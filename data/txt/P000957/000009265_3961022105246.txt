REPUBLIC OF GHANA
HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:                Republic of Ghana
Beneficiaries:           Ministry of Roads and Highways (MH), Ghana Highway
Authority (GHA) and the National Development Planning
Commission (NDPC).
Poverty:                 The project, which would support implementation of
Government's 1996-2000 Highway Sector Investment
Program, does not include specific targeted interventions to
reduce poverty. It will however have a significant impact
on poverty alleviation, particularly for Ghana's 3.54 million
rural poor, who account for 70 percent of those living
below the poverty level. Studies show that improved roads
were a major factor in reducing rural poverty from 42
percent to 34 percent between 1988 and 1992. This
reduction came through sustained growth of around 10
percent in non-farm self-employment, mainly wholesale and
resale trading activities, which was made possible by better
and cheaper transportation. The program will also improve
access to social services such as health and education and
employment opportunities will be created in the private
sector throughout the country in construction and
maintenance works.
Amount:                  SDR 67.8 million (US$100 million equivalent)
Terms:                   Standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity
Project Description:     Investments in physical infrastructure will be complemented
by a number of important institutional and policy
improvements as outlined below. The main components of
the 1996-2000 Highway Sector Investment Program are: (a)
Maintenance, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of the Road
Network: the US$1,480 million 1996-2000 program
allocates US$113 million (8 percent) for routine
maintenance of the entire network; US$493 million (33
percent) for periodic maintenance of 16,500km; US$132
million (9 percent) for rehabilitation of 5,350km; US$586



ii
million (40 percent) for reconstruction of 1,140km; US$158
million (11 percent) for administrative costs and the
settlement of arrears to contractors; (b) Institutional
Strengthening and Capacity Building: strengthening the
institutional capacity of the Ministry of Roads and
Highways (MRH), Ghana Highway Authority (GHA),
Department of Feeder Roads (DFR), the Department of
Urban Roads (DUR), the National Development Planning
Commission (NDPC) and the domestic construction
industry, through appropriate institutional reforms, technical
assistance, training and logistical support; (c) Policy
Reform: improving cost recovery by strengthening and
restructuring the road fund; encouraging private sector
financing of roads; raising environmental sensitivity;
enforcing axle load control; and improving road safety. The
project, funded by IDA's US$100 million credit, will
support the following: Periodic Maintenance: -US$51.4
million; Rehabilitation of Roads and Bridges: - US$14.1
million, and Institutional Support: - US$34.5 million. IDA
has a comparative advantage in providing institutional
support because of its continuous involvement in the sector
over the past 20 years; hence the relatively high allocation
for this activity.
Financing Plan:          IDA          US$100.0 m.
GOG         US$ 11.5m.
Benefits:                The main economic benefits of the investments will be
derived from savings in vehicle operating costs through the
reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance of roads and
bridges. This will promote increased agricultural
production, stimulate exports and increase the mobility of
people, particularly in rural areas. The program will also
improve highway sector management, through increased
reliance on market orientation, and help develop more
responsive institutions. The tangible benefits from road
investments have been quantified using cost benefit analysis.
The benefits arising from institutional strengthening and
policy reform related components cannot be measured in
monetary terms, but they are nevertheless critical to the long
term sustainability of the physical investments. Economic
evaluation of the roads and bridges to be funded under the
IDA credit (66 percent of the total) show a cost-weighted
economic rate of return (ERR) of 58 percent. The net
present value (NPV) of the roads is US$218 million at an



iii
annual discount rate of 15 percent. The robustness of the
investments was demonstrated by sensitivity analyses
carried out on a representative sample of the roads (24
percent of the total credit) which showed that a combined
reduction of benefits by 15 percent and increase in costs by
15 percent reduced the ERR of the sample from 40 percent
to 32 percent.
Risks:                   The main risks arise from Government having to find the
optimum balance between meeting the country's need for
improved road infrastructure and the electorate's
willingness and ability to pay for it, relative to other needs.
These risks are: (a) inadequate funding of maintenance - it
may not be feasible to increase the fuel levy sufficiently to
meet the full cost of maintenance, even with road user
support and the value of the road fund may be eroded by
continued depreciation of the Cedi; (b) securing the
necessary contributions for Government's capital budget -
the contribution is projected to decline from 44 percent in
1996 to 8 percent in 2000 with the enhanced road fund
providing the difference; (c) sub-optimal selection of roads
for improvement - Government agreed to a minimum
qualifying ERR of 15 percent for roads to be included in the
program. There will also be greater road user
representation in the selection process; (d) delays in
implementation - designs have already been prepared for 46
percent of the works and tender documents are available
and prequalification proposals have been invited for the ICB
works to be funded by IDA. There are no significant
technical risks. The works will be carried out using
conventional construction methods by contractors and
consultants with proven capability.

REPUBLIC OF GHANA
HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. BACKGROUND
A. INTRODUCTION
1.1   This is the first time that an integrated sector-wide investment approach has been
adopted for the sustainable development of a sector in Ghana. IDA's credit, together with
pledges from other donors, would help support implementation of the 1996-2000 Road Sector
Expenditure Program (the program) jointly developed by Government, user groups, the
Parliamentary sub-committee for infrastructure, and all donors active in the sector. The main
differences, which are elaborated in greater detail in para. 3.1, between the sector approach
and the traditional system of donors negotiating on an individual basis with Government are
that the sector approach:
* covers the entire sector including maintenance as well as the more conventional
capital investment, policy reform and institutional issues;
* has been jointly prepared by local stakeholders (Government and private and public
sector road users) and donors active in the sector, with the former taking the lead;
* is supported by all donors active in the sector;
* makes optimum use of scarce local resources;
* promotes standardized implementation procedures.
1.2   Previous projects supported by the Bank and the many other donors have attempted to
address the issues of seriously deteriorated highways and necessary institutional and policy
reform on a somewhat piecemeal basis. Trunk, urban and feeder roads have for example
generally been tackled separately. Given the scale of the problem and the investments
required, such an approach was understandable. However, it has now been appreciated that
because the road network is homogeneous, the full benefit of investments can only be secured
by treating it as such. It was also recognized that Government's administrative and financial
resources were being over-extended by having to deal with a multiplicity of donors with
differing terms and conditions. This program therefore adopts a comprehensive sector wide
approach as a means of directing and coordinating the efforts of Government and all donors
towards sustainable development.

B. MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT
1.3   Ghana is a medium sized country along the west coast of Africa with land area of
239,000 sq.km. and a population of 16 million (mid-1993). It is well endowed with natural
resources that include cocoa, timber and minerals. In spite of the country's potential, per
capita income declined and poverty increased in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1983, the
Government introduced an Economic Recovery Program (ERP) supported by financial and
technical assistance from the Bank, IMF and other donors. Under the ERP real GDP grew by
5 percent per annum, or around 2 percent on a per capita basis; the rate of inflation was
reduced; and Ghana's foreign exchange reserves increased.
1.4   Following a number of years of strong economic performance, fiscal performance
received a set-back during the run-up to the 1992 elections when large wage awards were
granted to the civil service and other public sector employees and delays in passing increases
in imported oil costs to consumers gave rise to large revenue losses. This led to a budget
deficit of 4.8 percent of GDP in 1992, a rapid growth in the money supply and inflationary
pressures re-emerging. Although the budget reverted to a surplus position in 1994, aided by
divestiture receipts, the macroeconomic situation has remained fragile with inflation growing.
Ghana's external position, after deteriorating in 1992-93, improved substantially in 1994 aided
by receipts from the divestiture of public companies, and the foreign exchange reserves
position improved to over four months of imports by the end of 1994, compared with only
three months at the end of 1993.
1.5   The 1995 macroeconomic performance under IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility was mixed. The external sector over-performed and GDP growth was close to
program target. Despite some arrears in the road sector, fiscal surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP
was close to the target of 1.2 percent. Monetary growth of 37 percent was higher than the
target of 14 percent mainly due to a larger than anticipated external surplus in the last quarter.
Inflation rose sharply in 1995 due to the lagged effect of large monetary expansion in the last
quarter of 1994 and first quarter of 1995. However, a targeted fiscal surplus of 1.8 percent of
GDP and monetary restraint is likely to lower inflation in 1996.
C. FISCAL ISSUES AND AFFORDABILITY
Highway Sector in Relation to Overall Budget
1.6   Until 1983, budget appropriations, together with donor grants, were used to finance
all road sector expenditures. However, because of economic constraints the funds allocated
were well short of the amounts required even to meet basic maintenance needs, let alone make
any contribution towards reducing the maintenance backlog. As part of the ERP, funding of
road infrastructure was increased to help stimulate economic growth. Between 1986 and
1990, the highway sector accounted for 20 percent of Ghana's total capital budget. Under the
ERP Government began moving to a system of market prices and full cost recovery for all
economic services. In furtherance of this a Road Fund was established in 1985 with its major
source of revenue a levy on petrol, diesel, kerosene and refined fuel oil. Although this was a



3
move in the right direction it has not achieved its objective of providing sufficient funds to
meet the costs of maintenance (see para 1.9).
1.7  In 1990 the Govemment decided to provide further impetus to the economy by
accelerating the reconstruction and major rehabilitation of key roads and increased road
spending to around 40 percent of the annual capital budget. However, this is not sustainable
given the competing demands from other sectors of the economy and, recognizing the need to
strengthen financing arrangements, GOG has decided to gradually raise the fuel levy and
restructure the Road Fund (see paras.3.28 and 3.29). Initially Government intends
implementing this in a fiscally neutral way i.e. part of the revenues that currently accrue to the
capital budget and are allocated to the highway sector would be redirected to the Road Fund.
However, the opportunity exists, once the public responds to the more transparent operation
proposed for the Road Fund for Government to secure a net increase in revenue.
1.8   The projected impact of these measures is shown in the proposed financing plan for
the 1996-2000 Road Sector Expenditure Program in Table 3.3 (page 24). Total planned road
expenditures (including repayment of arrears and debt service), increase to US$319 million in
1996 and US$317 million in 1998, before falling back to US$260 million in 2000. During this
period, Road Fund revenues are projected to rise from US$46 million in 1996 to US$106
million in 2000 (see Table 3.2, page 22). As a result, the burden on Government's
development budget would progressively reduce from 44 percent in 1995 to 8 percent in
2000. The balance of the expenditures would be financed by external sources (50 percent
over the program period) and Government's recurrent budget (4 percent). The pace of
transfer of maintenance funding from the development budget to user charges will be dictated
by road users willingness and ability to pay. The expenditure program will be reviewed jointly
by Gcvernment, road user representatives and donors on an annual basis and adjusted as
necessary to suit the funds available.
The Road Fund - Moving to Commercialization and Fee-for-Service
1.9   Although the fuel levy has been periodically revised (e.g., when the statutory retail
price of fuel is raised to reflect a devaluation), the portion going to the Road Fund has not
fully compensated for the decline in the value of the cedi. As a result, the fuel levy, expressed
as a percentage of the retail price, has fallen from a peak of 7.5 percent in 1992 to 3.2 percent
in 1995. The fund transfers to the Road Fund consequently fell from US$28.8 million in 1991
to US$ 17.4 million in 1994. Table 1.1 below shows the level of the fuel levy and how the
proceeds were divided between GHA, DFR and DUR during the period 1990-1994.

1.10  The other road user charges paid into the Road Fund include road and bridge tolls,
ferry fees and vehicle inspection fees. However, as shown in Table 1.2 below, these charges
contributed less than 10 percent of Road Fund revenues from 1992 to 1994. Consideration is
being given to the recommendations of a recent Road User Charges Study that a heavy vehicle
license fee be introduced, to ensure that heavy vehicles pay a higher proportion of the damage
they do to roads.

1.11  The Road Fund, as currently established, has some good points, but it also suffers
from several important weaknesses. Its strongest feature is that the fuel levy is collected by
the Ghana National Petroleum Company, which deposits the money directly into the Road
Fund account at the Bank of Ghana. The funds are not handled by Customs (who
nevertheless carry out an ex-post check to ensure all levies have been paid), or the Ministry of
Finance, and this prevents diversion of funds and the protracted delays which affect some of
the road funds in Africa. The weaknesses include: (a) the lack of a well developed



5
accounting system for funds collected; (b) the fact that the Road Fund only finances part of
routine and periodic maintenance; and (c) the fact that a technical audit has as yet not been
instituted. Under the program, allocations to the Road Fund will be increased by gradually
raising the fuel levy to enable all maintenance costs to be met; and administration of the Road
Fund will be strengthened (paras 3.28 and 3.29).
Financial Management
1.12  Financial management and contract administration have been problematic in recent
years in the road sector. There have been substantial budget overruns, which has resulted in
large arrears accruing to contractors. Capital budgets were exceeded by some 65 percent in
1994 and 1995 and arrears were estimated to have grown to Cedis 120 billion (US$75
millior;) by December 1995. Government has negotiated agreements with the contractors on
terms for payment. Provision has been made to pay some Cedis 64 billion (US$40 million) in
1996 and the balance has been rescheduled.
1.13  The overruns have arisen because too many fully funded contracts were signed in spite
of tight budgetary situations. In some cases there had been insufficient project preparation at
the feasibility and design stages resulting in major changes in the scope of works during
implementation. In other cases additional lengths were added to existing contracts instead of
treating them as separate contracts as currently practiced. Even though fluctuation clauses had
been fully catered for, in accordance with International practice and Bank procurement
guidelines, the projected effects were not included in project estimates and budgetary
allocations.
1.14  Government recognizes the seriousness of these problems and has established a
Cabinet Committee on road infrastructure to address them. Government agreed at
negotiations to the following:
(a)   No project to be undertaken without detailed engineering studies including the
preparation of technical specifications, accurate bills of quantities and realistic
cost estimates. The cost of any changes in the designs, specification and scope
of works after contract award to be kept within 25 percent of the original
contract value;
(b)   Contract cost and duration to be strictly controlled through more effective
contract management and supervision. Budgeting and accounting systems for
monitoring contracts acceptable to the Ministry of Finance and IDA, to be
implemented by MRH and the three road agencies by December 31, 1996.
D. DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS
1.15  During the economic crises of the 1970s and early 1980s transport infrastructure,
essential for the movement of key exports and farm production to market, faced virtual
collapse due to prolonged neglect of maintenance and rehabilitation. The resulting high
transport costs had an adverse effect on the whole economy. Under the ERP, with support



6
from IDA and other donors, Ghana commenced the rehabilitation of its transport network and
initiated generally sound and pragmatic institutional reforms. Significant progress has been
made, with the proportion of roads classified as "good" increasing from 15 percent in 1984,
to 43 percent in 1993. There has been a measurable impact with annual growth in domestic
trading throughout the country of over 10 percent in recent years being largely attributed to
improved road infrastructure. However, much remains to be done; 31 percent of trunk, and
around 50 percent of feeder roads are still classified as "poor" and continued high levels of
investment are required if this constraint to growth is to be fully eliminated, while preserving
the condition of roads already restored. Studies carried out under the Bank/United Nations
sponsored Sub-Saharan African Road Maintenance Initiative show that it costs between 2 and
3 times more to operate vehicles on "poor" roads than on roads that are kept in "good"
condition through effective maintenance. Other studies show that on paved roads a regular
maintenance strategy costs 35 percent less in NPV terms at 12 percent discount rate than
carrying out no maintenance and reconstructing every 15 years. Similar savings in the range
of 14 to 128 percent can be achieved on gravel roads.
E. BROAD DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES
1.16  Government's developmental goal is to reduce poverty through increased growth,
largely in the agricultural sector, and through improving access to social services, particularly
in rural areas. The 1996-2000 Highway Sector Investment Program will contribute to
achieving this by: (a) reducing vehicle operating costs through maintenance, rehabilitation and
reconstruction of the highest priority sections of the road network; (b) ensuring the
improvements are sustained by developing and implementing cost recovery policies, building
and utilizing indigenous capacity in the public and private sectors, and improving financial
management and control; and (c) strengthening donor coordination.
1.17  IDA's involvement in the program is consistent with the broader objectives of the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board in May 1995, which are to
support: poverty reduction; capacity building; private sector development; and to create
conditions for environmentally sustainable development. The program directly supports four
of the five key elements of the Bank Group's strategy outlined in the CAS: (a) invest heavily in
physical infrastructure, particularly to support agricultural growth - 80 percent of program
funds will be allocated for the maintenance of 16,100 km, rehabilitation of 5,300 km, and the
reconstruction of 1,000 km of trunk and feeder roads servicing agricultural areas; (b) promote
higher private sector investment especially in agriculture and exports - improved road
infrastructure has been identified as a major requirement for agricultural and export growth
and the program gives priority to improving routes to the two key ports, Takoradi and Tema;
(c) build and utilize indigenous capacity in the public and private sectors - heavy reliance will
be placed on local consultants and contractors of proven ability, many of whom have benefited
from training under previous Bank assisted projects, and technical assistance to the road
sector agencies will be largely locally sourced; and (d) strengthen human resources by
improving access to, and the quality of, basic social services - improved roads, particularly in
rural areas, will facilitate access to health and education services.

F. LESSONS LEARNED FROM BANK GROUP AND OTHER DONORS'
INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Donor Support for the Roads Sector
1.18  There are more than a dozen multi-lateral and bilateral donor organizations active in
the roads sector. Past commitments (1988-1994) made by Donor agencies have averaged
about US$ 115 million equivalent per annum, mainly for major reconstruction and
rehabilitation works (see Annex 1-1 for details). There has been increasing concern that
insufficient funds are being allocated for maintenance while new reconstruction works
continue to be funded. This issue was discussed at length during project preparation and
agreement reached that maintenance would be given top priority by Government and donors.
To this end it was agreed that the cost of maintenance should gradually be met from user
charges (see para. 3.29). The 1996-2000 Road Sector Expenditure Program was jointly
developed by Government, user groups, the Parliamentary sub-committee for infrastructure,
and all donors active in the sector (OECF, KfW, European Union, the Dutch Government,
BADEA, OPEC, DANIDA, USAID and ADF).
1.19  In the past, donor support has not been well coordinated and Government's
institutional resources have been strained by a multiplicity of terms, conditions and reporting
requirements. As part of the preparation for the program a donor conference was held in
Accra in November 1994. Government will organize similar conferences each year to
streamline dialogue with donors and report on progress with implementation of the program,
review projected plans for subsequent years, and to seek additional funding. Government
intends to adopt common arrangements for implementing, monitoring, accounting, and
reporting on all donor assisted projects and MRH have already established an Accounting and
Management Information Systems Unit (ANISU) to facilitate this.
1.20 The Bank Group in conjunction with various cofinanciers (OECF, ADB, UNDP, EU,
Saudi Fund, OPEC and Danida) has supported the following 12 projects since 1974 as
outlined in Table 1.3 below.

1.21  Conclusions drawn from past Bank supported projects are that: (a) highway sector
changes should be based on a clear set of long-term sector objectives and targets; (b) a
proliferation of donors acting independently ties up Government's limited institutional
resources and does not provide a basis for reaching agreement on necessary sector reforms;
(c) putting a deteriorated sector back on its feet, by rebuilding institutions and physical
infrastructure, and creating adequate financing systems is a long-term undertaking; (d)
revenue from road user charges has been inadequate to meet the cost of maintenance; and (e)
the development and assimilation of policy and organizational changes has been hampered by
limited institutional capacity

2. TRANSPORTATION IN GHANA
A. TRANSPORT STRATEGY
2.1   A Transport Sector Strategy Note (TSSN, Report No. 5737-GH, June 1985),
prepared by the Bank and agreed with Government in mid-1985, focused on the main
transport problems and policy issues, and presented a short and medium term strategy for
tackling them. Further Government/Bank joint reviews were undertaken in 1989, 1992 and
most recently in November 1994. The agreed transport sector strategy calls for the
allocation of a high proportion of budgetary resources to transport infrastructure until the
constraints to economic growth caused by the backlog of maintenance have been removed.
The capital investments are to be complemented by policy and institutional reforms to make
the delivery of transport services more sustainable and responsive to user's needs.
2.2   Achievements of the GOG-Bank dialogue since 1985 include: (a) establishment of a
Road Fund (fuel levy based) which finances a proportion of maintenance work and reduces
dependence on general revenues; (b) increased use of the private sector, including the
promotion of local contractors through training in competitive bidding and site organization;
(c) large reductions in personnel at GHA (from 8,400 in 1985 to 4,650 in 1994) and DFR
(from 2,000 in 1985 to 700 in 1993), due to the shift from force account to contracting; (d)
introduction of a labor-intensive rural road rehabilitation program; (e) systematic reduction
of foreign technical assistance requirements at MRH, GHA, DFR and DUR through the
training and promotion of local engineers; (f) increased reliance on local consultants for
engineering design and construction supervision; and (g) improved traffic safety through
vehicle inspection and licensing, and training of drivers and mechanics.
B. ROLE OF HIGHWAYS
2.3   Roads are the predominant mode of transportation, currently accounting for 94
percent of freight and 97 percent of traffic movements. There are no viable alternatives to
roads other than for the movement of bulk commodities such as timber, cocoa, bauxite and
manganese ore by rail from central collection centers to the ports. The railway network has
limited coverage (Accra-Kumasi-Takoradi) and operates at low efficiency under parastatal
management and internal water transport is limited to Lake Volta. A full description of rail
and internal water organizations and facilities is given in the SARs for the Transport
Rehabilitation Project (Report No. 6912-GH) and the Second Transport Project (Report No.
8945-GH). The road transport industry, which is dominated by the private sector, is
competitive and has unrestricted entry, but its efficiency is constrained by the high cost poor
roads impose on vehicle operation.
2.4   Government's highway sector objectives are to: (a) clear the large backlog of
maintenance work to stabilize the road network condition mix to 70 percent "good", 20
percent "fair", and not more than 10 percent "poor"; (b) strengthen the organizational
structure and institutional capacity of the road agencies and the local road construction



10
industry; (c) base road sector investment decisions on sound economic principles, and give
highest priority to routine and periodic maintenance, (d) improve cost recovery to ensure
that maintenance can be fully-funded on a sustainable basis; (e) promote greater private
sector involvement in both execution of works and financing of transport infrastructure; (f)
regain sector-wide discipline in expenditure management and control; (g) streamline
transport regulations, enforce axle-weight regulations, and enhance road safety, (h) promote
the use of non-motorized transport; (i) strengthen donor coordination, and (j) simplify and
improve procurement, monitoring and reporting procedures for road sector programs.
These are fully reflected in Government's Road Sector Policy Letter of February 9, 1996.
C. HIGHWAY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS
2.5   Ministry of Roads and Highways: The MIRH was created in 1982 to take over
responsibility from the Ministry of Works and Housing for the two road agencies then in
existence, GHA and DFR. GHA was established in 1974 by decree and was originally
responsible for all highways. DFR and DUR were subsequently created in 1981 and 1988
respectively, to provide a specialized focus on feeder and urban roads. Organisational charts
of the four institutions are given in the Project Files. The basic legislation governing the
road sector has not been amended to reflect the new institutional structure, even though
many of the powers and responsibilities originally assigned to GHA have been taken over by
DFR, DUR and MRH. To clarify matters, MRH has prepared a draft amendment to the
GHA Decree, as an interim measure pending enactment of a comprehensive Roads and
Highways Act, to formalize the institutional changes that have taken place, including
establishment of the Road Fund. A draft of the Roads and Highways Act has been reviewed
by Bank staff and is considered satisfactory.
2.6    MIRH is responsible for the formulation of road sector strategy and policy and for
monitoring the performance of GHA, DFR and DUR in terms of budgeting, accounting and
contract administration. An Accounting and Management Information System Unit
(AMISU) was established in early 1995 to improve financial management in the sector
through more effective disbursement, accounting, monitoring and reporting procedures.
Currently AMISU is responsible for all donor funded projects. This role will gradually be
expanded to cover all sector finances and MIS systems compatible to that of AMISU will be
established in the three road agencies, under the program. It is headed by an accounting and
MIS specialist and staffed by a financial manager; accountants and disbursement specialists;
computer and data analysts; and short-term resource persons all of whom have been
recruited from the local private sector (see Annex 2-1 for a full description of AMISU).
2.7   Ghana Highways Authority: The GHA was established in 1974 as an autonomous
highway authority administered by a Board of Management consisting of seven
representatives from the public sector, a member of the Institution of Engineers, a
representative from the Private Road Transport Union, and a Chairman. In 1982 MRH was
created to coordinate all works in the road sector. Around the same time there was a change
in government policy which resulted in the creation of Interim Management Committees for
all Public Corporations including GHA. Government now intends to reinstate GHA's



I1
autonomy and Board with greater private sector road user representation to encourage the
Authority to become a more commercial, customer-oriented agency.
2.8   GHA is responsible for 14,750 km of trunk roads, consisting of 6,000 km of paved
roads and 8,750 km of gravel roads. It employs 4,650 personnel (down from about 8,400 in
1985) comprising 90 engineers and 620 administrative, technical and supervisory staff and
some 3,940 skilled and unskilled workers involved in force account operations. GHA
intends to reduce its personnel further in line with its policy of contracting out virtually all
work to the private sector.
2.9   The following key principles of GHA's future organizational structure were agreed
during appraisal:
(a)   The Board of GHA will be reinstated and the GHA Decree will be replaced
by an appropriate Act of Parliament to make GHA more autonomous and
subject to market forces.
(b)   The policy of contracting out road reconstruction, rehabilitation and most
periodic maintenance to the private sector will continue.
(c)   GHA will strengthen its professional and technical staff, while it will reduce
substantially the number of semi-skilled and unskilled personnel, presently
still employed as force account labor. At negotiations, Government agreed
that the semi-skilled and unskilled labor force will be reduced in the 1995-98
period to bring total personnel to about 3,100. Furthermore, by December
31, 1998, the staffing situation will be jointly reviewed and an action plan
agreed to reduce personnel further.
2.10  Department of Feeder Roads: DFR is responsible for a network of some 22,000
km of feeder roads. It operates with a professional staff of 34 at three levels: (a) the head
office in Accra; (b) 10 regional offices; and (c) 10 out of 32 road district offices. The
management structure at the regional and road district levels is being reviewed with the
gradual implementation of decentralization to political districts. Under the IDA and donor
supported on-going National Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project, greater
emphasis is being placed on feeder road planning and selection, and integrating feeder road
rehabilitation and maintenance with trunk road and agricultural priorities. In addition, a
maintenance performance budgeting system has been developed to ensure that once feeder
roads have been rehabilitated, they are taken over for systematic maintenance.
2.11  Department of Urban Roads: DUR was established in 1988 to take over
responsibility for roads in Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi/Takoradi, Tema and Tamale. It has 550
personnel of whom 28 are professional staff located in headquarters and in District Road
Units (DRUs) in the five cities. The IDA and donor supported on-going Urban Transport
Project provides technical assistance to build capacity within DUR and the DRUs. The
department works closely with the Municipal and Metropolitan Assemblies (MMAs),
developing construction and maintenance programs. In 1990, the Accra Metropolitan Roads



12
Unit assumed responsibility for maintenance of Accra's roads, following strengthening of the
unit, though major reconstruction and rehabilitation works are still administered by DUR. It
is intended that all of the cities will follow Accra's example and eventually become
responsible for their own roads in accordance with Government's decentralization policy.
DUR would then focus on providing planning, coordination and technical support services.
2.12 National Development Planning Commission: The NDPC has prime
responsibility for the strategic planning of transportation infrastructure and for directing the
implementation of Government's decentralization policy. It produced a coordinated
program of economic and social development policies, entitled "Ghana-Vision 2020 (The
first step: 1996-2000)" in January 1995. This provides a policy and planning framework for
the preparation of medium term sectoral and district development plans. The next phase of
activities to be undertaken by NDPC includes preparation of the medium-term National
Development Plan (1996-2000), which will become the reference document outlining the
enabling environment to be provided by government in support of private investment,
initiative and innovation and also highlighting the priority social and economic activities to
be undertaken in the districts.
D. CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
2.13   Ghana's domestic construction capacity has developed significantly over the past
decade. At present there are about 270 road works and 700 bridge and drainage structure
contractors classified by MIRH in eight categories. The majority of the contractors are
capable of undertaking contracts ranging from US$150,000 to US$500,000 at a time within
twelve months, while the largest can tackle contracts of several million dollars. Training has
been provided to over 80 labor-based contractors each capable of undertaking 25km of
feeder roads rehabilitation per annum, and equipment has been provided on a credit basis to
52 of them.
2.14  This domestic capacity, with some strengthening, can handle most of the gravel trunk
and feeder road programs, while for paved trunk roads, there is still a need to build capacity.
This can be done by facilitating access to credit facilities, ensuring timely payment of
monthly certificates, generous advance mobilization loans and by providing training in
business administration, field work planning and programming and resource management.
There is also need to provide practical training to contractors on bituminous surface dressing
operations.

3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
A. PROGRAM CONCEPT
3.1   The 1996-2000 Highway Sector Investment Program and complementary institutional
strengthening and policy reform initiatives articulated in Government's Letter of Sector Policy
of February 9, 1996 were jointly prepared by Government, representatives of road users
groups and all donors active in the sector. Unlike previous IDA supported projects it
embraces the entire highways sector and seeks to coordinate and unify the activities of all
donors. The differences and advantages offered by the sector approach over the traditional
system of donors negotiating on an individual basis with Government are that the sector
approach: (a) covers the entire sector - this recognizes that road networks are interdependent
and that there is little point, for example, in improving the feeder roads in an area if there is
not also a complementary plan to improve the trunk road to which they link; (b) supports a
comprehensive program jointly formulated by all key stakeholders in the sector - involving
users and donors has increased the focus on sustainability with a greater emphasis being given
to maintenance; (c) is supported by all donors active in the sector - the joint efforts of donors
and Government has produced a realistic program (Government's original proposed
expenditure of US$1,900 million was scaled down to US$1,480 million based on a joint
assessment, which took account of the overall needs of the economy and a more realistic
projection of likely revenues) and facilitated the adoption of key policy reform and
institutional changes, which will make the delivery of road infrastructure services more
sustainable and responsive to users needs; (d) makes optimum use of scarce local resources -
the need for expensive and unsustainable foreign technical assistance has been reduced to
limited areas of specialization; and (e) promotes standardized implementation procedures -
this reduces pressure on Government's limited institutional resources which have been
overstretched in the past by the varying demands of individual donors.
B. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
3.2   Efficient cost effective road transport is fundamental to achieving the primary
objective of Government and the Bank, as reflected in the Country Assistance Strategy (May
1995), of reducing poverty through increased growth, largely in the agricultural sector. The
program will support this by:
*  Reducing vehicle operating costs through maintenance, rehabilitation and
reconstruction of roads; and
*  Ensuring that improvements are sustained by developing and implementing cost
recovery policies, building and utilizing indigenous capacity in the public and private
sectors, and improving financial management and control.



14
C. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
3.3   The main components of the 1996-2000 Highway Sector Investment Program are:
(a)   Maintenance, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of the Road Network:
Funding some 16,500km of periodic maintenance; 5,350km of rehabilitation;
and 1,140km of reconstruction;
(b)   Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building: Strengthening the
institutional capacity of MRH, GHA, DFR, DUR, NDPC, and the domestic
construction industry through appropriate institutional reforms, technical
assistance, training and logistical support; and
(c)   Policy Reform: Issues addressed include cost recovery, private sector
financing, increased environmental sensitivity, axle load control and road
safety.
3.4   Maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction of the road network will be supported
by all donors and the scope of works is described in the following paragraphs. The
institutional strengthening and policy reform components will be primarily supported by the
IDA credit because of IDA's comparative advantage derived through long-term involvement
in the sector. The components to be supported by the IDA Credit are described in Section D
(page 17).
MAINTENANCE, REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ROAD NETWORK
3.5   To clear the remaining backlog of deferred maintenance and stabilize the road network
in ten years (by 2005), would require average annual expenditure of about US$387 rnillion
compared to the average expenditure from 1988 to 1994 of US$140 million per annum. For
the six year period 1995-2000, this would amount to a total expenditure of US$2.32 billion,
which the MRH has designated as the "Desirable Program" (Annex 3-1). Such a massive
increase in the level of expenditure is not feasible given current revenue projections,
competing demands and the amount of external financing likely to be available. This program
was presented by MRH and its three road agencies for discussion at a Donors' Conference in
November 1994 attended by representatives of road and transport agencies, private sector
road users and donor agencies. On the basis of ensuing discussions, it was agreed that the
1996-2000 Road Sector Expenditure Program should be reduced from US$1.94 billion to
US$1.48 billion (an average of US$296 million per annum) with priority for funding as
follows:
(a)   Routine maintenance,
(b)   Periodic maintenance;
(c)   Rehabilitation;
(d)   Completion of on-going donor financed reconstruction and upgrading projects,



15
(e)   High priority reconstruction and upgrading projects in the pipeline with
secured donor financing;
(f)   Completion of GOG fully financed on-going reconstruction and upgrading
projects;
(g)   Fully-financed GOG reconstruction and upgrading projects in the pipeline; and
(h)   New roads
3.6   Around 62 percent by value of the roads to be included in the progran have already
been identified (this includes eleven ongoing donor supported projects the details of which are
given in Annex 3-2). The remaining roads will be selected on the basis of: economic benefit
(ERR of at least 15 percent); their contribution towards alleviating poverty; and by taking due
consideration of geographic distribution. The size and scope of the agreed expenditure
program and its distribution between routine maintenance (8 percent), periodic maintenance
(33 percent), rehabilitation (9 percent), reconstruction (40 percent); administration
expenditures (6 percent); and payment of arrears (5 percent) is given in Table 3. 1. A brief
description of the program is given in the following paragraphs (for further details including
annual budgetary outlays, see Annex 3-2). At negotiations, Government agreed to the
following:
(a)   The Road Sector Expenditure Program to be reviewed annually by November
30, by GOG jointly with IDA, other donor agencies and representatives of road
users, to monitor progress and agree on the following year's expenditure;
(b)   The minimum qualifying ERR for investment in any road section to be included
in the Road Sector Expenditure Program to be 15 percent.
3.7    Routine Maintenance: Routine, or preventative, maintenance provides the highest
rate of return of all road expenditure. It covers the entire network and includes activities such
as pot-hole patching, grading and reshaping gravel roads, cleaning drains and culverts and
clearing vegetation from shoulders and verges. Up to 1994, routine maintenance was financed
from the recurrent budget and the amounts allocated declined from US$17.6 million in 1992
to US$8.8 million in 1994. In 1995 it was increased slightly to US$10.5 million (still well
below the required amount of around US$24 million) and incorporated in the capital budget,
which means that the funds appropriated are less susceptible to Government cutbacks.
Allocations for routine maintenance will increase to about US$24 million a year under the
program. Annex 3-3 gives details of the trunk road routine maintenance program.

3.8   Periodic Maintenance and Rehabilitation: Periodic maintenance covers activities
such as the resealing of bituminised roads on a seven to ten year cycle, depending on
cumulative traffic loading, and the regravelling of unsurfaced roads on a 5 to 7 year cycle.
Costs range from US$10,000 per km for regravelling feeder roads to US$140,000 per km for
overlaying asphaltic concrete trunk roads. Rehabilitation is required when the entire road
structure, as opposed to only the surface layer, has failed. This applied to most of Ghana's
roads in the early 1980's. Rehabilitation differs from reconstruction (see below) in the extent
of work required; the former can normally be carried out at an average cost of US$20,000 per
km on gravel feeder roads and US$165,000 per km on bituminised trunk roads.



17
3.9   The length of periodic maintenance and rehabilitation works carried out between 1988
and 1994 was 13,600km at a total cost of US$245 million. The 1996-2000 program target is
21,850 km (16,500km periodic maintenance and 5,350km rehabilitation) at a total cost of
US$625 million. This is ambitious, but achievable given Government and donors' declared
commitment to maintenance. The main constraints in the years 1988-1994 were shortfalls in
funding and a cumbersome procurement system. With the proposed restructuring of the Road
Fund (see paras. 3.28 and 3.29), continued support from external donors, and improvements
in procurement and contracting procedures, which have already been implemented, the
proposed increased output is achievable.
3.10  Reconstruction: Reconstruction differs from rehabilitation in the extent of remedial
work required and often involves widening and partial realignment. It is generally required on
the busiest roads which have deteriorated most because of heavy traffic loading. Costs per
kilometer range from US$165,000 on surface dressed trunk roads to over US$1 million on
congested urban roads with asphaltic concrete pavements. The proposed I, 140km
reconstruction sub-program of US$586 million, which includes a provision of US$52 million
for bridges, accounts for some 40 percent of the proposed program and would be financed
largely by donors and, funds permitting, the government.
D. COMPONENTS SUPPORTED BY IDA CREDIT
3.11  IDA's Highway Sector Investment Credit would be allocated to the following
components of the program:
(a)   Trunk Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance: 1,100 km of periodic
maintenance, 90 km of rehabilitation, bridge rehabilitation and the spot
improvement of hazardous road sections;
(b)   Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building: Strengthening the
institutional capacity of GHA, MRH, NDPC, and the domestic construction
industry through appropriate institutional reforms, technical assistance, training
and logistical support;
(c)   Policy Reform: Issues to be addressed include cost recovery, private sector
financing, increased environmental sensitivity, axle load control and road
safety.
3.12  IDA, in conjunction with other donors, is already providing support to trunk roads
through the 1991 Second Transport Rehabilitation Project (TRP2); feeder roads through the
1992 National Feeder Road and Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (NFRRMP), and
urban roads through the 1993 Urban Transport Project (UTP). As the TRP2 funding is
already fully committed and largely disbursed it has been agreed with Government that
priority should be given to trunk road periodic maintenance and rehabilitation. Further
support to feeder roads is in the lending pipeline (projected Board presentation in 1999) and it
is proposed that preparation should be under streamnlined procedures within the framework of



18
the HSIP. Additional support will also be considered for urban roads in deprived areas if the
UTP is implemented satisfactorily.
PERIODIC MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION
3.13  The credit will help to clear part of the remaining maintenance backlog by financing 90
km of rehabilitation in Central and Eastern Regions, and the rehabilitation of bridges in Brong
Ahafo and other regions. The periodic maintenance of 1,100 km of roads throughout the
country will restore deteriorated running surfaces to "good" condition and preserve the
investment in these roads. The periodic maintenance works will be undertaken predominantly
by local contractors (45 NCB lots and 3 ICB lots) and the road rehabilitation and bridge
works have been packaged in 4 ICB lots. Designs have been completed for most of the roads
and bridges and bidding documents are being finalized (see PIM for more details). Details of
the roads to be funded are given in (Annex 4-2).
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING AND CAPACITY
Ghana Highway Authority
3.14 Legislative Changes: The proposed Amendment to the GHA Decree will, amongst
other things, specify the composition and terms of reference of GHA's Board and include
provisions to enable GHA to enter into contract with private sector entities to build, operate
and maintain selected trunk roads under concession agreements. The new Board will consist
of a Chairperson and ten members. Of the ten members, 4 will represent concerned ministries
(as before), 4 will represent road users (Chamber of Commerce, road transport industry,
farmers, and Association of Consultants), and 2 will be nominated by the Minister of MRH.
The CEO will be appointed in consultation with the Board in conformity with the provisions
of the 1992 Constitution. In the interim, Government has agreed to reinstate GHA's Board of
Management in accordance with the original GHA Decree.
3.15  Technical Assistance: GHA has a Maintenance Management System (MMS), which
requires updating and upgrading through the introduction of computerized systems. A
Management Information System (MIS) has also been designed under TRP2. The credit will
provide 36 person months (p/m) of technical assistance for GHA to implement the MIS, to
update and upgrade the MMS, and train GHA staff in the application of both systems. Of the
36 p/m of technical assistance, 12 p/m will be sourced locally and 24 p/m will be international.
The credit will also provide 18 p/m (12 p/m local; 6 p/m international) of technical assistance
for the establishment of a Bridge Condition and Maintenance System, which will enable GHA
to undertake systematic bridge condition assessments. Other technical assistance will include
165 p/m (all of which will be sourced locally) for four Accountants and an Internal Auditor in
headquarters. In order to assist GHA conduct studies from time to time in the following area:
the privatization of quarries, workshops and ferry operations; review of staffing needs after
1998; review of axle load regulations, assessment of training needs and facilities; and so on;
the credit will provide funds (up to US$1.0 million) for approximately 54 p/m (12 p/m local;
42 p/m international) for consultancy studies and short-term technical assistance.



19
3.16 Design and Supervision: Engineering designs and preparation of bidding documents
have already been completed for some 4,000km of trunk roads. These design works were
funded under TRP-2 and a PPF advance. The credit will fund an estimated 320 p/m of local
consultants for supervision of the ICB works. The supervision of all contracts under national
competitive bidding will be carried out in-house by GHA and local consultants (approximately
200 p/rn). In addition, IDA will finance international and local consultant services
(approximately 240 p/m international and 460 p/m local) for engineering design and feasibility
studies for around 2,600km of trunk road works to be undertaken after 2000 in follow-up
projects.
3.17  Logistical Support: GHA has four mobile maintenance units to undertake emergency
works and a proportion of programmed maintenance on roads and bridges. The credit will
fund the purchase of a limited amount of road maintenance equipment to replace old and
deteriorated essential equipment and spare parts to refurbish some of the equipment. Vehicles
and motorcycles will be purchased to enhance GHA's capacity to supervise contracts in the
regions and to facilitate site visits from Accra. Other vehicles and equipment to be purchased
under the project include materials testing equipment for the Central Laboratory; vehicles,
communication equipment and accessories for the road safety patrol; and drafting and survey
supplies for GHA's Design and Surveying Division (see Annex 3-4 for details).
3.18  Extension to Central Laboratory: Over the years, GHA has expanded its facilities
at the Central Materials Laboratory to provide the equipment and technical know-how for
quality control and adherence to technical specifications during road construction and
maintenance operations. The building space is inadequate to house recently acquired
equipment. The credit will therefore support construction of an annex to the existing building
using available land within the existing compound.
3.19  Staff Housing Units: GHA needs to keep qualified and experienced staff in its 10
regional and 32 road district offices to ensure efficient performance, acceptable quality
standards and cost effectiveness. The lack of adequate living conditions in the regions and
districts has been a key constraint to attracting and keeping qualified and experienced staff in
the field, particularly due to a wide disparity in remuneration between the public and private
sectors. To provide an incentive GHA needs to resolve the problem of accommodation for its
field staff. Under TRP-2 about 40 housing units were constructed and the program proved
highly successful. The credit will provide funds for the construction of 25 additional units of
2-3 bedrooms for professional staff.
Ministry of Roads and Highways
3.20 Technical Assistance: The credit will fund a Claims and Legal Specialist (up to 12
p/m of short term international services) as required for evaluating claims from contractors
and settling disputes. The following support will be provided to AMISU: 620 p/m of local
and up to 8 p/m of international short-term resource persons as required; logistical support;
office supplies and equipment; and an operations budget to carry out its functions. AMISU
will also be responsible for appointing consultants and local experts from time to time to
enable it to conduct baseline and follow-up studies to assess and monitor the performance and



20
developmental impact of the program. Support will also be provided to a newly established
Road Fund Secretariat (see para. 3.28) by meeting its operational costs including staff hired
on a consultancy basis for the first two years. Other Road Fund management costs associated
with the Board will be financed from the Road Fund.
3.21   Logistical Support: To facilitate the overall coordination and oversight functions of
MIRH; enable it to organize and supervise local contractor training programs, and to enhance
its policy formulation, donor coordination and progress monitoring functions, the project will
provide funds for purchase of the necessary additional transport vehicles, office equipment,
computers and photo copiers required to achieve this (see Annex 3-4 for details).
3.22  A summary of the technical assistance to GHA and NIRH (including financing
arrangement) envisioned under the credit is given in Annex 3-5, while their objectives and
draft terms of reference are detailed in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM).
Training of GHA and MRH Staff
3.23  To build institutional capacity, the credit includes training of GHA staff at local
institutes; through regional study tours; and at overseas or local seminars, conferences and
short courses. A summary of the 1996-99 manpower training program for GHA and MRIH is
given in Annex 3-6, while details are given in the PIM. GHA currently has no training
facilities for road sector technicians or contractors. A needs and feasibility study would be
undertaken to assess the options which include building a dedicated facility or developing
capacity at existing training institutions. Financial provision has been made to carry out
building works (see Annex 3-7 for details).
Incremental Operating Costs
3.24  To help defray incremental operating costs and enable MRH and GHA supervise
roadworks projects scattered all over the country, the credit will finance, on a declining basis
(100 percent in the first two years and 70 percent thereafter) operating costs related to vehicle
operation, office supplies, travel expenses, and so on, but excluding salaries of Government
officials, to a maximum of US$1.1 million for GHA and US$0.9 million for MRH, the latter to
include the costs associated with the Road Fund Secretariat referred to in para. 3.20.
Support to the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC)
3.25  Under TRP-1, IDA provided support to NDPC with technical assistance from two
development specialists who assisted the staff of NDPC in preparing the coordinated program
of economic and social development policies, developing the National Development Policy
Framework and initiating the training program for building capacity in the Districts for
development planning. The credit will provide further support for technical assistance
(infrastructure development specialists); field studies; research; operational workshops; staff
development and training; and logistical support required in the process of implementing,
monitoring, and evaluating the first five-year development plan (see Annex 3-8 for details).



21
Developing the Domestic Construction Industry
3.26 Domestic contractors and GHA's Maintenance Management Units (MMUs) need
training in practical field operations in bituminous surface dressing and road pavement
construction in order to enhance quality and improve road riding surfaces. This will be
organized by the Training Division of GHA through periodic training of domestic contractors,
MMUs and GHA staff in the field by specialists drawn from within the country and from
abroad. The credit will also provide funding for training of local contractors in the areas of
business management; finance and accounting; planning and programming of field operations;
and practical operations in the field. Training will be based on the recommnendations of a
domestic contractor assessment and development study completed under the NFRRMP.
MRH will coordinate the overall effort in this area.
Institutional Inputs from other Donors
3.27 The European Union will fund an internationally recruited Program Coordinator
(36p/m) appointed by the Borrower to assist the Chief Director of MRH coordinate the HSIP
and donor assistance. GHA will receive managerial assistance from OECF (72 p/m) and
financial and budgeting assistance (24p/m) from GTZ. GTZ will also provide technical
assistance to help implement maintenance in Brong Ahafo and Ashanti Regions. DFR already
receive assistance with maintenance planning and budgeting from Danida and the Nordic
Development Fund are supporting a Transport Planner (24p/m) in DUR.
POLICY REFORM
3.28  Cost Recovery -Restructuring the Road Fund: Assistance would be provided to
restructure the Road Fund so that it can operate according to sound accounting principles.
The key elements in the restructuring plan (see Annex 3-9 for a more detailed description) are:
(a) putting the administration and management of the Road Fund under the MRH Advisory
Board on which road users are represented; (b) increasing revenues paid into the Road Fund
through road user charges; (c) ensuring that the first charge on the Road Fund is for
preservation of existing road assets (i.e., financing routine and periodic maintenance); and (d)
managing the Road Fund in a pro-active manner using clear and consistent procedures for
dividing funds between the various road agencies, disbursing funds, and auditing work
financed from the Road Fund. The rules governing operation of the Road Fund have been
incorporated in the draft Roads and Highways Act. The nine members of the MRH Advisory
Board have already been appointed and Government have agreed that three additional road
user representatives (giving six in all) shall be co-opted to deal with Road Fund issues.
Formal inauguration of the MRH Advisory Board is a Condition of Credit Effectiveness.
The MRH Advisory Board will be supported by a Secretariat comprising a Director and up to
four accounting, planning and engineering staff to manage the day-to-day affairs of the Road
Fund.
3.29  In order to fully recover the annual cost of optimum routine and periodic maintenance
estimated at around US$132 million, the road fund component of the fuel levy (the road levy)
on petrol and diesel would have to be increased from its current average level of US cents 1.6



22
to US cents 9.5 per liter. Government raised the levy in the 1996 budget from Cedis 18 to
Cedis 60 (approximately US cents 4) per liter by allocating an increased proportion of the
overall tax on fuel. This would provide close to 60 percent of the 1996 planned maintenance
expenditure. They have also agreed to raise it incrementally in real terms by one US cent per
year thereafter until it reaches US cents 9.5 per liter (see Table 3.2). However, as stated in
para. 1.8, the rate at which user charges will be increased would be subject to what road users
are willing and able to pay. The MRH Advisory Board will take account of road users views,
when recommending increases after 1996 to the Ministry of Finance for incorporation into
subsequent budgets. These recommendations would also be discussed and analyzed at the
annual donors review conference (see para. 3.53). If the MRH Advisory Board performs as
intended and effectively mobilizes road user support, it is envisaged that subsequent increases
could be met by raising the price of fuel in real terms rather than by reallocating the existing
fuel tax. Government agreed at negotiations that the proceeds of the Road Fund will be
used exclusively to finance routine and periodic maintenance and administration of the Fund.

Private Sector Financing
3.30  Government recognizes that the shortage of public revenues limits it's ability to meet
the road sector's investment requirements. In this regard, it intends to assess the feasibility of
attracting private sector investment to build and/or operate selected roads under concession
agreements. The MRH organized, with IDA assistance, an international conference in Accra
in June 1995 to learn from the experience of others both in, and outside, Africa. To take
matters further, provision has been made under the credit to fund a feasibility study for five
road sections on which private sector participation may be viable. The proposed Roads and
Highways Act will provide the enabling legislation to enter into concession or lease
agreements.



23
Improving Road Safety
3.31  Under TRP-I and II, GHA improved its staff training in the areas of traffic
engineering, accident hazard analysis and design of low cost remedial measures. It also
improved some hazardous road sections. This credit will continue to support GHA's road
safety work. It will concentrate on reducing accidents on hazardous road sections through
minor realignment, provision of warning signs and appropriate road markings, and provision
of speed breakers. The credit will also provide up to 12 person-months of local consulting
services to enable GOG to implement recommendations from earlier road safety studies and
improve coordination with the National Road Safety Committee and recommend how it might
be made more effective. The review will also recommend whether the Committee needs a
full-time secretariat and, if so, its source of financing.
Environmental Sensitivity
3.32  Environmental units will be established within the Planning Division of GHA and in
MIRH to supervise future preparation of environmental impact assessments, spearhead the
development of training programs in environmental aspects of road projects in all agencies,
assist in developing environmental regulations, and oversee ongoing monitoring and
maintenance of construction activities. Capacity will be developed by providing 24 p/m input
from an Environmental Specialist consultant over 4 years to train three staff members from
GHA and one from MRH. The consultant will also oversee the environmental aspects of the
contractors' work in conjunction with the general supervision consultants. The unit will have
authority to halt work or impose financial penalties on contractors for non-compliance with
environmental laws or contract documents. The operating cost of the unit (about US$0.4
million) will be met from project funds. Appointment of the Environmental Specialist
consultant is a condition of Credit Effectiveness.
Axle Load Control
3.33  To enforce the vehicle and axle load regulation and reduce the high incidence of
vehicle overloading, the project will finance permanent weigh-bridge stations at five locations.
It will also provide portable equipment for spot checking by using mobile axle load control
units and include construction of buildings for the permanent weigh bridge stations and
appropriate transport and communications equipment for the mobile axle load control units
(Annex 3-4). MRH proposes to explore the feasibility of having the weigh-bridges operated
under contract by a private company.
E. PROGRAM COST AND FINANCING
3.34  The estimated cost of the program is US$1,480 million (see Annex 3-2 for details).
Costs have been estimated at January 1995 prices and at an exchange rate of US$1.00 = 1,000
Ghanaian cedis and are based on recent contract costs. The funding allocations for different
categories of work and provisions made to meet administration costs and accrued arrears
together with the sources of financing are given in Table 3.3. Of the US$1,480 million



24
required, US$540 million has already been pledged by twelve donors (US$200 million comes
from ongoing projects); a further US$200 million is projected to be secured from donors
during the program period; US$376 million is expected from the restructured Road Fund;
US$281 million from Government's development budget; and US$83 million from
Government's recurrent budget.

3.36  The program components to be funded by IDA's credit of US$100 million, which
together with Government counterpart funds of US$11.5 million equivalent (10 percent
matching funds plus taxes of US$1.5 million equivalent) are indicated in Table 3.4 above (see
Annexes 3-10 and 3-11 for details). Government agreed at negotiations that the project



26
counterpart funds will be deposited in separate project accounts opened by GHA and MRH.
Payment of initial deposits of US$250,000 equivalent and US$50,000 equivalent to GHA and
MRH respectively is a Condition of Effectiveness.
3.37  Costs include physical contingencies tailored to each defined project component,
averaging 5-10 percent of base cost. Price contingencies have been derived from the
following assumed rates of price increase: foreign prices 2.9 percent in 1995, 3.0 percent in
1996, 2.6 percent in 1997, and 2.0 percent per annum between 1998 and 2000; local prices
18.8 percent in 1995, 11.3 percent in 1996, 6.1 percent in 1997, and 5.5 percent per annum
between 1998 and 2000. Recent p/m rates in Ghana have been used for local and foreign
consultant services. For equipment, costs were based on 1993 prices for actual equipment
procured under TRP-2 and NFRRMFP.
F. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
3.38  MIRH would have overall responsibility for the program. No parallel project
administration units would be created, though some strategic support would be provided
within the existing institutional structure (see para. 3.20). MRH would specifically manage
the sector policy reforms; coordinate the expenditure program and related donor assistance;
arrange local contractor training programs; ensure the establishment and smooth functioning
of the restructured Road Fund and its Board and organize and chair the annual donor review
meetings. The technical assistance provided to NDPC would also be coordinated by MRH.
The Accounting and Management Information System Unit (AMISU) would develop and
implement accounting, monitoring and reporting procedures in MRH, GHA, DUR and DFR
and manage donor specific information systems (para. 2.6). An internationally recruited
Program Coordinator funded by the European Union would work directly under the Chief
Director to ensure timely implementation of key project activities and coordination of the
sector-wide expenditure program. Implementation responsibility for the civil works
components would rest with GHA, DFR and DUR who will be supported by consultants to
design and supervise the works. Components funded by the IDA credit would be
implemented by MRH and GHA.
3.39  An Implementation Manual covering the IDA credit has been prepared by GOG with
IDA's assistance.. This includes detailed schedules covering design, bidding, evaluation of
bids, award and implementation of contracts for civil works and goods under ICB and NCB,
and for technical assistance and studies, etc. The summarized implementation schedule
included in Annex 3-12 provides the baseline against which implementation progress will be
monitored. The program is expected to take about five years to implement and is scheduled
for completion by December 2000. Confirmation of Government's agreement to adopt the
implementation manual and the schedule incorporated therein is a Condition of
Effectiveness.



27
G. STATUS OF PROGRAM PREPARATION
3.40  Plans for the road sector are prepared on a rolling basis and incorporate large
contracts which are implemented over several years. Around US$360 million of the
US$1,480 million program is already committed in terms of on-going contracts and
engineering designs have been prepared for some 10,500km (46 percent of the total). With
regard to the IDA credit, tender documents for the rehabilitation of 93km of trunk roads in
Central and Eastern regions (ICB Lots No. I and 2) and for the periodic maintenance of
330km of paved roads in Eastern and Volta regions (ICB Lots No. 3,4 and 5), are nearing
completion, and contractors have been invited to prequalify. Periodic maintenance contracts
to be carried out under NCB will be implemented in three phases and road sections totaling
some 772km have been selected. Designs are already available and GHA have prepared a
detailed program for updating them where necessary and preparing contract packages. GHA
intends to invite bids for road works after negotiations, so that contracts can be awarded as
soon as the credit becomes effective. Draft bid documents for the vehicles and equipment to
be procured under the project have also been reviewed by the Bank. Based on experience
gained under TRP- 1 and TRP-2, contract completion periods for periodic maintenance would
be around 15 - 24 months, while contracts for rehabilitation and reconstruction would be
around 36 months.
3.41  On the institutional related components, a draft amendment of the GHA Decree has
already been prepared and organization and management studies for all of the sector agencies
have been carried out in the past two years. MRH in conjunction with the agencies is
preparing a coordinated plan to implement the recommendations of these studies. A MIS has
been developed for GHA and consultants have been engaged to start implementing it. The
recommendations that will be implemented under the program for strengthening the domestic
construction industry through training were made in a study carried out by international
consultants in 1994. Regarding restructuring of the Road Fund, Government has agreed that
the MRH Advisory Board will manage the Road Fund. This has been incorporated within the
draft Roads and Highways Act. Studies on road user charges and axle load control were
carried out in 1994 and the recommendations will be reviewed by the Board to determine
possible additional means of raising revenues.
H. PROCUREMENT
3.42  The three road agencies, under previous projects, have adopted NCB bidding
documents acceptable to the Bank and other donors. During project implementation, efforts
will be made to promote adoption of standard bidding documents for ICB. Procurement
arrangements for the IDA funded components are given in Table 3.5.

3.43  More than 90 percent of procurement of the IDA funded components will be managed
by GHA. MRH will handle the balance on their own behalf and for the NDPC. Both GHA
and MRH are familiar with Bank procurement procedures through their involvement in past
and on-going projects. Goods and civil works financed by IDA will be procured using
procedures outlined in "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,
January 1995." During negotiations, Government agreed on: (a) the procurement
arrangements; (b) Bank standard bidding documents being used for works and goods
procured under ICB and for consultants services, (c) all procurement of goods through ICB



29
being exempt from pre-shipment inspection for price, though quality and quantity inspections
may be carried out; and (d) standard procurement processing times for key activities.
3.44 Bank-financed civil works have already been divided into ICB and NCB packages
taking into account geographic spread, lengths of the road sections and the objective of
fostering growth in the domestic construction industry. The ICB works will be packaged into
eight separate contracts consisting of rehabilitation of 93km in Central Region (2 lots);
periodic maintenance of 330km in Eastern and Volta regions (3 lots); rehabilitation of four
bridges (2 lots); and construction training facilities.
3.45  Contracts for civil works estimated to cost individually more than US$2.0 million, and
for goods more than US$200,000, will be procured by ICB. Eligible domestic contractors'
bids will be evaluated on a 71/2 percent margin of preference for ICB bids. Civil works
estimated to cost less than US$2.0 million, and goods valued from US$50,000 to US$200,000
would be procured by NCB procedures which will include: local advertising; public opening,
clearly stated evaluation criteria; award to be made to the lowest evaluated responsive bidder;
and non-exclusion of foreign bidders if they wish to participate. The first NCB document will
be subject to review by the Bank regardless of the estimated contract value, before it is
released to the bidders. NCB contracts would consist of around 45 resurfacing, resealing,
regravelling and other rehabilitation contracts of average value around US$1  million scattered
all over the country. These works will be implemented over the whole project period in order
to spread the workload and the financial burden on Government. There will be adequate
competition as there are sufficient qualified local contractors and international contractors will
be permitted to bid if they so wish. The aggregate value of NCB contracts for civil works will
be about US$49.5 million of which IDA will finance up to US$42.7 million, and for goods,
US$1.6 million, of which IDA will finance up to US$1.4 million. Goods valued at less than
US$50,000 per contract will be procured by national shopping based on at least three
quotations and will be limited to an aggregate maximum of US$0.6 million. Spare parts and
accessories, which are of a proprietary nature may be purchased with prior approval of IDA
up to an aggregate value of US$0.5 million, under directly negotiated contracts from original
manufacturers/suppliers or their authorized agents.
3.46 Bank-financed civil works contracts above a threshold of US$1,000,000 will be
subject to Bank's prior review. The review process will cover about 75 percent of the total
civil works contracts by value. Goods contracts above US$100,000 will also be subject to
prior review by the Bank covering 80 percent of total value of Bank financed goods. The
prior review threshold for consultant services will be US$100,000 in the case of consulting
firms and US$50,000 in the case of individual consultants. Selective post review of awarded
contracts below the threshold levels will be carried out during supervision missions.
3.47 The following procurement information will be provided by GHA to the Bank in
quarterly reports: (a) volumes of contracts awarded; (b) revised costs of contracts, if and
when increases occur, giving reasons for the increases; (c) updates of the procurement
processing schedule giving reasons for any delay in project implementation; and (d)
compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.

L. DISBURSEMENT
3.48  The credit is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31, 2000. It will be
disbursed against the following categories as indicated in Table 3.6.

1/ Recurrent costs related to supervision, vehicle operation, office supplies, and project related travel
expenses, but excluding salaries of Government officials.
3.49  The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 3-13) is based on the detailed project
implementation plan (Annex 3-12). It reflects the advance actions taken to expedite
contracting of works in anticipation of the IDA credit, and the improvements in institutional
arrangements that are already in place or expected soon, which would allow more efficient
implementation.
3.50 To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications,
Special Accounts will be opened in US dollars for MRH and GHA at a commercial bank on
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocations amount to US$250,000
(Mff1 and US$1,000,000 (GHA) and cover about four months of eligible expenditures
payable directly from the Special Accounts. Upon effectiveness, an amount of US$125,000
(MH and US$500,000 (GHA), representing 50 percent of the authorized allocations, will
be deposited in the special accounts. The remaining balances will be made available as
needed. The special accounts would be used for all payments below US$50,000 (MH) and



31
US$100,000 (GHA). Replenishments would be submitted monthly. All replenishment
requests would be fully documented except for: (a) contracts of less than US$300,000 for
civil works and less than US$100,000 for goods and services (consulting firms); (b) contracts
of less than US$50,000 for individual consultants; and (c) operating costs which would be
claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). All supporting documentation for
SOEs will be retained by MRH and GHA for review by periodic Bank supervision missions
and external auditors.
J. ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING
3.51  MRH have begun to improve financial control in the sector (paras. 1.12 and 1.13)
through the establishment of the Accounting and Management Information System Unit
(AMISU) in 1995 (para. 2.6). AMISU's role has currently been limited to the financial
management of donor funded projects but this will be expanded to cover all road contracts.
An in-depth analysis of all on-going contracts was commenced by the Ministry in December
1995 to identify future monthly commitments and this analysis will provide the basis for
monthly monitoring of actual expenditures against future budgetary allocations.
3.52  The appointment of a qualified accountant to the Road Fund secretariat will enhance
the accounting procedures of the Road Fund. Monthly accounts showing receipts and
disbursements to and from the fund will be presented to the MRH Advisory Board. The
secretariat will also carry out spot checks to verify that the maintenance works paid from the
Road Fund have been carried out in accordance with the contracts. Government agreed at
negotiations that an accounting consultant would be commissioned by June 30, 1996 to
review the accounting systems of GHA and MRH and to establish procedures and practices
for the Road Fund related accounts.
3.53  For the IDA credit, GHA and MRH will establish separate accounts, in accordance
with acceptable accounting principles, to record all credit expenditures and to maintain
records on commitments, reimbursements and the status of credit funds. Both organizations
have already established appropriate accounting systems and auditing arrangements under
previous IDA projects and these are considered satisfactory. With respect to the amounts
withdrawn on the basis of SOEs, GHA and MRH will maintain records on contracts, invoices,
and evidence of payments readily available for review. At negotiations, Government agreed
to retain external auditors acceptable to the Association to carry out annual audits of the
Special Accounts, project accounts, including SOEs, and GHA and MRH accounting records,
and provide long form audit reports to IDA, including management letters within six months
of the end of each fiscal year. GHA and MRH will maintain accounting, costing and
procurement records and progress reports for their respective project components. Local
banks are adequately audited by extemal auditors.
K. REPORTING AND MONITORING
3.54 Government agreed at negotiations to a prograrn launch workshop, annual
implementation reviews and a mid-term review. The launch workshop will be held in Accra



32
soon after the IDA credit becomes effective. All implementing and financing agencies will be
involved and representatives of beneficiaries, including NGOs, will be invited to attend. The
Bank will be represented by engineering, economic, social science, financial and procurement
personnel. During the course of implementation, the project will be supervised by Bank staff
from headquarters and the resident mission in accordance with the supervision plan given in
Annex 3-14. Annual implementation reviews with MRH, the three road agencies, other
donors active in the sector and representatives of road users will be carried out by November
30 each year to evaluate progress with the program and to reach agreement on the
expenditure program for the following year. The timing of these reviews is such that it will be
possible to incorporate any necessary financial adjustments into GHA's annual budget
submission. A mid-term review of the IDA credit will be carried out not later than November
30, 1998. An assessment will be made as to whether any redesign and restructuring of credit
components with implementation difficulties is required and agreement will be reached on a
related action plan as necessary. A completion report will be prepared in accordance with
Bank guidelines by MLRH and GHA within six months of the final disbursement.
3.55  It was agreed at negotiations that GHA and MRH will prepare and furnish to the
Association quarterly reports, to be consolidated by MRH, on the status of. procurement and
disbursements; commitments made under the project; progress on civil works, supply of
goods, technical studies, and institutional accomplishments; trunk road sector related issues;
progress achieved against development and implementation monitoring indicators (see Annex
3-1 5); and contributions made through the Road Fund and from the Government budget to
program funding. Actual progress will be recorded against that planned on the baseline
implementation schedule (see Annex 3-12) and reasons given for any shortfalls together with
any necessary rectification measures. Government agreed at negotiations to the monitoring
indicators. Where needed, baseline surveys and follow-up studies will be conducted by GHA
and MRH (through AMISU).

4. BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS
A. GENERAL
4.1   This chapter describes the economic and social benefits, poverty and environmental
impacts, and the risks associated with the 1996-2000 Highway Sector Investment Program
and the US$100 million IDA credit supporting the program. The basis of the benefits and
impacts is essentially the same for both, though the range is wider in the program, reflecting
the greater diversity of the network. Risks associated with the program are also higher
because of the greater level of uncertainty of securing funding on the scale necessary.
B. ECONOMIC BENEFITS
4.2   Introduction. The main economic benefits of the investments will be derived from
savings in vehicle operating costs through the reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance
of roads and bridges. This will promote increased agricultural production, stimulate exports
and increase the mobility of people, particularly in rural areas. The program will also improve
transport sector management, through increased reliance on market orientation, and help
develop a more responsive institutional structure. The tangible benefits from road investments
have been quantified using cost benefit analysis. The benefits arising from institutional
strengthening and policy reform related components cannot be measured in monetary terms,
but they are nevertheless critical to the long term sustainability of the physical investments.
Social benefits are discussed in paras 4.8 and 4.9.
4.3   Economic Costs and Benefits. The economic costs of the road and bridge
components comprise the investment costs of design, construction, supervision and physical
contingencies (less price escalation, taxes and duties) plus the cost of routine maintenance.
The investments will result in smoother and more regular road surfaces, which will produce
reductions in the consumption of fuel, spare parts usage and other vehicle running costs.
Operating speeds and vehicle reliability will increase and this will reduce travel delays and
associated transport costs. The program will help the whole spectrum of society: low-income
farmers will gain from improved access to markets and social services; the urban poor will
secure better access to places of employment and other destinations; and the business
community will enjoy lower transport overheads. Investments in urban roads will reduce
traffic congestion and delay in major cities by better organizing and controlling the flow of
buses, other motor vehicles and non-motorized transport, thereby reducing passenger and
freight transport costs and enhancing the economic performance of Ghana's cities.
4.4   Analysis of Periodic Maintenance, Rehabilitation, and Reconstruction. Cost
benefit analyses were carried out by consultants between 1990 and 1995 using the World
Bank developed Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM). During appraisal, the
results were verified independently by Bank staff using the latest version of the model HDM
III on a representative sample of six different road sections totaling 386km with an estimated



34
cost of US$24 million. Calculations were based on vehicle cost coefficients derived in a 1992
study and assumed a traffic growth rate of 5.5 percent, which is considered conservative in the
context of projected GDP growth of 5 percent. Improved roads normally generate additional
traffic well beyond that which would be expected solely from increased economic activity.
Benefits were derived on a "with and without" investment basis and ERRs and net present
values (NPVs) at a discount rate of 15 percent derived for individual sections of road.
Investments in bridge rehabilitation were found to give very high rates of return, often in
excess of 100 percent. This is because once a bridge is closed, the added vehicle operating
costs related to making use of the next best alternative route can be significant since the
additional distance involved can be great.
Highway Sector Investment Program
4.5   The overall ERR for the program is 35 percent. This was derived by cost weighting
the average ERRs for each type of work (periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and
reconstruction) on each type of road (trunk, feeder and urban). These are presented in Table
4.1. For trunk road periodic maintenance and rehabilitation, typical sections from each of the
ten regions, totaling 3,500km with a combined value of US$179 million (47 percent of this
component), were analyzed giving a cost weighted ERR of 30 percent. The ERR of 51
percent for the periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of urban roads was based on detailed
analyses of typical road sections in Accra, Sekondi/Takoradi and Tamale. For feeder roads,
the analysis carried out during appraisal of the on-going National Feeder Roads Rehabilitation
and Maintenance Project (Report No. 9823-GH), which gave a composite ERR of 58 percent,
was utilized. The cost weighted ERR of 30 percent for reconstruction of trunk roads is based
on analysis of the 116km Accra-Yamoransa Road and the 25km Anwiankwanta-Kumasi Road
costing an estimated US$120 million (25 percent of this component). Both are critical
linkages in the trunk road system: the Accra-Yamoransa section being part of the main
east/west coast route connecting Togo and Cote D'Ivoire and linking the harbors of Takoradi
and Tema; and the Anwiankwanta-Kumasi section is on the route linking Kumasi with
Takoradi, an important route for export from the Regions of Brong Ahafo and Ashanti. For
urban road reconstruction, analyses prepared during appraisal of the Urban Transport Project
for investments in Accra and Sekondi/Takoradi costing US$49 million (26 percent of this
component), yielded a composite ERR of 39 percent. The validity of these calculations was
verified by analysis carried out during appraisal of the 386km representative sample of roads
referred to in para. 4.4. This produced ERRs ranging from 23 to 71 percent (cost weighted
average 40 percent) and a net present value at 15 percent discount rate of US$70 million. The
economic analyses are presented in more detail in Annex 4-1 and in the Project File.

4.6   Sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity of all investments was tested against higher
construction costs and lower project benefits. Projected traffic volumes were tested in
situations where these were thought to be significant and the effect of different maintenance
regimes was also evaluated. Table 4.2 presents the resuits of increasing costs by 15 percent,
decreasing benefits by 15 percent and for the increase and decrease happening concurrently,
for various routes. On the sample 386km evaluated during appraisal the effect was to reduce
the base case NPV of US$70 million to US$66 million and US$55 million respectively and the
average base case ERR of 40 percent to 36 percent and 35 percent respectively. A combined
increase of 15 percent and decrease in benefits of 15 percent reduced the NPV to US$52
million and reduced the cost weighted ERR from 40 percent to 32 percent. Individual
investments remain above the threshold ERR of 15 percent (see Annex 4-1 for details). The
ERRs of three other typical road sections for which periodic maintenance will be funded under
the IDA credit are also presented in Table 4.2. Investments are more sensitive to a
combination of reduced traffic volume and increased cost as indicated by analysis of the
Elubo-Assemkrom road in Westem Region. This revealed that a reduction in traffic of 10
percent combined with an increase in cost of 20 percent would reduce the base ERR from
22.2 percent to 17.9 percent, close to the qualifying ERR of 15 percent. However, the
average traffic growth assumption of 5 percent used in preparing the economic analyses is
considered conservative when viewed in the light of projected GDP growth of 5 percent.
Improved roads normally generate additional traffic beyond that directly associated from



36
increased economic prosperity. Evaluations carried out to test the effects of different road
maintenance regimes confirmed that deferring maintenance would cause ERRs to drop below
the 15 percent threshold, emphasizing the importance of effective routine and periodic
maintenance.

The IDA Credit
4.7   The IDA credit focuses on rehabilitation and periodic maintenance as a means of
sustaining Ghana's long term investment in highway infrastructure. This reflects Government
policy of giving highest priority to rehabilitation and maintenance. The results of analyses
carried out on all sections of road to be funded under the credit are summarized in Table 4.3
(see Annex 4-2 for more detail). Bridge rehabilitation gives the highest rate of return (for
conservatism 100 percent was adopted, though actual calculations yield rates in excess of this)
followed closely by periodic maintenance, which yields a cost weighted return of 92 percent
and a NPV at 15 percent discount rate of US$63.7 million for the resealing of 330km of
paved roads. The cost weighted ERR of the road and bridge components is 58 percent. The
NPV for the road components is US$218 million. The NPV for the bridge components is not
available, however on the basis of the high rate of return, the NPV is expected to be high.

C. SOCIAL BENEFITS AND POVERTY IMPACT
4.8   The 1996-2000 Highway Sector Investment Program and the IDA credit will deliver
direct and indirect benefits to the poor. Direct benefits on poverty levels will arise from:
(a)   improved access of remote rural areas to social services such as health and
education;
(b)   increased agricultural production through easier access to inputs such as
fertilizers, pesticides, extension services and even credit;
(c)   a reduction in the need for head-loading, which will particularly benefit
women;
(d)   employment opportunities in rural areas through the promotion of labor-based
construction and maintenance;
(e)   provision of paved access roads to low income areas in the main cities to
improve mobility thereby increasing employment and business opportunities;
(f)    NMV and pedestrian facilities in urban areas - the former will provide a lower
cost alternative to public transport for goods as well as individuals and the
latter will improve safety.
4.9   Indirect benefits on poverty levels will arise from the reduced cost of transporting
goods and personnel on improved roads. In some cases the possibility of marketing a
production surplus will become feasible for the first time, while in others, improved roads will
result in lower transport cost through increased competition and/or better prices through
access to more lucrative markets. The program will assist in creating employment both
directly in road works, and indirectly through expansion of farming and other economic
activities. Road safety improvements under the program will help reduce the high rate of road
accidents and fatalities, which affect the poor disproportionately.
4.10  While the program does not include specific targeted interventions to reduce poverty,
the 1995 Ghana Extended Poverty Study covering the period 1988 to 1992 revealed that
improvements in transport infrastructure were a principal factor contributing to the reduction
in rural poverty from 42 percent to 34 percent. Rural poverty accounts for 75 percent of all
poverty in Ghana. The study concluded that the reduction was primarily due to growth in non-
farm self-employment, mainly service-based wholesale and retail trading activity. This arose
from the surge in imports and exports stimulated by the ERP and improved transport
infrastructure, which enabled the benefits to reach rural areas. The continued focus on feeder
and trunk roads in the Program is expected to alleviate poverty further. The results of on-
going socio-economic studies on the impact of feeder road improvements will be utilized to
reassess the criteria for prioritizing the selection of roads for rehabilitation and periodic
maintenance and additional studies will be funded under the credit.



38
D. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
4.11  The project has been rated category "A" and a full-scale Environmental Impact
Assessment has been carried out by international consultants in association with local experts.
A copy of the EIA report and mitigation plan is available to the public in the Bank's Public
Information Centers in Washington and Accra and with MRH, GHA and GEPA. A copy of
the executive summary of the report was submitted to the Bank's Executive Directors in
March 1995. An acceptable mitigation plan was discussed and agreed during appraisal and
the required additional costs have been reflected in the project. The EIA concluded that the
project is unlikely to have any significant adverse effects on the environment as it mainly
involves rehabilitation and periodic maintenance operations on existing trunk roads and no
new construction is intended. Negative environmental impacts such as dust, noise, detours,
traffic delays, spoil materials, fumes, etc. will relate to construction activities and will be of
short term duration with adequate measures specified in the contracts to mitigate their adverse
effects. Positive environmental impacts of a long term nature will be achieved by: improving
safety through better maintenance and the elimination of hazardous road sections; paving (or
tarring) gravel road sections through high density settlements to reduce dust pollution; and
improving drainage which will reduce the exposure of nearby residents to water-borne
diseases associated with standing water. Annex 4-3 gives a summary of the EIA and
mitigation plan. At negotiations, Government agreed to adopt the mitigation plan and that
GHA will appoint, or assign, to its planning division, three engineers, or technicians, to assist
with environmental assessment and monitoring.
E. RISKS
4.12  The main risks and the measures to be taken under the program to mitigate them are:
(a)   benefits arising from road improvements not sustained because of inadequate
funding of maintenance - Government raised the levy on vehicle fuel from an
average of US cents 1.5 to 4 per liter in 1996 and plan further incremental
increases in subsequent years to meet the full cost of maintenance (estimated at
US$132 million in 1995 prices) by 2002;
(b)   securing the necessary contributions from the national budget - Government's
contribution to the Road Sector Investment Program as a percentage of the
capital budget is projected to decline from 44 percent in 1996 to 8 percent in
2000 with the enhanced Road Fund providing the difference. Total annual
expenditure on roads will however be above the 1995 level and this increase
will have to be met from the public pocket. Shortfalls in funding would mean
the impact of infrastructure constraints on economic growth would persist
longer;
(c)   sub-optimal selection of roads for improvement - Government agreed at
negotiations to a minimum qualifying ERR of 15 percent for roads to be
included in the program and reinstatement of GHA's Board with representation



39
from private sector road users and local government. Economic analyses of
almost 50 percent of the roads already selected for inclusion in the progran
(almost 50 percent by value) reveal returns significantly higher than this;
(d)   delays in implementation - designs have already been prepared for 46 percent
of the works (100 percent for the IDA funded roads), tender documents are
available and prequalification proposals have been invited for the ICB works to
be funded by IDA. The procurement process has been a major source of
delays in past projects, but procedures have been streamlined over the past 18
months. Government has agreed to the appointment of an intemationally
recruited Program Coordinator to assist manage the program;
(e)   increase in cost and/or decrease in benefits arising through higher than
anticipated inflation and/or other unforeseen factors - sensitivity analyses verify
the robustness of the investments.



40
5. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.1   In addition to standard covenants, Government agreed to the following at
negotiations:
(a)   No project to be undertaken without detailed engineering studies, including
the preparation of technical specifications, accurate bills of quantities and
realistic cost estimates. The cost of any changes in the designs,
specification and scope of works after contract award to be kept within 25
percent of the original contract value (para. 1.14);
(b)   Budgeting and accounting systems for monitoring contracts, acceptable to
the Ministry of Finance and IDA to be implemented by MRH and the three
road agencies by December 31, 1996 (para 1.14);
(c)   GHA to reduce the semi-skilled and unskilled labor force in the 1996-98
period to bring total personnel to about 3,100 by December 31, 1998.

(e)   The minimum qualifyring ERR for investment in any road section to be
included in the Road Sector Expenditure Program to be 15 percent (para.
3.6);
(f)   The proceeds of the Road Fund to be used exclusively to finance routine
and periodic maintenance costs and the Road Fund management costs
(para. 3.29);
(g)   Initial deposits of US$250,000 equivalent and US$50,000 equivalent to the
project accounts of GHA and MRH respectively (para. 3.35);
(h)   Procurement arrangements: Bank standard bidding documents being used
for works and goods procured under ICB and for consultants services; and
all procurement of goods through ICB being exempt from pre-shipment
inspection for price and standard procurement processing times for key
activities. (para. 3.42);



41
(i)    An accounting consultant to be commissioned to review the accounting
systems of GHA and MRH and set up internal procedures and practices for
Road Fund related accounts,
(j)    External auditors to be retained to: prepare annual long form audit reports
of the special and project accounts which would include a management
letter revealing any shortcomings (para. 3.52);
(k)   A program launch workshop, annual implementation reviews and a mid-
term review to be attended by all donors active in the highway sector.
Annual reviews to be held by November 30 each year and the mid-term
review to be held by November 30, 1998 (para. 3.53);
(1)    MRH to present consolidated quarterly reports on the status of
implementation of Bank funded components (para. 3.54);
(m)   Monitoring indicators for development objectives and implementation
schedules (para. 3.54);
(n)   GHA to appoint (or assign) to its planning division, three engineers, or
technicians, to assist with environmental impact assessments and
monitoring within 4 months of credit effectiveness (para. 4.11);
5.2   Government has agreed to the following Conditions for Credit Effectiveness:
(a)   Inauguration of the MRH Advisory Board (para. 3.28);
(b)   Adoption of an environmental mitigation plan satisfactory to IDA and
appointment of an environmental specialist to GHA (paras. 3.32 and 4.11);
(c)   Payment of initial deposits of US$250,000 equivalent and US$50,000
equivalent to the GHA and MRH project accounts respectively; and
(d)   Adoption of the implementation manual and the implementation schedule
incorporated therein (para. 3.38).

HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM UNIT (AMISU)
I .    The Ministry of Roads and Highways had in place a Project Management Unit
(PMU) established in 1985 under the Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
(RRMP) also known as Highway IV to provide co-ordination between and assistance to
the Road Agencies in the supervision of the various project elements as well as administer
the procurement. In addition PMU supervised the operation of the revolving funds
(Special Accounts) set up under the project and related disbursement requests from the
agencies.
2.    The PMU set up was continued under TRP- I and for part of TRP-2 and due to
increased requirement for assistance in procurement, disbursements and progress
reporting, the PMU could not provide enough support in the area of management
information.
3.    Accordingly, the PMU's scope of services was expanded during the later stage of
TRP-2 and renamed as Accounting and Management Information Systems Unit (AMISU)
and was structured to focus on financial information systems compatible with the overall
MIS of MRH and its agencies. The procurement functions handled by PMU under
RRMP, TRP-I and TRP-2 would henceforth be handled by the agencies' procurement
staff who underwent training at PMU in the procedures set up by the PMU.
4.    The objective under HSIP Project is to staff AMISU with local experts and to train
MRH personnel in order to prepare and facilitate integration of AMISU functions with the
MRH organization. For the expanded scope of work of AMISU, the project provides
628m/ms consisting of one accounting and management information systems specialist
(51mnims); one financial and accounting specialist (51m/ms); disbursement/accountant
specialists (l 02m/ms); short-term resource persons (I 6mI/ms); other staff (408 m/ms).
The Unit will be provided with logistical support, office supplies and equipment and
operations budget to carry out its functions.

THE 1995-2000 DESIRABLE ROAD SECTOR EXPENDITURE PROGRAM
(HIGH CASE)
1.    MRH has formulated it's 1995-2000 desirable road sector expenditure program
amnounting to US$2.32 billion on the basis of a program to stabilize the condition mix of the
road network to 70 percent in good condition and 20 percent in fair condition by 2005. The
program calls for an expenditure of US$1.03 billion in maintenance (routine and periodic)
and rehabilitation works including bridges and culverts (45 percent), US$1.19 billion in
reconstruction (51 percent) and US$0. 10 billion in administration expenditure (4 percent)
(see table below).

2.    The details of donor and GOG financed reconstruction projects included under this
program are given in MRH's report on the 1995-2000 road sector program and strategy.
When taking into account the external financing likely to be available and the constraint on
local budgetary resources, the program faces a financing shortfall of about US$ 766 million.
As a result of this financing gap, MRH has agreed to adopt a reduced fall back program of
US$1.55 billion which would also be adopted in the medium term under the HSIP.

THE 1996-2000 ROAD SECTOR EXPENDITURE PROGRAM (BASE CASE)
1.    Table 1 below gives a summary of the reduced expenditure program (US$ 1.48
billion) adopted by MRH under HSIP as a fall back to the desirable expenditure program due
to resource constraints. The reduced program is obtained by basically maintaining the outlay
for maintenance expenditure and cutting back on the reconstruction and rehabilitation sub-
programs. It calls for an expenditure of US$738 million in maintenance and rehabilitation
works including bridges and culverts (50 percent), US$586 million in reconstruction (40
percent), US$83 million in administration expenditure (6 percent) and US$75 million in the
payment of arrears (5 percent) due to contractors.

REPUBLIC OF GHANA
HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
THE 1995-2000 TRUNK ROAD ROUTINE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM
Routine Maintenance
1.    Background: Ghana has 14,750kms of trunk roads, 2,140kms of urban roads and
22,000kms of feeder roads. About 6,000kms of the trunk roads are bitumen surfaced and the
remaining 8,750kms of the trunk roads are laterite/gravel surface. By the end of 1993 after a
road condition survey on the trunk roads, the condition mix of the network was 40% Good,
27% Fair and 33% Poor. The amounts approved for routine maintenance in the past have
been continually subject to the constraints of the overall budget situation and have consistently
been much less than what is required. The funds provided for routine maintenance are
provided as part of recurrent budget that includes administrative costs, salaries, wages, etc.
The recurrent budget in 1992 was US$17.6 million, in 1994 the amount has reduced to
US$8.8 million with less than 50% of these amounts expended on routine maintenance. The
annual routine maintenance requirements range from US$11 to US$15 million in the medium-
term (1995-2000).
2.    Organization: The routine/recurrent maintenance operations are presently carried out
through the 10 regional offices, 32 districts across the country, two mobile maintenance units
and two bridge maintenance units. Each of the regions and districts has equipment
maintenance workshops and stores' operation. The maintenance department at the GHA
headquarters is headed by a Deputy Chief Executive (Maintenance) and assisted by directors
at the regions and director of maintenance at the HQ. The districts are responsible for both the
routine maintenance by contract and direct labor. In each district, there is an engineer assisted
by one works superintendent, one mechanical superintendent and some administrative staff. At
the moment, 50% of routine maintenance is done by contract through the Single Man
Contractors (SMC) and Local Private Contractors (LPC) and the remaining 50% by direct
labor. The supervision of routine maintenance works is done by the foremen located in the
district offices. The regional offices are run by regional directors and a maintenance engineer.
The district engineer visits the districts in their region regularly to monitor progress and
measure actual work done before recommending payment approval to the director.
3.    GHA plans to do more routine maintenance by contract, i.e., 90% by contract and
10% by direct labor over a six year period (1995-2000). It has started the restructuring
exercise and will put more emphasis on contract management and supervision. The multi-year
(1995-2000) routine maintenance by contract program planned by GHA establishes a direct
link between expenditures and physical outputs. The change in policy to do more routine
maintenance by contract will require a comprehensive review of the skilled and unskilled
workforce, reduction or total elimination of equipment, equipment operators and equipment
maintenance facilities and personnel at the regions and districts.

Annex 3-3
Page 2 of 4
4.    Planning: Presently, at the beginning of each year, the district engineers prepare the
routine maintenance needs and work programs in their districts, and forward the information
to the regional offices. The regional offices review the maintenance programs and send the
programs and cost estimates to the maintenance department. After reviewing and
consolidating the work programs from the regions, GHA presents a formal request to MRH
for funding. Experience from the past shows that GHA gets less than 50% of what they need.
The districts and the regions revise their work programs and schedules based on actual funds
provided. Starting from 1995, MRH has decided to include routine maintenance needs and
programs in the capital budget. NIRH and GHA have given top priority to routine
maintenance and multi-year (1995-2000) programming and budgeting cycle in other to ensure
a steady flow of work for private contractors and avoid delays in payment for completed
works. However for 1995 GHA proposed US$11.35 million for routine maintenance but
received approval for only US$4.52 million leaving a funding gap of US$6.83 million. The
program of phasing out routine maintenance by direct labor, auctioning of equipment and
closure of district and some regional workshops was done in such a manner that starting from
1996, GHA will be able to meet 100% of the funding for routine maintenance.
5.   Implementation: The district engineers prepare the revised implementation schedule in
line with actual fund available. Copies of the revised schedule are made available to the
regional offices and GHA headquarters for information and monitoring. The foreman at the
districts supervises and quantifies the actual work done by both contract and direct labor to
ensure quality and compliance with specification. The district engineer applies cost to the
actual work done and forwards same to the regional engineer who again reviews the payment
certificate and requests the regional director to approve for payment. On monthly basis the
district engineers meet with foremen to review implementation schedule and prepare progress
report that is forwarded to the regional offices. At the end of each quarter, GHA prepares a
quarterly progress report and presents it to the MRH.
Mobile Maintenance Units
6.    GHA established two Mobile Maintenance Units (MMU) and two Bridge Maintenance
Units (BMU) with a project engineer at the head of each unit and reporting directly to GHA
headquarters. The MMUs and BMUs are primarily concerned with performing periodic
maintenance and emergency repair works. The HSIP will strengthen the MMJUs and BMUs by
replacing and rehabilitating some of its vehicles and equipment and tools, for effective
performance. The equipment to be financed by the project for the MMUs and BMUs are
listed below.

The Contracting Industry
7.    The contracting industry in Ghana has reached a sufficient level to handle routine
maintenance works. At the moment MRH has a system of classification and registration of
contractors in categories and classes (see Project Files). Each year the contractors are
required to renew their registration and new contractors apply and are evaluated by MRH.
The following table shows the present number of registered contractors as of end December
1994 according to class and category:

HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
TRAINING NEEDS AND FACILITIES FOR GHANA HIGHWAY AUTHORITY
PERSONNEL
Background
1.    Training programs in the roads sector have, in the past, been provided locally at four
main locations, namely: (a) Shai Hills Training Center (b) Koforidua Training Center (c)
Road Training and Production Unit (RTPU), and (d) Mechanical Training and Production
Unit (MTPU), as briefly outlined below.
2.    Shai Hills: The Shai Hills center, located about 52 km from Accra, was established
in the mid fifties by the Public Works Department. The buildings had been put up as a
temporary camp for quarry laborers during the construction of the Tema harbor. It was taken
over for use by the Military before being passed on to the Public Works Department, from
which GHA was created. In the early years, it served as the backbone of all training activities
of the Ghana Highway Authority and other road agencies. However the structures
deteriorated rapidly, due to lack of maintenance, and worsened by the nature of the terrain on
which the buildings were sited - expansive clay foundation and earthquake zone. Serious
cracks developed in floors, walls and ceilings, leading to prohibitive maintenance cost. Very
little effort went into improving the center until July 1992, when the Military stepped in and
re-established it as a center for training new military recruits.
3.    Koforidua Training School: The Koforidua training school was set up under the
pilot Feeder Roads component of the RRMP (Cr. 1601 -GH) to train DFR staff and selected
Contractors in labor based technology. Training in labor based technology had began in 1987
at Sefwi Wiawso for contractors on some 40 km of roads in the Sefwi-Wiawso district, with
assistance from the ILO. Three successful training programs were run there between 1987
and 1989. In May 1989, the program was formalized and moved to Koforidua, to take
advantage of proximity to Accra, availability of land and labor as well as a network of Feeder
roads for field training. The school initially operated from rented classrooms, temporary
accommodation and inadequate training equipment. Despite these constraints, the school
achieved excellent results. Under the NFRRMP (Cr-2319GH) therefore, the school was given
support for the construction of permanent classrooms, dormitory and training equipment,
estimated at US$1,277,298 and jointly funded by Danida (47%), USAID (26%) and GOG
(27%) Being the only major school of its kind in the sub-region specializing in labor based
technology, the school is gradually gaining recognition among donors and other African
countries as a model training school. Given this state of affairs it would not be appropriate, at
this time, to expand its activities to cover both GHA and DUR field training needs.
4.    RTPU: The RTPU, located within the GHA district Yard at Nsawam, was first
established under the IDA supported RRMP (Cr.1601-GH) in 1987, to provide field training



62
Annex 3-7
Page 2 of 3
for road supervisors, equipment operators and tipper truck drivers by adopting a system of
training through production, that is, conducting training while at the same time carrying out
maintenance/rehabilitation on specific gravel road sections within GHA's annual maintenance
program. Effectively, the RTPU is a smaller version of the mobile maintenance unit (MMU).
After initial delays, the unit became operational in mid 1987, supported by an Internationally
recruited consultant. The unit achieved good results in the 1987-89, but due to severe
budgetary constraints, only managed to achieve 8% of its 1990 training target. The unit's
present premises - within the GHA district yard at Nsawam - has constrained its operations.
Classrooms, material storage, office and accommodation facilities are not adequate for the
programs offered. The proposal to eventually move the unit to Koforidua is aimed at
addressing these issues. The unit will however continue to be run independently of the Labor
based training school, which is receiving support for improvement under the ongoing
NFRRMP (Cr.23 1 9-GH).
5.    MTPU: The MTPU was also established under the IDA supported RRMP (Cr. 1601
GH) to conduct training of Mechanics mainly in the Central Mechanical Workshop/Stores in
Accra. The training programs focused on the repair of broken equipment under the
supervision of experienced mechanical instructors. The unit became operational in May 1987
following training programs prepared by consultants. The unit was supported under TRP 1
(Cr 1 858GH) with the renovation of a hostel and mechanics training shed, and further
supported under TRPII (Cr 2192 GH) with about US$0.4m worth of equipment and
Technical Assistance. The unit has hostel facilities to accommodate 30 participants and a
classroom for 20 trainees. The unit operates successfully and would continue to be supported
under the HSIP.
Assessment of Needs and Options for Training
6.    The development of a human resource center for GHA is required to bring staff up to
speed with and keep them abreast of new trends and technologies in road maintenance,
contracts administration, materials quality control etc. This can only be achieved through
carefully planned and regular training programs. Most of the Ministry's agencies have relied
on institutions overseas to provide this essential training, in addition to what used to be
available at the Shai hills Training center.
7.    But given the status of the Shai Hills center outlined above, it is clear that the center
would need replacement. Under the ongoing TRP II a central Training Center was to be
designed in-house and built to replace the facility at Shai Hills, using GHA's own funds.
However severe budgetary constraints prevented GHA from making any progress, except for
efforts to acquire about 5 hectares of land in East Lagon, Accra, about 15 km from GHA's
present head office building.
8.    Building a dedicated training facility is however only one option. A study will be
carried out to assess the training needs of all road sector staff over the next five years, taking
account of the continued move away from force account operations to contracting out. The
study will assess the capacity within existing training institutions in Ghana. If this reveals
that insufficient capacity is available, the options of providing the necessary capacity at an



63
Anfnex3-7
Page 3 of 3
appropriate existing institution will be compared against GHA building and operating a
dedicated facility. Economic analyses of the options, which take account of operating as well
as capital costs, will be carried out to deternine the optimum choice.
Detailed Description and Cost estimates
9.   It is assumed that the study will reveal that additional facilities are required. Essential
facilities to be provided would include (a) a conference hall (b) Classrooms - to cater for
survey, design, computer services and Audio Visual Facilities (c) materials laboratory (d)
office block for general administration (e) a reference library (f) Dining and Kitchen facility
(g) Residential accommodation - dormitory and limited single units.

SUPPORT TO NDPC
1.    The National Development Planning Commission (NDPC) has been established by
the 1992 Constitution of Ghana to advise the President of the Republic of Ghana on national
development planning policy and strategies. Accordingly, the mandate of NDPC covers all
aspects and sectors of the economy.
2.   In order to achieve its purpose, the NDPC is to carry out studies and make strategic
analysis on all aspects of national development, and make proposals on structural options for
the development of the economy. Among its other main functions, the NDPC is also to issue
broad national development policies for the guidance of all sectors of the economy as
directed by the President.
3.   In line with this, the Ghana-Vision 2020 (First Step: 1996 - 2000), which was
prepared by the NDPC and presented to Parliament in January 1995 by the President, makes
proposals for establishing the necessary conditions for achieving accelerated growth and
development of the economy which will lead to the transformation of Ghana into a high-end
middle-income country by the year 2020. The Ghana-Vision 2020 is a comprehensive
programme of policies for the preparation of medium-term plans by sectors and districts for
the 5-year period 1996-2000. It focuses on five development themes, namely:
(1)   human development, including poverty reduction, gender issues and
employment generation;
(2)   economic development, including production, economic infrastructure and
private sector development;
(3)   rural development;
(4)   urban development; and
(5)   enabling environment, including public administration and decentralization.
4.    As part of its mandate, the NDPC is also responsible for coordinating sectoral and
district development planning activities necessary for the implementation of the Ghana-
Vision 2020 concept. This implies that NDPC will have to build capacity in policy planning
and coordination to ensure that appropriate policies and programmes are formulated for the
development of the transport sector such that roads, highways and other transport services do
not only serve the urban areas but also rural areas where poverty in Ghana is mostly
concentrated. Such policies and programmes will considerably improve transport
infrastructure, particularly in the rural areas, reduce the drudgery of head porterage of
agricultural produce by rural women to neighbouring markets, and facilitate income
generation activities among the rural poor.



65
Annex 3-8
Page 2 of 3
5.    On account of this, NDPC will require assistance in the following areas:
(1)   Technical assistance in the form of two foreign and three local experts for
(i)   economic infrastructure policy planning and programming, including
transport, telecommunications and energy development;
(ii)   Science and technology policy development and planning;
(iii)  quantitative economic policy analysis and forecasting;
(iv)   development planning administration
(2)   Field studies and research in the areas of human development, especially
(a)   food security and nutrition;
(b)   export-oriented production and economic infrastructure development;
(c)   rural development and poverty reduction, i.e. rural infrastructure
development for increased food production and income generation,
provision of rural service centers, etc.
(3)   Staff development, training and Operational workshops for development
planners at district and sectoral levels.
(4)   Logistic support for the coordination of the preparation (as well as monitoring
and evaluation of the implementation) of this district and sectoral plans.
Development Specialists
6.    Development Specialists are required to provide technical expertise for in-depth
analysis of technical data and information, as well as for policy analysis and planning. The
Specialists will also be required to develop, in-house, the technical capacity of NDPC
professional staff for policy analysis and planning.
7.    Development fields identified for technical assistance include:
-- economic infrastructure;
-- quantitative economic policy analysis;
-- science and technology development policy; and
-- development planning administration.
Field Studies and Research
8.    The field studies and research are designed to provide primary data for policy analysis
and formulation. Various research projects will be undertaken in phases for the 4-year
period. The following areas have been identified to receive focused attention:
-- food security and nutrition
-- infrastructure development
-- development of Service Centres



66
Annex 3-8
Page 3 of 3
-- rural infrastructural development for increased food production and income
generation.
Operational Workshops
9.    Coordination between sectoral ministries, regions and districts needs to be further
strengthened. NDPC has plans to continue to build the planning capacity of development
planning authorities through technical workshops using gaming and other techniques. Similar
operational workshops organized in the past have proved successful for purposes of
coordination and syntheses of the development plans. Consultants are required for organizing
and moderating the workshops.
Staff Development and Training
10.   There is need to enhance the skills of NDPC staff in policy analysis, formulation and
planning in certain critical areas such as economic infrastructure, production, social, spatial
organization and the environment. A programme of short courses and other formal courses
have, therefore, been planned. This will enable staff to effectively assist in the evaluation and
review of development plans.
11.   A comprehensive training programme for planning staff at the district and sectoral
levels has also been planned.
Logistics
12.   NDPC is in the process of providing planning guidelines to sectoral Ministries and
districts for the preparation of medium-term (five years) plans. The Commission is required by
law to monitor and coordinate the entire process of plan and programme preparation in the
implementation of development policies, programmes and projects. Effective monitoring and
coordination of all these activities require adequate logistical support.

HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
RESTRUCTURING PLAN FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE ROAD FUND
I. Introduction
1.    A special account, referred to as the Road Fund, was established under an Executive
Decree in 1985. The Fund derives its revenues from a levy on fuel (petrol, diesel, kerosene
and refined fuel oil); bridge, ferry and road tolls; and the vehicle inspection fee. The Fund is
administered by the Ministry of Roads and Highways (the Ministry) who decide, on an
annual basis, how much of the Fund to allocate to the Ghana Highway Authority, Department
of Feeder Roads, and Department of Urban Roads. The revenues from the road fund are used
to partly finance periodic maintenance works carried out by contractors and the Ghana
Highway Authority's mobile maintenance units. The Fund is audited each year by an
independent firm of auditors.
II. The Road Fund
2.    The Ministry intends to continue using the Road Fund to finance road works, subject
to the following amendments:
(a)   in future, the fuel levy will only be applied to petrol and diesel fuel and will be
known as the "road levy";
(b)   bridge, ferry and road tolls shall continue to be paid into the Road Fund, but
shall be passed on to whichever road agency, or other competent body, is
responsible for operating the facility;
(c)   vehicle license fees, as determined by Parliament, shall be paid into the Road
Fund; and
(d)   international transit fees, collected from foreign vehicles entering the country
and using the road network, shall also be paid into the Road Fund.

HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF 1996-2000 ROAD SECTOR EXPENDITURE
PROGRAM
1.    This annex presents analyses of typical periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and
reconstruction works and summaries of the urban and feeder components included in the
Highway Sector Investment Program.
A.  PERIODIC MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION
2.    A sample of six typical sections of road totaling 246 km to be rehabilitated at an
estimated cost of $24 million were analyzed by Bank staff during appraisal using the Highway
Design and Maintenance Model III to cross check analyses carried out for GHA by various
consultants between 1990 and 1995. The treatments include regravelling, resealing with a
single surface dressing and resurfacing with double surface dressing and are representative of
the type of works to be undertaken in the program. Table 1 summarizes the road
characteristics.
3.    Costs were considered both in financial and economic terms (after adjusting for taxes,
duties etc.). Estimates of traffic growth based on recent surveys range from 5 percent for cars
and utility vehicles to 10 percent for buses and trucks. Table 2 shows a summary of the NPV
at 15 percent discount rate and ERRs. As seen from the table an investment of about $24
million in periodic maintenance produces a NPV of $70 million and ERRs that range from 23
percent to 71 percent, giving a weighted average ERR of 40 percent. A sensitivity analysis of
the NPV and ERR was made by increasing the investment cost by 15 percent and also by
reducing benefits by 15 percent. The effect was to reduce the NPV to $66 million and $55
million respectively and the average ERR to 36 percent and 35 percent respectively. The
combined effect of increasing the cost and reducing benefits by 15 percent simultaneously was
to decrease the NPV to $52 million and the average ERR to 32 percent.

B.   RECONSTRUCTION
4.    The 116 km Accra-Yamoransa Road and the 25 km Anwiankwanta-Kumasi Road are
representative of trunk roads that will be reconstructed. Both are critical linkages in the trunk
road system, the Accra-Yamoransa being a section of the Pan-African Highway which links
Accra to Cape Coast and an important connection between the harbors of Takoradi and
Tema. Anwiankwanta-Kumasi is a section on the route linking Kumasi with Cape Coast and
as such is an important route for export from the regions of Brong Ahafo and Ashanti.
Analysis of these sections yield ERRs of 25 percent and 40 percent respectively. The
following paragraphs outline the analysis of the Accra-Yamoransa Road.
5.    The civil works required and the benefits derived therefrom are considered typical.
The project involves work to expand roadway capacity, strengthen existing pavements,
preserve investment in existing assets, and realignments to remove serious geometric
deficiencies impacting on both safety and capacity. Benefits are captured through
measurement of reduction in vehicle operating costs and travel time.
6.    Traffic volumes were measured in 1993 through one week of automatic counting,
supplemented in particular locations by 10 hour manual counts to determine vehicle type,
distribution, and peak hour factors. Where appropriate, seasonal adjustments have been
made. Traffic forecasted to Year 2011 assumes an average annual growth rate of 5 percent.
This compares with a forecast of GDP growth made in a World Bank report, Ghana Progress
on Adjustment, 1991 of 4.9% for 1990-95 and 5.2% 1996-2000. Since growth in the
transport sector normally is somewhat greater than GDP growth, the forecast assumption is
considered conservative. Diverted traffic was not assumed, given the absence of roads with
service characteristics competitive to the existing road in this corridor. Generated traffic was
included only for the section closest to Accra.
7.    The design criteria and standards for alignment design have been selected from the
Ghana Highway Authority "Road Design Guide", 1991, with minor adjustments to conform
with the guidelines of the AASHTO, "A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways", 1990,
where considered appropriate because of the international importance of the project road
being a link in the Pan African Highway. The road is a National highway classified as primary
road, class A. The proposed reconstruction includes expanding a short 16.4 km section to
dual-carriageway, widening other sections to a uniform standard, which would provide design
speeds for 100km/hr on all but one 16 km section through hilly terrain, where an 80km/hr
design is acceptable. Climbing lanes are also provided to increase capacity on steep grades (4-
5%), where the speed of a loaded truck is expected to be reduced by more than 16 km/hr
below average travel speeds and where total traffic and the percentage of trucks warrant their
use. Table I indicates characteristics of each section of the Accra-Yamoransa Road.
8.    Roadway capacity analysis has been carried out using the Highway Capacity Manual,
Special Report 209, TRB, 1985. As a result, a four lane cross section was proposed for the
16 km link closest to Accra and two lanes for the remaining sections. The economic
assessment employed the RODEMAN program, which is a slightly simplified version of the
World Bank HDM-III model. The ERRs for each of the six sections are presented in Table 3.

The vehicle cost coefficients used were derived from a Bank funded study performed in 1992.
Pavement parameters needed for the RODEMAN calculations were obtained from a condition
survey. These benefits covered savings in Vehicle Operation Costs (VOC), savings on
maintenance on the existing road, and time savings for the trucks relative to the base strategy,
which comprised resealing and preventative maintenance.

C.   URBAN ROADS
General
9.    The urban roads component of the 1995-2000 Road Sector Expenditure Program
comprises periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of key arterial roads. Economic evaluation
has been carried out for the civil works elements of the road improvement sub-program,
including the rehabilitation of pavements and drains, and traffic management improvements.
10.   Economic costs include the investment costs of final design, construction, supervision
and physical contingencies (less price escalation, taxes and duties). The costs of routine and
periodic maintenance associated with the project roads have been costed separately and then
aggregated to arrive at total costs for the Accra and Takoradi road rehabilitation components.
Urban Road Rehabilitation
11.   The rehabilitation of the CBD and main radial roads in Accra, and the CBD roads in
Takoradi and Sekondi, would reduce traffic congestion in the central areas of these cities and
on the surrounding road network. The primary economic benefits of these investments will be
savings in vehicle operating costs for the traffic using the affected portions of the urban road
network in comparison to the costs for a do-nothing scenario. In quantifying these benefits, a
priority sub-network of urban roads was identified. This sub-network consists of eight high
priority sub-projects with a total length of 18.1 km in Accra, and an additional seven roads
totaling 10.4 km in Sekondi/Takoradi.

Annex 4-1
Page 5 of 6
12.   Forecast traffic volumes for the road rehabilitation sub-projects were prepared using
various estimation techniques. Traffic forecasts were developed for three classes of vehicles:
light vehicles (cars and taxis); light commercial vehicles; and heavy vehicles (trucks and
buses). A conservatively low traffic growth rate of 3.5% per annum was used in the analysis.
This rate reflects the effect of road capacity constraints on future traffic volume levels. Since
traffic volumes already are high on many links, generated and diverted traffic was not included
in the analysis.
13.   Vehicle operating cost estimates prepared by the Ghana Highway Authority were
developed for the three representative vehicle types. Adjustments to the GHA's estimates
were made to reflect the different operational and physical characteristics encountered in
urban areas, particularly with regard to average speed and stop and go traffic cycles. In order
to simulate with and without project conditions, several key analysis parameters were
established, including: flat and rolling road alignments; road surfaces with IRI measurements
ranging from 2,000 to 10,000 mm/km; and car speeds of between 16 (very poor surface
condition) to 35 kph (fair condition). The resulting VOCs for the with and without project
cases were compared to arrive at total VOC benefits. Net benefits were calculated by
deducting road maintenance costs. The composite ERR for this component is 29% as shown
in Table 4.

D.  FEEDER ROADS
14.   Feeder Roads are an important part of Ghana's road network, serving an estimated 70
percent of the population who live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their
livelihood. Feeder roads provide rural settlements with access to social services and economic
opportunity otherwise only available in larger centers. Most importantly, feeder roads
connect rural settlements to market centers. The poor condition of feeder roads in Ghana has
been a serious constraint on agricultural production and marketing, discouraging farmers from
producing beyond the subsistence level. Feeder roads in good condition are a prerequisite for
increased agricultural production. They also (i) ensure increased accessibility to extension
services; (ii) foster development of markets; (iii) lead to a reduction in transport cost and
storage losses; and (iv) enable intensified cultivation, and/or an increase in land area cropped.
15.   Economic Rates of Return (ERRs) were calculated for 1600 km of roads to be
rehabilitated under the National Feeder Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project.
Quantifiable benefits include: (i) increases in agricultural production, and (ii) reduction in
transport costs on existing production. Estimated ERRs are high; an average of 47 percent
reflecting the inherently high return in this type of investment, as well as the fact that
economic return criteria were used systematically to select feeder roads for rehabilitation.
16.   The evaluation methodology adopted a producer surplus approach with two major
benefit streams: (i) increases in agricultural value added due to increases in production, and
(ii) reduced transport costs or savings accruing to transporters on existing production. The
analysis of these two major benefit streams indicates that the increases in value added are far
more important than savings accruing to transporters. Increased value added is due to the
intensification of agriculture rather than expansion in area cultivated or due to improved
technology. Details of the evaluation methodology are contained in the appraisal report of the
NFRRM.
17.   The estimates of benefits for each phase- I feeder road were based on field data
provided by consultants from a study of four project zones in Accra/Volta, Salaga/Bimbilla,
North Western and Ejura/Kintampo. In each zone, feeder roads were selected representing
various levels of accessibility. In all, 1,200 households in 24 road corridors were interviewed.
Similarly, the estimates of benefits for the second phase feeder roads were based on field data
collected in the following road areas: Mampong, Sunyani, Techiman, Bekwai, Cape Coast,
Hohoe, Yendi, Tamale and Tumu. About 1,500 households living along both accessible and
inaccessible feeder road corridors were interviewed.

REPUBLIC OF GHANA
HIGHWAY SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND
MITIGATION PLAN
1.    The methodology utilized to conduct the site-specific environmental impact surveys
of the road sections included in HSIP was based on guidelines in the World Bank
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook.
2.    EIA field observations of HSIP road sections indicate that impacts will be fairly
benign and limited to local areas where road works will be carried out. Severe environmental
impacts necessitating resettlement of communities, or causing damage to fragile ecosystems,
will not occur as a result of the project.
3.    As no new road alignments are envisaged, direct negative impacts of HSIP will be
limited to soil erosion which may be due to improper designs of embankments or side drains;
scouring of the landscape due to opening of borrow pits; destruction of vegetation due to
clearing rights-of-way and a lack of adequate provisions for revegetation; dust, fumes, noise,
and vibrations during road work; increased sediment loads in streams and rivers where road
crossings occur; and safety hazards created by increased traffic flows and speed.
4.    Secondary impacts from the HSIP reconstruction will also occur. Prominent among
them is the possibility of induced development along more accessible road corridors and
opening up areas to exploitation of natural resources. Examples of the latter include easing
access to protected areas or forest reserves, thereby increasing the chances of over-
exploitation of wildlife, timber and fuel wood. HSIP road rehabilitation may also cause land
use changes and affect land ownership systems as improved roads may increase market
opportunities and, therefore, the value of land.
5.    Positive impacts from HSIP road improvement activities occur and indeed provide the
rationale for the project. Example include increase in value of agricultural products due to
improved access to markets, enhanced roadside commerce and increases in social mobility.
6.    GHA is giving increasing attention to strengthening its capabilities in the area of
environmental management of road projects including the production of EIAs. Plans are
underway to develop an environmental unit within the Planning Division of GHA.
7.    Recommendations to mitigate and monitor adverse environmental impacts of HSIP
are divided into the following categories: i) on-site maintenance; ii) institutional
strengthening and training; iii) environmental management of road construction and



93
Annex 4-3
Page 2 of 4
maintenance actions; and iv) compliance with environmental requirements by rehabilitation
contractors.
8.    Major recommendations in the mitigation plan include:
(i)   hiring an environmental specialist for 24 months (spread over the four year
HSIP implementation period) to assist the fledgling environmental unit of
GHA in implementing environmental management aspects of HSIP;
(ii)  to alleviate chronic road dust problems in settlements, road stretches through
busier towns and villages should be tarred;
(iii)  to reduce accidents the road corridor in the vicinity of settlements, speed
limits should be clearly posted and rumble strips and pedestrian crossings provided;
(iv)  GHA should establish an environmental unit in the Planning Division to
oversee environmental management of trunk roads in concert with finalizing
and implementing a training plan to ensure that environmental management is
institutionalized into GHA work;
(v)   public hearings should be used to provide a forum for local communities to
discuss their concerns about environmental aspects of upcoming road
rehabilitation activities with staff from GHA;
(vi)  GHA should develop plans to undertake an awareness campaign for
communities on environmental aspects of road works so that the public can
provide inforrned input to the EIA and environmental monitoring processes;
(vii) strengthened institutional coordination and interagency arrangements are
necessary at district and national levels to ensure effective mitigation of road
work on the surroundings, and the impacts of other activities on the roads
themselves;
(viii) environmental protection clauses should be included in construction bid
documents with clear penalties for non-compliance.
9.    Table I below lists specific mitigation recommendations including who should carry
them out and when, and implications for project costs. Further details are available in the
Draft Final Report of the Environmental Impact Assessment Study by ARD, INC., March
1995.
