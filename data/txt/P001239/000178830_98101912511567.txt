TEA FACTORY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The economy of Kenya is largely dependent on agriculture, and as a
consequence of the country's rapidly expanding population, intense pressure
on the land has resulted in steadily increasing rural poverty. The Government
is therefore making strenuous efforts to raise agricultural output and to
improve living conditions in the rural areas. The major thrust of the 1970-74
Development Plan is directed towards increasing the share of total resources
available to these areas as a means of providing improved income earning
opportunities for the rural poor. It is estimated that at least one half of
the farm families in the heavily populated areas suitable for tea growing
have no significant cash income, and tea is the one major cash crop which
offers them an opportunity to substantially improve their standard of living.
The annual income of those owning 0.32 ha of mature tea is about Ksh 1,300
(US$185) as compared with an average agricultural income of about Ksh 420
(US$60). The tea program has therefore made a substantial contribution
toward alleviating rural poverty.
ii.       The Project would provide processing facilities for tea planted
by about 35,000 smallholders under previous KTDA development plans and now
coming into full production.  It would not expand the acreage under tea but
would complement two previous IDA credits for the development of smallholder
tea production. The first in 1964 for US$2.8 million provided for the
planting of some 5,800 ha of tea and included provision for leaf collection
services and maintenance of tea roads. The second credit in 1968 extended
plantings by some 6,000 ha. Under the Project 17 tea factories, each with
an annual capacity of 1,200 tons made tea, would be constructed and equipped.
The Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA) would directly manage all new
factories. In order to help implement this increased management responsi-
bility, three new departments would be created within KTDA: Factory Con-
struction and Management, Marketing, and a Secretary's Department. A
training wing would also be added to one of the new factories which would
provide facilities for the training of factory managers.
iii.      All new KTDA factories would be established as limited companies
with KTDA initially the sole shareholder and creditor and serving as managing
agents for design, supervision of construction and management. KTDA would
impose a charge of Ksh 0.16/kg made tea for these services. As the new
factories become profitable, growers would be encouraged to purchase shares.
iv.       Total five year Project cost is estimated at Ksh 162 million
(US$22.7 million) of which about US$10.9 million or 48% would be foreign
exchange. The proposed IBRD Loan to KTDA of US$10.4 million would finance
about 50% of total Project costs excluding sales taxes. A Commonwealth
Development Corporation (CDC) loan of US$6.3 million would finance about



- ii - 
30% of Project costs. IBRD and CDC together would finance all foreign ex-
change and about 49% of local costs. Government would as its contribution
lend US$6.0 million to KTDA. The IBRD loan would be at an annual interest rate
of 7-1/4%, and CDC's loan would be at 5%. Goveirnment's loan would be ex-
tended at a rate of not less than 6-1/2% per annum. All loans to KTDA would
be for 20 years with a seven-year moratorium on principal. KTDA would invest
about 5% of the loan proceeds as share capital in new tea factories, and would
onlend the balance to the factories at an interest rate of 7-3/4% for 16 years
with three years moratorium on principal. Orders for vehicles, and factory
buildings, plant and equipment in excess of US$30,000 would be procured by
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
Goods and services costing between US$10,000 and US$30,000 would be procured
after competitive bidding on the basis of local advertisement. Contracts for
less than US$10,000 would be made on the basis of quotations from local
suppliers.
v.        At full development in 1981/82, the factories would process about
19,000 tons of made tea per annum, about 85% of which would be exported.
This would have a gross foreign exchange value of Ksh 130 million (US$18
million) per annum.
vi.       In calculating the economic rate of return of the Project it has
been assumed that the opportunity cost of labor is one-half of the daily wage
rate of Ksh 4.0 and that a rate of Ksh 10 per US$1 reflects the economic value
of foreign exchange to Kenya.  On these assumptions the rate of return is
calculated to be 24%; with no shadow pricing of foreign exchange the rate of
return would be 17% and with no shadow pricing of either foreign exchange or
labor it would be 10%. The rate of return is sensitive to changes in costs
or benefits. A 10% increase in Project costs or a 10% reduction in benefits
would reduce the estimated return to 20%; the combination of both would
reduce the return to 17%.
vii.      The Project is suitable for an IBRD loan of US$10.4 million to KTDA.

TEA FACTORY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Kenya's agricultural development strategy aims at bringing a sub-
stantially larger number of smallholders into the market economy. As a conse-
quence of the country's rapidly expanding population, intense pressure on the
available land has resulted in steadily increasing rural poverty. The major
thrust of agricultural policy is, therefore, directed at a massive expansion
of income-earning opportunities for the small peasant farmer. This goal is
made more difficult, however, by the fact that through a combination of world
market constraints, near internal self-sufficiency and a limited opportunity
for crop diversification, a significant proportion of the farming population
is unlikely to have access to a marketable cash crop. It is therefore neces-
saryv that any crop which can make a substantial contribution to total income
ancl employment should be encouraged. The areas of Kenya suitable for tea
growing generally constitute some of the country's most heavily populated
areas, and it is estimated that at least one half of the farm families have
at present no significant cash income. As alternative crops have been succes-
sful only in limited parts of these areas, tea remains the major cash crop
which offers an opportunity to improve the standard of living of this large
rural population.
1.02      Two IDA credits have been extended for the development of small-
holder tea production in Kenya. The first in 1964 for US$2.8 million provided
for the planting of some 5,800 ha and included provision for leaf collection
services and maintenance of tea roads. The second credit extended plantings
by some 6,000 ha. Factory construction was not financed by IDA under either
credit. Existing factories have been constructed by the Kenya Tea Development
Authority (KTDA) with substantial assistance from the Commonwealth Development
Corporation (CDC). Factory capacity now must be expanded, however, in order
to process tea planted under previous IDA credits which is now reaching ma-
turity. The proposed Project would provide for the construction of 17 new
tea factories to handle the expected increased volume of tea production.
1.03      Seven other loans or credits totalling US$23.7 million have assisted
the agricultural sector in Kenya since 1960. These include a loan in 1964
of US$2.6 million to assist the Kenya settlement program and two agricultural
credits in 1967 and 1972 to finance on-farm development. The livestock
industry has been assisted by a credit of US$3.6 million which provided for
the development of group, company and individual ranches, augmented services
to the livestock industry and assisted in the development of semi-arid grazing
areas. A second and more comprehensive credit for about US$20 million has
been negotiated but has not yet been approved. In 1970 a loan of US$2.6
million was extended for afforestation for saw-wood and pulpwood production.
In general, all projects have been well-executed, although institutional and
staffing problems have given some concern.



-2-
1.04      This Project was prepared by the Kenya Tea Development Authority
(KTDA) with assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture and the Bank's
Resident Mission in East Africa. The Project as originally planned in-
cluded provision for the planting of an additional 14,800 ha of smallholder
tea, for expanded leaf collection facilities, and for construction of 22
factories to process tea from both new and already established plantings.
After appraisal a Bank study 1/ revealed the unfavorable future prospects
for tea and the adverse effect which further plantings would have on world
prices. Consequently, the Bank has decided that it would support the expansion
of tea production only under very special circumstances. Accordingly, the
planting and leaf collection elements and the factories related to these new
plantings were excluded and the Project re-constituted to include only. factories
recuired for the processing of tea already planted. The further planting
program will, ho'vever, be financed by CDC. The Project was appraised in
November/December 1972 in conjunction with a CDC mission, by Messrs. E.
Zimmer-Vorhaus, G.U. Mbanefo, W. Stolber (Bank/IDA) and W. Coultas (Consultant).
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Lying astride the equator on the eastern coast of Africa, Kenya
has an area of 582,750 km2 and is a country of striking topographical and
climatic variety. Almost all economic activity is concentrated in the south-
ern third of the land area, which supports over 85% of Kenya's population -
now estimated at 12 million. This area is bounded by the hot and humid coastal
area in the East, and by Lake Victoria in the West. Stretching between are
high sweeping plateaus, varying in altitude from 900 to 3,000 m and contain-
ing some of Africa's most fertile soil.
2.02      Kenya's Gross National Product (GNP) in 1971 was just over US$1.9
billion, with an average per capita income of US$170; this figure is signifi-
cantly lower in rural areas, however. The average annual rate of increase
in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in real terms for the past eight years has
exceeded 6.5%, resulting in significant improvements in per capita income
despite an annual population increase of over 3.3%.
B. Agriculture
2.03      Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy.  It pro-
vides a livelihood for 90% of the population, generates over 60% of the
foreign exchange earnings and contributes between 35% and 40% of GDP. Signif-
icant strides have been made in the development of this sector over the last
decade and substantial increases have been attained in the production of
1/   Bank Financing of Tea, R73206, August 1973.



3 -
Kenya's main export crops - coffee, tea, and pyrethrum (Annex 1). Other crops
such as sugar, rice and cashew nuts have also been important. It has long
been Government policy that the natural potential for exportable cash crops
should be exploited to the fullest extent and that smallholders should par-
ticipate as far as possible in this development. To foster this pattern of
agricultural development several smallholder credit schemes and specialized
agencies were set up; these include the Agricultural Finance Corporation,
the Kenya Tea Development Authority and other Boards for such crops as
cotton, coffee and pyrethrum.
C.  The Tea Industry (Annex 2)
2.04      Commercial production of tea started in the mid-1920's and by 1945
about 4,000 ha had been planted on estates.  By 1972 tea estate plantings
had increased from 10,000 ha in 1955 to 23,000 ha.  Early in the 1950's the
Department of Agriculture began experiments on smallholder tea cultivation,
and in 1952 pilot projects were started in Nyeri and Kericho Districts.  Green
leaf from these schemes was processed by commercial estates and marketed
through Provincial Tea Marketing Boards. The success of these pilot schemes
led to the establishment in 1961 of the Special Crop Development Authority,
*      which in 1964 became the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA).  KTDA was
established as a statutory authority to provide the integrated services
required by smallholders to enable them to participate in tea growing,
including credit, extension and leaf collection services and the manufacture
of green leaf. KTDA was authorized to recover its operating costs by cesses
levied on green leaf produced (and for which it has a purchasing monopoly);
it thus developed into a fully autonomous commercial venture bringing many
of the advantages of large scale tea production to smallholders.
2.05      Under KTDA's First Tea Plan, financed by CDC and the Federal Re-
public of Germany, 4,200 ha were planted by the end of the 1963/64 planting
season. Together with CDC, IDA made its first tea Credit (64-KE) in 1964
for KTDA's Second Tea Plan, which by 1967/68 had added a further 6,600 ha
of tea. With CDC, IDA made a second Credit (119-KE) in 1968 to assist with
the implementation of the Third Tea Plan, and 13,700 ha were planted by
1971/72. Including the tea component of the settlement program (1,440 ha)
which was financed independently, by the end of 1972, 26,000 ha had been
developed by 67,000 growers averaging 0.39 ha tea, and the smallholder share
of the total Kenya tea acreage had increased from 4% in 1959 to 56% (Annex 2,
Table 1). In 1972/73, the first year of the Fourth Tea Plan, 12,400 small-
holders planted an additional 4,700 ha of tea (Annex 2, Table 2).
2.06      Total Kenya tea production in 1972 was 53,300 tons or 5% of world
output. As a reflection of the high quality of its tea, the average prices
of Kenya teas have shown a steady increase from 14% below London market
average in 1959 to the world's highest in 1970 (6% above London average)
*       and 1971 (9% above).  Since that time they have been among the three high-
est prices.

2.07      The Tea Board of Kenya regulates the industry and promotes research
and tea consumption. It is comprised of representatives from both the estate
anc smallholder sectors. The Board is maintained by cesses on the area of
planted tea and weight of marketed tea.
2.08      Tea research for Eastern Africa is carried out by the Tea Research
Institute (TRI) which has its headquarters at Kericho in Kenya and maintains
sub-stations in Uganda and Tanzania. TRI is funded by contributions from the
Tea Boards of Kenya and Uganda and the Tanzania Tea Authority. Since its
inception in 1951, research has been confined to the production of improved
and selected clonal planting material, the nutrition, cultivation and harvest-
ing of the crop and the influence of climate on tea. Limited facilities have
prevented research into manufacturing processes. TRI maintains a small
extension service designed to bring up-to-date information, such as recom-
mended fertilizer application rates, to the notice of tea extension workers
in both estate and smallholder operations throughout Eastern Africa.
III. SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT
A. General
3.01      There are some 600,000 ha suitable for smallholder tea cultivation
in Kenya, mainly in the districts of Kisii, Kakamega, Kericho, Nandi, Kitale,
Kiambu, Muranga, Nyeri, Kirinyaga, Embu and Meru. These areas are also
generally suited to mixed farming and, where established, tea forms only a
part of the overall activities on individual farms. Smallholder tea has thus
been developed in varying intensity over very large areas with the objective
that wherever possible, farmers who want to grow this crop should be enabled
to do so. Individual land titles have been granted and holdings, normally
ranging in size from 1.6 to 3.2 ha, have been consolidated. The tea areas
lie at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,300 m with a well-distributed rainfall
of about 1,200 mm/year. Soils are deep, free draining, acid and of volcanic
origin, and thus are ideally suited to tea growing. For details of acreage
established see Annex 2, Table 2 and Map.
3.02      There are three major elements involved in the smallholder tea
industry in Kenya. First, the grower plants and cultivates his tea on small
farms along with his other, mainly subsistence, farming activities.  Secondly,
KTDA - which also provides credit and extension services - purchases the
green leaf from the farmer at a set price and transports it to the factories.
KTDA meets the operating costs of these service activities through a cess on
green leaf purchased. Thirdly, the -actories then purchase the leaf from
KTDA for processing and marketing through commercial or private chanmels.
Although established as separate companies, the factories are essentially
service units which, after meeting their costs and a fixed dividend to share-
holders, pay any surplus to X¶2DA for distribution to growers.  Thus far KTDA



-5-
has been only a shareholder in the factories, as their management has been
entrusted to commercial tea companies acting as managing agents.  With regard
to future factories, however, KTDA would not only be the principal share-
holder but would take over direct management responsibilities.
B. Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA)
3.03      KTDA's Board of Directors is composed of a Chairman and 15 members
including representatives from CDC, the Provincial Administration, the Ministry
of Agriculture, elected representatives of growers, and the Chairman of the
Tea Board of Kenya. Much of the decision making is delegated to the General
Manager, who has operational responsibility and control over the three existing
departments: the Technical Department, providing extension services; the
Administrative Department, controlling leaf inspection and collection in addi-
tion to administrative services; and the Accounting Department handling KTDA's
and grower accounts.
3.04      Field Development and Extension Services.  New smallholders are
selected by District Tea Committees representing tea smallholders and by
KTDA supervisory staff on the basis of farming experience and a satisfactory
*      land title.  KTDA is responsible for the issue of planting licenses to grow-
ers.  Initially all planting material was produced by KTDA and it was thus
able to control all new plantings. With the introduction of vegetative
propagated (VP) material it became feasible for growers to operate their own
nurseries, and KTDA now retains control over tea acreage through the licen-
sing system alone. KTDA still maintains nurseries to supply leaf cuttings
to new growers. It also extends credit to growers for purchase of planting
material and fertilizer. Extension work is directed by the Chief Technical
Officer assisted by an Assistant Chief Technical Officer with responsibili-
ty for nurseries and farmer training. All field extension staff are seconded
from the Ministry of Agriculture. Farmer training concentrates on short
courses at local farmer training centers and on farm demonstrations and field
days.
3.05      Leaf Collection and Inspection.  KTDA inspects and buys leaf from
smallholders at widely dispersed centers which are so located that no grower
has to transport leaf more than 5 km from his tea holding. Each center will
ultimately handle about 250 tons of green leaf per year. KTDA constructs
leaf bases near each factory; the bases serve as the administrative centers
of the Leaf Inspection and Collection Service, and through them the leaf is
sold to factories. Each base includes housing for the Leaf Officer and
his staff, offices and stores. Details of cost of these services are given
in Annex 3, Table 1.
3.06      Payment to Growers.  At the end of each month KTDA pays to growers
*      about Ksh 0.90/kg for green leaf, less deductions for cess (para. 3.07).  In
accordance with KTDA's agreements with factories, at end of each year the



-6-
latter pay to KTDA for distribution to growers all surpluses after meeting
operating costs, debt service, taxes and a fixed dividend of 8% on share
capital. Details are given in Annex 3, rable 2.
3.07      Financial.  About 85% of KTDA's income is derived from a cess on
green leaf delivered. This levy, established by statutory order, is intend-
ed to help meet KTDA's operating expenses and debt services. This cess is
presently set at a level of Ksh 0.32/kg on green leaf delivered, but with the
expected reduction in unit costs brought about by increased production, it is
expected that the cess would be gradually reduced. Other sources of income
are irnterest margins on loans made to growers, dividends from factory companies
(para. 3.10), a development charge of Ksh 0.03 per tea bush planted, and net
proceeds of sales to growers of planting materials and fertilizer.
3.08      KTDA's total long-term indebtedness as at June 30, 1973 was Ksh 36
million (US$5 million). These debts comprise IDA Credits 64-KE and 119-KE
on-lent to KTDA by Kenya Government (44%), CDC loans (43%) and smaller amounts
borrowed directly from other sources. Over the years KTDA has built up
operational deficits which by 1973 totalled Ksh 21.1 million (US$3.0 million).
These deficits arose during the initial years of smallholder tea development
when KTDA provided a high level of services to growers and costs were not
fully covered by annual income. However, in the twelve months ending June
30, 1973, KTDA made a net profit of about Ksh 6.6 million (US$0.9 million),
most of which was devoted to reducing the past operational deficit.
3.09      Tea Roads.  Government is responsible for the construction and
maintenance of all roads used for tea collection. During the First and Second
Tea Projects, about 1,300 km of roads were upgraded to allow leaf collection
vehicles to operate in all but extremely wet conditions. Maintenance of
these roads has been generally satisfactory.
C. Tea Factories (Annex 4)
3.10      There are presently twelve tea factories processing smallholder
tea and three additional factories under construction. Each of the factories
is established as a limited liability company with a Board of Directors com-
prising representatives of KTDA, CDC, the managing agents, tea growers and
Government. Of the twelve existing factories, ten are managed by commercial
tea companies acting as managing agents and two are directly managed by KTDA.
KTDA and CDC are the major shareholders in eleven of the factories; the twelfth
is jointly owned by KTDA and other private interests. The five factories most
recently established each had authorized share capital of Ksh 200,000, com-
prising 20,000 founders shar*es held equally by CDC and KTDA and valued at
Ksh 5 (each carrying 41 votes), and 20,000 growers shares also at Ksh 5 (with
1 vote). Of the authorized shares, only 5,000 founders shares have actually
been issued. Growers may acquire shares in the factory to which they deliver
leaf.  Of the six factory companies established before 1971, five have sold



-7 -
shares to growers ranging in value from Ksh 30,220 by the Litein Factory to
Ksh 141,700 by Ragati Factory Company. In addition to share capital, each
factory has loan capital of about Ksh 4.5 million provided by CDC and the
managing agent and bearing interest at 8 or 8-1/2% per year. A chart showing
the financial structure and past performance of factory companies is at Annex
4, Table 1.
D. Achievements Under First and Second Tea Projects
3.11      As a result of an impressive farmer response, the first three Tea
Plans have either been completed ahead of schedule or exceeded their targets.
By the end of the Third Plan (1972) 67,000 growers had planted 26,000 ha ave-
raging 0.39 ha tea per farm. Among the factors contributing to the success of
this program have been: the integration within KTDA of all services required
by growers; KTDA's ability to recruit a well qualified extension and administra-
tive staff by paying salaries considerably above prevailing Government levels;
the participation of growers at all levels of decision-making thus ensuring
their cooperation; the strict control of leaf quality exercised by KTDA; and
finally the prompt payment to growers of an attractive price for green leaf
produced.
3.12      Disbursements under the first and second IDA Credits covered KTDA
capital and operating deficits. As a result of under-estimates of expected
yields and over-estimates of costs, the actual deficits incurred were lower
than projected. Consequently, 21% of the first Credit and 94% of the second
were cancelled. The table below illustrates KTDA's performance as it related
to appraisal estimates. Further details are given in Annex 3, Table 3.

3.13      KTDA has been uniquely successful in initiating and supervising the
large smallholder planting programs to high standards at relatively low cost,
and average yields have consistently been higher than estimated. As a result,
by mid-1973 some 71,000 farmers dispersed over wide areas either have received
or are expected to receive significant increases in their cash incomes.

E. Future Tea Development
3.14      Financial returns to farmers combined with the availability of
additional land well suited to tea farming led KTDA to embark on its Fourth
Tea Plan in 1972/73; in that year 4,700 ha were established. The Fourth
Plan proposes to establish a total of 19,500 ha of smallholder tea over the
five year period 1972/73 - 1977/78. Planting of 14,800 ha. would be financed
by CDC and Government. At maturity, these plantings would require the con-
struction of additonal factories.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Description and Detailed Features
4.01      The Project would over the five-year period 1974/75 - 1978/79 pro-
vide for the establishment of 17 tea factories required for processing leaf
from previous plantings now coming into full production. Provision would
also be made for factory and marketing services.  The Project would be ex-
ecuted by KTDA.  Specifically, the Project would provide for:
(a)  the construction and equipping of 17 tea factories; and
(b) the establishment of factory management, training, tea
marketing and accounting services within KTDA which would
be required to support Project factory investments.
4.02      Factory Development (Annex 4).  Experience has shown that tea
factories with an annual capacity of 1,200 tons made tea are generally the
most efficient. A recent consultants' study shows that if factory capacity
were doubled, processing costs could be reduced by 12%. This would, however,
necessitate greatly increased road costs and the risk of factory breakdown
would involve considerably increased losses. Consequently, under the Project
the 17 new factories would be constructed to a capacity of 1,200 tons (Annex
4, Table 2). Assurances were obtained that KTDA would carry out with any
necessary assistance from consultants, a study on the most suitable form of
factory design, equipment and manufacture of tea.

Leaf collection services, including the construction of leaf bases, required
for each factory would be financed outside the Project.
4.03      Factory Management and Training Facilities.  Until such time as
growers purchase shares, KTDA would be the only shareholder in all Project
factory companies. KTDA would act as managing agents for these factories.
In order to meet this increased management responsibility new departments
would be created - one for factory construction and management, one for
marketing, and a Secretary's Department (para 5.01). A training wing would
be added to one of the new factories which would provide facilities for the
training of factory managers. Theoretical as well as practical training for
each trainee would be carried out over a four-year period. Facilities would
be provided for the demonstration of various production methods, and for
maintenance of tea machinery.
4.04      Ecology.  There are not expected to be any adverse effects on the
environment as a result of the Project.

B. Project Costs (Annex 5)
4.05      Total five year Project cost is estimated at Ksh 162 million (US$22.7
million), of which about US$10.9 million or 48% would be foreign exchange.

Costs have been estimated on the basis of 1973 prices adjusted to reflect
recent currency alignments.  Contingencies - 5% physical and 7% price per
annum (cumulative from the first year) - have been included for all items.
Costs include 10% sales tax on all capital goods amounting to US$1.9 million
(including related contingencies).

C. Financing (Annex 6)
4.0)6     Project Costs would be financed by IBRD, CDC and Government in the
following proportions:

The proposed IBRD loan to KTDA for US$10.4 million would finance about 46%
of total Project costs or 50% of Project costs excluding sales tax. The
loan would be for 20 years at 7-1/4% interest with a seven-year moratorium
on principal. The CDC loan to KTDA of US$6.3 million or 28% of total Project
costs (30% of Project costs excluding sales tax) would be on the same terms
but with an interest rate of 5%.  In this way IBRD and CDC would fund, on a
joint financing basis, all foreign exchange and about 49% of local costs.
The balance of US$6.0 million would be contributed by Government. Govern-
ment would lend its contribution to KTDA at an annual interest rate of not
less than 6-1/2% for a 20-year term with a seven-year moratorium on prin-
cipal. KTDA would invest about 5% of the loan proceeds as share capital
in new tea factories and would onlend the balance to the factories at an
interest rate of 7-3/4% for 16 years with three years moratorium on principal.
Assurances to this effect were obtained. Taxes and duties drived from the
Project would over the Project period be about US$1.9 million. The net
Government contribution would be about US$4.1 million. The delays caused
by the change of the Project concept (para 1.04) make it necessary to pro-
vide retroactive financing for the construction of four tea factories and
for related consultancies (US$400,000).

D. Procurement
4.07      Procurement of vehicles (US$0.1 million), factory buildings
(including buildings for the training factory) and factory plant and equipment
(US$14.6 million) where contracts exceed US$30,000 would be by international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines; orders would be
bulked wherever appropriate. Procurement of goods and services costing between
US$10,000 and US$30,000 would be subject to competitive bidding on the basis
of local advertisement. Any contract for goods or services costing less
than US$10,000 would be made on the basis of quotations from local suppliers.
Appropriate assurances were obtained. Assurances were also obtained that (i)
before proceeding with factory constructions detailed proposals and plans
would be agreed with IBRD, (ii) that draft tender documents for all contracts
exceeding US$30,000 would be submitted to IBRD for approval, and (iii) that
bid analysis and recommendations would be sent to IBRD for comment before
award.
E.  Disbursement (Annex 6)
4.08      Disbursement of funds from CDC and IBRD loans would be on a joint
financing basis and would be apportioned in the ratio 5/8 : 3/8.  Final
administrative arrangements between CDC and IBRD were agreed at negotiations.
Total IBRD disbursements would cover:
(a)  51% of total expenditures for vehicles (US$34,000),
construction of the training factory (US$90,000),
salaries for KTDA's head office factory services and
training factory (US$780,000), civil works for factory
construction (US$2,800,000), and factory plant and
equipment (US$4,300,000); and
(b) an unallocated amount of US$2,396,000 representing
contingencies on the above items and transferable to
them as required.
Disbursements would be supported by full documentation. The estimated
schedule of disbursements is given in Annex 6, Table 2. Any surplus funds
remaining at the closing date would be cancelled.
F. Accounts and Audit
4.09      KTDA maintains a satisfactory accounting system which adequately
records its financial transactions as well as its assets and liabilities.
It also produces semi-annual income and expenditure accounts and balance
sheets audited by independent accountants satisfactory to IBRD. Assurances



-13 -
that this practice would continue, and that audited accounts would be sub-
mitted to IBRD within six months of the closing of the financial period
were obtained. As individual companies, each factory would maintain its
own accounts. Assurances were obtained that these accounts would be audit-
ed by independent auditors acceptable to IBRD and that such accounts would
also be submitted to IBRD within six months of the closing of the financial
year. Assurances were also obtained that KTDA would introduce a cost account-
ing system to demonstrate the efficiency of the field and the new factory
services.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
5.01      KTDA would execute the Project under the direction of a General
Manager responsible to the Board (Chart). Existing Departments - Adminis-
trative, Technical and Accounting (para.. 3.03) -'would continue to be or-
ganized as at present. However, in order to carry out the factory development
program three new Departments would be established: a Factory Department to
undertake the design, construction and management of new factories and to
train factory managers and staff; a Marketing Department and a Secretary's
Department.  The appropriate assurances as to these arrangements were
obtained. The existing factories now managed under managing agency agreements
would not be serviced by KTDA's new departments.
A. New Departments
5.02      A Factory Department (Annex 4) headed by a Chief Factory Officer
would be comprised of a factory construction and maintenance section headed
by a factory engineer, a production section under a factory superintendent
responsible for regulating and supervising all aspects of tea manufacture,
and a section for training factory managers under a training officer.
5.03      A Marketing Department would be established under a Chief Marketing
Officer. The department would test and evaluate tea, prepare marketing
strategy and control the flow of tea to markets and provide advice to KTDA
factories. The actual sale of tea through brokers or agents would continue.
5.04      A Secretary's Department under a qualified Secretary would keep
minutes of factory company meetings, file returns required by law, transfer
shares to growers, maintain the necessary registers.
5.05      A factory accounting service would be provided within the existing
Accounting Department. An internal auditor would also be appointed who would
undertake a continuous and critical evaluation of the adequacy and effective-
ness of KTDA's accounting and internal control systems and report directly
thereon to the General Manager and Chief Accountant. KTDA maintains adequate



- 14-
records to enable a comprehensive evaluation of the Project to be made.
Financial provision has been included to enable KTDA to retain consultants
to analyze this information. Procedures for evaluation were agreed during
negotiations.
B. Recruitment of Staff
5.06      Competent management for the new Factory, Marketing and Secretary's
Departments would be vital to the continued efficiency of KTDA. The effec-
tiveness of the new departments would depend on the caliber of staff recruit-
ed to fill key posts and the subsequent availability of additional technical
advice. IBRD would therefore be consulted before appointment of the Chief
Factory Officer and the Marketing Officer. Candidates for these posts would
be recruited by KTDA either directly or through consultants. Assurances were
obtained that if it proved impossible to recruit suitable persons for these
posts or for the posts of Factory Engineer, Factory Superintendent and Train-
ing Officer, KTDA would employ consulting firms to fill this need and that
either individual consultants or consulting firms would be appointed within
six months of loan effectiveness. In addition KTDA may employ consultants
to assist with the design and construction of factories.
0
C. Factory Companies (Annex 4)
5.07      All new KTDA factories would be established as limited companies
under Kenya Company Ordinance with KTDA as the only shareholder (52 of total
investment). As factories become profitable, growers would be encouraged to
buy shares and the proceeds used to repay factory loans prematurely; from the
beginning growers would be represented on the Board of Directors of the factory.
Under agreements concluded with KTDA which would be submitted to IBRD for com-
ment, factories vwould continue the payment system under which all surpluses
would be distributed to growers as a second payment after deduction of oper-
ating costs, debt service, first payment for growers' leaf, and a dividend
payment of 8% on share capital and taxes. New factory companies would appoint
KTDA as their managing agents for the design, supervision of construction,
and management of factories and the provision of accounting, administrative
and marketing services. KTDA would levy a charge of Ksh 0.16/kg made tea for
these services (para 6.06). The financial position of factories is set forth
in para 6.06.



-15 -
VI. PRODUCTION, PRICES AND BENEFITS
A. Production and Marketing (Annexes 2 and 7)
6.01      Production from existing plantings is estimated to increase from
14,000 tons in 1972/73 to 39,000 tons at maturity in 1981/82. Tea from KTDA
is presently sold through four different channels: London auctions (37%),
Mombasa auctions (17%), pool sales to meet requirements of East African mar-
kets (15%), and private contracts (31%). No major changes are expected under
the Project. KTDA's new marketing department would advise both the factory
companies and the Authority's Board on marketing policy. Tea brokers would
continue to sell tea produced by both existing factories operating under
managing agency agreements and Project factories to be managed by KTDA.
B. Prices (Annex 7)
6.02      The main feature of the international trade in tea since the mid-
50's has been a steady growth in export volume averaging about 2% annually.
This, together with near stagnant demand, has caused average prices on the
London market to fall from an average of 45.7 new pence/kg in 1970 to about
42.2 new pence/kg in 1972, recovering to 42.9 new pence/kg in 1973. Recent
projections 1/ of supply and demand estimate a current price on the London
market in 1980 of 55 new pence/kg which corresponds to a 1973 constant price
of 34.3 new pence/kg.
6.03      Comparative tea qualities and the price differentials between coun-
tries are in part the result of climatic conditions which give rise to annual
price fluctuations. They also depend on the quality of planting material and
technical standards in factories; in the latter, Kenya generally and KTDA
in particular enjoy an advantage over ths older established estates in Sri
Lanka and India. This has been reflected in Kenya's average tea prices,
which have been among the three highest since 1970. In these years prices
were on average about 5% above the London average. KTDA's smallholders are
generally situated in the most favorable climate areas and have achieved a
high standard of tea plucking; its teas have thus earned a reputation of
above average Kenya quality. It is therefore assumed that its tea would
continue to enjoy a premium on world markets, and would in 1980 receive about
57 new pence/kg (about 4% above current average London projected market prices).
C. Farmer Benefits (Annex 8)
6.04      At present prices, farmers planting 0.32 ha of tea over a two-year
period would receive a net return, after cess and debt service, rising from
Ksh 87 in year 4 (the first year of plucking), to Ksh 1,300 at maturity in
1/   IBRD, Commodity Forecast, March, 1974.



- 16-
year 13 when all debts (repayments for planting material and fertilizer)
would have been paid. This compares favorably with alternative net returns
from the same area of: maize Ksh 200, dairy cattle Ksh 140, and pyrethrum
Ksh 420. Given 1980 current price projections, the net return from tea
would be Ksh 100 in year 4 and Ksh 1,500 at maturity. These net returns to
farmers from tea would be appreciably higher than those from other crops.
D. KTDA's Financial Position (Annex 9)
6.05      In addition to the existing sources of income (principally the
cess on green leaf para 3.07), KTLA would under the Project earn additional
income from a management charge of Ksh 0.16/kg made tea on all Project fac-
tories. The dividends and interest from factory companies would be augmented
as the nunber of factories increases. In addition to current debt service
liabilities, KTDA's prospective liabilities include loan repayment liabilities
on project loans, on loans of about US$5.9 million for the Fourth Tea Plan
and of about US$26 million required for further factory development and for
various replacement needs. With the expected reduction in unit costs brought
about by increased leaf production, KTDA would be in a position to meet these
current and prospective obligations and reduce its green leaf cess by Ksh
0.01/kg each year from the present level of Ksh 0.32/kg to Ksh 0.22/kg.
Assurances were obtained that any reduction in green leaf cess of more than
Ksh 0.01/kg annually would require the prior approval of IBRD.
E. Financial Position of Factory Companies (Annex 4)
6.06      Capital Structure and Financial Performance.  Hitherto factory
companies have been financed by a proportion of equity capital eligible for
dividends (not exceeding an annual average of 8%) and loan capital (8 - 8-1/2%
interest rate); all surpluses remaining after meeting these obligations and
allowing for operating costs and accumulation of working capital are distri-
buted to farmers as payment on green leaf delivered. These arrangements
would continue under the Project (para 5.07). In addition to these and other
recurrent obligations, each new factory would in future pay KTDA a management
fee of Ksh 0.16/kg made tea which would equal the fees now payable to manag-
ing agents but which are levied on a different basis. This fee would be
changed only after consultation with IBRD and assurances to this effect were
obtained. New factories are only established when a minimum economic through-
out from the adjacent area is assured; thereafter payments to growers (which
are partially balanced out by KTDA between different factories) depend on
factory profitability. Financial projections (Annex 4) show that factory
companies would be able to meet their obligations and make leaf payments
which would give farmers the average returns indicated in paragraph 6.04.



- 17 -
F. Government Budgetary Position (Annex 10)
6.07      Government revenues arising from the Project would be a 10% sales
tax on capital goods produced in or imported into Kenya and interest on their
loan to KTDA. Government cash outflows over the same period would be its
contribution to Project costs. Net Government outflows over the Project
period would be recovered by 1984/85 and the surplus would increase to Ksh 51
million by 1993/94.
VII.  ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The Project would provide for the construction of 17 tea factories
and for the related services required to process green leaf grown by about
35,000 smallholders under previous tea planting programs. Tea with its high
labor requirements and high value is more advantageous both in terms of employ-
ment and income than alternate agricultural activity in the area. About
2,000 persons would be employed in factories and within KTDA. At full develop-
ment in 1981/82, the factories would process about 19,000 tons of made tea
per annum, about 85% of which would be exported. The gross foreign exchange
*      value of exports at full development (1981/82 onwards) would amount to about
Ksh 130 million (US$18 million) per annum.
7.02      At the time of appraisal of the Second KTDA Project (1968) the
economic rate of return was calculated to be between 16 and 25% depending
on the assumption made for shadow pricing labor. This calculation reflected
costs and benefits attributable to the entire tea program including plantings
and estimated factory investment and operating costs. In recalculating the
economic rate of return the Project was treated as an integral part of the
Second Project and adjustments were made to the calculations of the latter
in order to reflect new developments. Costs of factories and their capacity
have been increased, resulting in a slight reduction in unit investment costs.
Factory operating costs have also been revised and the cost of KTDA's Factory
Management Service together with that of the training factory have been added.
Estimates of production from the Second KTDA Project plantings were increased
by 6% representing the weighted average of latest yield estimates (Annex 2,
Tables 2 and 3). Tea prices used are based on 1980 forecast prices at London
auctions of 34.3 new pence/kg made tea (Ksh 4.86/kg made tea ex-factory), and
expressed in 1973 constant terms.
7.03      For the Second KTDA Project two rates of return were calculated.
A rate of return of 16% was estimated on the assumption that the economic
cost of on-farm labor (both family and hired labor) was equal to the 1968
daily wage of Ksh 2.50; however, assuming no alternative opportunity for
labor, the rate of return was estimated at 25%. In the meantime, Governmental
*i   programs have somewhat increased alternative employment opportunities (partic-
le    ularly for maize, pyrethrum and dairy cattle) so that in the present recalcula-
tion an opportunity cost for labor of one-half the 1973 daily wage rate of



- 18 -
Ksh 4.00 has been assumed.  It has also been assumed that a rate of Ksh 10
per US$1 reflects the economic value of foreign exchange to Kenya.
7.04      The Project economic rate of return calculated on the above assump-
tion is 24%; with no shadow pricing of foreign exchange the rate of return is
17%, and with no shadow pricing of either foreign exchange or labor, 10%.
Possible factors that would adversely affect the outcome of the Project are
increases in capital and recurrent costs and a decrease in yields and prices.
A 10% cost increase or a 10% reduction in benefits would reduce the rate of
return to 20%. The unlikely combination of both of these factors would reduce
the rate to 17%, while a 10% increases in benefits would increased it to 28%.
7.05      Before their involvement in tea growing, the tea producers were
essentially limited to subsistence production. Under the Project, annual in-
comes of farmers owning 0.32 ha of mature tea would, at present prices, be
about Ksh 1,300 (US$185). A combination of possible alternative agricultural
activities would only provide an income of about Ksh 200 (US$30). Since the
average per capita GNP of Kenya is estimated at about Ksh 1,200 (US$170) and
the average agricultural income at less than Ksh 420 (US$60), the tea program
would help primarily a poor segment of Kenya's population and would thus con-
tribute to a more equitable distribution of income.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION                             0
8.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following
principal points:
(a) Government would onlend its contribution to Project costs
at an interest rate of not less than 6-1/2% per annum; KTDA
would onlend to tea factories at a rate of 7-3/4% (para 4.06);
(b) Before proceeding with construction of individual factories,
detailed plans, specifications and contract documents would
be agreed with IBRD (para 4.07);
(c) Appointments to the posts of Chief Factory Officer and
Marketing Officer would be made only after consultation
with IBRD. In the event that KTDA experienced difficulties
in securing qualified and experienced personnel for the posts
of Chief Factory Officer, Factory Engineer, Factory Super-
intendent, Marketing Officer and Training Officer, within
6 months after loan effectiveness KTDA would retain con-
sultants acceptable to IBRD in order to carry out these
functions (para 5.06);
(d) Any reduction of KTDA's green leaf cess of more than Ksh 0.01/kg
annually (para 6.05) would be subject to IBRD approval, and any
change in the management fee of Ksh 0.16/kg made tea
would be made only after consultation with IBRD (para 6.06).

8.02      The Project is suitable for an IBRD loan of US$10.4 million to
KTDA at an anmual interest rate of 7-1/4% for 20 years with seven years
moratoriwu on principal.

TEA FACTORY PROJECT
Factory Development
General
1.        There are twelve KTDA tea factories processing smallholder tea,
one of which, Kianjakoma, produces green tea for the Japanese market. Each
factory is established as a limited liability company with a Board of
Directors on which growers are represented. Ten of the factories are
managed by well established commercial tea companies acting as managing
agents and operating under twenty year agreements. Two factories are
managed directly by KTDA.
Capital Structure
2.        The five factories most recently established each had authorized
share capital of Ksh 200,000, comprising 20,000 founders shares held equally
*m    by CDC and KTDA and valued at Ksh 5 (each carying 41 votes), and 20,000
growers shares also at Ksh 5 (with 1 vote). Of the authorized shares, only
5,000 founders shares have actually been issued. Growers may acquire shares
in the factory to which they deliver leaf. Of the six factory companies
established before 1971, five have sold shares to growers ranging in value
from Ksh 30,220 by the Litein Factory to Ksh 141,700 by Ragati Factory
Company. In addition to share capital, each factory has loan capital of about
Ksh 4.5 million, provided by CDC and the managing agent and bearing interest
at 8 or 8-1/2% per year. A chart showing the financial structure and past
performance of factory companies is at Table 1.
3.        Factories constructed under the Project would have a similar
structure. KTDA would, however, be the only source of share capital and
long term loans. The purchase of shares by growers would continue to be
encouraged.
Factory Management
4.        For those factories operated by managing agents remuneration is on
the basis of a standardized formula written into each managing agency agree-
ment. This usually includes:



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(a)  A fee of Ksh 30,000/year (reduced under certain circumstances 1/);
(b) 2% commission on gross sales;
(c) 2-1/2% commission on all purchases made by the managing agents;
and
(d) 1% commission on sales other than by auction, through a recognized
broker, or to Associated Tea Growers of East Africa.
Average remuneration paid by factories in 1970 was Ksh 140,000. Managing
agents supply staff whose salaries are paid by factories, and supervise this
management by inspection visits and regular reports. They also fulfill
statutory obligations under the Kenya Companies Ordinance, and provide
accounting and tea marketing services at their own expense.
New Services
5.        Under the Project, factory companies would employ KTDA as their
managing agent responsible for:
(a)  Design and supervision of factory construction including:
basic feasibility studies; design of factories; procurement,
tendering and bid evaluation; and supervision of the delivery
of plant and equipment and factory construction.
(b)  Management of factories including:  assistance in recruitment
of factory managers; supervision of manufacturing including
processing programs; supervision of repair and maintenance;
and services as company secretary.
(c) The Marketing of Made Tea.
6.        To fullfill these functions KTDA vould establish a Factory Department,
a Marketing Department, a Secretary's Department and a special factory account-
ing section in the Accounting Department.
7.        A Chief Factory Officer would head the Factory Department, which
would design and supervise construction of factories and determine process-
ing programs.  A Factory Superintendent, responsible to the Chief Factory
Officer, would design manufacturing programs for individual factories in
consultation with Marketing Department, and would supervise their implementation.
8.        The Factory Engineer, responsible to the Chief Factory Officer,
would be responsible for design, procurement and supervision of construction
1/   If the 2% commission on sales exceeds Ksh 50,000.

of new factories and auxiliary buildings.  He would also be responsible for
maintenance of factories, buildings, vehicles and stores, and would oversee
the work of factory mechanics.
9.        The Factory Training Officer, responsible to the Chief Factory
Officer, would be in charge of the training factory (a training wing annexed
to one factory). His duties would include training of prospective factory
personnel in:
(a) -lea manufacturing through all stages from green leaf to made
tea;
(b) Operation and maintenance of factory machines; and
(c) Workshop practices.
He would cooperate with the Tea Research Instiute of East Africa, and the
private sector in the development of new or modifications to existing
machinerv.
10.       The Marketing Officer heading the Marketing Department would:
(a)  Advise on marketing of made tea;
(b)  Consult with the factory superintendent on manufacturing
programs for individual factories;
(c) Provide market intelligence on local and overseas markets; and
(d) Train KTDA and factory staff in tea testing and evaluation.

1/  Based on a factory capacity of 1,200 ton made tea (5,400 ton green leaf). A new factory would be constructed au soon as tte crop is
about 2,500 ton green leaf above the capacity  of the existing factories.  Some deviation  from the calculated factory requirement is due
to local conditions, such as arrangements with private factories or indivisibilities of transportation arrangements.
2/ Factories would be sited to serve production zones and would not necessarily be confined to Districts.
3/ Factories shown in year in which they start operating, factory construction to start one year earlier.

TEA FACTORY PROJECT
The Tea Market
General
1.        World tea production is largely concentrated in South Asia and East
Africa. East Africa's share of world production and exports has increased
rapidly in recent years, while that of the main South Asian growers has been
declining. While there has been an increase in the volume of world tea trade,
aggregate export earnings have stagnated in the past decade as a result of
declining prices.
2.        A potential surplus in the international tea market is indicated
by all recent projections of supply and demand. Long term price projections
by the Commodities and Export Projections Division of IBRD put the "most
likely" estimate of the average current London price for all made teas in
1980 at 55 new pence/kg (para 9) which corresponds to a 1973 constant price
of 34.3 new pence/kg.  This compares to an average of 43 new pence/kg in
1967/69 and 42.9 in 1973.
3.        Kenya's share of total world exports has increased from 1.3% in
1955 to 5.7% in 1970, and amounted to 34,000 tons in 1971. 1/ About 83%
of the country's production is exported and the rest is consumed domestically.
Over the years the quality of tea exported has markedly improved. In 1959
Kenya teas were 14% below London average price; in 1966 they surpassed the
average, and in 1970 and 1971 were the wozrld's highest (6% and 9% above London
average) and since then they have been ih the top three. Since 1967 Kenya
tea has earned, on average, a quality premium of about two new pence/kg.
Even though quality teas have sufferred from the increased use of lower
quality teas with an expanding market for tea bags and instant tea, it is
expected that Kenya's quality premium should remain at its present level.
4.        Smallholder tea is expected to be 60% of Kenya's total tea production
by 1980 and an analysis of prices received by KTDA for smallholder teas show
them to be about equal to the Kenya average. For purposes of future projections
it has been assumed that this relationship would continue. Although local Kenya
consumption can be expected to grow rapidly, its share of total production is
unlikely to increase.

Marketing Arrangements
5.        KTDA sells tea through four different channels:  (a) London auctions
(37%); (b) Mombasa auctions (17%); (c) local pool sales for East Africa con-
sumption (15%); and (d) private contracts (31X).
6.        Generally speaking, the best teas are shipped to the London market
where quality is fully recognized and premiums are paid for tea destined for
consumption within Continental Europe and Britain. The Mombasa auctions
mainly cater to the needs of countries not buying at the London sales (e.g.
Middle East and E'ersian Gulf countries), and tend to sell teas of intermediate
quality. Prices obtained are generally not as high as in London. Teas sold
through private contracts are a matter of agreement between the individual
factory company and the buyer; the price agreed is not released for public
information. The duration of contracts varies usually from 3-14 months and
the price may be either for the period of the contract or subject to periodic
review and adjusted up or down depending on the general movement of tea
prices. The local pool is a form of cooperative selling by the major East
African producers who have agreed not to compete with each other on the local
East African market. The managing agents for the scheme are N/S Brooke Bond
Liebig, and all teas are sold under their label. Members have an equal share
in supplying the local market; all teas marketed are valued by a panel of
tasters in London.  With the exception oi Ragati, all KTDA factory companies
are members of the pool which supplies more than 90 percent of the local market.
Ragati Factory Company was obliged to resign from the pool for selling teas
independently to Uganda, and subsequent requests to rejoin have been rejected.

Tea Prices
8.        Comparative tea qualities and the price differentials between
countries are in part the result of climatic conditions which, to the extent
of their variability, give rise to annual price fluctuations. They also de-
pend however on the quality of planting material and technical standards in
factories; here Kenya generally and KTDA operations particularly (being more
recently developed) enjoy an advantage over the older established estates in
Sri Lanka and India.  Prices received for Kenya teas in London as compared
with average prices for other quality tea producers are as follows:

ANNEX 7

The projected prices are current market prices; that is, according to the
method used the effect (if any) of inflation on tea prices in the world
market has already been accounted for. As monetary spillovers on tea prices
are considered to be negligible the figures show the expected real supply-
demand-price relationship. A decline in tea prices substantially below 55
new pence/kg is considered unlikely, as many tea enterprises would prove un-
profitable at this level. The removal of marginal areas from production would
reduce supply, thereby halting further ceclines in price. It must be noted
that any forecast should be viewed against the uncertainties surrounding
long-term demand and supply conditions.
10.       In view of the importance of India both as a producer and as a con-
sumer, the demand and supply situation in that country is going to have a
direct bearing on the world situation as a whole. According to an FAO report
"Outlook For The World Tea Market - 1968-1975", between 1955-57 and 1966-67,
Indian tea consumption increased at 5.7 percent per annum, while production
increased at only 2 percent per annum. The position has changed little since
then. India's per capita consumption is still low, a reflection of the
deliberate Government policy to restrict local consumption. In general
when stocks in London reach certain levels and prices decline, India's
local consumption goes up and exports are consequently reduced.

TEA FACTORY PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The economic rate of return is based on calculations made in the
Second KTDA Project1/ (Report TO-632a) which was appraised in 1968. That
calculation reflected costs and benefits attributable to new plantings of
14,000 ha of tea and included a tentative allocation of factory investment
and operating costs. In the revised calculation the following adjustments
have now been made to costs and benefits to reflect the present situation.
2.        Costs
(a)  Cost of on-farm labor.  For the Second XTDA Project two rates
of return were calculated. A rate of return of 16% was esti-
mated on the assumption that the economic cost of on-farm
labor (both family and hired labor) was equal to the 1968
daily wage of Ksh 2.50; however, assuming no alternative
opportunity to labor, the rate of return was estimated at
25%. In the meantime, Governmental programs have somewhat
increased alternative employment opportunities (particularly
for maize, pyrethrum and dairy cattle) so that in the present
re-calculation an opportunity cost for labor of one-half the
1973 daily wage rate of Ksh 4.00 has been assumed.
(b)  Factory Capital Costs.  Tea planted under KTDA's previous
plans requires 18 new factories of 1,200 ton/year capacity
between 1973/74 and 1978/79; of these 17 will be financed
under the Project.
Of the 18 factories required, 14 are assumed to process
tea from Second KTDA Project plantings and have been included
in the costs. Together with 4 factories built before the
Project they would provide a processing capacity of 20,400
ton/year for an estimated production from the Second KTDA
Project of 19,000 ton/year by 1981/82. Factory construction
costs (including 5% physical contingencies but excluding
a sales tax of 10%) have altered with the increased size of
factory from Ksh 4.8 million for a 900 ton/year factory to
Ksh 5.6 million for 1,200 ton/year factory. This has slightly
decreased the unit cost. A useful life for each factory of
16 years has been assumed, coimpared to 20 years in the 1968
calculation; Capital costs have been repeated from 1986/87
to 1995/96.
1/   This project covered KTDA's Third Tea Plan.

(c)  Factory Services.  (Annex 5, Table 2).  The cost of KTDA's
new factory management service, (including 5% physical
contingency), has been allocated proportionately to the
factories supported by the service.
(d)  Factory Operating Costs.  (Annex 4, Table 4).  Total operat-
ing costs which exclude transport and marketing costs and a
fee for KTDA's management services (para c) have been recal-
culated as follows:
Year 1  Year 2  Year 3 onwards
-------Ksh '000------------
existirtg factories, 900 ton/capacity    700    1,000       1,200
new factories, 1,200      "      "        900    1,200      1,500
In the 1968 calculation factory operating costs included
transport and marketing cost F.O.B. Mombasa.
(e)  Training Factory (Annex 5, Table 3).  Full capital and recurrent
costs (including 5% physical contingencies) of the Training
Factory have been added to costs.
3.        Benefits                                                                     0
(a)  Production.  Estimates of annual tea production have been increased
by 6% above 1968 estimates, in line with the weighted average of
revised long-term yield estimates (Annex 2, Tables 2 and 4).
Production would increase from 5,000 ton made tea in 1974/75 to
19,000 ton made tea in 1981/82.
(b) Made Tea Prices. In the 1968 calculation prices F.O.B. Nombasa
were used. Prices have now been calculated ex-factory and
include dispatch and marketing costs to London tea auctions.
From 1973/74 onwards, a constant price of Ksh 4.86/kg made
tea has been used. This figure was arrived at as follows:
Average constant price 1973
London auction (on basis of 1980
current price of 55 new pence/kg)          new pence  34.3/kg made tea
Quality premium for Kenya tea                new pence   2.0/kg   "
Price for Kenya Tea                          new pence  36.3/kg   "   "
Converted at Ksh 17.25:100 new pence             Ksh      6.26/kg  "   "
Dispatch and Marketing costs (Annex 7)           Ksh      1.40/kg  "
Price ex-factory                            Ksh      4.86/kg  "   "
.

4.        Shadow Rate of Forein Exchange
It has been assumed that a rate of Ksh 10 per US$1 reflects the
value of foreign exchange to Kenya.
5.        Rate of Return
Based on the above assumptions the economic rate of return over
35 years would be 24%. With no shadow rating of foreign exchange, the rate
of return would be 17%.
6.        Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity of the internal economic rate of return of the
Project to changes in some of the basic assumptions used in the calculation
is shown below:
Internal Rate of Return
(a)  10% increase in cost                        20.7
(b)  10% reduction in benefits                   20.3
(c) 10% increase in cost and 10% reduction
in benefits                               16.5
(d)  10% increase in benefits                    28.2
(e) Without shadow pricing on-farm labor and
without shadow rating foreign exchange   9.7
