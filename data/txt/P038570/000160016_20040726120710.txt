EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Government of Tanzania (GoT) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS)
has taken various initiatives to improve agricultural sector in the country. One of these initiatives is
undertaking the River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP);
in context with which, is the Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC). Among others,
the need to undertake the RBMSIIP arose out of a nation-wide realisation that the ecosystems of
coLintry's river basins (especially those of the Rufiji and the Pangani Rivers) are not being properly
managed, leading to extensive environimentai degradation and loss of potentialities of these vital
ecosystems. Moreover, it was also realised that in view of the above-mentioned loss of potentiality,
smallholder traditional irrigation schemes are the worst affected: hence the need arose to undertake also
the SIIC.
Support t o smallholder t raditionial irrigation i mprovement and rehabilitation i s, t herefore, o ne o f the
major components of this RBMSIIP programme. The SIIC component focuses on improving
management of water resources and crop husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation
schemes. This can be achieved, among others, through improvement of natural resources, land and
water, during implementation of the rehabilitation and upgradinlg of irrigation schemes.) SIIC is geared
at improvement of water management in smallholder irrigation schemes to ensure sustainable use of
land and water resources and ultimately yield increase with minimal environmental degradation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC both the Scheme Environmental Assessment (SEA) as well as an
Environmental Audit (EA) were carried out for the Soko Irrigation Scheme. Among others, both the
assessment and the audit were based on the Initial Environmental Assessments (IEE) studies carried out
by the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Irrigation Section of the MAFS.
This report presents the findings of the study.
The objective of the study was identifying changes that have taken place before/after scheme
improvement, assessing and quantifying thereto environmental and social impacts, also duly preparing
an environmental and social management plan as well as developing an environmental and social
management and monitoring system. According to the ToR the expected outputs of this study are two
in one interrelated reports i.e. covering both Environmental Audit (EA) as well as Scheme
Environmental Assessment (SEA), analysing e.g. socio-economic, socio-cultural and engineeriig
factors in order to provide quantitative information.
Furthermore, the report incorporates an assessment of compliance of the scheme's improvement to the
Tanzanian policy and legislation framework, as well as the World Bank's relevant environmental safe
guard policies (especially on OP 4.01).
Different methodologies were employed to carry out the task, including the following:
*   Desk review of recommended documents
*   Questionnaire administration to key stakeholders
*   Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA)
At different stages of the study the following approaches and analytical tools were applied
*   Participatory data collection
*   Key informant interview
*   Trend analysis
*   Geographical informationi system
Describing the location of the scheme, the study found that the Soko irrigation scheme lies at lowlands
of foot of Mt.Kilimanjaro about 30km east of Moshi municipality. Its coordinates are latitude 03028i
viii



South and longitude  37030' East, and are at an altitude of about 700m above mean sea level. It
comprises the following villages: Chekereni, Kiterini, Mangaria, Utomovu, Mwangaria.
Villages aroulid the Soko irrigationi scheme have a total population of 3179 people. The main ethnic
groups in the scheme area are Wakahe, Wachaga, Wapare, and other smaller groLips. The majority of
these are agriculturalists. Few are livestock keepers. The land use in the adjacent villages of Soko is
mainly irrigation as well as rain-fed cultivation and grazing.
The source o fw ater for the Soko scheme is Soko springs that forms Soko River and which is later
joined by Dehis River to form one Soko River. Mean monthly flows in cumecs are higher in Nov/Dec
(0.465 m3/sec) and lowest in March/April/May/JUne/July (0.39, 0.36, 0.35, 0.35, 0.38).
Conflicts over water use have been recorded in the study area, especially in the dry season when river
flows are at the lowest.
With the improvement of irrigation structures and prospects for higher income earnings from irrigated
agricultire within reach, there is greater loyalty to the leadership of Water Associations. Since most of
the people are irrigators and members of the associations, the latter has greater influenlce beyond
irrigation matters.
The following are some of the positive effects:
*   Strengthened existing Water Users Association.
-Crop production has improved a great deal
*   Water availability has improved with more areas obtaining water than used to be in before
improvement.
*   Temporary employment opportunities were created during the construction phase.
*   Some farmers have attended on farm training and exchange visits to other areas to share
experience with other farmers as well as learning new skills.
A summary of identified impacts differentiated at up-stream, down-stream and within scheme levels
for resulting from Chapter 7 and appropriate mitigation measures are summarized in the Environimental
and Social Management Plan as follows:

In conclusion, it was found that the location of the scheme enhances sustainability of the scheme. This
is because the scheme is located near a rapidly growing minor township of Chekereni, as well as the
highway junction of Moshi -Mombasa -Tanga and Dar-es Salaam all of which provide mucIh trading
opportLinities. However, the short distance to the scheme itself (of about 4 km) is very rough, thence
Lindermining all that favourable situation mentioned above.
In order to minimize water and landuse conflicts, stakeholders of Pangani River Basin in general
should work together as partners to improve production and sustainable development of the watershed
management and the Soko's sustainable development.

1. BACKGROUND
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The Governmenit of Tanzania, through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security ( MA FS), has
undertaken various initiatives to improve the agriculture sector in the country. One of these initiatives
is the River Basin Management and Smaliholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP). The
Smaliholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC) is included within the scope of RBMSIIP.
RBMSIIP was developed in response to a water shortage crisis prevalent in many parts of the country.
Water demands often exceed available resources; this is especially true in the Pangani and Rufiji
basins.
Support to smallholder traditional irrigation improvement and rehabilitation is one of the major
components of this project. SlIC focuses on improving the management of water resources and crop
husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation schemes. This is achieved through, among other
things, the improvement of natural resources (land and water) during implementation of the
rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes.
The SIIC undertaking supports the objectives of the National Irrigation Development Plan (NIDP) that
was formulated and adopted in 1994. The plan includes a management and decision-making framework
that is based on the comprehensive ranking of schemes within each management unit (river or drainage
basin).
Under NIDP the order of priority for irrigation development is as follows:
*   Improvement/rehabilitation of Traditional Smallholder Irrigation Schemes:
*   Water Harvesting Technology;
*   Opening of New Smaliholder Schemes;
*   Large Scale Irrigation Schemes for Private Sector.
SIIC focuses on the improvement of water management in smallholder irrigation schemes to ensure the
sustainable use of land and water resources. Ultimately, SIIC aims to facilitate increases in crop yields
while minimizing environmental degradation. According to World Bank guidelines, the irrigation
schemes in the Rufiji and Pangani basins are classified as Category B. Under this category, no major
adverse environmental impacts are permitted and mitigation measures must be incorporated into the
scheme design, implementation and operation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC, a feasibility study was carried out that resulted in the preparation of
the Project Implementation Plan for 1996/97 - 2001/02. This plan, produced in October 1996, contains
an assessment of enviroinenital issues together with proposed environinental mitigation measures.
Under World Bank advisement, the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Security conducted an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) of the irrigation schemes. The
IEEs were u sed as the basis for t he S cheme Improvement A ssessment Stidies. T he c onsultants, i n
collaboration with ECU, have been charged to conduct environmental audits in seven Category B
sites: Ruanda Majenje, Igomelo, Mangalali, Nyamahana, Soko, Kambi ya Tanga, and Mahenge. An
additional site, Lemkuna, only required the development of an Environmental and Social Management
Plan. This report is focused on presenting the findings of the environmental audit that was conducted
for the Soko Irrigation Scheme.
This report draws heavily on intensive field observations by the study team. Discussions were held
with farmers and other local people, village and district officials, and project staff. A review of various
existing documents was also conducted in the preparation of this report.

1.2 UNDERSTANDING OF THE STUDY
1.2.1   Objective of the Study
The objective of the study is to get a better understanding of the present environmental conditions and
relevant i mpact a reas (environimental a Lidit) within the scheme. Increased a wareness will allow for
improved monitorinig of both negative and positive changes over time and will assist in the formulatioll
of niore effective mitigation measures. The environmental audit will also be the basis for the
preparation of an environmental and social management plan and monitorinlg system.
Specifically, the study will undertake the following:
*   Assess and quantify baseline environmental and social conditions
*   Assess and quantify environmental and social impacts
*   Conduct environmental audits in order to comply with existing Government of Tanzania and
World Bank environmental and safeguard policies
*   Prepare an environmental and social management plan
*   Develop an environmental and social management and monitoring systeim
*   Conduct public consultations
1.3 STRATEGIC APPROACH
The consultant's environmental audit of the Soko irrigation scheme was characterized by three
approaches: ecosystem, farming system and participatory. The basic approach of the stLidy is
illustrated in Figure 1-1.
1.3.1   Ecosystem Approach
In view of the fact that the project activities are wholly based in a rural area, potential conflicts
between the project and the e nvironment are likely to arise.  Thus, i ssues pertaining t o the use of
natural resources (e.g. livestock grazing, agriculture, irrigation, water source protection, agroforestry,
etc.) have to be studied.
In applying the ecosystem approach, the consultant not only focused on the Soko irrigationi scheme bLit
also on all the ecosystems upstream and down stream that impact the environmental and social
characteristics of the area. To accomplish this, the study sought an understanding of all activities
taking place within the irrigation scheme's water catchment area. River pollution, sedimentation, flash
floods, deforestation, destabilization of riverbanks, erosion, salinity, land degradation, and waterborne
diseases (among others) are all contributing to degradation of the catchment area. In suggesting
mitigation measures, sustainable practices for the use of water and land resources must be adopted to
prevent and control environimenltal and social problems.
1.3.2   Farming System Approach
Oii the irrigation scheme level, a farming system approach was used to describe and analyse
environmenital and socio-economic conditions. Issues related to soil contamination, water pollution,
the use and dangers of pesticides and fertilizers, health, and others have been identified. It is clear that
the irr igation activities will traiisform village life and the whole farming system in the Soko area.
The success of the proposed mitigating measures will, therefore, depend on commull1ty involvement,
improvement of the socio-ecoiiomic situation, capacity building, and proper upgrading, maintenance
and operation of the irrigation infrastructure. The latter should take into account the local environment
as well as the prevailing institutional, economic and social conditions.
1.3.3   Participatory Approach
A participatory approach was adopted in preparation for the environmental audit. This entailed seeking
informationi/experience from st akeholders (i.e. farmers, district a nd regional o fficers, R BMSIIP a nd
other institutions who have been involved in the project). In order to ensure effective participation and
2



cooperation it was necessary to inform stakeholders prior to the aLidit of the environmental and socio-
economic problems to be addressed. Their inputs have contributed to the development of more
realistic and appropriate mitigation measures.

1.4 METHODOLOGY
The methodology follows Tanzanian policy and legislation and the World Bank's policies on
environmental assessment (OP/BP 4.01 and related policies and guidance documents).
Available reference documnents were reviewed for pur1poses of identifying pertinent environmental and
social Issues. Information was obtained on the Soko irrigation scheme before and after construction as
well as during operation. Several meetings were held with SIIP project staff In particular, the ECU
team, which was involved in the Scheme Environmental Assessment, was consulted to discuss
background and potential issues. Subsequently, a ten-day field mission was conducted in August by
the study team and members of ECU. The team was used to: 1) complete further fieldwork at various
sites in the Soko irrigation scheme, 2) collect additional information, 3) work with the irrigation
scheme management team, and 4) to liaise with the various stakeholders includinig the district officials.
During the field visits, the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan for disseminating the results of the
Draft Environmental Audit were developed with the ECU staff.
1.4.1  Consultation
Public c onsultations t ook place i n two phases. The first phase t ook place d uring the E nvironmental
Audit (EA) preparation process. This initial stage allowed for the identification of the key
environmental issues and involved the gathering of information on stakeholder concerns and views of
potential environmental and social impacts. During the secondly phase, consultations allowed
stakeholders to review findings and give their comniiients.
1.4.2  Analytical Tools
The followiiig methodologies were applied in the process of the study:
*   Participatory data collection
*   Key informant interviews
*   Socio-economic and environmental analysis
*   Trend analysis of river flow and rainfall
*   Water and soil quality analysis
*   Geographical information systems (GIS)
Participatory Data Collection
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) involves problem analysis, ranking, proposal planning, role
assigning and timing. The role playing consisted of a facilitator who played the role of an advisor on
the d ifferent matters raised d uring the workshop ( those which t he team was not i nformed a bout or
aware of). In the final analysis, a Logical Framework Approach workshop (also known as ZOPP)
produced the Environmental Action Plan for the irrigation scheme.
Key Informant Interview
In addition to group discussions, information was also obtained from key informants. These were
generally staff from the Zonal Irrigation Office (ZIO), the District Executive Director (DED), farmers
of the Igomelo scheme, village officials (including village leaders), and others (agriculture and
irrigationi officers who are residents in the community). Any inconisistenit information was cross-
checked to ensure accLiracy. Various officials conducted the crosschecking of inforniatioii while
members of the study team facilitated the group discussiolIs.

Socio economic and Environmental Analysis
A total of 93 household questionnaire (sample size) have been administered using the random
sampling method. This represents.20 Percent of households of the study area (upstream, down stream
and scheme level) 80 percent approximately (80 questionnaires) of selected sample size has been
administered at Soko village (scheme level), where as 10 percent (10 questioninaires) has been
administered at Kiterini village (upstream village) and 10 percent (10 questionnaires) has been
administered at Mwangaria village (downstream village).
Quantitative data reiating to the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the scheme was
collected and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS ) software.
Trend Analysis of River Flow and Rainfall
An investigation was conducted upstream and downstream on rivers that feed the scheme. Both
statistical and visual interpretations of variability analysis were applied. To further reveal any existence
of severe abstraction or flow regime changes, variability analysis was done month to month. Any
possible causes for the change in the flow regime were quantified. In this regard, annual rainfall
variability for stations in or around the study area was noted. Three approaches were followed to tackle
the impacts problem:
*   Visual interpretation - Understanding and interpreting the annual time series and percent deviation
time series from the annual mean.
*   Testing randomness on the annual and monthly time series data - This test indicates that if the null
hypothesis tested for randomness is accepted, no flow regime change prevails in the record;
otherwise, it shows the flow regime is changed or there is a likely impact on the river upstream or
downstream.
*   Testing of breaks - At times a break or jump may be observed in the time series of flow. If, for
example, a huge volume of water is suddenly diverted to an irrigation area, segments before and
after the diversion can have different means.
Subsequent sections provide scheme level variability analysis and interpretation of the results for both
flow and rainfall.
The flow and rainfall data were collected from various sources. Rainfall data were collected partly from
Tanzania Meteorology Agency (TMA) and partly from the Ministry of Water and Livestock
Development (MWL). Flow data were partly collected from the Ministry of Water and Livestock
(MWL) and partly from previous reports.
Water and Soil Analysis
Water and soil samples were analysed at the laboratory of the Department of Environmental
Engineering, University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS) and Mlingano Soil
Laboratory. Procedures and analysis were done according to the Internationial Standards of Water and
Soil Analysis.
Geographical Information System (GIS)
Overlay maps and GIS were used to analyse sensitive/significant/relevanit features of the irrigation
scheme area. Attributes and features that were mapped and analysed included water bodies, land use
patterns, vegetation cover, and cultural structures. The technique involved the physical overlaying of
individual topographic maps to provide a composite pictire of the overall environmental and social
situation. Usiiig ArcView 3. 1, analysis was carried out to liik spatial and noni-spatial data.

1.5 LIMITATIONS
Data quantification proved a difficult exercise due to the following reasons:
(i)  There was insufficienit baseline data related to environmental and socio-economilic parameters.
(ii) Updated meteorological and hydrological data were not available.

2.1.2   History of the schleme
Soko schelme irrigations come from the folloiw ig villages: Soko. Kvomu. Mwangaria, Ngasmvi, Oria
and Kiteriani- Settlement in the area is said to ha e started osver 50 ears ago, while rice produLction
started in l 979s. After local commnunity efforts iltervention came in 1979 by constructing a concrete
structure During the internention the farmers contributes labour swhereas the government proOded
materials as *well as expertise.
2.1.3   Landuse patterns
The area is characterised bv three major land uses namelvy rain fed aoriculture irrigated agriculture
and livestock keeping. The farm size ranges from less than I acre to above 7 acres per hotusehold. And
the numuber of farms per household is shown respectively in the tables below.

Similar with some other irrigation schemes, residential areas of the Soko scheme are not far away from
the farms.
Potential irrigable area is estimated at 800ha while gross average size of farms for each farming
househlold per crop is (rice 0.4 - 0.8 ha) maize (0.2 - 0.4 ha) and bean (0.1 - 0.2 ha). Land for grazing
has been allocated/reserved Soko is not inhabited by pastoral communlities and so there is rarely land
disputer in this regard.
2.1.4   Land ownership/acquisition pattern
Field reports of studies conducted in 1997 showed that there are 93% owner farmers, 3% tenant
farmers, and 3% owner-tenant farmers where as the remaining 1% comprises of system structure.
Regarding land ownership, a majority of farmers (i.e. about 78%) own about only one to three farms,
and about 48% of their farn sizes are of 2 to 3 acres.
2.2 BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.2.1   Climatic Data
For thc Soko schenme, climatic data was collected and analysed based on station at Chekereni and at
TPC's Langasani station. based on similarity of topography, proximity of the station to the schenme area
and the length and continuity of the records.
Soko scheme lies in the marginal zone of the Kilimanjaro region where rainfall is erratic and
inadequate with annual rainfall varying between 400 to 800 mm. The rainfall pattern of t he area i s
characterized by bi-modal distribution with heavy rain falling between March and May and the light
rains between November and January. The mean temperature varies from 20 to 25 throughout the year.
The climatic data for Soko scheme was taken from stations close to the project area.

2.2.2   Water Resources
The source of water for Soko scheme is Soko springs which form Soko river, which later joins with
Dehu river to form one river Soko river runs the whole year round unless at critical drought where the
water levels decreases. No history of flow measurement was found for Soko spring except 12 mean
monthly flows obtained from Kilimanjaro Region Water Master Plan. Table... shows the flows as
obtained fi-om the Master plan study. The spring serves for both irrigation and domestic water supply
for Soko village, Kyomu and Kiterini village the intake is located at Mwangaru Soko village. The water
righit of the scheme is 200 I/s. which means according to Table 7.4 There is no water shortage for the
scheme as far as water availability is concerned.

The primary source of water for irrigation system of the Soko ir-igation scheme is the Soko spring. The
water quality of the system is good for irrigation.
Water Distribution
Due to poor levelling on farms water stagnates leading to poor distribution.
Water use conflict
The nature of the water use conflict at the Soko scheme is that it is apparentiy inadequate to suf fice
demand of the users
Domestic water supply
Although the village has no water supply systems to the villager's water for domestic use is not a
problem since they have other sources of water such as rivers and springs. Distance for domestic water
points is depicted in the table.

There are 2 public primary schools within the scheme area, but it caters mainly for pupils both outside
and inside the scheme.
There is a one small dispensary which is located in Kyomu village, the dispensary don't have all the
necessary facilities like microscope so sometimes people have to go to Himo or Mawenzi hospital in
Moshi MLnicipality. Common diseases in the villages according o the dispensary doctor are shown in
the following table below:

Generally speaking, farmers in Soko area lack adequate social services in the vicinity of the scheme
area. Sanitation in Soko village is generally of moderate quality due to existing urban-like
characteristics. They use traditional latrines, which do not have adequate roofing, and have poorly
constructed walls.
Energy Supply
At about 95.6 % of use fuel-wood and charcoal are by far the main sources of energy for cooking. In
view of absence of woodlands in the vicinity of human settlements, availability of wood fuel is a major
problem. There are traders selling charcoal in the area apparently because charcoal is considered to be
relatively more conduciveto usethan firewood, although relatively more expensive. Availability of
energy resources and stoves Lised in the scheme area are shown in the tables below

Extension Services
The farners enjoy extension services. Villagers are advised on the type of fertilisers to use, depending
on the type of crops they are planting and on the type of pesticides.

There has been some continuous tension and conflict between the farmers over distribution of water.
Social Capital
Irrigators association, Umwagiliaji Soko Rural Primary Co-operative Society (UWASO) have been
managing the scheme.

3. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND STAKEHOLDER
3.1 JAPAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY
The agency has been supporting an irrigation project at Chekereni village for many years.
3.2 NGOs
There are more than 45 other NGOs who are supporting health, education, agriculture, and etc. projects
in the area in particular in the downstream of the scheme. The NGOs which have participated fully in
the past three years in implementing various developmental and service delivery activities are:
*   Kiliman.jaro joint action - Pamoja
*   Environmental and human right care organization - Envirocare
*   Bramton Tanzania trust - BTT
*   Himo environmental management project - Hem Trust Fund
*   Community management of protected areas conservation prqject - COMPACT
3.3 COMMUNITY BASED INITIATIVES
The scheme is managed by an Irrigators cooperative society, namely Umwagiliaji Soko Rural Primary
Co-Operative Society (UWASO). UWASO was registered in 1998 with registration number KLR 522.
The specific function of UWASO includes ensuring regular and equitable distribution of irrigation
water to all farmers in their farm/plots and maintenance.
Membership is open to anyone provided he/she has a plot in the irrigation scheme area, he/she is 18
years of age or more, is mentally fit and is willing to pay various UWASO contributions such as
registration fees of 1500 Tshs, annual fees 1000 Tshs and buy at least one share each worth Tshs 1000
Tshs. Currently there are 149 already registered members out of 315 expected members. The
organization structure is presented below.

executive committee includes the Chairperson, vice chair person and secretary, it comprise three sub
committee, which are planning and finance, construction, operation and maintenance and the third one
is training, agriculture and environment. The members of executive committee were elected from 5
villages involves in the scheme whereby Soko, Kiterini and Kyomo were represented by 3 members,
Oria and Ngasini 2 members. The main execLitive committee recruits accoulitanit.
3.4 STAKEHOLDER'S ROLE
3.4.1   Identified stakeholders
In order of vested powers in decision-making roles enforcement the identified stakeholders are as
follows:
*   District Council's i.e., through the District Executive, Director (DED) with his/her- relevant
committee and functional officers e.g. District Agricultural and Livestock Development Officer
(DALDO), District Water Engineer, District Council Development office, etc.
*   Ward Executive Officers i.e., through the Ward Executive Officers (WEO) with their relevant
committee and functional offices, e.g. Ward Agricultural Officer.
*   Village Executive Officer i.e. through the village Executive Officers (VEO) with their relevant
committee and functional officer e.g. Village Agricultural Officer.
*   Water users association.
   Farmers' groups/associations.
*   Private organization, e.g. NGOs, CBOs, etc
*   Donors
3.4.2   Analysis of stakeholders
In general for sake of sustainability influential role of all the identified stakeholders is synergetic. For
example, at the highest level, the District Council chaired by the council chairman/woman with all its
relevant committees and functional officers has to be fully involved so that they can put in their agenda
and plans financial issues of the scheme. In that way further development of the scheme will get both
the support and the authority it requires.
Likewise even at the lowest level (i.e. at village government/farmers associations level) the
stakeholders need to be fully involved because being at grass-roots, they are capable of providing
solution on a routine bases.
3.4.3   Involvement of stakeholders in environmental audit and implementation of ESMP
In view of the above therefore different stakeholders were and will be involved in environmental
auditing and implementation of ESMP as follows:
Water users association
Managing water resources within schemes
Farmers associations/groups
Carrying out routine activities/controlling actions
Identifying/formulating required action to VEO.
Saving and credit organisations.
Village Executive Office (VEO)
Grass-roots representation of local government system.
Mobilizes, receives, identified required action and forwards them to WEO for considerations.
Ward Executive Officer (WEO)
Grass roots representative of local government system.Mobilizes, receives checks and controls
identified required action and forwards them to District Council (through relevant its committees).
22



District Council
District development planning.
Mobilizes, receives and deliberates identified required action and incorporates  them into the district
development plan for financing.
Finance/overseas implementation of the identified actions.
Private Organization/NGOs/CBOs
Promotes identification and implementation of identified action.
Helps to secure funding of the actions.
Donor agency
Promotes development cooperation.
Finances/overseas implementation of action plans
3.4.4   Ensuring incorporation of concern of stakeholders in ESMP
In order to ensure the concern of stakeholders are incorporated in ESMP, it is proposed that the
following measures be taken after finalization/submission of the ESMP:
Seeking government approval of ESMP
This government approval of ESMP is imperative because the councils are not allowed to implement a
plan unknown to the government. Under these circumstances the ESMP has to be approved firstly by
MAFS, NEMC and then by PO-RALG.
Dissemination of the ESMP to relevant district
After government approval, then the ESMP should be disseminated to relevant district for
implementation. This should be followed by a series of workshops, seminar, etc. to enable public
discussion on the ESMP. The discussion should start at district level then percolate to lower and lower
levels as indicated above.
23



4.       COMPLIANCE WITH TANZANIA'S POLICIES, LEGAL
FRAMEWORK AND WITH WORLD BANK'S SAFE
GUARD POLICIES
4.1     NATIONAL POLICIES
Relevant p olicies with a bearing on agricultiral and rural development in general, and irrigation in
particular, and therefore Soko irrigation scheme, have been examined. These include the National
Environment policy, the Land policy, the National Water policy, the Energy policy, the National
Agriculture policy, Draft Rural Development Policy, Poverty Reduction Strategy, Draft Rural
Development Strategy, Agriculture Sector Development Strategy, the Forest policy and the Wildlife
policy. These policies affect direct key sectoral activities and were examined because they
automatically affect important land uses in the area viz: agriculture, water, livestock, energy, forest
and wildlife.
4.1.1   National Environment Policy of 1997
Implementation of the river basin management and smallholder irrigation project and particularly the
irrigation schenmes under operation is consistent with the overall objectives of the National
Environment Policy. The policy provides a framework for multi-sectoral participation and cooperation
to achieve sustainable development; and seeks to ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources for
meeting the basic needs of present and future generations, without degrading the environmental
resource base or risking health and safety. The policy emphasize the need to prevent and control
degradation of land, water, vegetation and air which constitute our life support systems; to conserve
and enhance our natural and man made heritage; including biological diversity; to improve the
condition and productivity of degraded areas including rural and urban settlements; to raise public
awareness and understanding of the essential linkages between environment and development and
promote individual and community participation in environmental action, among others.
Furthermore the policy calls for improved agricultural practices, and better utilization of the scarce
water for irrigation, ensure efficiency, minimize looses and avoid salinisation as well as proper use of
agrochemicals to minimize reduce/pollution of water sources.
The design, re-construction and operation of the schemes have taken into accounlt the above
considerations. Additionally, planiied training of farmers in effective and efficient management of
water resources intends to contribute to achievement of the objectives of the environmenit policy.
4.1.2   Agriculture Policy 1997
The implementation of the RBM-SIIP on the basis of farmer groups and rural community participation
is consistent with the Agricultural and Livestock Policy (ALP) of 1997, which provides policy
guidance on the development of the agricultural sector. The policy seeks to ensure that the direction
and pattern o fd evelopment in the sector meets economic, social and environmental objectives The
policy aims at accelerated growth of production and exports through among others, assuring national
food security, developing and introducing new technologies which will increase productivity of labour
and land; promote integrated and sustainable use and management of natural resources and providing
agricultural support services.
The smallholder irrigation projects aims at providing agricultural support services; improve income of
the rural poor, promote rational use of water resources and introdtice appropriate technologies among
others.
4.1.3   Land Policy of 1995
The N ational L and Policy of 1995 p rovides i ncentives for e fficient Li se o f land and its resources. I t
seeks to promote and ensure a secure land tenure system, encourage optimal use of land resources and
facilitate broad-based social and economic development without up setting or endangering the
24



ecological balance of the environment. Farmer groups and communities participating in the project
have acquired customary rights of occupancy from their respective villages and some villages are
processing granted rights. Both granted and customary rights of occupancy secure land ownership, add
incentives for farmers to maintain and develop their farms accordingly, reduces land use conflicts and
increase the value of land.
4.1.4   Water Policy of 2002
The National Water Policy (2002) provides a comprehenisive framework for promoting optimal,
sustainiable and equitable development and use of water resources for sustainable development. The
policy seeks to ensure supply of good quality of water to meet domestic, environmental and other
priority development purpose. Emphasis is placed on the need to ensure more efficient Litilizationi of
existing water resources througIl institutional improvements, proper soil management to prevent soil
erosion and flooding and improved monitoring to control water quality and contamination from
industrial sewerage and excessive Llse of pesticides and fertilizers. These objectives requite on
integrated and holistic planning and management in areas, water use and disposal of effluents. The
planned project objectives are supportive of the objectives of the water policy through education,
awareness and training on better agricultural practices, effective and efficient utilization of water, water
conservation, and application o f agrochemicals t o m inimize pollution o f w ater sources t o m ention a
few.
4.1.5   Forest Policy of 1998
The main objective of the National Forestry Policy is to enhance contribution of the forestry sector in
sustainable socio-economic development of the country, as well as conservation and management of
the natural resource-base for the benefit of both the represent and future generations. In view of the
general objective, the policy focuses its intervention in the following four area (i) forest land
management
Conservation of the forestry resources in the upper catchment is crucial for ensuring sustainable flows
of water for irrigation purposes and other uses. The establishment of the scheme is thus an extra
incentive for undertaking conservation measures in the catchment area of Mt. Meru.
4.1.6   Wildlife Policy of 1998
The main Wildlife Policy is to seek involvement of a broader section of the society in wildlife
conservation, and in particular the rural local communities, as well as the private sector with only a
role of stimulating and duly guiding both the rural local communities and the private sector by
administering, r egulating a nd p romoting management of wildlife r esources. I n view of t his general
objective, the policy facilities it interventions in the following area: (i) wildlife protection (i.e.
incorporating management and development of protected areas) (ii) wildlife utilization (i.e.
incorporating promotion of establishment of Wildlife Management Areas conservation as well as
management measures and (iii) international corporation and coordination. Within the scheme there
are no wildlife management areas. The developments have also concentrated on the already existing
scheme, with therefore little likelihood of encroaching into wildlife areas.
4.1.7   Energy Policy of 2002 (Draft)
Sufficient aiid efficient supply of energy is crucial for national development. The objective of the
energy policy is therefore to contribute to the national socio-economic development process by
providing an efficient energy production, procurement, transportation, distribution and end-use system
in an environmentally sound manner and with due regard to gender issues.
Provision of energy for scheme farmers in a convenient manner will allow more time for women
farmers to participate in farm activities. It is against this background that commLinities are being
encouraged to use fuel-efficient charcoal and wood stoves.
25



4.2 LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The smaliholder irrigation project will be implemented in the overall context legal framework that
governs agricultural and rural development. Some of the few legal frameworks that are supportive of
the project inclLide but not limited to: -
4.2.1   Environment Legislation
Currently Tanzania lacks a single comprehensive environmental legal framework or environmental
law. Efforts are uliderway to prepare such a framework. To-date, the management of environmenit and
natural resources is governed by fragmented sectoral pieces of legislation that are yet to be fully
harmonized.
There are some guidelines on1 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Government is
working on an act to make ElAs mandatory for all development projects. In this regard an
environmental legislation aimed at "promoting and managing environmental conservation in the
country" is in the making
The ten-n "environmental" legislation incorporates nearly one hundred acts and ordinances and several
additional subsidiary legislation from all sectors of the economy, which affect the environment.
However, given the broad policy goal of achieving sustainable development and the specific policy
objectives, issues of unsustainable utilization of resources, deforestation, desertification, salinization,
land degradation, pollution of water resources, and impacts on rural land use have been emphasized.
The design and operational strategy oft he S oko scheme have taken these I egal c onsiderations i nto
account.
4.2.2  NEMC Act no.19 of 1983
This act establishes the National Environnment Management Council as a statutory body responsible for
advising and coordinating environmental management issues. Among the many functionis of the
Council, the act seeks to provide a framework for evaluation of existing and proposed development
policies, programmes, plans and activities of both public and private that are likely to affect the
environment and recommend measures to ensure adequate account of environmental effects.
Furthermore, the act provides for the specification of environmental standards, norms, criteria,
guidelines for the protection and maintenance of the quality of the environment, cooperation between
government, local authorities and bodies engaged in environmental programmes and stimLulate public
and private participation in environmental and natural resource management.
Relevant legislation pertaining to agricultural development in general, and irrigation in particular, and
how it relates to the proposed projects, including Soko irrigation scheme was examined. The following
are the sectoral environment legislations.
4.2.3   Land Act no.4 and Village Land Act no. 5 of 1999
Both laws became operational in May 2001, following the approval of their regulations. The acts seek
control land use and clarify controversial issues pertaining to ownership of land and land-based
resources, transactions on land and land administration. The new land act identifies three categories of
land i.e. village (customary land); public/gazetted land (i.e. national parks, forest reserves) and general
land that does not fall in any of the above two categories for private investment.
Implementation of the project is consistent with both legislations. For purposes of controlling land in
the village and to protect it from alienation to foreign investors, village governments would be given
documents indicating their boundaries. However, in order to give value to land there is a need for
26



completion of the process of land survey and demarcation which amounts to land titling and allocation
to different land use categories to speed up investment in agriculture.
Land allocation at the Soko scheme was guided by existing land tenure arrangements which are in line
with these legal provisions. Both men and women have received irrigation plots.
4.2.3   Wildlife Act 1974 (with amendments of 1978)
Wildlife act provides for protection, conservation, development, regulations and control in both
acqLuisition and utilization of products of both fauna and flora. To this end, therefore the Act stipulates
"modus operandi", i.e. required restrictions in the following areas (i) in protected areas: namely game
reserves, game controlled areas, partial game reserves, national parks, etc. (ii) proper procedures in
hunting, capturing and photographing of wildlife and (iii) proper handling of trophies. Furthermore, in
the wake of the Wildlife policy, which stipulates for villagers' involvement in Wildlife Management
Areas (WMA), the Act also provides modalities and procedures for designation, operation and
involvement of local communities in the management of the WMAs. Within the scheme there are no
wildlife management areas.
4.2.4   Water Acts of 1974
As mentionied before the Water Acts principally seek to ensure that water is utilized without sectoral
conflicts, and without catising pollution. This is the spirit of both Act no. 42 of 1974 and Act no. 10 of
1981. They were enacted to control and protect water resources. The legislation defines "water" as all
water flowing over the surface of the ground or contained or flowing in or from a spring or stream or
natural lake, swamp or beneath a watercourse. The Act places a regime of water rights to govern
access to water use. Pollution control norms and standards are embodied in the water rights.
Apart from incorporating pollution control and having prevention conditionality in the water rights,
the Act goes a step further by putting in place a regime in consent with discharge of effluent. Under
Section 15 A (1) of the Act, no person may discharge of effluent from any commercial, industrial or
other trade waste systems into receiving waters without a consent duly granted by a Water Officer.
The Act also contains two schedules, which set standards for receiving waters and effluent. The Soko
irrigation has a water right in which the rights and obligations of scheme operators, the farmers, are
stipulated.
4.2.5   Forest Act 1974
The Forest Act deals with the protection of forests and forest products in forest reserves and
restrictions and prohibitions in forest reserves. The forest management plans are administered under
the Forest Ordinance (1957). Any contravention of the restrictions and prohibition is considered an
offence under this ordinance and subject to enforcement. However, the law is being revised to meet
new requirements tinder a new Forest Policy. There is no forest land within the scheme area.
4.2.6   The Town and Country Planning Ordinance, Cap 378 of 1956
The Town and Country Planning Ordinance Cap 378, Part IV provides for control of urban
development while implementing a scheme of land development. Important aspects include the
designationi and allocation o f adequate land for solid w aste disposal in a ny u rban scheme. The law
further stipulates the design of a good sewerage system to manage liquid waste from various major
water consumers. The law empowers local authorities to enforce such schemes and punishments as
stipulated in the Act. The law further empowers neighbours and any individual to take to court anyone
who injuriously affects others due to his/her unhygienic activities. The Water Users' Association at the
scheme m ay pass by-laws t o t his e ffect. H owever, t hey would need su pport from I ocal a uthorities,
particularly with regard to enforcement.
4.2.7   Local Government Act (District and Urban Authorities) Acts of 1982
This Act provides detailed responsibility for urban and district councils in the administration of their
day-to-day activities. Waste management is pointed out as one of the activities to be managed by
urban authorities. This Act is the backboiie of the Village Government's operation, powers,
27



responsibilities of various local authorities and structure. The law requires that the Village Assemblies
act as the apex authorities in decision-making processes at the village level. However, such meetings
rarely take place in most villages, leaving decisions to be made by few leaders without having
consulted with the village public. This being the case, many Village Governments fail to bring about
development for their villagers.
4.2.8   Land Use Planning Commission Act of 1984
The National Land Use Commission (NLUC) was established under this Act as the principal advisory
organ of the Government on all matters related to land use. Among other things, it recommends
measures to ensure that the Government policies, including those for development and conservation of
land are in harmony. It also takes adequate account of their effects on land use and seeks for the
advancement of scientific knowledge of changes in land use; it encourages the development of
technology to prevent, or minimize adverse effects that endanger man's health and his/her welfare; it
also specifies standards, norms and criteria for the protection of beneficial uses and the maintenance of
the quality of the land.
In accordance with the functions mentioned above, the Commission can indirectly help to prevent or
minimize pollution by restricting location of potential and actual pollution sources. The major issue is
the sectoralisation of the Government's operations while neglecting holistic view of each activity on
land and their impacts on others. There is a tendency of each sector making decisions without
consulting t he others. For e xample, W ildlife Division c an d esignate a n a rea for game conservation
without consulting the Agriculture and Food Security Divisions to avoid grabbing land for agriculture
activities.
The Soko scheme is included in the National Irrigation Development Plan that has been officially
adopted by the Government.
4.2.9  The Land Acquisitions Act of 1967
The Land Acquisition Act gives powerstothe Presidenttotake"land" from private occupants for
public purposes when the public's interests to do so. The new Land laws declare all land in Tanzania
as "Public Land" and vested to the President as trustee of all citizens. However, the Land Acquisition
law has been watered down by the New Land Laws, which restrict the President's powers not to
acquire land without negotiation with the owners. Again the new laws stipulate detailed
compensations to be paid on any acquired land that amounts to deterring the President to do so without
careful considerationis.
4.2.10 By-Laws
All villages in Tanzania are allowed to form by-laws. This has been done in Soko village whose by-
laws address proper use of land and water to ensure public health.
4.3 NATIONAL STRATEGIES
In order to guide national development more effectively and systematically, Tanzania has prepared a
number of strategies aiming at operationalizing the various policies in key sectors. Some of the
strategies that have a bearing on irrigation development and discussed below include: the Government
Vision 2025, Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Rural Sector Development Strategy and the
Agricultural Sector Development Strategy.
4.3.1  Government Development Vision 2025
The Government Development Policy 2025 is guiding framework for national development to the year
2025. It aims at achieving a high quality livelihood for the people, characterized by su stainable and
equitable growth. It also aims at attaining good governance through the rule of law and at developing a
strong and competitive economy by moving from a less developed country (LDC) to a middle-income
country by 2025.
28



Scheme irrigation committees and water users' associations are potential ucIClei for promoting good
governance and democratic practices in rural villages. By adhering to common practices and cropping
patterins, farmers will realize more or less equal and higher incomes.
4.3.2   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of 2000
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) concentrates on efforts aimed reduicing income poverty;
improving humani capabilities, survival and social well-being. The PRSP has set medium term goals to
be achieved bythe year 2010 through sustaining macroeconomic stability, rural sector developmient
and export, and private sector development.
Improvement of food supply and security is key to infant and maternity health as well as to income
generation. A number of activities, including construction and consultancy services have been
performed by the private sector. This has contributed to local capacity building.
4.3.3   Rural Sector Development Strategy (RDS) of 2000
The Strategy aims at reducing rural poverty as means of managing resources sustainably, since
widespread poverty i n rural areas compels people, in search for survival, to o ver-exploit the n atural
resources. The RDS envisages the following:
*   Revising legislation and regulations with a view to enhancing community participation in
management and utilization of natural resources.
*   Revising the licensing procedures related to utilization of natural resources.
*   Introducing procedures for cost and benefit sharing of natural resoLirces.
*   Introducing EIA as a pre-requisite for all development projects.
.   Developing procedures for natural resources with regard to entitlement of the state, communities
and individuals.
*   Developing procedures for conflict resolution in matters of natural resources utilization.
The Soko scheme will contribute to the principle objective of the RDS of poverty reduction through
raising incomes and better resource utilization. The work ofthe water users' association iivolves a
number of elements targeted by the Strategy.
4.3.4  Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) of 2001
The ASDS, which was formulated through a broad based consultative process, aims at transforming the
agricultural sector into a m odernized, commercial, highly productive and profitable sector that sh all
utilize natural resources in a sustainable manner and shall act as an effective basis for i ntersectoral
linkages.
The ASDS will address the key weaknesses facing the agricultural sector, which include low
productivity, poor coordination and limited capacity, underdeveloped supporting facilities, erosion of
the natural resource base, inappropriate technology, dependency on rainfed agriculture, impediments to
food market access as well as low public and private expenditure levels.
The investments and other interventions made in improving the irrigation system at Soko are highly
relevant and well in line with the targets of the ASDS. These improvements will contribute to higher
productivity, income generation, better water and land utilization, all of whichi are targets of the
Strategy.
4.4 COMPLIANCE WITH WORLD BANK SAFEGUARD
POLICIES
A list of World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies is listed in Appendix 3. This part of
the report contains an analysis of the compliance of the Soko scheme with the Bank Safeguard policies.
It is based o n i ntensive field observation b y t he study team, coupled w ith discussions h eld with the
29



farmiers and other local people, including village and district officials as well as project staff. The report
is also based on the review of various existing documents.
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)
In order to ascertain that project proposals submitted for funding are environmentally sound and
sustainable, the World Bank requires that Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposals be carried
out. An Environmental Assessment (EA) of Soko Scheme was carried out as part of the overall base
line study of the scheme. The assessment also built on the work done earlier by the Environmental Cell
Unit (ECU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.
In view of the present day nature of activities at the scheme, it was found that the scheme can not bring
about adverse environmental impacts, and that depending on proper handling of several factors, e.g.
land tenure issues, it's sustainability may also be ensured.
The findings of the study were discussed with, farmers as well as local community leaders at meetings
held at the scheme and also with district officials at their district headquarters. Their opinions and ideas
were taken into account in finalising the Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan.
From the above-mentioned observation the Soko Irrigation Scheme is considered to be in compliance
with the Bank Environmental Assessment.
Natural Habitat (OP/BP 4.04)
Soko irrigation scheme is a relatively a newly established scheme. It has only recently been
rehabilitated and improved. It expansion is restricted on all four sides in an extensively cultivated area.
There are therefore no neighbouring natural habitats that require protection and conservation. The
scheme does not therefore trigger the Natural Habitat safeguard policy of the World Bank.
Pest Management (OP 4.09)
Use of pesticides at the Soko scheme is currently at low level. The farmers, through the extension
service, are encouraged to a pply I PM approaches. F armers are also trained o n safe use, storage and
disposal of chemicals. These efforts will lead to greater compliance with the Integrated Pest
Management policy of the World Bank, than present day situation.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
As menitioned above, Soko is a relatively newly established scheme and has only recently been
rehabilitated. The farmers have been living in the area originally for the purpose of practising livestock
rearing, however with introduction o f irrigation agriculture, they a Iso took it up in order to increase
their incomes .The place was originally only bush land. There were therefore no resettlements carried
out. The scheme does not, therefore, trigger the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard policy of the
World Bank.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)
Again in historical terms, the scheme was originally only pastoralists' area of operation. At the time of
initial settlement there were no indigenous people in the area. Presently people of various ethnic origins
belonging to the neighbouring Arusha ,Kilimanjaro, Singida and Tanga regions habitat the area , for
example: Wapare, Wanyiramba, Wanyaturu, Wachaga e.t.c.lf. They are presently permanently settled
in the area, and in response to the questionnaire, no household indicated plans to move away.
In view of the above, it is evident that project activities at Soko would not trigger the indigenous policy
of the World Bank.
Forests (OP/BP 4.36)
Neither the up-stream nor the down-stream areas of the scheme have forested areas which may be
adversely impacted by project activities of the scheme. For this reason, project activities at the scheme
may not trigger the World Bank's safe guard policy on Forests.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37)
There are presently no dams, and moreover none are under consideration at Soko irrigation scheme.
The schenme does not therefore trigger this safe guard policy of the World Bank.
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03 - draft OP 4.11)
30



The scheme does not have niovable or immovable objects, sites, natuial features aiid landscapes that hlave
archaeological, palaeontological, historical, architectural, religious, aesthetic, or cultural significance. Therefore.
the scheme does not trigger this safeguard policy.
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50)
The scheme is using Soko springs fiom whicih there arises the Soko River and which does not flow to other states.
The schemile does not therefore trigger this safeguard policy.
Project in Disputed Areas (OP/BP 7.60)
The scheme does not operate in disputed areas and it does not therefore trigger this safeguard policy.
Consultation and Disclosure Requirements (BP 17.50)
The findings of study and recommendations have been discussed with farmers' representatives at the
scheme. They endorsed the findings and recommendations. The Environmental Audit report will be
submitted to the relevant government authorities for review and approval prior to the disclosure
through newspapers, district offices, MAFS, and governmenit websites.

5.0 TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES USED IN ASSESSING AND
ANALYSINGENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
5.1 INTRODUCTION
There are several tools and techniques recommended predication for environmenital and social nipacts
as follows:
*   Checklists
*   Interactioon matrixes
*   Network
*   Geographical Information System
*   Mathematical modelling
In undertaking the assignment, the following tools aiid teciniques were applied for assessing aiid
analysing of environmental and social impacts of the irrigation scheme in the process of the EA study:
Checklist
The environmental checklist is used for physical observations in the assessment of the irrigation
scheme.
Geographical information system (GIS)
GIS has been used in analysing hydrological changes and trends in water quality and soil study of the
irrigation scheme.
5.2 IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Impact assessment is a complex activity and is mainly based and depends on range and type of baseline
date. Depending on available baseline data mainly techniques can be applied to study this for example
the following:
*   Mathematical models (such as groundwater and river models, noise propagation models, air and
water dispersion models, income multipliers)
*   Physical models (such as hydrological models for trend analysis, wind tunnels and hydraulic
models for estuaries)
*   Scientific experience, judgment and observations
*   Structured/semi-structured approaches (e.g. changes in landscape and social impacts)
Most EA use a mixture of these techniques - many appear to rely heavily on the latter two. Impacts
analysis and assessment must also provide information on the following aspects:
*   Duration (time period over which they will occur)
   Likelihood or probability of occurrence (very likely or unlikely, etc.)
*   Reversibility (natural recovery or aided by human intervention)
*   Area affected (size and whether near or far from the project)
*   NLmber (and characteristics) of people likely to be affected and their locations
*   Transboundary aspects - do impacts cross-national borders?
Due to lack of baseline data and time constraints the consultant was not able to condLuct impact
assessment based on mathematical and physical models for the environment audit. For environmenital
and social impacts structured/semi-structured approaches, focused group discussions, scientific
experience, observations and judgment and GIS were used to quantify and evaluate impacts.

6.0 CONSULTATIONS WITH COMMUNITY AND FARMERS
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Meeting
During the environmental auditing meetings held at district level village at scheme level, at the village
level the government leaders or the irrigator's association leaders participated in the meetings. The
major aim of this meetings include the brief purpose of the environmental auditing, but also to
understand the District Development Plan how it has tackled environmental at social issue in the
irrigation scheme, while at the village level the major aim was not only to brief on the purpose of the
environmental audit but to understand the major environmental and social problems and how to
mitigate them.
On the 27'h August, the Moshi district office was visited and the team managed to meet the Assistant
District Director, who also discussed with us their District Development plans and budget.
Focused Group discussion
While in Soko Irrigation scheme which was conducted on 27th August, the focus group discussion, was
done for three group, that is for youth, men and women. The combined major problems, which faced
all members of the scheme, are part of this discussioni.
Participants
Likewise in the Soko irrigation scheme men, women and youth were (34) thirty-four.
6.2 MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES
IDENTIFIED BY STAKEHOLDERS
Erosion at canal banks
The scheme is facing erosion problem near the canal banks. This is because of the unlined canals, thLis
the effects are destruction of the canals.
Conflicts
The scheme consist livestock keeper and farmers, livestock mostly enters the field searching for water,
but also this scheme has no any watering points for the livestock's in turn there is destruction of
infrastructures.
Destruction of farm roads
This problem  is caused by lack of maintenance; hence the roads are difficulties in production,
transportation to and from the field.
Lack of capital
This scheme do not have any credit and saving institutions hence they experience low production by
not using improved seeds, chemicals etc.
Leadership problem
The scheme has also leadership problem because the leaders are not accountable, hence there is no any
meeting held for solving problems.
High seepage
There is high seepage due to unlined canals but also the drain canals is very near and lower than the
irrigated plots. The effects include insufficient amount of water in the fields.
Water pollution
Washing and bathing in the canals and rivers causes the pollution in this schenme, and the effects has
increased water related diseases. The villagers agreed to enforce their existing by laws, which will be
implemented by the farmers and the executive committee.
Vegetation at canals
33



This is caused neglecting in cleaning of the canal and it has reduced the water flow in the canal.
6.2 MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
IDENTIFIED BY STAKEHOLDERS: WOMEN DISCUSSIONS
Unreliable source of domestic water
The scheme has no domestic water sources in some of it's villages, This problem has increased water
related diseases; example typhoid, amoeba, schistomisis etc. The farmers requested to be provided
reliable source of safe and clean water.
Lack of proper road
The scheme is facing difficulties on transportation of their inputs and products in and oit of the
scheme, which also increase the cost of production.
Deepened of canals
This has reduced crop per unit area and they need the canals to be lined.
Lack of market
There is a big problem of marketbecausetheroads are notaccessiblethroughout the yearthis has
created low income to most women.
Lack of agriculture inputs
There is no any source of agricultural inputs in the scheme area, but also if available are very expensive
for farmers to buy. This has created low agricultural produce.
Lack of energy source
In this scheme there are fire wood problems due to the deforestation practices taking place, which has
created wind, too much time is consumed for collection fire wood and has reduce rainfall.
Major environmental and social impacts identified by stakeholders: Men discussions
Water related diseases
There is no reliable water source for domestic use, which is clean and safe, this has created diseases
such as typhoid, cholera and malaria.
Low production
There is unreliable source of input supply and hence create low income to farmers. However they
suggest establishing local SACCOs.
Lack of roads
The roads in this scheme need to be constructed, this situation has increased production cost to go high.
Main canal drain flow back to the fields
This is problem is associated with a technical problem during the construCtion which has create floods
to the fields.
Uneven distribution of water
The fields are not well leveled and create loss of water unnecessary therefore there is too much
abstraction of water from the upstream users in turn there is low production and low income.
Participatory environmental action plan developed by farmers during focus group discussions is
presented in Appendix 3.

7.0 IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Key environmental and social issues/inlpacts identified for the Soko Irrigation Scheme were based on
the following sources: field observations, lEE reports of 1998, and focus group discussions. Table 7.1
presents a summary of the issues that are considered pertinent and significant now and in the future.

This chapter presents a brief description of identified environmental and social impacts for improving
the Soko Irrigation Scheme. The impacts are based on changes, which have or are expected to occur,
prior or post improvement of the scheme. Attempts have been made to indicate both positive as well as
negative impacts, but forthe sake of preparing an effective Environmental and Social Management
Plan (ESMP), negative impacts have featured more than positive impacts. The impacts may also be
categorized (based on localities) as follows:
*   Upstream and downstream impacts
*   Scheme level impacts
7.2 UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS
7.2.1   Demographic trends (population changes)
Statistics from the 1988 census indicate that a total of 9392 people were present in the scheme area.
The recent census report of 2002 shows an increase of population to a new figure of 17,458. However,
in the actual village of Soko there has been a decrease in the population from 1351 to 667. The decline
is apparently due to migration to other villages in the ward. Table 7.2 shows the population trend in the
1988 census.

7.2.2   Hydrological changes
Water extractions from sprinigs do have an impact on the overall water availability and quality for
irrigation and other uses downstream.  Therefore, extraction activities at the springs must be
considered.
Two springs which join and form the Soko River are located in Ghona Village. The life of the Soko
scheme depends so much on the availability of water in these springs. There is a danger of the scheme
running short of water due to interference of the springs in the village. This is because people in the
village make use of the springs right at the source. According to the villagers, there are no alternative
sources of water for domestic as well as for livestock use.
Two competing irrigation schemes are located upstream of Soko scheme. They are Kyomu A and
Kyomui B. Soko scheme experiences a water shortage in the month of October.
Discussions revealed that the whole reach of the stream is covered with tall grasses. The grasses are
encroaching over the weir top.  While the grasses may increase overall loss of water through
evaporation, it has been found useful in two ways: 1) as a sediment trapping mechanism for the
schemes, and 2) as a roofing material.
Hydrological flow regime change due to backwater effect
The main drainage canal appears to have zero or negative slope; hence there is always backwater flow
from Soko and Dehu streams, especially during the rainy season. Durinig high flood times, the Soko
River floods the a djacent S oko v illage. So far, the flooding h as n ot b een c atastrophic; however, the
irrigation engineer feels that if another high flood comes, it may cause damage to village property.
7.2.3   Catchment degradation
A topographical map of 1982 indicates that both upstream and downstream areas of the present day
Soko Irrigation Scheme were scrublands. During the field visit, it was observed that the scrubs are a
type resistant to salinity. This has indicated the fact that the area is saline and has poor fertility.
Satellite imagery of 1998, however, indicates that much change has taken place since 1982. In
upstream areas, the landuse/vegetation cover is still mostly scrublands, but the vegetation becomes
greener and greener as one goes farther and farther downstream. This is a unique landuse/vegetation
cover characteristic compared to most other schemes.
37



7.2.4   Water quality upstream and dowi n stream villages (Kochakindo and Ghona)
The most affected village due to the existence of the scheme is Kochakindo. For instance people have
failed completely to use waater fromi the Soko River for domestic uses because of the presence ot0
agrochemiicals. According to the villagers, the situation became ssorse soon after improvement of the
scheme. This has resulted in an increase of le-alth cases such as cancer. Apart firom that NNater lesels
have becoime critically low., especiallY fromn October to January.

7.2.5   Socio economic impacts on downstream users
Major water users downstream include domestic users, irrigators and livestock keepers. Water
availability is a problem, especially during the dry season when there is a low base flow. There are
potential water use conflicts within scheme users during periods of water scarcity.
7.3 IRRIGATION SCHEME LEVEL IMPACTS
The major problems in the scheme may be attributed to a lack of proper understandinig of the soil and
topographic characteristics in the design of the conveyance structures.

7.3.1   Hydraulic regime
Shortage of water after r ehabilitation of the scheme
Before rehabilitation. the majo r problem of the Soko scheme w\as the loinmation of ponds inside the
schemle arca. These ponds were pemmanent and acted like sws amps in the scheme causilng fow to reach
the Soko stream only whien the ponds overflowsed Ilow evcr, the water released througlh the Soko canal
was adequate for die farming area. Due to the introductioni ot the drainage canals in the svstein the
problem of ws ater pooling disappeared and the drainage of the retumed flow has significantly improved.
Unforttnatel. this improvement has not come w-itllout consequences.
Water that passes through the field canals and is intenided to tlood the paddy ficlds emerges 20 to 3(
imeters away from the actual ficlds. This situationi creates a watcr shortage and, in fact, less fields are
being served by irrigatio n than prior to the rehabilitation.
Water conveyance problem in sonie tertiary canals
iWater conveyance problems in some tertiarv canals is causing stagnation.

Overflows
Soko joins Dehu stream at the left and Ghoina at the riglht bank. The Ghoma River overflowN s its baris
into Soko both upstream and downstream of the intake location. Ill-is causes flooding in the upstream
vicinities and sometimes to the field areas.
Water use efficiency
As any other scheme, the water efficiency of Soko is low. The overall efficiency of the scheme is about
24%. Low wvater application efficiencY is responsible for the low- overall efficiency as showvn in the
table below'.

Background
hlie soils upstream have a of pl- 7.4 (mildly- I. 1 I  while soils at the middle of the schemie have a
pH ranging from 8.5 to 9.3 (stronigl- alkaline). Ihis has been caused by high sodium concentrations in
the soil (sodium carbonates locally named as mogadi). Generally, the soil pl-l ranges from strongly
acidic to slighth acidic for faims located downstream. Fertility ranges fromn very loxw to low. although1
there is good mineralization. There is very low available phosphorus in the farms. DowNnstream areas have
higlh catioii exchange capacitv wNhile the upstream  faLniis have low  cation exchange capacity.
41



Exchangeable sodium percentage shows that the upstream farms are non-sodic. Middle farms are slightly
sodic. The table7.9 below shows results of the soil analysis.

Soil sodicity has been detected in farms located in the middle of the scheme. Soil sodicity increases to
downstream farms. Soil samples taken at site number one at 60 cm indicated a very high salinity
problem. From this assessment, a conclusion can be reached that the sodicity is at the bedrock level and
the salts move to downstreamil farms.
Exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K) of the scheme area were measured during the scheme improvenment
assessment (1998) as shown in the table below. It shows all the exchangeable cations have increased by
four fold during the last five years following the improvement of the scheme. This indicates an increase
in the use of fertilizers and other chemicals. In the future, salinity trends are expected to increase unless
farmers use proper agriculture practices.

These salts are soluble in water, thus they can easily be washed out of the field. Fertility can be
increased by introducing good crop husbandry practices (crop rotation, variable tillage, application of
organic fertilizers) and planting of nitrogen fixing legume plants. Since soil pH is mostly alkaline,
acidic fertilisers such as sulphate of ammonia [S/A] can be used to lower the soil pH.
7.3.3  Water quality
The water quality testing of the scheme, as presented in Table 7.11, reveals that the pH ranges between
7.34 and 8.15, which is a near-neutral pH band. The dissolved oxygen (DO) ranges from 5.28 mg/i to
8.17 mg/I, indicating good aeration and fairly low organic pollution in the water. The salinity and total
dissolved solids (TDS) values of the incoming water (measured from the intakes) indicate that the
water used for irrigation is fresh and very suitable for that matter. The TDS and turbidity values are
almost similar within the Soko scheme. This indicates less inorganic and suspenlded solid input into the
canals. The scheme shows elevated faecal contamination, having a range of 154-328 FC/100 ml. Water
quality may be affected by activities going on in the scheme area incLiding washing and bathing in the
canals. However, t his q uality st ill meets t he WHO guideline i imits for i rrigation water q uality. The
values for total hardness and acidity are rather elevated though show little variation in the entil-c
irrigation scheme. This trend is normal in irrigated farms.

7.3.4   Fertilizers and pesticides use
During field survey, majority of farmers 84% found to use industrial fertilizers, however the rate of
application per acre have been lower compared to the recommended standard.
Also there is under utilization of pesticide and insecticide during plant treatment and disease control.
The Table7.13 blow indicate the type and amount used of fertilizers, pesticides and insecticide in the
scheme. The tinder application of fertilizer and pesticides is caused by higher prices of these
commodities and low capital among farmers. However the under utilization of chemical cause
resistance to disease and pests.

People in the three villages get their treatment in the small dispensary, which is located in You Village.
As the dispensary doesn't have all the necessary facilities, sometimes people are forced to go to Himo
or Mawenzi Hospital il Moshi Munlicipality. Common diseases in the villages according to the
dispensary doctor are shown in Table 7.15.

7.3.6   Drinking water quality and sanitation
The villages do not have water supply systems ford omestic use. Villagers are forced to use other
sources of water such as rivers and springs. The three primary villages' drinking water situation is
presented below:
Kyomu village
This is the only village among the there villages in the scheme which have a hand pump well.
However, villagers also use water from Soko springs and the Dehu River. There are canals which pass
the village from Soko River.
Kiterini village
In this village people fetch water from Soko springs and the Soko River. They also fetch water from
Kyomu, especially during rainy season when water in the rivers becomes very turbid.
Soko village
Like Kiterini Village, people in Soko Village don't have a hand pump well. Instead, they mostly
depend on water from the Soko River and the Dehu River for domestic purposes. Like people in
Kiterini, during the rainy season they fetch water from Kyomu Village where there is a hand pump
well.
Most houseliolds in the three villages don't have toilets but rely on pit latrines. The pit latrines are,
however, not in a good condition

7.3.7   Socio-econornic: positive and negative impacts of villages within the schemte
Negative Impacts
Due tc a lack of field level sen ice roads. crossing and transportation of cUltivated goods has become a
difficult task. This is particular-b true at the main canal \hich is being undennined by domestic
animals as thev trv to cross the main canal to get drinkinpg wNater from the riv er. In somne instances, the
farmners have made an attemiipt to put \ood crossings for human crossing.
Plate 7.3: Wooden crossing along the main canal.
*   PoIllution of wNater due to agrolchmicals used in the scheiie;, fin-s is a problem especially in the
downstream xillage of Kochakinido.
* TFhc soil in the area is imure or less affected hv salinity.
*   The main drain does not -work well hecauLse the river base level is almost the samie to that of
the drain base level. This has resulted in back flowN inato the miain drain, especially duriing rainY
seasoni.
*   Distribution of wvater in the schemie is poor and has, resulted in ijinniense conveyance losses
and appears to affect the overall water use efficiencyv.
*   T'he canal banks are weak anid unistable:, this results in seepage alonig the stretch. Somie of the
secondary canal base levels are deeper than the field level (beyond field leveb) so some of the
farmers fail to use thiemi for irrigation.
*   There is only, one road accessing the intake. w,hich is in a very bad condition. --The road is
impassable duLring the rainy season. Thlis has resutlted in difficulties in transportation of farm
pr oduce. Thlere are no servi ce roads to the field-, hience, miost of the fariis are not accessible he.
tractors.
* Water related dlisease like malaria, diarrhea, fungal inifection and schistosomniasis have
incereased. In Kyomio dispensary, malaria appeared as a leading disease in 2003.
*   Due to the avail abilits of wvater, the numnber of livestock keepers has increased drastically in
the scheme area. Thie cattle are poilluting the water and destroying the canals throug-h
increased soil erosion.
   Interactioni of people ltioni differenit areas hias increased the prevalence of HIlV/AIDS in the
scheine.
*   Temporary immigrant hiousing are coiitnLicted using poor- sanitation standards.
Positive Impacts
   'lhe inicome of people has increased duie to good productioni in two farniing seasons.
*   There is more farmier development in the scheme in termis of standard of living, h-ousing and
education.
47



-~~~~~~~~~~~~
*   Extension services have improved resulting in better crop husbandry and good irrigation
maniagement.
*   Land productivity has been improved by the introduction of irrigation and drainage systems, which
control seasonal flooding.
*   More farmers received trainings in solving problems, finding markets and using of farm inputs.
*   Formation of farmers organization groups like SACCOS.

8.      IDENTIFIED MITIGATION MEASURES
8.1 INTRODUCTION
This section presents a brief description of the identified impacts and sLibsequent mitigation measures.
The description addresses itself to three categories of identified impacts as presented in previous
chapter, as well as four categories of identified mitigation measures. The categories of identified
impacts include the following:
*   Impacts in up-stream areas of scheme
*   Impacts at scheme areas
*   Impacts in down areas of schemes
Furthernmore, the categories of identified mitigation measures include the following:
*   Environmental management
*   Enhancement of social -economic activities
*   Improving health situationi
* Revisiting engineering designs and /or construction.
8.2 UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM MEASURES
8.2.1   Environmental Management
In the case of the Soko scheme, which depends on the Soko springs, is up-stream saliiiity, poor
levelling in farms, water stagnation and poorly functioning drainage structures. For this reason the up-
stream  mitigation measure under category of environmental management, therefore include the
following:
*   Combating weeds infestation.
*   Establishing mechanism for ensuring that up-stream resource use activities e.g. drilling, gravel
mining etc don't result into hydro geological affects of the area.
*   Identifying underground course and embarking on afforestation/reforestation activities in order to
protect the undergroulid course of the Soko spring.
*   Strengthening local community capacity to monitor and control up-stream water abstractions.
Specifically, in up-stream areas of the Soko scheme, the measures include promotion of environnmental
consciousness in all social-economic activities. This should include establishment of mechaniisms,
which should ensure controlled acquisition and appropriate land use practices.
In down -stream areas the villagers are not yet adequately conscious on high potential usefulness of
irrigation agriculture as a social- economic activity. There is, therefore, the need for promoting this
activity.
8.2.2   Enhancement of social-economic conditions
Under the circumstances, at up-stream and down-stream, the mitigation measures Linder category of
enhancement of social-economic activities include the following:
*   Considering other factors, which, although are not of direct bearing to the interventions mentioned,
are however very influenitial in the endeavour. It is common for people to practice two or more
econonmic activities in puIsuit of their well-being. For a soLind contribution to the sustainable
socio-economic well-being, therefore, there is need to focus improvement not only on1 irrigation
agricLilture but also to address other socio economic activities in the area, namely pastorals and
small enterprises business development. The focus on irrigation ultimately alone jeopardizes the
existing harnmoniy and cooperation with other sectors of the economy.
49



Look into p ossibility of i mproving su pporting socio-economic services naamely: healtlh facilities
and water supply. Some of these matters were also mentioned during focus group discussions and
interviews. Lack or poor condition of these services presently seriously jeopardizes villagers'
ability and their effort to imipr-ove their financial earnings.
*   Strengthening mechanisms for controlled acquisition and uses of land and water resources.
*   Promotioni of enviroiiniental consciousniess in all socio-economic activities.
In order to avoid continuous tension and conflict in water use between the scheme and downstream
villages the project should provide support to the villages downstream of the througlh public
awareness campaigns in water management, health and sanitation, and safe handling and use of
agrochemicals. Joint training seminars for scheme and those downstream should be farmer's
organized training with farmers from the scheme.  Supply of improved drinking water for
downstream villagers should also be considered.
The project should assist in monitoring of waterborne diseases and damage to downstream
ecosystem due to reduced water quantity and quality
8.3 IRRIGATION SCHEME LEVEL
8.3.1   Environmental Management
Within scheme areas of the Soko the key issues are poor irrigation practices leading to uses of water
resoul-ces, poor levelling of farilis, leading to water stagnation and poor performiaice of drainage
structure. The m itigation m easures u nder category of e nvironmenltal management, therefore inclUde
the following:
*   Establishment and/or strengthening l ocal based (i.e. scheme based) effective water m anagement
system.
*   Establishing and/or strengthening local-based mechanisms for resolution of conflicts in use of both
water and land resources.
At the scheme level, however, the mitigation measure should include promotion of appropriate
irrigation practice which should ultimately lead to increased productivity, incomes and henice reduction
of poverty Focus improvement not only of rice cultivation but also of other crops e.g. maize and
vegetables (i.e. horticulture). This should ensure availability of food in the village in case rice
production fails some day.
Integrated management to minimize the use of saline water
An integrated, holistic approach is needed to conserve water and prevent soil salinization and water
logging, while protecting the environmenit and ecology. Three mitigation options are proposed for
improvemenit oftthe irrigated land forthe Soko irrigation scheme:
*   Improvement of water application practices to minimize water and reduce deep percolation,
*   Improvement of drainage including disposal of water to evaporation ponds if quality of Soko river
flow is adversely affected by drainage water.
*   Maintenance of channels to prevent seepage, and reduce inefficiencies resulting from siltation and
weeds.
*   Provision of improved access to channels for maintenance.
*   Salinity monitoring, with a view to developing a model to predict salt loads and concentrations at
the irrigation scheme.
Integrated Pest Management
IPM c onibines all k nown technologies of p lant protection in an interdisciplinary and farmer centred
approach, using ecologically and economically appropriate and sustainable methods atpre- and post
harvest levels and it involves the knowledge, skills and experience of farmers with their intimate
acquaintance with their crops and environment, entomologists, agronomists, sociologists, plant
breeders, environmentalists, agro-climatologists, gender specialists. etc.
50



IPM has become increasingly used in recent years as a result of the deepening realization of higlh cost
and the adverse effects that the overuse of, and over-dependenice on, chemical pesticides produce. The
objective in the development of an IPM is to find the most appropriate blend of preventive and control
methods and processes for the Soko irrigation scheme.
Integrated Soil Fertility Management
Soil fertility is a major limiting factor for agricultural production in irrigated farms. The maintenance,
restoration and enhancement of soil fertility, particularly in areas where salinity problems have been
observed, is a key element in the development of food security and sustainable agricultLiral systems in
Luganiga i-rigation scheme. With this in mind, the consultant suggested the project to incorporate
integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) in Soko irrigation scheme.
The purpose of ISFM is to foster greater understanding of both the factors contributing to soil fertility.
SIIP a ct a s a c atalyst f or implementation of ISFM n ot only i n S oko but a Iso i n t he other i rrigation
schemes.
8.3.2   Improving health situation
This category of measure should be relevant for identified impacts at both scheme levels, as well as in
down-stream areas of the scheme.
One of the known environmental impacts of irrigation activities is spread of water borne diseases, e.g.
bilharzias is, dysentery, malaria, and etc. Furthermore, expected influx of people, as irrigation
agriculture increases will mean that promiscuity will also arise. This calls for the need to embark on a
prograni for prevention of HIV/AIDS, as well as strengthening existing health and water supply
services, as appropriate.
8.3.3   Revisiting engineering designs and/or construction stages
The consultant, in line with the farmers' expression, recommends as of first priority, the completion of
the outstanding works, which include:
*   Construction of bridge crossings for livestock
*   Re-filling up of the borrow pits.
* Provision of water troughs to downstream users.
*   Supply proper drainage slope to wherever necessary to avoid backwater flooding
*   Construct proper dykes to reduce flooding from Dehu river and Ghoma streams
*   Introduce adequate field service roads and crossings for easy access of harvests and services
Construction of cattle troughs
To alleviate the tendency of livestock drinking in the main canal, a drinking point for livestock has
been provided along main canal to avoid concentration of livestock in one drinking point. The project
should assist in construction of a trough or two for downstream livestock keepers. Livestock from these
areas obtain water from irrigation canals, which is a dangerous habit since it leads to d estruction of
canals.
Monitoring of water quality
In order t o safe guard health o f d ownstream Li sers, i rrigation water q uality should b e monitored for
contamination. Appropriate measures should be taken to address any deviations from internationally
accepted standards.

9. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
(ESMP)
9.1 INTRODUCTION
The mitigationi measures proposed in the previous chapter represent the core findings of the EA and are
important elements in implementing the current improvement of the irrigation scheme and mitigating
potentially adverse social and environmental impacts. The Environmental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP) in the following sections presents:
*   Identification and summary of major anticipated adverse environmental impacts
*   Description of mitigation measures
*   Descriptioii of elements of monitoring program
*   Institutional arrangement
*   Implementation schedule for mitigation measures
*   Performance monitoring and reporting procedures
*   Cost estimates and sources of funds
The ESMP is based on the guidelines defined in the World Bank Operational Manual OP/BP 4.01.
9.2 OBJECTIVES
General objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the Soko irrigation
scheme would be to promote sustainiable and efficient irrigation agricultural activities in the area.
Specifically, the o bjectives o f the Environmental and S ocial M anagement Plan for the S oko Irrigation
scheme are therefore mainly two-fold; namely:
(i)  To promote sustainability of the schemes through:
*   Improving capacities, knowledge/skills,
*   Establishing /strengtlhening mechanisms for resolution of conflicts pertaining to uses of
natural resources especially water and land resources,
*   Establishing /strengthening mechanisms for enforcenment of regulations for water
abstractions and pollution control
*   Strengthening local community leadership and effective mechanism  for control in
acquisition and uses of land resources.
(ii) To promote efficiency in irrigation agricultural activities, through:
*   Providing/educating on appropriate irrigation practices, e.g. on proper uses of agro-
chemicals, IPM approaches,
*   Strengthening implementation of water management concept.
*   Revisiting designing and construction stages of the scheme to assess the need for review
of the stages.

9.4 DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENTS OF MONITORING
PROGRAM
Mionitoring objectives
Monitoring refers to a systematic collection of data/information and due analysis, with the aim of
following tip on the subsequent phenomena in the wake of implementation of the ESMP. Activities are
followed up, their status assessed, quantified and rectified accordingly. This process should bc
considered as part of the ESMP. The District Council will keep a close eye on changing conditions and
keep records, as accurately as possible, to check, among others, on compliance with statutory
environmental protection provisions and World Bank Safeguard Policies.
Description of performance indicators whicb provide linkages to impacts and mitigation
measures in the EA
Water quality
Water quality will be monitored as follows:
*   The water quality of the Kukeletwa River will be assessed continuously to determine the overall
impact of, fertilizers, insecticides or pesticides used in the irrigation project and upstream
agricultural activities.
*   The water flow volume in the river will be measured through the established gauging stations.
Water balance modeling should be done for predication proposes. This exercise will help to assess
base flows, water yields, and hydrological characteristics of the catchment area.
Ground water
   The ground water will be checked to detenmine salinity of ground water as a result of project
operations.
.   The changes in pH of grounld water will be monitored to check the impacts oii ground water of the
various types of crops planted.
*   Changes i n I evels of water t able will be monitored i n s ample areas of c rops t hat c onsUmne too
much of ground water including the well-documented eucalyptus species.
Soil Conservation
Soil composition, texture and structure in the irrigation project area will be monitored in the sample
areas to determine impacts from various agricultural practices.
The fertility level of soils (i.e. nutrienit concentration and soil moistire) ii the sample crop areas will
be monitored to determine impacts from the planted crops. Changes in salinity, porosity, pH level and
types of biota in the soils will also be monitored in the sample crop areas. Alteration of these
parameters could be expected in cases where crops are grown alongside water or nutrient demanding
trees, which may consequently jeopardize the well being of the crops.
Biodiversity indicators
The following are pertinent indicators for catchment management: sedimentation rates, riverbank
erosion, flashfloods and deforestationi rates. The District Natural Resource Office supported by other
stakeholder and RBM should monitor these.
Other important ecological parameters include vegetation; (i.e. both on dry I and as well as on river
valleys); fish, (i.e. plankton, invertebrates); and birds, and other living organisms available in the area.
Crop Diseases
The type of diseases affecting planted trees will be monitored in the sample compartments to
determine cominoni diseases to various crops that will require special treatment in the next rotation of
crop farming or application of appropriate pesticides for treatment of the disease.
The most damaging crop pests, especially those that have caused extensive loss of production in the
farms in Tanzania will be monitored. The monitoring of emerging pests and insects in and aroulid the
project area will help determine the most suitable disease control mitigation measure.
55



Afforestation
Provenanice and species resistance to diseases and pests for planting in the community and individual's
forest plots within the project will be screened. Provenance and nursery plots will be established. DBI-
and heights will be measured.
The amoulit of carbon and other greenhouse gases in the soils will be monitored in and around the
project area. The amount of greenhouse gases will be monitored to assess the impacts of forest
sequestration of greenhouse gases, especially carbon.
Socio-economic
The District Office shoLlld monitor the characteristics, activities and attitudes of the adjacent
communities in order to develop feasible extension programs. The major objectives will be to reduce
pressure on the irrigation area i,iter alia through encouraging alternative enterprises. The steps would
include:
*   Promoting agro-forestry in the local community farmis.
*   Infrastructure development such as accessibility, marketing, education, healthi and other proposed
activities by the local community around the project area.
*   Net immigration monitoring of people in the local community. Population dynamics will be
monitored in sub-villages and around the project.
*   Fuel wood requirements for the local community will also be monitored to determine local
demand and develop possible strategies such as agro-forestry, community forest areas and
conservation of natural woodlands in the villages around the project.
Health indicators
The main health indicators to be monitored are water-borne diseases such as malaria and bilharziasis.
Description of parameters to be measures, methods to be employed, sampling locations, frequency of
measurements, detection I imits (where appropriate) and definition of thresholds that will signed the
need for remedial actions, institutional responsibilities, timing and timescales for monitorinig,
Reporting arrangements (to regulatory authiorities and the Bank), and costs and financing provisions

9.5 INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
The fuLidamental area for consideration is empowerment of existing administrative and organisationial
arr-anigemilenits. These include farimlers, local communities, both as a group as well as in their individual
capacities, in both upstream and downstreamn villages The empowerment has to be carried out througl
provision of capacity building, public awareness campaigns, tailor-made training, etc.
As a strategic approach SIIC should strengthen partnership among the Soko community in the use of
water and land resources. Based on the adopted organisational-structure and job descriptions of
various committees to be established, for the operation of the scheme, a framework should be
established through which the stakeholders are able to actively engage in a dialogue aimed at equitable
and sustainable use of the common resources.
The project should firstly embark on a programme of key and strategic activities that are part of the
above outlined Environmental and Social Management Plan and should enhance attainment of the
above objectives. More specifically, the following are proposed:
   Hold meetings of various committees as per agreement
.   Assist: (i) to organise ward or district- based farmers' day,
and (ii) participation in local and nationial events like farmers day
*   Undertake joint study visits

10. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.1 CONCLUSION
10.1.1  General conclusion
Based on review of baseline information, field visits to Soko irrigationi scheme and data analyses, it is
evident that there are environmental and social issues/imnpacts/problems that need to be addressed in
order to ensure sustainable and sound operation of the irrigation scheme. As outlined in above chapters
(among others): in up-stream areas of the scheme, the key issues constraining sustainability are
uncontrolled water abstractions leading to flow/hydrological instability changes of the river's
hydrological and hydraulic regime. In within scheme areas the impacts are general poor soil fertility
and soil salinity. In down-stream area sustainability is mainly constrained by inadequacy of water and
inappropriate irrigation practices. These impacts manifest either to upstream  environmental
degradation, (particularly of the catchment area), or within-the-scheme impacts, (e.g. due to poor soil
fertility, soil salinity, etc.), or also in down -stream areas (due to unlcontrolled water abstractions)
leading to commnunlity conflicts.
Baseline data with comprehensive benchmark parameters related to various studies like hydrogeology,
socio-economic, environment, water quality, etc. at catchment and irrigation levels were not available
in the area. Environment and social assessment impact requires "before and after" studies, and perhaps
experience from sinilar environment to facilitate a ssessnient oft he severity of perceived problems.
Quantification of impacts requires collection of data, understaniding of process and analysis of results,
which take more time and resoLirces.
Through ecosystem, farming system and participatory approaches, the key impacts were identified and,
as far, as was possible, quantified. Additionally, measures pertaining to prevention and/or control have
been proposed. An Environmental and Social Management Plan for the Soko irrigation scheme were
developed.
10.1.2 Specific conclusions
Location
In conclusion, it was found that the location of the scheme enhances sustainability of the scheme. This
is because the scheme is located near a rapidly growing minor township of Chekereni, as well as the
highway junction of Moshi -Mombasa -Tanga and Dar-es Salaam all of which provide much trading
opportunities. However, the short distance to the scheme itself (of abouit 4 km) is very rough, thence
undermining all that favourable situation mentioned above.
Biophysical environment
The Soko scheme lies in semi -arid area of Tanzania, where without irrigation, agriculture is difficult to
practice Up-stream area of the scheme are predominantly saline and hence vegetation is
characteristically salinity resistance It was therefore found in conclusion that scheme improvement has
been very beneficial to the local community.
Socio-economic environment
Field observations indicated that local community of Soko combine irrigatioin agriculture with
livestock rearing. It was observed that people practising irrigation at the scheme are those who
originally migrated to the area in search of pasture for their livestock, but in the course of time, having
realised social-economic benefits of the activities, they gradually got attracted to go for irrigation
agriculture.
66



Identified impacts
It is important that the positive aspects of development emerge, especially because these are what
motivate the people at village (farni) level and dictate the decisions they take or are willing to have
taken on1 their behalf
Positive impacts
In the Soko irrigation scheme positive imipacts are:
-Increased incomes and production, leading to alleviation of poverty
-Improved land and water resources management and distribution,
Negative impacts
Negative impacts identified upstream of the Soko scheme are soil quality changes, i.e. in terms of e.g.
change of salinity etc. The downstream impacts are water borne diseases and socio-economic impacts
on the community. Within the irrigation scheme major impacts are soil quality and waterborne
diseases.
Mitigation measures
A number of mitigation measures were proposed to address the identified impacts. As far as possible,
preventive management measure should be given priority in combating soil and water pollution,
catchment degradation, and pollutionl of the rivers and disease control.
Again Chapter 4 to 7 above contains details on analysis of identified mitigation measures.
Compliance with the Tanzanian legislation and World Bank Safeguard Policies
The study team has demonstrated that the Soko irrigation scheme is in compliance with the Tanzanian
legislation and policies, and World Bank Safeguard Policies.
10.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
Role of Local Government authorities
Most of the identified mitigation measures are related with local community-based effective structural
-organization. This means therefore that local government authorities themselves with financial and
technical assistance of can implement most of the measures funded projects e.g. RBMSIIP.
Partnership building
It is recommended to share experiences and information from other partners in the area could
collaboirate with these stakeholders in implementation of environmenital management inteivenitionis,
whiclh are relevant to Soko irrigation scheme and others in Pangani River Basin.
In order to minimize water and landuse conflicts, stakeholders of Pangani River Basin in general
should work together as partners to improve production and sustainable development of the watershed
management and the scheme's sustainable development.
Similar projects should develop institutional arrangements geared to share responsibility (decision
making) for catchment management plan and prevention management activities in the Pangani River
Basin. A partnership approach, however, also needs an appropriate institutional framework, which
clearly lays on the roles and responsibilities of each project, district councils and stakeholders.
Community and farmers participation could be solicited in planning, management, financing,
constructioni and maintenance of catchment areas and receiving bodies.
67



Environmental and social impact management plan and monitoring
A participatory environmental and social impact plan and monitoring system has been developed for
the Soko irrigation schemes. There is need to establish process-based plan and monitoring, to build
capacity of scheme management team and to develop a databank on the environmental and social
impact management plan including the I monitoring plan.
Capacity Building
The following stake holders, at various levels should participate in the capacity- building program:
individual farmers, households, farmers' groups, associations scheme committee members etc. They
should also include village /ward authiorities, district personnel, and NGOs, CBOs, etc.
Baseline Studies
It is vital for any sustainable smallholder irrigation development and managemenit in the river basin
that tiere is a minimum knowledge about waterresources and quanitified (baseline data) related to
environmenital and social issues. It is therefore, proposed that a mechanism for regular collection of
baseline data be established some baseline studies and investigations should be undertaken in the
future smallholder irrigation improvement projects.
