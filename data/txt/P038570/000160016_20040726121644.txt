EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Government of Tanzania (GoT) through the Ministry of AgricultLre and Food Security (MAFS)
has taken various initiatives to improve agricultural sector in the country. One of these initiatives is
undertaking the River Basin Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP);
in context with which, is the Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC). Among others,
the need to undertake the RBMSIIP arose out of a nation-wide realisation that the ecosystems of
country's river basins (especially those of the Rufiji and the Pangani Rivers) are not being properly
managed, leading to extensive environmental degradation and loss of potentialities of these vital
ecosystems. Moreover, it was also realised that in view of the above-mentioned loss of potentiality,
smallholder traditional irrigation schemes are the worst affected; hence the need arose to undertake also
the SIIC.
Support to smallholder traditional irrigation improvement and rehabilitation is, therefore, one of the
major components of this RBMSIIP programme. The SIIC component focuses on improving
management of water resources and crop husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation
schemes. This can be achieved, among others, through improvement of natural resources, land and
water, during implementation of the rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes.) SIIC is geared
at improvement of water management in smallholder irrigation schemes to ensure sustainable use of
land and water resources and ultimately yield increase with minimal environmental degradation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC both the Scheme Environmental Assessment (SEA) as well as the
Environmental Audit (EA) were carried out for the Rwanda-Majenje Irrigation Scheme. Among others,
both the assessment and the audit were based on the Initial Environmental Assessments (IEE) studies
carried out by the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Irrigation Section of the MAFS. This report
presents the findings of the study.
The objective of the study were identifying changes that have taken place before/after scheme
improvement, assessing and quantifying thereto environmental and social impacts, also duly preparing
an environmental and social management plan as well as developing an environmental and social
management monitoring system. According to the ToR the expected outputs of this study are two in
one interrelated reports i.e. covering both Environmental Audit (EA) as well as Scheme
Environmental Assessment (SEA), analysing e.g. socio-economic, socio-cultural and engineering
factors in order to provide quantitative information.
Furthermore, the report incorporates an assessment of compliance of the scheme's improvement to the
Tanzanian policy and legislation framework, as well as the World Bank's relevant environmental safe
guard policies (especially on OP 4.01).
Different methodologies were employed, including the following:
*   Desk review of recommended documents
*   Questioinaire administration to key stakeholders
*   Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA)
At different stages of the study the following approaches and analytical tools were applied
*   Participatory data collection
*   Key informant interview
*   Trend analysis
*   Geographical information system
Describing the location of the scheme, the study found that the Rwanda-Majenje irrigation scheme lies
relatively in up-stream areas of the Usangu plains about 54 Km East of Mbeya municipality It is
located at a minor township of Igurusi along the TANZAM highway. Its coordinates are latitude 08 48'
South and longitude 330 50' East, and is at an altitude of about 1200m above mean sea level. The
following villages are direct beneficiaries of the scheme: Ruanda, Mjimwema, Majenje, Jipemoyo,
Chamuto, Jangwani, and Amkeni.
vii



Villages around the Rwanda -Majenje irrigation scheme has a population of 3225 people. The main
ethnic groups around the scheme area are Wanyakyusa, Wasangu, Wawanji, Wabena and other smaller
groups. The majority of these are agriculturalists. Few are livestock keepers.
The land use in the adjacent villages of Rwanda-Majenje is mainly irrigation as well as rain-fed
cultivation and grazing.
The Rwanda - Majenje scheme abstracts water from Luanyo River. It is a tributary of Mambi River.
The Luanyo River has no ganging station. Therefore during the design stage, dependable flow of
information was transferred from a nearby station on Chimala River (at a place called Chitekelo).
According the estimated mean and dependable flows of the Luanyo River at the intake of the Ruanda-
Majenje scheme varies from the highest (at 0.70, 0.68) cumecs in the wet months of March and April,
respectively, to the lowest (at 0.07, 0.06, 0.05 and 0.12) cumecs in dry months of August, Sept, Oct,
Nov, and Dec respectively.
Water abstractions by upstream users for domestic purposes, irrigation and livestock are likely to
impact on the quality and quantity of water available to the scheme. Poor farming practices, especially
cultivation of crops close to the riverbanks, is increasing silt load in the river and causing siltation of
the irrigation structures.
The availability of good domestic water supply, coupled with good sanitation at Rwanda- Majenje will
considerably reduce downstream water pollution from domestic uses. Drained water from the scheme
area is likely to be contaminated from activities carried out in the scheme area, including application of
agro-chemicals, and sharing irrigation water with livestock. The on-farm activities will thus form the
main source of pollution downstream.
Conflicts over water use have been recorded in the study area, especially in the dry season when river
flows are at the lowest.
In the past say 10 years, fuel wood was obtained in the nearby forests. Deforestation for firewood.
openings of new farms and uncontrolled wild fires have led to a significant decrease in forest areas.
With ilTigation structures in place, coupled with improvement and prospects for higher income earnings
from irrigated agriculture, there is greater loyalty to the leadership of Water Associations.
The following are some of the positive effects:
*   Strengthened existing Water Users Association.
*   Temporal employmeent opportunities were created during the construction phase.
*   Some farmers have attended on farm training and exchange visits to other areas to share
experience with other farmers as well as leaming new skills.
*   The project has brought about improvement in water availability distribution and management.
*   Crop production has improved a great deal
A summary of identified impacts differentiated at up-stream, down-stream and within scheme levels for
resulting from Chapter 7 and appropriate mitigation measures are summarized in the Environmental
and Social Management Plan as follows:

The monitoring program comprises the following attributes: water quality, groundwater, soil
conservation, biodiversity, crop diseases, afforestation, socio-economic and health indicators.
Additionally, the environmental audit main conclusions and recommendations are the followings:
In conclusion it was found that the location of the scheme has both positive and negative aspects. The
scheme provides many opportunities that it facilitates and encourages irrigation practices, hence
enhancing the sustainability of the scheme. On the other hand, because of being near a rapidly growing
minor township of Igurusi poses a possible threat of detracting people from practicing irrigation. A
possible negative influence is one such as availability of poor soil fertility which would require
capital-intensive interventions. One of the main recommendations is most of the identified mitigation
measures are related with local community-based effective structural organization. This means
therefore that local government authorities themselves, with financial and technical assistance of
funded projects, e.g. RBMSIIP, NGOs and CBOs, can implement most of the measures.

1. BACKGROUND
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The Goverrunent of Tanzania, through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS), has
undertaken various initiatives to imnprove the agriculture sector in the country. One of these initiatives
is the River Basin Management and Smallholder liTigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP). The
Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC) is included within the scope of RBMSIIP.
RBMSIIP was developed in response to a water shortage crisis prevalent in many parts of the country.
Water demands often exceed available resources; this is especially true in the Pangani and Rufiji
basins.
Support to smallholder traditional irrigation improvement and rehabilitation is one of the major
components of this project. SIIC focuses on improving the management of water resources and crop
husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation schemes. This is achieved through, among other
things, the improvement of natural resources (land and water) during implementation of the
rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes.
The SIIC undertaking supports the objectives of the National Irrigation Development Plan (NIDP)
which was formulated and adopted in 1994. The plan includes a management and decision-making
framework that is based on the comprehensive ranking of schemes within each management unit (river
or drainage basin).
Under NIDP the order of priority for irrigation development is as follows:
*   Improvement/rehabilitation of Traditional Smallholder liTigation Schemes;
*   Water Harvesting Technology;
*   Opening of New Smallholder Schemes;
*   Large Scale Irrigation Schemes for Private Sector.
SIIC focuses on the improvement of water management in smallholder irrigation schemes to ensure the
sustainable use of land and water resources. Ultimately, SIIC aims to facilitate increases in crop yields
while minimizing environmental degradation. According to World Bank guidelines, the irrigation
schemes in the Rufiji and Pangani basins are classified as Category B. Under this category, no major
adverse environmental impacts are permitted and mitigation measures must be incorporated into the
scheme design, implementation and operation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC, a feasibility study was carried out that resulted in the preparation of
the Project Implementation Plan for 1996/97 - 2001/02. This plan, produced in October 1996, contains
an assessment of environmental issues together with proposed environmental mitigation measures.
Under World Bank advisement, the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Food Security conducted an Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) of the irrigation schemes. The
IEEs were u sed a s t he b asis for t he S cheme I mprovement A ssessment Studies. T he c onsultants, i n
collaboration with ECU, have been charged to conduct environmental audits in seven Category B
sites: Ruanda Majenje, Igomelo, Mangalali, Nyamahana, Soko, Kambi ya Tanga, and Mahenge. An
additional site, Lemkuna, only required the development of an Environmental and Social Management
Plan. This report is focused on presenting the findings of the environmental audit that was conducted
for the Ruanda Majenje Irrigation Scheme.
This report draws heavily on intensive field observations by the study team. Discussions were held
with farmers and other local people, village and district officials, and project staff. A review of various
existing documents was also conducted in the preparation of this report.
1.2 UNDERSTANDING OF THE STUDY
1.2.1  Objective of the Study
The objective of the study is to get a better understanding of the present environmental conditions and
relevant i mpact a reas ( environmental a udit) within t he s cheme. I ncreased a wareness will a llow for



improved monitoring of both negative and positive changes over time and will assist in the formulation
of more effective mitigation measures. The environmental audit will also be the basis for the
preparation of an environmental and social management plan and monitoring system.
Specifically, the study will undertake the following:
*   Assess and quantify baseline environmental and social conditions
*   Assess and quantify environmental and social impacts
*   Conduct environmental audits in order to comply with existing Government of Tanzania and
World Bank environmental and safeguard policies.
*   Prepare an environmental and social management plan.
*   Develop an environmental and social management and monitoring system.
*   Conduct public consultations.
1.3     STRATEGIC APPROACH
The consultant's environmental audit of the Ruanda Majenje irrigation scheme was characterized by
three a pproaches: e cosystem, farmin7g system and p articipatolo. The basic a pproach oft he stuidy i s
illustrated in Figure 1-1.
1.3.1   Ecosystem Approach
In view of the fact that the project activities are wholly based in a rural area, potential conflicts
between the project and the environment are likely to arise.  Thus, issues pertaining to the use of
natural resources (e.g. livestock grazing, agriculture, irrigation, water source protection, agro-forestry,
etc.) have to be studied.
In applying the ecosystem approach, the consultant not only focused on the Ruanda Majenje irrigation
scheme but also on all the ecosystems upstream and down stream that impact the environmental and
social characteristics of the area. To accomplish this, the study sought an understanding of all
activities taking place within the irrigation scheme's water catchment area. River pollution,
sedimentation, flash floods, deforestation, destabilization of riverbanks, erosion, salinity, land
degradation, and waterbome diseases (among others) are all contributing to degradation of the
catchment area. In suggesting mitigation measures, sustainable practices for the use of water and land
resources must be adopted to prevent and control environmental and social problems.
1.3.2  Farming System Approach
On the irrigation scheme level, a farming system approach was used to describe and analyse
environmental and socio-economic conditions. Issues related to soil contamination, water pollution,
the use and dangers of pesticides and fertilizers, health, and others have been identified. It is clear that
the irrigation activities will transform village life and the whole farming system in the Ruanda Majenje
area.
The success of the proposed mitigating measures will, therefore, depend on community involvement,
improvement of the socio-economic situation, capacity building, and proper upgrading, maintenance
and operation of the irrigation infrastructure. The latter should take into account the local environment
as well as the prevailing institutional, economic and social conditions.
1.3.3   Participatory Approach
A participatory approach was adopted in preparation for the environmental audit. This entailed seeking
information/experience from stakeholders (i.e. farmers, district and regional officers, RBMSIIP and
other institutions who have been involved in the project). In order to ensure effective participation and
cooperation it was necessary to inform stakeholders prior to the audit of the environmental and socio-
economic problems to be addressed. Their inputs have contributed to the development of more
realistic and appropriate mitigation measures.

1.4 METHODOLOGY
The methodology follows Tanzanian policy and legislation and the World Bank's policies on
environmental assessment (OP 4.0 and related policies and guidance documents).
Available reference documents were reviewed for purposes of identifying pertinent environmental and
social issues. Information was obtained on the Ruanda Majenje irrigation scheme before and after
construction as well as during operation. Several meetings were held with SIIP project staff. In
particular, the ECU team, which was involved in the Scheme Environmental Assessment, was
consulted to discuss background and potential issues. Subsequently, a ten-day field mission was
conducted in A ugust by the study team and members of E CU. The team w as u sed to: I) complete
further fieldwork at various sites in the Ruanda Majenje irrigation scheme, 2) collect additional
information, 3) work with the irrigation scheme management team, and 4) to liaise with the various
stakeholders including the district officials. During the field visits, the Public Consultation and
Disclosure Plan for disseminating the results of the Draft Environmental Audit were developed with
the ECU staff.
1.4.1  Consultation
Public c onsultations took p lace i n two phases. The first p hase took p lace during the E nvironmental
Audit (EA) preparation process. This initial stage allowed for the identification of the key
environmental issues and involved the gathering of information on stakeholder concerns and views of
potential environmental and social impacts. During the secondly phase, consultations allowed
stakeholders to review findings and give their comments.
1.4.2  Analytical Tools
The following methodologies were applied in the process of the study:
*   Participatoiy data collection
* Key informant interviews
* Socio-economic and environmental analysis
* Trend analysis of river flow and rainfall
* Water and soil quality analysis
* Geographical information systems (GIS)
Participatory Data Collection
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) involves problem analysis, ranking, proposal planning, role
assigning and timing. The role playing consisted of a facilitator who played the role of an advisor on
the d ifferent matters raised d uring the workshop ( those which the team was not i nformed a bout o r
aware of). In the final analysis, a Logical Framework Approach workshop (also known as ZOPP)
produced the Environmental Action Plan for the irrigation scheme.
Key Informant Interview
In addition to group discussions, information was also obtained from key informants. These were
generally staff from the Zonal Irrigation Office (ZIO), the District Executive Director (DED), farmers
of the Ruanda Majenje scheme, village officials (including village leaders), and others (agriculture and
irrigation officers who are residents in the community). Any inconsistent information was cross-
checked to ensure accuracy. Various officials conducted the crosschecking of information while
members of the study team facilitated the group discussions.
Socio-economic and Environment
A total of 106 household questionnaires (sample size) have been administered using the random
sampling method. This represents. Percent of households of the study area (upstream, down stream and
scheme level) 80 percent (80 questionnaires) of selected sample size has been administered at Majenje
village (scheme level), where as 10 percent (10 questionnaires) has been administered at Majenje
village (upstream village) and 10 percent (10 questionnaires) has been administered at Chamoto village
(downstream village).
4



Quantitative data relating to the socio-economic and environmental conditions of the scheme was
collected and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software.
Trend Analysis of River Flow and Rainfall
An investigation was conducted upstream and downstream on rivers that feed the scheme. Both
statistical and visual interpretations of variability analysis were applied. To further reveal any existence
of severe abstraction or flow regime changes, variability analysis was done month-to-month. Any
possible causes for the change in the flow regime were quantified. In this regard, annuual rainfall
variability for stations in or around the study area was noted. Three approaches were followed to tackle
the impacts problem:
!   Visual interpretation - Understanding and interpreting the annual time series and percent deviation
time series from the annual mean.
*   Testing randomness on the annual and monthly time series data - This test indicates that if the null
hypothesis tested for randomness is accepted, no flow regime change prevails in the record;
otherwise, it shows the flow regime is changed or there is a likely impact on the river upstream or
downstream.
*   Testing of breaks - At times a break or jump may be observed in the time series of flow. If, for
example, a huge volume of water is suddenly diverted to an irrigation area, segments before and
after the diversion can have different means.
Subsequent sections provide scheme level variability analysis and intelpretation of the results for both
flow and rainfall.
The flow and rainfall data were collected from various sources. Rainfall data were collected partly from
Tanzania Meteorology Agency (TMA) and partly from the Ministry of Water and Livestock
Development (MWL). Flow data were partly collected from the Ministry of Water and Livestock
(MWL) and partly from previous reports.
Water and Soil Analysis
Water and soil samples were analysed at the laboratory of the Department of Environmental
Engineering, University College of Lands and Architectural Studies (UCLAS) and Mlingano Soil
Laboratory. Procedures and analysis were done according to the Intemational Standards of Water and
Soil Analysis.
Geographical Information System (GIS)
Overlay maps and GIS were used to analyse sensitive/significant/relevant features of the irrigation
scheme area. Attributes and features that were mapped and analysed included: water bodies, land use,
patterns, vegetation cover, and cultural structures. The technique involved the physical overlaying of
individual topographic maps to provide a composite picture of the overall environmental and social
situation. Using ArcView 3. 1, analysis was carried out to link spatial and non-spatial data.
1.5 LIMITATIONS
Data quantification proved a difficult exercise due to the following reasons:
(i) There was insufficient baseline data related to environmental and socio-economic parameters.
(ii) Updated meteorological and hydrological data were not available.

2.       BASELINE OF THE IRRIGATION SCHENIE AREA
2.1      THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.1.1   Location
The Rwzanda Majenje irrigation scheme is located in Mbarali district. Mbeya region about 54 km to the
east of Mbeya Municipality. It lies at a latitude OS 49 Soullt and longitude of 33 50'East. The scheme
is situated at an altitude of approximately 1-200mi above sea level.

2.1.2  History of scheme
In the wake of heavy infestation of desert locusts irTigation activities were initiated in Ruanda Majenje
in 1950s to overcome the consequent problem of famine. In May 1997 water right to extract from the
Luanyo River was requested by the local community.
For several years the Mbeya - Iringa highway traversed near the scheme. However significant impact
on the scheme occurred in early 1990s. This is when the alignment of the Mbeya - Iringa highway was
moved relatively northwards of the scheme, there by changing the relative positions of human
settlements, vis-a-vis distances from the scheme to Igurusi of about 4 km. As the main rapidly growing
township of the area Igurusi overshadows all what happen in Ruanda. Indeed shift of road alignment
meant that the Ruanda village collapsed because to date most farmers actually reside at Igurusi
township, practising petty trading for most of their time, but for some of them also owning farm areas
in the scheme. Probably this is the major reason for land hoarding going on in the areas
2.1.3   Land use, ownership and acquisition pattern
Land use
In the scheme area, land use being practiced is almost exclusively irrigation agriculture. Crops being
cultivated include rice, maize, sweet potatoes, horticultural products e.g. tomatoes, onions, vegetables,
etc.
In down-stream areas, rain fed agriculture takes place parallel with irrigation agriculture, but the former
is more widespread than the latter. Moreover in these areas fruit cultivation is also going on e.g.
bananas, mangoes etc.
By tradition, the people in the area are agro-pastoralists.  But livestock numbers are not numerous
and they don't seem to cause disturbances.
Land ownership and acquisition pattern
Field studies show that 38.7% of the interviewed household acquired land by purchase while 26.4%
through inheritance 11.3% acquired land by clearing the bush or forest, 12.3% of land belongs to local
government authority and the remaining 11.3% used other means to acquire the land With respect to
land ownership/ acquisition patterns, about 38.7% acquired land through purchase, compared to 26.4%
who acquired through inheritance, 12.3% through village government, 1 1.3.% by bush clearing and the
rest;I 1.3 % miscellaneously. This is in tandem with the fact that the first inmmigrants (about 26.4% of
population) came into the area as early as before 1950s followed by a twenty -year slow-down in
immigration between 1960s to 1980s only to pick up rapidly after that It is therefore apparent that the
first immigrants are presently dying away (hence high proportion of inheritances), and at the same
time, some heirs decide to sell away (hence rise in purchases). Figure 2.3.2 illustrates various means of
acquired land in Ruanda Majenje.
More farmers own between one to three farms. Few households, i.e. 5%, own more than four farms
while 9% have none. Table 2.1 illustrates the number of farms owned by the household.

2.2     BIOPHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.2.1   Climatic Data
The nearest meteorological station to the scheme to which climatic data could be referred is located at
the Igurusi Meteorological station (No.98.3331). The geographical position of the station is Latitude 08
50'--and Longitude 35 50', with elevation of about I lOOm.
Ruanda Majenje Scheme lies in a semi-arid climate receiving about 681 mm of rainfall. In addition,
despite its meagreness, the rainfall is also highly unreliable in terms of distribution.
The amount is also variable year. Another characteristic of rainfall at Ruanda Majenje is mono-modal
in nature. All these rainfall characteristics make it very difficult for agriculture development depending
only on rainfall. Rainfall starts in November and ends in April with peak in either January of February.
The rest of the months in a year are dry.
The mean monthly temperatures vary from 25.80C in November and 21.1 °C in June.
For the Rwanda Majenje scheme, climatic data from only one station in the project area was collected
and duly analysed. The station was the above-mentioned Igurusi Meteorological Station no.98.3331 .A
summary of the climatic data is presented in Table no.2.2.1 below.

2.2.2   Water Resources
The Ruanda Majemje scheme abstracts water from Luanyo River, which has a catchment area of 12 sq.
km upstream of the intake. Luanyo River is a perennial river with variable discharge seasonally. It
starts from the steeps from the slopes of Poroto Mountains and has a very steep gradient. It is a
tributary of Mambi River. Luanyo River has no gauging station and dependable flow information was
transferred from a nearby station at Chimala River (at Chitekelo). Chimala River with a reference code
number of 1KA7A has a catchment area of 165 sq. km. at Chitekelo.
Accordingly, the estimated mean and dependable flows of Luanyo at the intake of Ruanda Majenje
scheme is given below.

The scheme has a water right number RBWO 80 issued in March 1998 for abstracting 15,552,000 I/day
for a period of November to May and 3,456,000 I/day for a period of June to October. The available
estimated flow at Lwenyo appears to be sufficient for most of the months except from November to
January with the water right less than the available flow in the river. The minimum and the maximum
water right converted to cumecs is 0.04 and 0.18 cumecs respectively.

Water use conflict
There is no serious wlater use conflict in Rwvanda Majenie irrigation scheme. sinply because demands
for irrigation agricultural activities are not high.
Water quality
A total of seven (7) w ater samples were collected from the Ruanda Majenje irrigation scheme. The
sampling locations wvere systematically choseni so as to track on the quality of wlater as it trickles dow-n
the ilTigation schelme. Samples were taken fromi the intake and downstreamn end. Others w-ere collected
within the irTigation farms (chamiels) themselv-es as shown in the map below. More detailed on w-ater
quality impact on up-and dow n stream anid irrigation level impacts are presented in Chapter 7.

2.2.4  Biodiversity at the scheme
Villages surrounding Rwanda Majenje scheme are themselves still surrounded by woodlands and
bushlands characteristic of semi-arid areas of Tanzania. However, no species of wildlife can be found
around.
2.3 SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.3.1   Population
According to the scheme improvement assessment (SIA) of 1998 indicate the Ruanda Majenje village
had 445 households 40 being women headed households. The village population was 2152 out of
whom 1526 people were able to work and 729 were not (these included children, old people and
disabled). Average number of persons in the household in Ruanda Majenje was 5. According to field
data population around the Ruanda Majenje scheme is 3225 people population with 620 households.
The area comprises seven (7) hamlets population characteristic by sex is presented in Table.

Percentage        48.7         51.3         100.0
Population characteristics by sex indicate that there are slightly more women than men; namely: 5 1.0%
(for women) compared to 48.7% (for men).
2.3.2  Immigration patterns
Field data indicates that massive immigration took place before 1950. For the next 30 years there was
very minor immigration but then only to pick-up especially after 1981 to date. Table presents summary
of this migration patterns

2.3.2  Occupations
The potential irrigation area of Rwanda Majenje scheme is 450 ha of which 413 were involved in the
new improvement, while the remaining 37 ha have been left untouched The Luanyo River separates
the two areas.
A number of villagers who may benefit from the Rwanda Majenje scheme come to a total population of
about 150 households, most of whom are farmers presently relying on agriculture (either irrigated
and/or rain fed agriculture) as the main activity for their livelihood and to a lesser extent on livestock
keeping. About 82.1% practice non-irrigation (i.e. rain fed) cultivation, 9.4% only irrigation
cultivation, and the rest (i.e. about 9.4%) miscellaneous activities.
By far the majority of the farmers i.e. about 61.3% of them own two farms. The cluster continues on
both side of the histogram: namely for people with three farms at 18.9% and for people with one farm
at 14.2%. Few people have more than four famis; 4.7% and even fewer with no farm; 0.9%.
Furthermore, the majority of farm sizes i.e. over 70.7% range from 2.0 to 5 acres: very few (2.0%) of
less than one acre, but about 26 4. 1% of more than six to seven acres.
With respect to land ownership/ acquisition pattems, about 38.7% acquired land through purchase,
compared to 26.4% who acquired through inheritance, 12.3% through village govermment, 11.3.% by
bush clearing and the rest; 11.3 % miscellaneously. This is in tandem with the fact that the first
inunigrants (about 2 6.4% of population) came into the area as early as before I 950s followed by a
twenty -year slow-down in immigration between 1960s to 1980s only to pick up rapidly after that It is
therefore apparent that the first immigrants are presently dying away (hence high proportion of
inheritances), and at the same time, some heirs decide to sell away (hence rise in purchases).
Cultivation practise
Farming at Ruanda Majenje is done both n rainy and dry season. However the main farming activities
are done during the rain season where predominant crops are paddy and maize. During dry season,
maize, onions, tomatoes and green vegetables are planted. Farming is conducted with minimal use of
inputs like, use of improved seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and insecticides due to lack of capital these
results to poor crop yield. H owever few farmers use fertilizers like C AN, U REA, DAP and S A to
improve the soil fertility.
Income activities
Several farmers about 87% depend on rain fed cultivation as shown in the table below:

Livestock keeping
People in Ruanda Majenje keep livestock e.g. I - 4 cows, I - 4 goats etc, however the percentage of
households with no higher 81.1 and 68.9% respectively while the majority of households keep free
range chickens

Energy Supply
Fuel-wood and charcoal are the main sources of energy for domestic purposes; especially for cooking.
Charcoal is however considered rather expensive. Both electricity and kerosene are used mainly for
lighting. Stone cooker is used by most villagers.

Marketing and information
The findings show that farmers' access to market and market information is not a problem. It was
found out that only minorities of the farmers depend on local buyers. Most farmers sell their products
to middlemen who come all the way from as far as Mbeya, Iringa, and Dar-es-Salaam .In some cases
the middlemen even come from neighbouring countries of the Congo, Zambia and Malawi. Few
farmers sell directly to local buyers and yet others produce for their own domestic consumption.
Education
Rwanda Majenje population constitute people with different levels of educational background. Women
are holding high percentage in illiteracy and low percentage in higher education. About 96.06 % has
attained the primary school education while 3.84% attained secondary school education. The schools
cultivate maize, and rice. The have planted trees around the schools as a windbreak
Literacy level of the irrigators was very low .18% had no education, 73% were standard seven
(Primary school) leavers, 7% attended adult education, 2% were form four (ordinary secondary school)
leavers.
Farmers at Ruanda Majenje village depend mostly on family labour in conducting their activities.
Social study at this village has revealed that for the families which comprised of two wives or more
(polygamous). Men and women have their own field to cultivate. After the women finish working in
their fields, they work at their husbands fields.
Women fields are the purpose of food for the family while the man's fields are for income generation
to pay for school fees, clothing, and medical treatment and so on.
Few house holds hire labour especially during the peak periods of farm activities. Some people
mobilise their neighbours to work on their fields, after working they celebrate by drinking local brew.
2.3.3  Existing facilities near the irrigation scheme
There are several institutions and social services. There are two primary schools, Majenje and Mambi.
Mambi is a new school. T he villages have local health staffs that are trained to run infant clinics.
Other health services are available in Igurusi village e.g. dispensaries and medical shops. Social
services available in the village: club for local brew, petrol station, tap water, road (from Mbeya to Dar
es Salaam) pass through the village.
2.3.4   Extension Services
The farmers adequately enjoy extension services as summarized in Tables 2.13 and 2.14 below.

3.      DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND STAKEHOLDERS
3.1 SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF THE USANGU WETLAND AND
ITS CATCHMENT
The Sustainable Management of the Usangu Wetland and its Catchment (SMUWC) project began in
September 1998, in response to the seasonal drying up of the Great Ruaha River at Msembe in the
Ruaha National Park, starting in 1993. At that time this was linked in many minds to water shortages at
Mtera reservoir, which in turn led to severe national electrical shortages in the mid-1990s. Low and
zero flows in the Great Ruaha River during the dry season were attributed by many to land use
activities in the Usangu catchment. With these points in mind,
The SMUWC project was initiated with two broad thrusts:
*   A technical investigation into what was happening to the water, and the causes of the problem
*   A community outreach programme, to understand human use and management of water and other
natural resources, and to understand how these might be changed to release more water to the
Great Ruaha River.
In the long term, these were to come together in the development of a management strategy for
Usangu, to be agreed on by all stakeholders and informed by SMUWC findings. The project seeks to
bring these stakeholders together to develop a shared vision of the future. This will lead to a strategic
framework for Usangu that will prioritise and guide activities, encourage cross-sectoral co-ordination,
and ensure the incorporation of environmental considerations into development planning at an early
stage. The first phase of the SMUWC project ran for 21/2 years, ended 31 March 2001.
3.2     WATER USERS ASSOCIATIONS
The Ruanda Majenje iiTigation scheme has only the Water Users Association. It started in 1998 and is a
registered association in the Ministry of Home Affairs with a registration number: SO 9596.WUA
holds the annual general meeting (AGM) which is attended by all 330 members. This is the top most
organ of the organization, meeting once a year and normally in June or early July.
Under the AGM is found the management committee, which has twelve members, six being female and
the other six being male. Each of the three villages has four members in the water committee making a
total of twelve members.
The chairperson of WUA is among the twelve members of the management committee. However,
Secretary o f W UA is e lected b y AGM a nd i s not a member o f t he management c ommnittee. O ffice
tenure is three years and members of the management committee are allowed to re-apply for another
term.
The management committee has three-sub committees namely, resource management, supervision and
constluction. Each of these sub committees has four members with well defined gender balance. The
organization chart for Ruanda Majenje WUA is given in Figure 3-1
The aims of water user's association are:
a) To promote irrigation agriculture.
b) To control irrigation agriculture activities.
c) To collect and daily represent member views to whoever wishes to attend to them.
d) To build way's and means for strengthening irrigation agricultural activities e.g. capital/credit
facilities etc.
21



3.3     STAKEHOLDER'S ROLE
3.3.1   Identified stakeholders
In order of vested powers in decision-making, enforcement roles and the identified stakeholders are as
follows:
*   District Council's i.e., through the District Executive Director (DED) with his/her relevant
committee a nd functional o fficers e .g. D istrict Agricultural a nd Livestock D evelopment 0 fficer
(DALDO), District Water Engineer, District Council Development office, etc.
*   Ward Executive Officers i.e., through the Ward Executive Officers (WEO) with their relevant
committee and functional offices, e.g. Ward Agricultural Officer.
*   Village Executive Officer i.e. through the village Executive Officers (VEO) with their relevant
committee and functional officer e.g. Village Agricultural Officer.
*   Water users association.
*   Farmers' groups/associations.
*   Private organization, e.g. NGOs, CBOs, etc
*   Donors
3.3.2   Analysis of stakeholders
In general for sake of sustainability influential role of all the identified stakeholders is synergetic. For
example, at the highest level, the District Council chaired by the council chairperson with all its
relevant conumittees and functional officers has to be fully involved so that they can put in their agenda
and plans financial issues of the scheme. In that way further development of the scheme will get both
the support and the authority it requires.
Likewise even at the lowest level (i.e. at village government/farmers associations' level) the
stakeholders need to be fully involved because being at grass-roots; they are capable of providing
solution on a routine basis.
3.3.3   Involvement of stakeholders in environmental audit and implementation of ESMP
In view of the above therefore different stakeholders were and will be involved in environmental
auditing and implementation of ESMP as follows:
Water users association
*   Managing water resources within schemes
*   Farmers associations/groups
*   Carrying out routine activities/controlling actions
*   Identifying/formulating required action to VEO.
*   Saving and credit organisations.
Village Executive Office (VEO)
Grass-roots representation of local government system.
Mobilizes, receives, identified required action and forwards them to WEO for considerations.
Ward Executive Officer (WEO)
*   Grass roots representative of local government system.
*   Mobilizes, receives checks and controls identified required action and forwards them to District
Council (through relevant its committees).
District Council
*   District development planning.
*   Mobilizes, receives and deliberates identified required action and incolporates them into the
district development plan for financing.
*   Finance/overseas implementation of the identified actions.
Private Organizations/NGOs/CBOs
* Promotes identification and implementation of identified action.
22



* Helps to secure funding of the actions.
Donor agency
*   Promotes development cooperation.
*   Finances/overseas implementation of action plans
3.3.4   Ensuring incorporation of concern of stakeholders in ESMP
In order to ensure the concerns of stakeholders are incorporated in ESMP, it is proposed that the
following measures be taken after finalization/submission of the ESMP:
Seeking government approval of ESMP
This government approval of ESMP is imperative because the councils are not allowed to implement a
plan unknown to the government. Under these circumstances the ESMP has to be approved firstly by
MAFS, NEMC and then by PO-RALG.
Dissemination of the ESMP to relevant district
After government approval, then the ESMP should be disseminated to relevant districts for
implementation. This should be followed by a series of workshops, seminar, etc. to enable public
discussion on the ESMP. The discussion should start at district level then percolate to lower and lower
levels as indicated above.
23



4. COMPLIANCE WITH TANZANIA'S POLICIES, LEGAL
FRAMEWORK AND WITH WORLD BANK'S SAFE
GUARD POLICIES
4.1     NATIONAL POLICIES
Relevant policies with a bearing on agricultural and rural development in general, and irrigation in
particular, and therefore Igomelo irTigation scheme, have been examined. These include the National
Environment policy, the Land policy, the National Water policy, the Energy policy, the National
Agriculture policy, Draft Rural Development Policy, Poverty Reduction Strategy, Draft Rural
Development Strategy, Agriculture Sector Development Strategy, the Forest policy and the Wildlife
policy. These policies affect direct key sectoral activities and were examined because they
automatically affect important land uses in the area vis-a-vis: agriculture, water, livestock, energy,
forest and wildlife.
4.1.1  National Environment Policy of 1997
Implementation of the river basin management and smallholder irrigation project and particularly the
irrigation schemes under operation is consistent with the overall objectives of the National
Environment Policy. The policy provides a framework for multi-sectoral participation and cooperation
to achieve sustainable development; and seeks to ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources for
meeting the basic needs of present and future generations, without degrading the environmental
resource base or risking health and safety. The policy emphasize the need to prevent and control
degradation of land, water, vegetation and air which constitute our life suppolt systems; to conserve
and enhance our natural and man made heritage; including biological diversity; to improve the
condition and productivity of degraded areas including rural and urban settlements; to raise public
awareness and understanding of the essential linkages between environment and development and
promote individual and community participation in environmental action, among others.
Furthermore the policy calls for improved agricultural practices, and better utilization of the scarce
water for irrigation, ensure efficiency, minimize looses and avoid salinisation as well as proper use of
agrochemicals to minimize reduce/pollution of water sources.
The design, re-construction and operation of the schemes have taken into account the above
considerations. Additionally, planned training of farmers in effective and efficient management of
water resources intends to contribute to achievement of the objectives of the environment policy.
4.1.2  Agriculture Policy 1997
The implementation of the RBM-SIIP on the basis of farmer groups and rural community participation
is consistent with the Agricultural and Livestock Policy (ALP) of 1997, which provides policy
guidance on the development of the agricultural sector. The policy seeks to ensure that the direction
and pattern of development in the sector meets economic, social and environmental objectives. The
policy aims at accelerated growth of production and exports through among others, assuring national
food security, developing and introducing new technologies which will increase productivity of labour
and land; promote integrated and sustainable use and management of natural resources and providing
agricultural support services.
The smallholder irrigation projects aims at providing agricultural support services; improve income of
the rural poor, promote rational use of water resources and introduce appropriate technologies among
others.
4.1.3  Land Policy of 1995
The National Land Policy of 1995 provides incentives for efficient use of land and its resources. It
seeks to promote and ensure a secure land tenure system, encourage optimal use of land resources and
facilitate broad-based social and economic development without up setting or endangering the
ecological balance of the environment. Farmer groups and communities participating in the project
have acquired customary rights of occupancy from their respective villages and some villages are
24



processing granted rights. Both granted and customary rights of occupancy secure land ownership add
incentives for farmers to maintain and develop their farms accordingly, reduce land use conflicts and
increase the value of land.
4.1.4   Water Policy of 2002
The National Water Policy (2002) provides a comprehensive framework for promoting optimal,
sustainable and equitable development and use of water resources for sustainable development. The
policy seeks to ensure supply of good quality of water to meet domestic, environmental and other
priority development purpose. Emphasis is placed on the need to ensure more efficient utilization of
existing water resources through institutional improvements, proper soil management to prevent soil
erosion and flooding and improved monitoring to control water quality and contamination from
industrial sewerage and excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers. These objectives requite on
integrated and holistic p lanning and management in a reas, water use and d isposal o f e ffluents. The
planned project objectives are supportive of the objectives of the water policy through education,
awareness and training on better agricultural practices, effective and efficient utilization of water, water
conservation, and application of agrochemicals to minimize pollution of water sources to m ention a
few.
4.1.5   Forest Policy of 1998
The main objective of the National Forestry Policy is to enhance contribution of the forestry sector in
sustainable socio-econoniic development of the country, as well as conservation and management of
the natural resource-base for the benefit of both the represent and future generations. In view of the
general objective, the policy focuses its intervention in the following four area (i) forest land
management
Conservation of the forestry resources in the upper catchment is crucial for ensuring sustainable flows
of water for irrigation purposes and other uses. The establishment of the scheme is thus an extra
incentive for undertaking conservation measures in the catchment area of Mt. Meru.
4.1.6   Wildlife Policy of 1998
The main Wildlife Policy is to seek involvement of a broader section of the society in wildlife
conservation, and in particular the rural local communities, as well as the private sector with only a
role of stimulating and duly guiding both the rural local communities and the private sector by
administering, r egulating a nd p romoting management o f wildlife r esources. I n view o f t his general
objective, the policy facilities it interventions in the following area: (i) wildlife protection (i.e.
incorporating management and development of protected areas) (ii) wildlife utilization (i.e.
incorporating promotion of establishment of Wildlife Management Areas conservation as well as
management measures and (iii) international corporation and coordination. Within the scheme there
are no wildlife management areas. The developments have also concentrated on the already existing
scheme, with therefore little likelihood of encroaching into wildlife areas.
4.1.7   Energy Policy of 2002 (Draft)
Sufficient and efficient supply of energy is crucial for national development. The objective of the
energy policy is therefore to contribute to the national socio-economic development process by
providing an efficient energy production, procurement, transportation, distribution and end-use system
in an environmentally sound manner and with due regard to gender issues.
Provision of energy for scheme farmers in a convenient manner will allow more time for women
farmers to participate in farm activities. It is against this background that communities are being
encouraged to use fuel-efficient charcoal and wood stoves.
4.2 LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The smallholder irrigation project will be implemented in the overall context legal framework that
governs agricultural and rural development. Some of the few legal frameworks that are supportive of
the project include but not limited to: -
25



4.2.1   Environment Legislation
Cuirently Tanzania lacks a single comprehensive environmental legal framework or environmental
law. Efforts are underway to prepare such a framework. To-date, the management of environment and
natural resources is governed by fragmented sectoral pieces of legislation that are yet to be fully
harmonized.
There are some guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Government is
working on an act to make EIAs mandatory for all development projects. In this regard an
environmental legislation aimed at "promoting and managing environmental conservation in the
country" is in the making
The term "environmental" legislation incorporates nearly one hundred acts and ordinances and several
additional subsidiary legislation from all sectors of the economy, which affect the environment.
However, given the broad policy goal of achieving sustainable development and the specific policy
objectives, issues of unsustainable utilization of resources, deforestation, desertification, salinization,
land degradation, pollution of water resources, and impacts on rural land use have been emphasized.
The design and operational strategy of the Igomelo scheme have taken these legal considerations into
account.
4.2.2   NEMC Act no.19 of 1983
This act establishes the National Environment Management Council as a statutory body responsible for
advising and coordinating environmental management issues. Among the many functions of the
Council, the act seeks to provide a fiamework for evaluation of existing and proposed development
policies, programmes, plans and activities of both public and private that are likely to affect the
environment and recommend measures to ensure adequate account of environmental effects.
Furthermore, the act provides for the specification of environmental standards, norms, criteria,
guidelines for the protection and maintenance of the quality of the environment. Cooperation between
government, local authorities and bodies engaged in environmental programmes can stimulate public
and private participation in environmental and natural resource management.
Relevant legislation pertaining to agricultural development in general, and iiTigation in particular and
how it relates to the proposed projects, including Igomelo irrigation scheme was examined. The
following are the sectoral environment legislations.
4.2.3   Land Act no.4 and Village Land Act no. 5 of 1999
Both laws became operational in May 2001, following the approval of their regulations. The acts seek
control land use and clarify controversial issues pertaining to ownership of land and land-based
resources, transactions on land and land administration. The new land act identifies thuee categories of
land i.e. village (customary land); public/gazetted land (i.e. national parks, forest reserves) and general
land that does not fall in any of the above two categories for private investment.
Implementation of the project is consistent with both legislations. For purposes of controlling land in
the village and to protect it from alienation to foreign investors, village governments would be given
documents indicating their boundaries. However, in order to give value to land there is a need for
completion of the process of land survey and demarcation which amounts to land titling and allocation
to different land use categories to speed up investment in agriculture.
Land allocation at the Igomelo scheme was guided by existing land tenure arrangements which are in
line with these legal provisions. Both men and women have received irrigation plots.
4.2.4  Wildlife Act 1974 (with amendments of 1978)
Wildlife act provides for protection, conservation, development, regulations and control in both
acquisition and utilization of products of both fauna and flora. To this end, therefore the Act stipulates
"modus operandi", i.e. required restrictions in the following areas (i) in protected areas: namely game
26



reserves, game controlled areas, partial game reserves, national parks, etc. (ii) proper procedures in
hunting, capturing and photographing of wildlife and (iii) proper handling of trophies. Furthermore, in
the wake of the Wildlife policy, which stipulates for villagers' involvement in Wildlife Management
Areas (WMA), the Act also provides modalities and procedures for designation, operation and
involvement of local communities in the management of the WMAs. Within the scheme there are no
wildlife management areas.
4.2.5  Water Acts of 1974
As mentioned before the Water Acts principally seek to ensure that water is utilized without sectoral
conflicts, and without causing pollution. This is the spirit of both Act no. 42 of 1974 and Act no. 10 of
1981. They were enacted to control and protect water resources. The legislation defines "water" as all
water flowing over the surface of the ground or contained or flowing in or from a spring or stream or
natural lake, swamp or beneath a watercourse. The Act places a regime of water rights to govern
access to water use. Pollution control nonns and standards are embodied in the water rights.
Apart from incorporating pollution control and having prevention conditionality in the water rights,
the Act goes a step further by putting in place a regime in consent with discharge of effluent. Under
Section 15 A (1) of the Act, no person may discharge of effluent from any commercial, industrial or
other trade waste systems into receiving waters without a consent duly granted by a Water Officer.
The Act also contains two schedules, which set standards for receiving waters and effluent. The
Igomelo irrigation has a water right in which the rights and obligations of scheme operators, the
farmers, are stipulated.
4.2.6  Forest Act 1974
The Forest Act deals with the protection of forests and forest products in forest reserves and
restrictions and prohibitions in forest reserves. The forest management plans are administered under
the Forest Ordinance (1957). Any contravention of the restrictions and prohibition is considered an
offence under this ordinance and subject to enforcement. However, the law is being revised to meet
new requirements under a new Forest Policy. There is no forest land within the scheme area.
4.2.7  The Town and Country Planning Ordinance, Cap 378 of 1956
The Town and Country Planning Ordinance Cap 378, Part IV provides for control of urban
development while implementing a scheme of land development. Important aspects include the
designation and allocation of adequate land for solid waste disposal in any urban scheme. The law
further stipulates the design of a good sewerage system to manage liquid waste from various major
water consumers. The law empowers local authorities to enforce such schemes and punishments as
stipulated in the Act. The law further empowers neighbours and any individual to take to court anyone
who injuriously affects others due to his/her unhygienic activities. The Water Users' Association at the
scheme may p ass b y-laws t o this e ffect. H owever, they would n eed s upport from I ocal a uthorities,
particularly with regard to enforcement.
4.2.8  Local Government Act (District and Urban Authorities) Acts of 1982
This Act provides detailed responsibility for urban and district councils in the administration of their
day-to-day activities. Waste management is pointed out as one of the activities to be managed by
urban authorities. This Act is the backbone of the Village Government's operation, powers,
responsibilities of various local authorities and structure. The law requires that the Village Assemblies
act as the apex authorities in decision-making processes at the village level. However, such meetings
rarely take place in most villages, leaving decisions to be made by few leaders without having
consulted with the village public. This being the case, many Village Governments fail to bring about
development for their villagers.
4.2.9  Land Use Planning Commission Act of 1984
The National Land Use Commission (NLUC) was established under this Act as the principal advisory
organ of the Government on all matters related to land use. Among other things, it recommends
measures to ensure that the Government policies, including those for development and conservation of
27



land are in harmony. It also takes adequate account of their effects on land use and seeks for the
advancement of scientific knowledge of changes in land use; it encourages the development of
technology to prevent, or minimize adverse effects that endanger man's health and his/her welfare; it
also specifies standards, norms and criteria for the protection of beneficial uses and the maintenance of
the quality of the land.
In accordance with the functions mentioned above, the Commission can indirectly help to prevent or
minimize pollution by restricting location of potential and actual pollution sources. The major issue is
the sectoralisation of the Government's operations while neglecting holistic view of each activity on
land and their impacts on others. There is a tendency of each sector making decisions without
consulting t he o thers. F or e xample, W ildlife D ivision c an d esignate a n a rea for g ame conservation
without consulting the Agriculture and Food Security Divisions to avoid grabbing land for agriculture
activities.
The Igomelo scheme is included in the National Irrigation Development Plan which has been officially
adopted by the Government.
4.2.10 The Land Acquisitions Act of 1967
The L and A cquisition A ct g ives p owers t o t he P resident t o t ake " land" from p rivate o ccupants f or
public purposes when the public's interests to do so. The new Land laws declare all land in Tanzania
as "Public Land" and vested to the President as trustee of all citizens. However, the Land Acquisition
law has been watered down by the New Land Laws, which restrict the President's powers not to
acquire land without negotiation with the owners. Again the new laws stipulate detailed
compensations to be paid on any acquired land that amounts to deterring the President to do so without
careful considerations.
4.2.11 By-Laws
All villages in Tanzania are allowed to form by-laws. This has been done in Ruanda Majenje village
whose by-laws address proper use of land and water to ensure public health.
4.3     NATIONAL STRATEGIES
In order to guide national development more effectively and systematically, Tanzania has prepared a
number of strategies aiming at operationalizing the various policies in key sectors. Some of the
strategies that have a bearing on irrigation development and discussed below include: the Government
Vision 2025, Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Rural Sector Development Strategy and the
Agricultural Sector Development Strategy.
4.3.1   Government Development Vision 2025
The Government Development Policy 2025 is guiding framework for national development to the year
2025. It aims at achieving a high quality livelihood for the people, characterized by sustainable and
equitable growth. It also aims at attaining good governance through the rule of law and at developing a
strong and competitive economy by moving from a less developed country (LDC) to a middle-income
country by 2025.
Scheme irTigation committees and water users' associations are potential nuclei for promoting good
govemance and democratic practices in rural villages. By adhering to common practices and cropping
patterns, farmers will realize more or less equal and higher incomes.
4.3.2   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of 2000
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) concentrates on efforts aimed reducing income poverty;
improving human capabilities, survival and social well-being. The PRSP has set medium term goals to
be achieved by the y ear 2010 through s ustaining m acroeconomic s tability, rural s ector development
and export, and private sector development.

Improvement of food supply and security is key to infant and maternity health as well as to income
generation. A number of activities, including construction and consultancy services have been
performed by the private sector. This has contributed to local capacity building.
4.3.3   Rural Sector Development Strategy (RDS) of 2000
The Strategy aims at reducing rural poverty as means of managing resources sustainably, since
widespread poverty in rural areas compels people, in search for survival, to over-exploit the natural
resources. The RDS envisages the following:
*   Revising legislation and regulations with a view to enhancing coimnunity participation in
management and utilization of natural resources.
*   Revising the licensing procedures related to utilization of natural resources.
*   Introducing procedures for cost and benefit sharing of natural resources.
*   Introducing EIA as a pre-requisite for all development projects.
*   Developing procedures for natural resources with regard to entitlement of the state, communities
and individuals.
*   Developing procedures for conflict resolution in matters of natural resources utilization.
The Ruanda Majenje scheme will contribute to the principle objective of the RDS of poverty reduction
through raising incomes and better resource utilization. The work of the water users' association
involves a number of elements targeted by the Strategy.
4.3.4   Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) of 2001
The ASDS, which was formulated through a broad based consultative process, aims at transforming the
agricultural sector into a m odernized, commercial, highly productive and profitable s ector that sh all
utilize natural r esources i n a sustainable manner a nd sh all a ct a s a n e ffective b asis f or i ntersectoral
linkages.
The ASDS will address the key weaknesses facing the agricultural sector, which include low
productivity, poor coordination and limited capacity, underdeveloped supporting facilities, erosion of
the natural resource base, inappropriate technology, dependency on rain fed agriculture, impediments
to food market access as well as low public and private expenditure levels.
The investments and other interventions made in improving the irrigation system at Ruanda Majenje
are highly relevant and well in line with the targets of the ASDS. These improvements will contribute
to higher productivity, income generation, better water and land utilization, all of which are targets of
the Strategy.
4.4 COMPLIANCE WITH WORLD BANK SAFEGUARD POLICIES
A list of World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies is listed in Appendix 2. This part of
the report contains an analysis of the compliance of the Ruanda Majenje scheme with the Bank
Safeguard policies. It is based on intensive field observation by the study team, coupled with
discussions held with the farmers and other local people, including village and district officials as well
as project staff. The report is also based on the review of various existing documents.
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)
In order to ascertain that project proposals submitted for funding are environmentally sound and
sustainable, the World Bank requires that Environmental Assessment (EA) of the proposals be carried
out. An Environmental Assessment (EA) of Ruanda Majenje Scheme was carried out as part of the
overall base line study of the scheme. The assessment also built on the work done earlier by the
Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.
In view of the present day nature of activities at the scheme, it was found that the scheme can not bring
about adverse environmental impacts, and that depending on proper handling of several factors; e.g.
land tenure issues, it's sustainability may also be ensured.
29



The findings of the study were discussed with farmers as well as local community leaders at meetings
held at the scheme and also with district officials at their district headquarters. Their opinions and ideas
were taken into account in finalising the Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan.
From the above-mentioned observation the Ruanda Majenje Irrigation Scheme is considered to be in
compliance with the Bank Environmental Assessment.
Natural Habitat (OP/BP 4.04)
Ruanda Majenje irrigation scheme is relatively an old established scheme. It has, however, only
recently been rehabilitated and improved. There are therefore no neighbouring natural habitats which
require protection and conservation. The scheme does not therefore trigger the Natural Habitat
safeguard policy of the World Bank.
Pest Management (OP 4.09)
Use of pesticides at the Ruanda Majenje scheme is currently at low level. The farmers, through the
extension service, are encouraged to apply IPM approaches. Farmers are also trained on safe use,
storage and disposal of chemicals. These efforts will lead to greater compliance with the Integrated Pest
Management policy of the World Bank, than present day situation.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
As mentioned above, Ruanda Majenje is a relatively old scheme, which has, also only recently been
rehabilitated. The farmers have been living in the area since mid-1950s, in the wake of policy of
rewarding land to war veterans at the end of 2nd World War. However, changes of route alignment of
the nearby Mbeya to Iringa road highway has profoundly affected patterns of the human settlements as
well as land ownership and subsequently farming activities. At the scheme area, however, no
resettlements have had to be carried out. The scheme does not, therefore, trigger the Involuntary
Resettlement safeguard policy of the World Bank.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)
As mentioned above, there was rapid growth of human settlements only in mid-1950s. The growth
involved mainly the local indigenous people themselves. They are presently permanently settled in the
area, and in response to the questionnaire, no household indicated plans to move away. In view of the
above, it is evident that project activities at Ruanda Majenje would not trigger the indigenous policy of
the World Bank.
Forests (OP/BP 4.36)
Neither the up-stream nor the down-stream areas of the scheme have forested areas which may be
adversely impacted by project activities of the scheme For this reason, project activities at the scheme
may not trigger the World Bank's safe guard policy on Forests.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37)
There are presently no dams, and moreover none are under consideration at Ruanda Majenje irrigation
scheme. The scheme does not therefore trigger this safe guard policy of the World Bank.
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03 - draft OP 4.11)
The scheme does not have movable or immovable objects, sites, natural features and landscapes that have
archaeological, palaentological, historical, architectural, religious, aesthetic, or cultural significance. Therefore, the
scheme does not trigger this safeguard policy.
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50)
The scheme is using the Mbarali River, which does not flow, to any other states. The scheme does not therefore
trigger this safeguard policy.
Project in Disputed Areas (OP/BP 7.60)
The scheme does not operate in disputed areas and it does not therefore trigger this safeguard policy.
Consultation and Disclosure Requirements (BP 17.50)
The findings of study and recommendations have been discussed with farmers' representatives at the
scheme. They endorsed the findings and recommendations. The Environmental Audit report will be
submitted to the relevant government authorities for review and approval prior to the disclosure
through newspapers, district offices, MAFS, and government websites.

5.      TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES USED IN ASSESSING AND
ANALYZING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
5.1     INTRODUCTION
There are several tools and techniques recommended predication environmental and social impacts as
follows:
* Checklists
* Interaction matrixes
* Network
* Geographical Information System
* Mathematical modeling
In undertaking the assignment, the following tools and techniques were applied for assessing and
analyzing of environmental and social impacts of the irrigation scheme in the process of the EA study:
Checklist
The environmental checklist is used for physical observations in the assessment of the irrigation
scheme.
Geographical information system (GIS)
GIS has been used in analysing hydrological changes and trends in water quality, land use/vegetation
study, etc. of the irrigation scheme.
5.2     IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Impact assessment is a complex activity and is mainly based and depends on range and type of baseline
date. Depending on available baseline data mainly techniques can be applied to study this for example
the following:
* Mathematical models (such as groundwater and river models, noise propagation models, air and
water dispersion models, income multipliers)
* Physical models (such as hydrological models for trend analysis, wind tunnels and hydraulic
models for estuaries)
* Scientific experience, judgment and observations
*   Structured/semi-structured approaches (e.g. changes in landscape and social impacts)
Most EA use a mixture of these techniques - many appear to rely heavily on the latter two. Impacts
analysis and assessment must also provide information on the following aspects:
* Duration (time period over which they will occur)
* Likelihood or probability of occurrence (very likely or unlikely, etc.)
* Reversibility (natural recovery or aided by human intervention)
* Area affected (size and whether near or far from the project)
* Number (and characteristics) of people likely to be affected and their locations
* Trans-bourndary aspects - do impacts cross-national borders?-
Due to lack of baseline data and time constraints the consultant was not able to conduct impact
assessment based on mathematical and physical models for the environment audit. For environmental
and social impacts structured/semi-structured approaches, focused group discussions, scientific
experience, observations and judgment and GIS were used to quantify and evaluate impacts.

6. CONSULTATIONS WITH COMMUNITY AND FARMERS
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Briefing Meetings
Briefing meetings were held with Village Goverinuent Leaders, Farmers group leader and village
agricultural extension officer prior to the holding of the focus group discussions.
Focus Group discussion
The focus group discussions were conducted with village governments, farmers' groups and women
groups. Data and information on issues like water and land use conflicts were thence gathered.
Participants
During the meetings and focus group discussions, the study team witnessed active participation of both
men and women. The size of the focus groups ranged from 13 to 16. Guided by skilled and
experienced facilitators participants deliberated on a variety of issues regarding agricultural production
and environmental conservation. The participants contributed freely to the discussions and had diverse
opinions on same issues. The group size and the skills of the facilitator helped to make the meetings
successful.
6.2 MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY
STAKEHOLDERS
Inadequate water in river
The farmers explained that they are experiencing shortage of water in the river, which is caused by
wanton cutting of trees at the upstream and around the source, but also the practice by villagers to set
wild bush fires. In turn the effects include shortage of water for irrigation and low yields resulting to
low income and poverty.
Lack of sanitary facilities
In this scheme there are a limited number of sanitary facilities due to negligence of some farmers of not
being able to construct latrines/unruly behaviour to take bath in canals. This has led to some effects
such as pollution of water by faeces and dirty water through washing body and soap, also potentiality
of farmers contracting infectious diseases like diarrhea, bilharzias and typhoid.
Poor production and productivity
The scheme is experiencing poor production and productivity due to lack of capital to run agriculture
activities and lack of land tenure to majority of the farmer's. Moreover there is an element of laziness.
As the result there is lack or low income, that causes people to live in the vicious circle of poverty and
hence inability to buy inputs, hire labour and farm machinery.
Environmental degradation
There is a major problem of environmental degradation at the water source, which is contributed by the
deforestation, wild bush fires, laxity on the part of bylaws, and low level of stakeholder of the
participation of environmental management. A s the result there is poor rainfall distribution also soil
erosion because land is left bare and silting of river course, intake and canals.
Lack of women's participation
There is low/lack of women's participation in activities attached to environmental conservation (in fact
even low in other development activities). This is contributed by patriarchal factors, shying off since
their male foes are present and scapegoat tendencies that these are men's activities. The major effects
include the environmental degradation through the deforestation and bush fires also soil erosion due to
cultivation along canal banks, since women are the ones who are practically engaged with cultivation
of the fields.
Low knowledge on environmental issues
Most of the villagers have very limited knowledge concerning the environmental and scheme
management, which is caused by sporadic training packages on the subject, low level knowledge

This chapter presents a brief description of identified environmental and social impacts for improving
the Ruanda Majenje Irrigation Scheme. The impacts are based on changes, which have or are expected
to occur, prior or post improvement of the scheme. Attempts have been made to indicate both positive
as well as negative impacts, but for the sake of preparing an effective Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP), negative impacts have featured more than positive impacts. The impacts
may also be categorized (based on localities) as follows:
*   Upstream and downstream impacts
*   Scheme level impacts
7.2 UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS
7.2.1   Demographic trend (population changes)
The population has increased in the village. According to the Scheme Improvement Assessment
Report of 1998, Ruanda Majenje had 445 households with a total population of 2152.
Population in the study area is as presented in Table 7.2 below. Ruanda Majenje village, comprised of
seven hamlets, now has a population of 3225 with 620 households.

The scheme has no upstream areas because the irrigation scheme begins just after the intake which has
been constructed at the base of the Pororo Mountains. There are no settlements on the mountains.
Downstream, Chamoto village has a total of 255 households with 859 people.

7.2.2  Hydrological regime
Changes to the hydrological regime are a concern to both environmental and socio-economic aspects of
the scheme. It has been estimated that about 10% of the hydrological regime is adversely affected both
during the wet and dry seasons.
7.2.3  Catchment degradation
There is neither human settlement nor abstraction upstream of the Ruanda Majenje scheme. The intake
is located just at the foot of the Pororo Mountains. The major upstream impact, which will change the
flow regime of the Lwenyo flow, is forest burning. The hunters use fire to scare off and trap animals in
the upland forests where the Lwenyo River originates. If this continues unchecked, it will have
significant impacts in both the wet season and dry season. In the wet season, it will drastically increase
the peak flow, which would otherwise have been lowered by the delaying effect of the forest. Forest
enhances ground water recharge by delaying surface water movement and giving ample time for
infiltration to take place. This helps produce enhanced base flow during the dry season. If burning of
the forest resource continues unabated, the dry flow of the river may disappear. Forest destruction is
also the main cause of erosion and sedimentation effects in the canals, intakes, etc.
Villagers reported that incidences of forest fires continually increase from about I to 3 per month. It is
estimated that per annum about 5% of forest vegetation cover is lost.

A satellite image of 1998 indicates great changes of in land use/vegetation cov-er. In upstream areas.

place. Within scheme areas, the scrublands also turned into trees and herbaceous plants.  In
dow-nstream areas of the scheme, w-here scattered cultivation wvas earlier going on. tumed into a minor
tow-nship called Igurusi.
A significanit amount of clearing of the herbaceous plants has. therefore, taken place to achieve the
current land use/vegetation cover. Ricc and/or vegetable farmlands nowv dominate the area.
7.2.4  Water quality on downstream users
The pH ranges between 6.54 and 6.9. which is a near-neutral pH band. The dissolv-ed oxygen (DO)
ranges from  5.70 mg/I to 8.05 mg/l. indicating good aeration and fairly lo- organic pollution. The
salinity and total dissol-ed solids (TDS) v-alues of the incoming wvater (measured from the intakes)
indicate that the water used for irrigation is fresh anid very suitable for that matter. The salinity is zero
and TDS ranges betw-een 20.4 mg/l to 32.6 mg/l. This is very good fresh -ater w -ith little dissolved
substance. This fact is supported by low v-alues of total hardniess (23-32 mg/l as CaCO3).

Mbeya, Iringa, and Dar es Salaam, there is rapid socio-economic growth of downstream areas. Produce
from the scheme finds a ready market as vendors frequent the scheme area. The pressure on the farmers
to produce more and more has grown to the extent that the vendors make inputs available to the farmers
in order to establish links and to ensure availability of crops for sale. However, there is a catch in this,
because since the prices of inputs continually increase and vendors are looking for greater profit
margins, the local farmers become more and more disadvantaged.
7.3      IRRIGATION SCHEME LEVEL IMPACTS
7.3.1    Soil quality
Four representative   soil samples were collected     from  Ruanda Majenje     Irrigation  Scheme  for
examination of physical and chemical properties of the soil. The analysis also checked for the presence
of salinity and trends. The results are presented in Table 7.5.

7.3.3    Stagnant water
About 8% of the farm areas are affected by the impact by stagnant water. Stagnant water poses a
potential risk for the propagation of malaria-bearing mosquitoes and other waterbome diseases.
7.3.4    Waterborne diseases
Many people in the scheme area have been attending the dispensary for treatment of malaria. Another
disease is HIV/AIDS, which seems to growing due to the influx of immigrants and truck drivers at the
Igurusi Centre. Other diseases are mentioned as follows

7.3.5   Socio-economic: positive and negative impacts of villages within the scheme
Negative Impacts
* Increased population and demand for building materials has led to higher rates of
deforestation.
* There are unplanned settlements in the upstream areas.
* The water is highly polluted with agrochemicals, human and livestock waste.
* The rate of HIV/AIDS in the area has increased.
* Occurrence of water-related diseases in the area has increased.
Positive Impacts
* There are higher levels of development growth in the Ruanda Majenje area. Two primary
schools and a dispensary have been created.
* Farmers get more income from the high production of rice and two cropping seasons in a year.
* Farmers are now able to build good houses, buy assets, and pay for school fees.

8. IDENTIFICATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES
8.1 INTRODUCTION
This section presents mitigation measures. The description addresses itself to three categories of
identified impacts as presented in previous chapter, as well as four categories of identified nitigation
measures. The categories of identified impacts include the following:
*   Impacts in up-stream areas of scheme
*   Impacts at scheme areas
*   Impacts in down areas of schemes
Furtheimore, the categories of identified mitigation measures include the following:
*   Environmental management
*   Enhancement of social -economic activities
*   Improving health situation
*   Revisiting engineering designs and /or construction.
8.2 UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM
8.2.1   Environmental Management
For this reason, the key up-stream mitigation measure under this category of environimental
management will therefore include:
*   Strengthening local based mechanisms for control of acquisition and use of land resources. For
example during field visits, it was observed that there are many absentee landlords in the area.
This phenomena amount to land hoarding, which isn't allowed in Tanzania. The proposed local
based mechanism should be able to handle this matter effectively.
*   Strengthening local based mechanism to prohibit up-stream human settlements and/or human
activities i.e. far away for appreciable distance up-stream of the intake structure.
*   Promotion of up-stream afforestation/reforestation activities as well as environmental protection in
general.
*   Strengthening and/or establishment of local based mechanism for resolution of conflicts.
The watershed management programme should encompass:
*   Community forestry management
*   Agro-forestry approaches
*   Enacting and enforcing by-laws
* Provision of alternative sources of livelihoods (water and energy)
*   Environmental training and campaigns
For this reason, the key up-stream mitigation measure under this category of environmental
management will therefore include:
*   Strengthening local based mechanisms for control of acquisition and use of land resources. For
example during field visits, it was observed that there are many absentee landlords in the area.
This phenomena amount to land hoarding, which isn't allowed in Tanzania. The proposed local
based mechanism should be able to handle this matter effectively.
*   Strengthening local based mechanism to prohibit up-stream human settlements and/or human
activities i.e. far away for appreciable distance up-stream of the intake structure.
*   Promotion of up-stream afforestation/reforestation activities as well as environmental protection in
general.
*   Strengthening and/or establishment of local based mechanism for resolution of conflicts.
Again in the case of down-stream and within Ruanda Majenje scheme area, the key issue is inadequacy
of local based leadership to enable monitoring, effective surveillance and enforce regulation for water
abstraction, acquisition and use of land resources.
41



8.2.2  Enhancement of social economic activities
Enhancement of social-economic activities in general involves promotion of sustainable social -
economic activities.
Specifically, in up-stream areas of the Ruanda Majenje scheme, the measures include promotion of
environmental consciousness in all social-economic activities. This should include establishment of
mechanisms, which should ensure controlled acquisition and appropriate land use practices.
In down -stream areas the villagers are not yet adequately conscious on potential usefulness of
irrigation agriculture as a social-economic activity. There is, therefore, the need for promoting this
activity.
8.3 IRRIGATION SCHEME LEVEL
8.3.1  Environmental management
Mitigation measure under category of environmental management will therefore include:
*   Establishment and/or strengthening of local based effective water management system (including
when possible establishment of a sub-catchment water authority).
*   Creating awareness and simultaneously improving skills/knowledge in integrated approaches of
irrigation agricultural practice e.g. on IPM, soil fertility management appropriate uses of agro-
chemicals etc.
Specifically, the following mitigation measures are proposed:
*   Training of farmers and village extension officers on good agronomic practices. Focus should be
on sustainable use of these natural resources.
*   Training of farmers in operation and maintenance of the irrigation system.
*   Conducting environmental awareness campaigns and education to all soil and water users.
*   Establishing and/or strengthening of local based mechanism for resolutions of competition,
conflicts in the use of both water and land resources.
*   Establishing and/or strengthening of local based mechanism for enforcement of regulations e.g. for
prohibition of cultivation too near the course of the river, which turn causes bank erosion and
siltation.
8.3.2  Improving water quality
Mitigation measures to prevent or mininmlize pollution at water sources, rivers and canals should be
undertaken; and these could include:
*   Special restrictions in the use of pesticides in areas with sensitive water resources, e.g. in the
vicinity of drinking water points/sources.
*   Control and regulation in handling, storage, application and disposal of agrochemical containers
*   Measurements of pesticide residues in irrigation canals, drains and rivers and in soils should be
carried out (once per year)
*   Record keeping of pesticides in use, application methods at all seasons
*   Adopt recommendations from TPRI regarding safe and correct handling, storage, application
(pesticide selection, timing, rate and methods) and disposal.
8.3.3  Enhancement of socio-economic condition
In the case of Ruanda Majenje scheme, the key issue is local community's inadequacy of awareness on
high potentiality of irrigation agriculture as a viable socio-economic activity:
Under these circumstances therefore, the mitigation measure Ruanda Majenje, under category of
enhancing social economic conditions, include the following:
*   Promoting irrigation agriculture as a potentially viable socio-economic activity of Ruanda Majenje
scheme.
42



* Promoting better productivity through improved skills/knowledge on appropriate practices e.g.
thuough use of improved seeds varieties etc.
8.3.4   Improving health situation
This category of measure should be relevant for identified impacts at both scheme levels, as well as in
down-stream areas of the scheme.
One of the known environmental impacts of ilTigation activities is spread of water borne diseases, e.g.
bilharzias, dysentery, malaria, etc. Furthermore, expected influx of people, as irrigation agriculture
increases will mean that promiscuity will also arise. This calls for the need to embark on a program for
prevention of HIV/AIDS, as well as strengthening existing health and water supply services, as
appropriate. To reduce the vulnerability of the Ruanda Majenje irrigation community to the water
related diseases the following is recommended:
*   Health and sanitation campaigns should be conducted to sensitize the farming community on
transmission patterns of these water-related diseases and how to avoid contact with disease-
causing vectors.
*   Awareness raising among the community on the ecological requirements of different disease
vectors e.g. Anopheline mosquitoes and aquatic snails.
*   Irrigation canals should be cleaned on a regular basis to prevent development of favourable
habitats for vectors that transmit diseases.
8.3.5   Revisiting engineering designs and/or construction stages
During the field visit it was observed that due to a variety of reasons tertiary canals weren't performing.
This situation frustrates the few farmers who won't work and "gives ammunition" for those who are
critical of the scheme and don't want to work. It is therefore recommended that the structures be
examined and immediate remedial action be taken whose solution may be designing, and/or
construction problems, etc.
43



9. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
(ESMP)
9.1     INTRODUCTION
The mitigation measures proposed in the previous chapter represent the core findings of the EA and are
important elements in implementing the current improvement of the irrigation scheme and mitigating
potentially adverse social and environmental impacts. The Environmiental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP) in the following sections presents:
*   Identification and summary of major anticipated adverse environmental impacts
*   Description of mitigation measures
*   Description of elements of monitoring program
*   Institutional arrangement
*   Implementation schedule for mitigation measures
*   Performance monitoring and reporting procedures
*   Cost estimates and sources of funds
The ESMP is based on the guidelines defined in the World Bank Operational Manual OP/BP 4.01.
9.2     OBJECTIVES
General objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the Rwanda-
Majenje irrigation scheme would be to promote sustainable and efficient irrigation agricultural
activities in the area.
Specifically, the objectives of the Environmental and Social Management Plan for the Rwanda-
Majenje iirigation scheme are therefore mainly two-fold; namely:
(i)   To promote sustainability of the schemes through:
* Improving capacities, knowledge/skills,
* Establishing /strengthening mechanisms for resolution of conflicts pertaining to uses of
natural resources especially water and land resources,
* Establishing /strengthening mechanisms for enforcement of regulations for water
abstractions and pollution control
* Strengthening local community leadership and effective mechanism for control in
acquisition and uses of land resources.
(ii) To promote efficiency in irrigation agricultural activities, thlrough:
* Providing/educating on appropriate irrigation practices, e.g. on proper uses of agro-
chemicals, IPM approaches,
* Strengthening implementation of water management concept.
* Revisiting designing and construction stages of the scheme to assess the need for review
of the stages.

9.4 DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENTS OF MONITORING PROGRAM
Monitoring objectives
Monitoring refers to a systematic collection of data/information and due analysis, with the aim of
following up on the subsequent phenomena in the wake of implementation of the ESMP. Activities are
followed up, their status assessed, quantified and rectified accordingly. This process should be
considered as part of the ESMP. The District Council will keep a close eye on changing conditions and
keep records, as accurately as possible, to check, among others, on compliance with statutory
environmental protection provisions and World Bank Safeguard Policies.
Description of performance indicators which provide linkages to impacts and mitigation
measures in the EA
Water quality
Water quality will be monitored as follows:
*   The water quality of the Luanyo River will be assessed continuously to determine the overall
impact of, fertilizers, insecticides or pesticides used in the inigation project and upstream
agricultural activities.
*   The water flow volume in the river will be measured through the established gauging stations.
Water balance modeling should be done for predication proposes. This exercise will help to assess
base flows, water yields, and hydrological characteristics of the catchlment area.
Ground water
*   The g round water will b e c hecked t o d etermine salinity o f g round water a s a r esult o f p roj ect
operations.
*   The changes in pH of ground water will be monitored to check the impacts on ground water of the
various types of crops planted.

much of ground water including the well-documented eucalyptus species.
Soil Conservation
Soil composition, texture and structure in the irrigation project area will be monitored in the sample
areas to determine impacts from various agricultural practices.
The fertility level of soils (i.e. nutrient concentration and soil moisture) in the sample crop areas will
be monitored to determine impacts from the planted crops. Changes in salinity, porosity, pH level and
types of biota in the soils will also be monitored in the sample crop areas. Alteration of these
parameters could be expected in cases where crops are grown alongside water or nutrient demanding
trees, which may consequently jeopardize the well being of the crops.
Biodiversity indicators
The following are pertinent indicators for catchment management: sedimentation rates, riverbank
erosion, flashfloods and deforestation rates. The District Natural Resource Office supported by other
stakeholder and RBM should monitor these.
Other important ecological parameters include vegetation; (i.e. both on dry land as well as on river
valleys); fish, (i.e. plankton, invertebrates); and birds, and other living organisms available in the area.
Crop Diseases
The type of diseases affecting planted trees will be monitored in the sample compartments to
detemline common diseases to various crops that will require special treatment in the next rotation of
crop farming or application of appropriate pesticides for treatment of the disease.
The most damaging crop pests, especially those that have caused extensive loss of production in the
farms in Tanzania will be monitored. The monitoring of emerging pests and insects in and around the
project area will help determine the most suitable disease control mitigation measure.
Afforestation
*   Provenance and species resistance to diseases and pests for planting in the community and
individual's forest plots within the project will be screened. Provenance and nursery plots will be
established. DBH and heights will be measured.
*   The amount of carbon and other greenhouse gases in the soils will be monitored in and around the
project area. The amount of greenhouse gases will be monitored to assess the impacts of forest
sequestration of greenhouse gases, especially carbon.
Socio-economic
The District Office should monitor the characteristics, activities and attitudes of the adjacent
communities in order to develop feasible extension programs. The major objectives will be to reduce
pressure on the iiTigation area inter alia through encouraging alternative enterprises. The steps would
include:
*   Promoting agro-forestry in the local community farms.
*   Infrastructure development such as accessibility, marketing, education, health and other proposed
activities by the local community around the project area.
*   Net immigration monitoring of people in the local community. Population dynamics will be
monitored in sub-villages and around the project.
*   Fuel wood requirements for the local community will also be monitored to determine local
demand and develop possible strategies such as agro-forestry, community forest areas and
conservation of natural woodlands in the villages around the project.
Health indicators
The main health indicators to be monitored are water-bome diseases such as malaria and bilharzias.

9.5    INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
The fundamental area for consideration is empowerment of existing administrative and organisational
alTangements. These include farmers, local communities, both as a group as well as in their individual
capacities, in both upstream and downstream villages The empowerment has to be carried out through
provision of capacity building, public awareness campaigns, tailor-made training, etc.
As a strategic approach SIIC should strengthen partnership among the Rwanda-Majenje community in the use
of water and land resources. Based on the adopted organisational-structure and job descriptions of various
committees to be established, for the operation of the scheme, a framework should be established through
which the stakeholders are able to actively engage in a dialogue aimed at equitable and sustainable use of the
common resources.
The project should firstly embark on a programme of key and strategic activities which are part of the above
outlined Environrnental and Social Management Plan and should enhance attainment of the above objectives.
More specifically, the following are proposed:
*   Hold meetings of various committees as per agreement
*   Assist: (i) to organize ward or district- based farmers' day,
and (ii) participation in local and national events like farmers day
*   Undertake joint study visits
9.6 INPUTS REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTED OUTPUTS

10. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.1    CONCLUSION
10.1.1 General conclusion
Based on review of baseline information, field visits to Rwanda-Majenje irrigation scheme and data analyses; it
is evident that there are environmental and social issues/impacts/problems which need to be addressed in order
to ensure sustainable and sound operation of the ilTigation scheme. As outlined in above chapters (among
others): in up-stream areas of the scheme, the key issues constraining sustainability are increased incidences of
forest fires as well changes of the river's hydrological and hydraulic regime. In within-scheme areas the
constraints are general poor soil fertility coupled with land hoarding practices In down-stream area
sustainability is mainly constrained by inadequacy of knowledge and skills of the farmers on appropriate
irrigation practices. These constraints manifest to upstream environmental degradation, (particularly of the
catchment area), or within-the-scheme impacts, (e.g. due to inappropriate irrigation practices), or also in down -
stream areas (due to uncontrolled water abstractions leading to community conflicts.
Baseline data with comprehensive benchmark parameters related to various studies like hydrogeology, socio-
economic, environment, water quality, etc. at catchment and irrigation levels were not available in the area.
Environment and social assessment impact requires "before and after" studies, and perhaps experience from
similar environment to facilitate assessment of the severity of perceived problems. Quantification of impacts
requires collection of data, understanding of process and analysis of results, which take more time and
resources.
Through ecosystem, farming system and participatory approaches, the key impacts were identified and, as far,
as was possible, quantified. Additionally, measures pertaining to prevention and/or control have been proposed.
An Environmental and Social Management Plan for the Rwanda-Majenje irrigation scheme were developed.
10.1.2 Specific conclusions
Location
In conclusion it was found that the location of the scheme has both positive and negative aspects. The scheme
provides much opportunities that it facilitate/encourage irrigation practices, hence enhancing the sustainability
of the scheme. On the other hand, because of being near a rapidly growing minor township of Igurusi poses a
possible threat of detracting p eople from practising irrigation. A possible negative influence is one such as
availability of poor soil fertility which would require capital intensive interventions.
Bio-physical environment
The Rwanda-Majenje scheme lies in semi -arid area of Tanzania, where without irrigation, agriculture is
difficult to practice. It was therefore found in conclusion that scheme improvement has been very beneficial to
the local community,
Socio-economic environment
Field observations indicated that irrigation agriculture is difficult to practice at Rwanda Majenje. This makes
community go for petty trade as an activity. Indeed people practising irrigation at the scheme are those who are
socio-economically not well to do and are those who can not afford to acquire relatively more fertile farmlands
lying in down-stream areas. Again field observations indicated that socio-culturally the people in the area are
very hard working; however inadequacy of effective community organisation constrains their achievement.
Identified impacts
It is important that the positive aspects of development emerge, especially because these are what motivate the
people at village (farm) level and dictate the decisions they take or are willing to have taken on their behalf
55



In view of the above, therefore iirigation activities at the scheme are relatively not intensive, and as such,
environmental and social impacts are relatively also not significant. In any case, in brief, this study identified
the following impacts:
Positive impacts
In the Rwanda -Majenje irrigation scheme positive impacts are:
* Availability of alternative socio-economic activities especially in times of drought
* Increased incomes and production, leading to alleviation of poverty
* Improved land and water resources management and distribution,
Negative impacts
Negative impacts identified upstream of the Rwanda-Majenje scheme are hydrological changes, i.e. in terms of
e.g. change of regime of river flow, catchment degradation, etc. The downstream impacts are water borne
diseases and socio-economic impacts on the community. Within the irrigation scheme major impacts are poor
soil quality and waterborne diseases
Mitigation measures
A number of mitigation measures were proposed to address the identified impacts. As far as possible,
preventive management measure are given priority in combating soil and water pollution, catchment
degradation, and pollution of the river and disease control.
Compliance with the Tanzanian legislation and World Bank Safeguard Policies
The study team has demonstrated that the Rwanda-Majenje irrigation scheme is in compliance with the
Tanzanian legislation and policies, and World Bank Safeguard Policies.
10.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
Role of Local Government authorities
Most of the identified mitigation measures are related with local community-based effective structural -
organization. This means therefore that most of the measures can be implemented by local government
authorities themselves with financial and technical assistance of funded projects e.g. RBMSIIP and NGOs and
CBOs.
Partnership building
It is recommended that arrangements should be made to share experience and information from other partners
in the area e.g. SMUWK, SUA research project in Usangu plains, IFAD, etc. The Mbarali District could
collaborate with these stakeholders in implementation of environmental and social management plan, which
are relevant to Rwanda-Majenje irrigation scheme and others in Rufiji River Basin.
In order to minimize water and land use conflicts, stakeholders of Rufiji River Basin in general should work
together as partners to improve production and sustainable development of the watershed management and the
scheme's sustainable development.
Similar projects should develop institutional arrangements geared to share responsibility (decision making) for
catchment m anagement plan a nd prevention m anagement a ctivities in the Rufiji River Basin. A partnership
approach, however, also needs an appropriate institutional framework, which clearly lays on the roles and
responsibilities of each project, district councils and stakeholders. Community and farmers participation could
be solicited in planning, management, financing, construction and maintenance of catchment areas and
receiving bodies.
Environmental and social impacts monitoring
56



A participatory monitoring system h as been developed for the Rwanda-Majenje irrigation scheme. There is
need to establish process-based plan and monitoring, to build capacity of scheme management team and to
develop a databank on the environmental and social impact management plan including the I monitoring plan.
Capacity Building
Capacity building is vital for sustainability of the scheme. For this reason, capacity building is relevant for all
administrative levels, i.e. staiting with a farmer (as an individual), a household, farmers' committees,
associations a nd g roups, village a nd /or wards, up t o d istrict a uthorities a s well a s I ocal b ased p ublic a nd
private organizations e.g. NGOs, CBOs, etc.
Baseline Studies
It is vital for any sustainable smallholder ilTigation development and management in the river basin that there is
a minimum knowledge about water resources and quantified (baseline data) related to environmental and social
issues. It is therefore, proposed that a mechanism for regular collection of baseline data be established some
baseline studies and investigations should be undertaken in the future smallholder irrigation improvement
projects.

APPENDIX        1:             Terms of Reference
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT OF GROUP B
IRRIGATION SCHEMES
PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The G overnment o f t he U nited R epublic o f T anzania has b een i mplementing R iver B asin M anagement a nd
Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP) since 1996 through IDA credit. The project aims at (i)
strengthening the government capacity to manage its water resources in an integrated and comprehensive
manner that ensure equitable, efficiency and sustainable development of the resource and address water related
environmental concerns at the National level and in the Rufiji and Pangani basins: and (ii) Improve irrigation
efficiency of selected smallholder traditional irrigation schemes in these two basins.  The Ministry of
Agriculture and Food Security and the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development are implementing the
project.
The Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component of the project is focusing on the improvement of existing
traditional irrigation schemes. Under existing World Bank Environmental Policy (OD 4.01), the River Basin
Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP) has been classified as a category "B"
project requiring a limited environmental analysis and, if necessary the inclusion of mitigation measures in
project design. This is essence means that no major environmental impacts are expected and that only
mitigation measures can be incorporated into the scheme design, implementation and operation (SAR 1995)
SCOPE OF WORK
The Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Irrigation section carried out the Initial Environmental Examination
(IEEs) in 15 traditional Irrigation schemes to ascertain environmental issue and suggest mitigation measures
that have to be incorporated during scheme design, Construction and Operation and Maintenance. Based on the
IEE findings, IEE Reports were prepared as part of Scheme Improvement Assessment Studies.
The consultants in collaboration with ECU will be required to carry out Environmental Audit in seven (7) group
B Scheme of Ruanda Majenje, Igomelo, Mangalali, Nyamahana, Soko, Kambi ya Tanga and Mahenge
irrigation schemes. The consultant did environmental Review of Lemkuna irrigation scheme in 2001, thus it
requires an Environmental and Social Management Plan only. The schemes are now in operation phase.
The assignment is a continuation of the last activities of Environmental Audit of group A and C irrigation
schemes. This will be done in accordance with GoT and World Bank safeguard policies

AVAILABLE REPORTS
The reports available at the Irrigation Section (PFT) include Initial Environmental Examination, Engineering,
Socio-Economic, Topographical Surveys, Agronomy/Agriculture and Water Resource Studies.
The consultant is therefore required to compile quantitative and qualitative informnation from these
supplemented by field visit in order to have baseline information on environmental issues to develop a model
for future review of Initial Environmental Examination reports under RBMSIIP.
TIMING
The consultant is expected to spend about five month starting May 2003.
OUTPUTS
The consultant will be required to produce 17 copies of reports for each irrigation scheme for review by NEMC
in hard copy and in MS Word diskette for submission to World Bank for review.
The document should address the following issues:
* Analysis of Engineering, Socio Economic, Agricultural, Soils and Water Resources reports in order to
provide quantitative infonmation given the qualitative information in the IEE reports.
* Compliance with EIA procedures according to the Government of Tanzania and World Bank guidelines.
* Proper methodology and approach including criteria for assessment,
* Integrated Pest Management.
* Prepare Environmental Management plan to specify clearly who and when mitigation measures can be
implemented.

APPENDIX        4:            World Bank Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies
Environmenttal Assessment (OPIBP 4.01). Outlines Bank policy and procedure for the environmental
assessment of Bank lending operations. The Bank undertakes environmental screening of each proposed project
to determine the appropriate extent and type of EA. The Bank classifies the project into one of four categories,
depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and the scale of the project and the nature and magnitude of its
potential environmental impacts. RBMSIIC is Category B..
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04). The conservation of natural habitats, like other measures that protect and
enhance the environment, is essential for long-term sustainable development. The Bank does not support
projects involving the significant conversion of natural habitats unless there are no feasible alternatives for the
project and its citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits from the project
substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If the environmental assessment indicates that a project will
significantly convert or degrade natural habitats, the project includes mitigation measures acceptable to the
Bank. Such mitigation measures include, as appropriate, minimizing habitat loss (e.g. strategic habitat retention
and post-development restoration) and establishing and maintaining an ecologically similar protected area.
Pest Management (OP 4.09). The policy supports safe, affective, and environmentally sound pest management.
It promotes the use of biological and environmental control methods. An assessment is made of the capacity of
the country's regulatory framework and institutions to promote and support safe, effective, and environmentally
sound pest management.
Involuntaiy Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). The resettlement policy is triggered when people are affected by loss
of land, loss of property and/or loss of access to resources. It is therefore irrelevant whether or not the impact
will entail physical relocation of the affected people, the policy is triggered in all such cases This means that the
impact may be of such kind that only compensation in cash or kind is necessary.
Indigenouis Peoples (OD 4.20). This directive provides guidance to ensure that indigenous people benefit from
development projects, and to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of Bank-financed development projects on
indigenous people Measures to address issues pertaining to indigenous peoples must be based on the informed
participation of the indigenous people themselves.
Forests (OP/BP 4.36). This policy applies to the following types of Bank-financed investment projects (a)
projects that have or may have impacts on the health and quality of forests, (b) projects that affect the rights and
welfare of people and their level of dependence upon or interaction with forests, and (c) projects that aim to
bring about changes in the management, protection, or utilization of natural forests or plantations, whether they
are publicly, privately, or communally owned. The Bank does not finance projects that, in its opinion, would
involve significant conversion or degradation of critical forest areas or related critical habitats. If a project
involves the significant conversion or degradation of natural forests or related natural habitats that the Bank
determines are not critical, and the Bank determines that there are no feasible alternatives to the project and its
citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits from the project substantially outweigh
the environmental costs, the Bank may finance the project provided thal. it incorporates appropriate mitigation
measures.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37). For the life of any dam, the owner is responsible for ensuring that appropriate
measures are taken and sufficient resources provided for the safety to the dam, irrespective of its funding
sources or construction status. The Bank distinguishes between small and large dams. Small dams are normally
less than 15 m in height, this category includes, for example, farm ponds, local silt retention dams, and low
embankment tanks. For small dams, generic dam safety measures designed by qualified engineers are usually
adequate.
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03). The term "cultural property" includes sites having archaeological (prehistoric),
paleontological, historical, religious, and unique natural values. The Bank's g eneral policy regarding cultural
property is to assist in their preservation, and to seek to avoid their elimination. The Bank (i) normally declines
to finance projects that will significantly damage non-replicable cultural property, and will assist only those
projects that are sited or designed to prevent such damage, and (ii) will assist in the protection and enhancement
of cultural properties encountered in Bank-financed projects, rather than leaving that protection to chance. The
management of cultural property of a country is the responsibility of the government. The government's
attention will be drawn specifically to what is known about the cultural property aspects of the proposed project



site. Appropriate agencies, NGOs, or university departments will be consulted if there are any questions
concerning cultural property in the area, and a brief reconnaissance survey will be undertaken in the field by a
specialist.
Projects on International Waterways (7.50). The Bank recognizes that the cooperation and good will of
riparian is essential for the efficient utilisation and protection of international waterways and attaches great
importance to riparian making appropriate agreements or arrangement for the entire waterway or any part
thereof Projects that trigger this policy include hydroelectric, irrigation, flood control, navigation, drainage,
water and sewerage, industrial, and similar projects that involve the use or potential pollution of international
waterways. The riparian are being notified in accordance with this policy, no additional steps need to be taken at
the level of the subprojects.
Disputted Areas (OP/BP/ 7.60): Projects in disputed areas may occur between the Bank and its member
countries as well as between the borrower and one or more neighbouring countries. Any dispute over an area in
which a proposed project is located requires formal procedures at the earliest possible stage. The Bank attempts
to acquire assurance that it may proceed with a project in a disputed area if the governments concerned agree
that, pending the settlement of the dispute, the project proposed can go forward without prejudice to the claims
of the country having a dispute.



APPENDIX 5:                   Farmers voices: Proposed solutions
It was agreed that starting a saving and credit organisation could help farmers in a number of ways including
readily availability of farm inputs and better ways to penetrate the market and hence raising farmers income and
in so doing increasing household capital.
Farmers agreed to work out the number of paddy bags to be contributed by each farmer and sold for seed money
for the newly established savings and credit organisation starting the coming harvest, which is May-July 2003.
After a long discussion it became apparent that some farmers have not managed to complete the agreed farmers
20% contribution to the total project costs. It was generally agreed that areas currently facing water problems
were those with drainage canals not yet completed. The meeting urged for completion of drainage canals.
Farmers will dig the drains under the supervision of the water association committee by 27th August -
November 2002 period.
The irrigation committee has to note areas affected by scouring water velocities and report them to the
Contractor for rectification. The meeting was told that the scheme is still under Contractor supervision for a
year.
It is anticipated that any rectification to the affected canals will be completed by February 2003 which is the end
of contractor's supervision period.
The meeting resolved that there is a need for irrigators to sit together and prepare a water schedule to ensure the
little available water is utilised in the best sustainable manner. This entails strict adherence to the agreed water
distribution schedule.
The water users committee was given the task to prepare the water distribution schedule to be ready for the
July-December period months it is a water scarcity period.
Introduction of modal pit latrines in the irrigation fields.
Boiling water before drinking and boiling milk to avoid tuberculosis.
General cleanliness around homesteads to deter mosquito breeding.
Awareness raising towards risky behaviours which increase spread of HIV/AIDS such as excessive alcohol
drinking, unfaithful relationships in marriage and pre-marital sex for youths.
The local dispensary should be improved to enable it offer quality services.
Farmers request RBMSIIP to look into the matter in collaboration with irrigators and livestock keepers.
It was agreed that the above works should be completed before the project phases out.
As a temporal solution, the village government should set aside and demarcate area for grazing.
The water users association committee was instructed to send a request to the village government before
September 2002.
It was agreed to establish a savings and credit society for easy and affordable availability of farm inputs.
Farmers agreed to establish the savings and credit society by July 2003.
Encourage participation of both men and women in meetings.
Invitation f or meetings sh ould be sent to both men and w omen. At present only men receive invitations. In
addition, sub-village leaders should send invitation well in advance to avoid disappointment.
It was agreed that both village government and WUA leaders should be responsible for dissemination of
information with regard to meetings.
Farmers agreed to look into the possibility of planting high yielding and marketable seed varieties and use
WUA and savings and credit organisations to look for markets for crop produce.



It was agreed that seed varieties should be found in the September-November 2002 period and markets to be
located in May - July 2003 period.
Dissemination of gender education to the Ruanda Majenje society through various means including mass media.
Enact and use of village bylaws to resolve some household conflicts.
Establish a gender committee in the village government structure
This will be done by a gender specialist and the villagers will formulate a gender committee which whose
members will be those villagers who have attended a gender course. It was agreed that the gender committee
should be in place by 2nd September 2002 with gender education to commence in June 2003.
Planting trees around homesteads and wherever feasible in farm fields.
Use of locally made energy saving stoves, which uses little firewood.
To use poison for rats
Trapping wild animals.
Since the problem is seasonal, it was agreed that agricultural field officer should offer assistance whenever this
problem arises.
Use either gypsum or cow dung was advocated for areas with small salt traces and stopping irrigation in areas
with severe salts to halt spread to other areas.
It was agreed that reclamation of salt affected areas should be the responsibility of affected farmers but they
should seek advice from the extension officer.
Before buying any agrochemical, the extension officer should be consulted.
In some instances a group of farmers could ask the extension officer to buy agrochemicals for them.
The meeting agreed that the agricultural field officer should assist the farmers on this issue.
