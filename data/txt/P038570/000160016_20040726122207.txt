EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Government of Tanzania (GoT) through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS) has taken various
initiatives to improve agricultural sector in the country. One of these initiatives is undertaking the River Basin Management
and Smaliholder Irrigation Improvement Project (RBMSIIP); in context with which, is the Smallholder Irrigation
Improvement Component (SIIC). Among others, the need to undertake the RBMSIIP arose out of a nation-wide realisation
that the ecosystems of country's river basins (especially those of the Rufiji and the Pangani Rivers) are not being properly
managed, leading to extensive environmental degradation and loss of potentialities of these vital ecosystems. Moreover, it
was also realised that in view of the above-mentioned loss of potentiality, smallholder traditional irrigation schemes are the
worst affected; hence the need arose to undertake also the SIIC.
Support to smallholder traditional irrigation improvement and rehabilitation is, therefore, one of the major components of this
RBMSIIP programme. The SIIC component focuses on improving management of water resources and crop husbandry
practices in existing smallholder irrigation schemes. This can be achieved, among others, through improvement of natural
resources, land and water, during implementation of the rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation schemes.) SIIC is geared at
improvement of water management in smallholder irrigation schemes to ensure sustainable use of land and water resources
and ultimately yield increase with minimal environmental degradation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC both the Scheme Environmental Assessment (SEA) as well as an Environmental Audit (EA)
were carried out for the Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme. Among others, both the assessment and the audit were based on the
Initial Environmental Assessments (IEE) studies carried out by the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Irrigation Section
of the MAFS.
This report presents the findings of the study.
The objective of the study was identifying changes that have taken place before/after scheme improvement, assessing and
quantifying thereto environmental and social impacts, also duly preparing an environmental and social management plan as
well as developing an environmental and social management and monitoring system. A ccording to the ToR the expected
outputs o f t his s tudy a re two i n o ne i nterrelated reports i.e. c overing both Environmental Audit (EA) a s w ell as S cheme
Environmental Assessment (SEA), analysing e.g. socio-economic, socio-cultural and engineering factors in order to provide
quantitative information.
Furthermore, the report incorporates an assessment of compliance of the scheme's improvement to the Tanzanian policy and
legislation framework, as well as the World Bank's relevant environmental safe guard policies (especially on OP 4.01). The
study team has demonstrated that the Lemkuna irrigation scheme is in compliance with the Tanzanian legislation and
policies, and the World Bank Safeguard Policies, but the scheme triggers Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37. In line with this a
safety dam report should be prepared by relevant authorities.
Different methodologies were employed to carry out the task, including the following:
*    Desk review of recommended documents
*    Questionnaire administration to key stakeholders
*    Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA)
At different stages of the study the following approaches and analytical tools were applied
*    Participatory data collection
*    Key informant interview
*    Trend analysis
*    Geographical information system
Describing the location of the scheme, the study found that the Lemkuna irrigation scheme lies down-stream of the Nyumba
ya Mungu reservoir about 128 km south east of Arusha municipality .It is located at a village of Lemkuna. Its coordinates are
latitude 030 47' South and longitude 370 26' East, and are at an altitude of about 700m above mean sea level. It comprises the
following villages: Lemkuna "A" and "B"
The villages around the Lemkuna irrigation scheme have a total population of about 1700 people. The main ethnic groups in
the scheme area are Wapare, Wasambaa, Waarusha Wameru, and other smaller groups. The majority of these are
agriculturalists. Few are livestock keepers.
v



The land use in the adjacent villages of Lemkuna is mainly irrigation as well as rain-fed cultivation and grazing.
The only available source for the Lemkuna scheme is the Pangani River as it continues its way to the coast of Tanzania and
after it generates electricity at the Nyumba ya Mungu reservoir. Average discharge from the Nyumba ya Mungu is estimated
at 24.6 cumecs. The scheme has been granted a water right to abstract 500 litres/sec; however this depends on operational
requirements of the hydro-power station.
Water abstractions by upstream users for domestic purposes, irrigation and livestock are likely to impact on the quality and
quantity of water available to the scheme. Poor farming practices, especially cultivation of crops close to the riverbanks, is
increasing silt load in the river and causing siltation of the irrigation structures.
The availability of good domestic water supply, coupled with good sanitation at Lemkuna will considerably reduce
downstream water pollution from domestic uses. Drained waterfrom the scheme area is likely to be contaminated from
activities carried out in the scheme area, including application of agro-chemicals, and sharing irrigation water with livestock.
The on-farm activities will thus form the main source of pollution downstream.
In the past say 10 years, fuel wood was obtained in the nearby forests. Deforestation for firewood, opening of new farms and
uncontrolled wild fires have led a much decrease in forest areas.
With the irrigation structures improvement and prospects for higher income earnings from irrigated agriculture, there is
greater loyalty to the leadership of Water Associations. Since most of the people are irrigators and members of the
associations, the latter has greater influence beyond irrigation matters.
The following are some of the positive effects:
*    Crop production has improved a great deal
*    Strengthened existing Water Users Association.
*    Temporary employment opportunities were created during the construction phase.
*    Some farmers have attended on farm training and exchange visits to other areas to share experience with other farmers
as well as learning new skills.
*    Crop production has improved a great deal

The monitoring program comprises the following attributes: water quality, groundwater, soil conservation, biodiversity, crop
diseases, afforestation, socio-economic and health indicators
Additionally, the environmental audit main conclusions and recommendations are:
It is evident that wild animals are still not a serious threat to the Lemkuna irrigation scheme and farmers are able to control
them. Rodents, Quelea quelea and green locust's cases have not occurred since 1996/7 and also no serious destruction of
crops has occurred and there are capabilities to control them at the community level when they occur in small scale.
The Lemkuna irrigation scheme has an active interaction with environment through wildlife biodiversity (wild animals,
insects, rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish). Wildlife isan essential componentofa living environmentand its
presence or absence indicates the quality of the environment. The scheme should therefore seek to maintain a balance
between these two essential interactions. It is recommended that most of pest control methods should not use chemical
methods except where there are intensive outbreaks of birds, like quelea quelea and pests like Army- worms, Green locusts
and cases of Rodents. Wild animals will for a long time be effectively controlled using community-based interventions
supported by stakeholder institutions.

1. BACKGROUND
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The Govemment of Tanzania, through the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security (MAFS), has undertaken various initi
improve the agriculture sector in the country. One of these initiatives is the River Basin Management and Smallholder I
Improvement Project (RBMSIIP). The Smaliholder Irrigation Improvement Component (SIIC) is included within the scope of R
RBMSIIP was developed in response to a water shortage crisis prevalent in many parts of the country. Water demands ofte
available resources; this is especially true in the Pangani and Rufiji basins.
Support to smallholder traditional irrigation improvement and rehabilitation is one of the major components of this project. SIIC fc
improving the management of water resources and crop husbandry practices in existing smallholder irrigation schemes. This is
through, among other things, the improvement of natural resources (land and water) during implementation of the rehabilitz
upgrading of irrigation schemes.
The SIIC undertaking supports the objectives of the National Irrigation Development Plan (NIDP) which was formulated and a(
1994. The plan includes a management and decision-making framework that is based on the comprehensive ranking of schemi
each management unit (river or drainage basin).
Under NIDP the order of priority for irrigation development is as follows:
*   Improvement/rehabilitation of Traditional Smallholder Irrigation Schemes;
*   Water Harvesting Technology;
*   Opening of New Smallholder Schemes;
*   Large Scale Irrigation Schemes for Private Sector.
SIIC focuses on the improvement of water management in smaliholder irrigation schemes to ensure the sustainable use of land a
resources. Ultimately, SIIC aims to facilitate increases in crop yields while minimizing environmental degradation. According
Bank guidelines, the irrigation schemes in the Rufiji and Pangani basins are classified as Category B. Under this category. X
adverse environmental impacts are permitted and mitigation measures must be incorporated into the scheme design. implement;
operation.
Under the auspices of the SIIC, a feasibility study was carried out that resulted in the preparation of the Project Implementation
1996/97 - 2001/02. This plan, produced in October 1996, contains an assessment of environmental issues together with
environmental mitigation measures.
Under World Bank advisement, the Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food SecuritN conducted
Environmental Examination (IEE) of the irrigation schemes. The IEEs were used as the basis for the Scheme Improvement As
Studies. The consultants, in collaboration with ECU, have been charged to conduct environmental audits in seven Category B sites
Majenje, Igomelo. Mangalali, Nyamahana, Soko, Kambi ya Tanga, and Mahenge. An additional site, Lemkuna. only reqi
development of an Environmental and Social Management Plan. This report is focused on presenting the findings of the envir
audit that was conducted for the Mahenge Irrigation Scheme.
This report draws heavily on intensive field observations by the study team. Discussions were held with farmers and other loca
village and district officials, and project staff. A review of various existing documents was also conducted in the preparation of thi!
1.2     UNDERSTANDING OF THE STUDY
1.2.1  Objective of the Study
The objective of the study is to get a better understanding of the present environmental conditions and relevant impact areas (envir
audit) within the scheme. Increased awareness will allow for improved monitoring of both negative and positive changes over
will assist in the formulation of more effective mitigation measures. The environmental audit will also be the basis for the preparat
environmental and social management plan and monitoring system.



Specifically, the study will undertake the following:
*   Assess and quantify baseline environmental and social conditions
.   Assess and quantify environmental and social impacts
.   Conduct environmental audits in order to comply with existing Government of Tanzania and World Bank environmental and s
policies
.   Prepare an environmental and social management plan
.   Develop an environmental and social management and monitoring system
*   Conduct public consultations
1.3 STRATEGIC APPROACH
The consultant's environmental audit of the Mahenge irrigation scheme was characterized by three approaches: ecosystem, farmir
and participatory. The basic approach of the study is illustrated in Figure 1.
1.3.1   Ecosystem Approach
In view of the fact that the project activities are wholly based in a rural area, potential conflicts between the project and the env
are likely to arise.  Thus, issues pertaining to the use of natural resources (e.g. livestock grazing, agriculture, irrigation. wati
protection, agro-forestry, etc.) have to be studied.
In applying the ecosystem approach, the consultant not only focused on the Mahenge irrigation scheme but also on all the ec
upstream and down stream that impact the environmental and social characteristics of the area. To accomplish this. the stud) s
understanding of all activities taking place within the irrigation scheme's water catchment area. River pollution, sedimentati
floods, deforestation, destabilization of riverbanks, erosion, salinity, land degradation, and waterbome diseases (among other!
contributing to degradation of the catchment area. In suggesting mitigation measures, sustainable practices for the use of water
resources must be adopted to prevent and control environmental and social problems.
1.3.2   Farming System Approach
On the irrigation scheme level, a farming system approach was used to describe and analyse environmental and socio-economic cc
Issues related to soil contamination, water pollution, the use and dangers of pesticides and fertilizers. health, and others h;
identified. It is clear that the irrigation activities will transform village life and the whole farming system in the Mahenge area.
The success of the proposed mitigating measures will, therefore, depend on community involvement, improvement of the socio-t
situation, capacity building, and proper upgrading, maintenance and operation of the irrigation infrastructure. The latter should
account the local environment as well as the prevailing institutional, economic and social conditions.
1.3.3   Participatory Approach
A participatory approach was adopted in preparation for the environmental audit. This entailed seeking informatioll/experiel
stakeholders (i.e. farmers, district and regional officers, RBMSIIP and other institutions who have been involved in the project). Ir
ensure effective participation and cooperation it was necessary to inform stakeholders prior to the audit of the environmental ai
economic problems to be addressed. Their inputs have contributed to the development of more realistic and appropriate n
measures.

1.4 METHODOLOGY
The methodology follows Tanzanian policy and legislation and the World Bank's policies on environmiental assessment (OP/BP
related policies and guidance documents).
Available reference documents were reviewed for purposes of identifying pertinent environmental and social issues. Informa
obtained on the Lemkuna irrigation scheme before and after construction as well as during operation. Several meetings were held I
project staff, In particular, the ECU team, which was involved in the Scheme Environmental Assessment, was consulted u
background and potential issues. Subsequently, a ten-day field mission was conducted in August by the study team and members
The team was used to: I) complete further fieldwork at various Sites in the Lemkuna irrigation scheme, 2) collect additional ilnfor
work with the irrigation scheme management team, and 4) to liaise with the various stakeholders including the district officials. D
field visits, the Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan for disseminating the results of the Draft Environmental Audit were d
with the ECU staff.
1.4.1  Consultation
Public consultations took place in two phases. The first phase took place during the Environmental Audit (EA) preparation proc
initial stage allowed for the identification of the key environmental issues and involved the gathering of information on sta
concerns and views of potential environmental and social impacts. During the secondly phase, consultations allowed stakeholders I
findings and give their comments.
1.4.2  Analytical Tools
The following methodologies were applied in the process of the study:
*   Participatory data collection
*   Key informant interviews
*   Socio-economic and environmental analysis
*   Trend analysis of river flow and rainfall
*   Water and soil quality analysis
*   Geographical information systems (GIS)
Participatory Data Collection
Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) involves problem analysis, ranking, proposal planning, role assigning and timing. The roh
consisted of a facilitator who played the role of an advisor on the different matters raised during the workshop (those which the I
not informed about or aware of). In the final analysis, a Logical Framework Approach workshop (also known as ZOPP) prod

2.1.2   History of the scheme
In late 1970, some farmers started irrigated farming abstracting water Pangani River. They were mainly growing maize, ban
sugarcane for subsistence consumption. During the same period, Community Development Trust Fund (CDTF) built a weir to ft
into the traditionally developed irrigation canals and channels. It also cleared part of the 800 ha potential irrigation scheme area an
it over to the villagers.
TAN consult did a scheme assessment in association with Halcrow Rural Management in October 1995 following the recommen
the 1992/93 studies. The scheme assessment report included Engineering, Socio-Economic and Agriculture studies but ha
information on environmental issues.
In October 1996 the Government of Tanzania received assistance from the World Bank in order to improve water use efficiene
rehabilitation of smallholder irrigation schemes in the Rufiji and Pangani River basins (where Lemkuna scheme found).
In October 1999 the Govemment of Tanzania received the final report on Review of Environmental Issues and Prepat
Environmental Implementation Program from the consultant in order to improve water use efficiency and its sustainable con:
through rehabilitation of smallholder irrigation schemes in the Rufiji and Pangani River basins.
The Lemkuna irrigation scheme was constructed/rehabilitated and completed in 2002. The scheme has a total irrigated area of a
ha. Crops irrigated include paddy, maize and vegetables.
2.1.3   Existing land use
The total irrigated area of Lemkuna scheme is 800 ha. The area is characterised by three major land uses namely; rain fed agriculture,
agriculture, and livestock keeping. The farm size ranges from I to 2 -ha per household.
By far the main social-economic activity of the villagers of Lemkuna is livestock rearing. This is firstly because of semi-arid chara
of the area, but secondly also because of the social-cultural characteristics of the Maasai who dominate the area, i.e. they prefer
rearing more than any other social-economic activity.
In light of the above outlined situation. therefore. land under irrigation/agricultural cultivation at Lemkuna sillage is onlx a tin\ pi
of the totally available village land. Indeed. this situation is similar also countrywide, but in these cases. it's due to various other
Similar with some other irrigation schemes, residential areas of the Lemkuna scheme are not far away from the farms.
2.1.4   Farming Systems
Irrigated farm crops at the scheme are categorized mainly as food and commercial crops. The food crops include maize and pa
growing season for paddy is from November to early January and maize is grown from the end of May. Paddy yield varies fr
kglha (low) to 3900 kg/ha (high) with an average production of 2250 kg/ha. The price at planting is 12,000 /= per bag an
harvesting time is around Tsh. 8,000/=. Yields from maize vary from 1250 kg/ha at a price of Tshs 7,500/bag. The area irrigated I
is estimated to be 400 ha and the area irrigated for maize is about 50 ha. Other crops grown at small scale are tomatoes, onia
variety of vegetables.
Hand hoe is the predominant tool used for cultivation, few people use hired tractors. Most of the farm produce is sold to the loc;
within the village. Apart from the local trading, there are some trades men from Mwanga district who came in the village during h
period to buy crops. Vegetables and tomatoes are sold at Nyumba ya Mungu village (spillway) about 6 km from Lemkuna.
2.2 THE BIO-PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
2.2.1  Climate
The scheme lies in the marginal area where the climatic conditions are rather severe with annual rainfall generally less than 500
and an average with annual air temperature of 25 Ca. There are two rainfall seasons, the main rains usually falls during the period,
to may and small less reliable rains occurs in the period of November to December. The rest of the year is dry. The agro- met
parameter for Lemkuna irrigation scheme was taken from TPC Langasai meteorological station as shown in the table below.

Assessment Report, 1998)
The only available water resources for Lemkuna scheme is the Pangani River. The direct discharge from the catchment area
Nyumba ya Mungu and Lemkuna village are considered to be very small due to the dry condition at the upstream and control g:
dam. An average discharges from Nyumba ya Mungu Dam is estimated at 24.6 m3/s.
The source of water for Lemkuna irrigation scheme is Pangani River about 6 km downstream Nyumba ya Mungu. The scheme
granted a water right to abstract 500 I/sec. However frequent floods occurs depending on the operation of the hydropower
Nyumba ya Mungu. It causes floods to Lemkuna irrigation scheme. Severe floods occurred in the 1997 due to El-Nino rains.
farmers experience paddy fields on the lower end of the irrigation scheme become water logged for long time due to lack of
system. Water remains in the ponds from January to May.
2.2.2  Topography and Soils
The topography of Lemkuna area is relatively flat with ground slope ranging 0.5 % to 1%. The soils are composed of alluvial in
close to Pangani River bank. As you stretch further from the river soils are composed of course textured within the village area. li
the scheme soils ranges from light soils to heavy soils. Soil analysis has been classified based on its suitability for crop production.
2.2.3  Water Resources
The quantity of water at Lemkuna irrigation scheme can be estimated by flow records at gauging station ID8C located do\
Nyumba ya Mungu. The average monthly minimum flow at this station varies between 17.2 and 23.8 cumecs in February and Oct(
annual average minimum discharge is 20 cumecs. It is apparently that the river carries substantial amounL of flow (water I
assessment report (September 1998). The quantity of water for irrigation is 5001/s, which will be used for intended development n
400 ha.

Domestic Water Supply
The villagers depend on irrigation water for domestic use. The quality of water for domestic consumption is questionable due to I
The water does not receive any kind of treatment prior to its use by humans. Livestock also use water directly from irrigation cana
are no specific watering points for livestock.
Water conflict
There has been some continuous tension and conflict between the irrigators over distribution of water. Apart from irrigation, water
river is used for other activities. During the study, it was observed that river water is used for domestic purposes, for irrigation a
for livestock. Other uses do have a significant influence on the quality of water for irrigation; namely: activities like bathing and w
the canals.
Water use conflict
The nature of the water use conflict at the Lemkuna scheme is that up-stream communities pollute the water so much, that it
unsuitable for down-stream users e.g. villagers of Lemkuna.
Water quality
A total of eight (8) water samples were collected from the Lemkuna (Simanjiro District) irrigation scheme. The sampling locati
systematically chosen so as to track on the quality of water as it trickles down the irrigation scheme. Samples were taken from tl
and downstream end. Others were collected within the irrigation farms (channels) themselves. A detailed data is presented and
in Chapter 5.
2.2.4   Soil
Soil survey was carried out on the 4h September 2003. The survey was carried during dry season therefore it was somehow imposs
asses the crop yield. The area is ranked class 4. Crops grown are maize, beans, vegetables, cassava, bananas and coffee all under I
rainfall and irrigation.

2.3 THE ECO SOCIO -CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
2.3.1   Flora and fauna
Almost all the project area is under cultivation with scattered trees and ample grazing land outside the scheme. Some wild animal
monkeys, crocodiles, birds, and rates were reported. Flora and Fauna species seen there are common types. No species requirin
preservation have been seen.
The remarkable features found in the project area and neighborhood is presented in the table below.

2.3.2   Eco-climate
The village lies in Eco-climatic zone 5 within the Maasai Steppe ecosystem. It is an arid thorn bushland and thicket clim.
dominated by Commoziphora. Acacia tortilis. A. mellifera. Balanites aegyptica, and Boscia angustifolia, Capparis tomnentosa tret
Ocinzuon suave, Sericocomnopsis hildebrandiii. and Sansevieria intermedia dominate forb community. Common grasses are
Cenchrus Digitaria, Aristida and Chlor-is grass species.
The predominant land use in this zone is pastoralism and wildlife. The annual rainfall is often less than 600 mm. During the di
temperatures are consistently above 30°C and rarely drop to 20°C at night. There is high annual potential evaporation range of
1900 mm and 2000 mm. The land is of marginal agricultural potential and suited to agriculture only where fertile soils coinm
irrigationl potential or favourable rainfall. Generally rains are unpredictable, fall in mosaics and areas suffer from frequent droL
famines.
Lemkuna Village is situated in a valley bottom of Pangani River circumscribed by Laletema mountain ranges and the Pare Mounta
2.3.3   Vegetation
Lemkuna Village has three distinct vegetation types that form important habitats for wild animals, birds, insects and rodents. VE
Soil type and availability of water influence the land use pattems in the village.
Riverine Vegetation
This vegetation is found and extends to about twenty metres on both sides of the river at the widest point and about five 1
narrowest stretch. The plants in this vegetation depend on the fiver for their moisture requirement. It is characteristically everg
dominated by Ficus sycomoras, Acacia xyanthophlea. reeds (Typha species), Panicum maximum, cynadon species and isolated
reclinata. It is an open wooded grassland because trees constitute about 20% of the canopy cover and occupies less than 1% of
village land area. Maize, vegetables and bananas are commonly grown in this vegetation type after paddy harvesting.
Short grassland
This is edaphic short grassland characterised by water logging and alkaline soils. Farmers commonly call these soils Magadi.
means alkaline or soda areas. The common grass species include Sporobolus spicatus, S. homblei and Cynodon species. It i
vegetation that most of the irrigation scheme was opened. Because of the edaphic characteristics, only paddy does well in this:
short grassland occupies about 15% of the entire village land area.
Wooded bushland
This vegetation type constitutes over 80% of the village land area. It is a typical arid thorn bushland with thickets. The comn
species include:
14



Trees: Acacia tortilis, A. mellifera, Commiphora species, Balanites aegyptica, Boscia angustifolia. Capparis tomentosa, Grewi.
and Candelabrum species.
Forbs: Sericocomopsis hildebrandtii. Ocimum suave, Sansevieria intermedia and Solanum incunum.
Grasses: Sporobolus africanus, S. marginatus S. spicatus, Panicum species, Cenchrus digitaria, Aristida and Chloris rhoxyburgia,
This is the area where pastoralism and wildlife are major land-use forms. Small-scale rain-fed cultivation is also practised in
mosaics of fertile soils but poor yields and crop failures are frequent occurrence.
2.4 THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
2.4.1   Population
Lemkuna village was originally scatted composed of indigenous ethnic group, mainly the Masai pastoral with a population of a
people. In 1975 during villagerization programme the village was registered and more people were settled. In the same year the
scheme was constructed with financial assistance from the Community Development Trust Fund (CDTF) and more people migrat
area.
According to the village leaders, the population at Lemkuna village was below expectation, then exercise cancelled needed to be
but at 1 999 was estimated to be 1 711 people and the village had 329 households of which 192 households are involved in
activities and the remaining 137 households are pastoralist. There are 695 adults and 1016 children.
Beneficiaries of Lemkuna irrigation scheme, come from two villages namely Lemkuna A and Lemkuna B. The total population
The main ethnic groups in the scheme area are Wapare, Wamaasai, and immigrants from Lake Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa
doing fishing activities but are other smaller groups. The majority of these are agriculturalists and pastoralists. The whole populati.
the scheme and downstream, is supplied with neither tap water nor hand pump wells. So they depend on the river as a sole s.
domestic water supply, water from the irrigation canal may be used for washing and bathing, especially in places where the canal
the proximity of the houses.
Income generating activities
The main occupation of villaaers in Lemkuna irrigation scheme is farming and pastoralisim. Farming is the major source of incomi
most of the households t. Mostly women have heavy workload per day to fulfil, while man can only work for two hours a day. mor
women have no or very little participation in decision making especially when matters of access to resources and %hat to be sold a
harvest arises.
Market
Despite being close to the Northem highway, farmers complained about lack of access to market information. Most of the farmers
products to traders (middlemen from Mwanga) at Nyumba ya Mungu market at a relatively low price compared to the cost incurm
production. Villagers are not well informed on crop price changes and rely on these traders for such information, which is often mi
Credit facilities
The village has no specific credit facility to help farmers apart from UWALE in boosting their income from farm activities, alt
recent years a ward bank has been established. One of the conditions is to form groups to facilitate easy access to loans.
Energy availability
Fuel wood is the most common source of energy for households. But with the expansion of the village and increase in popula
wood availability has increasingly become difficult. Some of the villagers have to buy fuel wood.
Communication
The village is not close to the Northen highway and as such transportation is a big issue, where as the road heading to the vill.
Nyumba ya Mungu village are passable throughout the year.
Work Load
Improvement of the irrigation scheme has brought about increased water to the fields, which goes hand in hand with increased
for irrigators. Prior to improvements workload was relatively less due to some of the farms inability to get water. Women in partic
15



more burden due to the fact that in the wet season they are busy with paddy and maize and switch to vegetables in the dr,
Vegetables fetch good money and are easily marketable within the village.
Household income management
The major source of income is from farming, which accounts for 96% of all income sources. Findings from discussion indicate th
families both husband and wife have control over household income. In most families men have an upper hand on household im
mitigate this, some women have resorted to acquire their own land to reduce conflicts with their husbands.
Markets and marketing information
The findings show that farmers' access to market and market information is a major problem at the Lemkuna scheme due
accessibility especially during rainy seasons. It was found out that majority of the farmers depend on local buyers, with only a
selling to non local buyers and the rest produce for their own domestic cotisumption.
Existing facilities near the irrigation scheme
There is one public primary school within the scheme area which it caters mainly for pupils both outside and inside the scheme. T
health facility, but about 5-Km outside the scheme. Generally speaking, farmers in Lemkuna area lack adequate social servic
vicinity of the scheme area.
Sanitation in Lemkuna village is generally of poor quality due to existing extensive rural characteristics. They use traditional
which do not have adequate roofing, and have poorly constructed walls.
Energy Supply
Fuel-wood and charcoal are the main sources of energy for cooking. In view of abundance availability of woodlands in the vi
human settlements, availability of wood fuel is not a problem.
There are no traders selling charcoal in the area apparently because charcoal is considered to be relatively more expensive to
firewood, hence no market for it. There is no electricity and kerosene is used for lighting.
Extension Services
The farmers enjoy extension services. Villagers are advised on the type of fertilisers to use, depending on the type of crops
planting and on the type of pesticides.
Social Capital
There are a few organisations operating in the area and all of them are community based namely women groups and a co-operative
2.4     DESCRIPTION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS
In villages around the Lemkuna scheme, field study showed that there are no environmentally sensitive areas of special scientit
cultural values.

3. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND STAKEHOLDER
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Government of Tanzania/S IDA's: Land Management Program for Environmental Conservation (LAMP) Project
This project started in 1989. As its' name implies, its' major activity is to promote environmental conservation through land mar
in the district. Originally its' area of focus was mainly in the then Babati District. With the same strategic approach, the current fc
extension of Babati District into the following districts; namely: Simanjiro (to which the Lemkuna irrigation scheme belongs)
Kiteto District.
The project is a joint undertaking between the Govemment of Tanzania in collaboration with the Govemment of Sweden (thr
Swedish Intemational Development Agency i.e. SIDA).
3.1.1   Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs)
Field studies identified the following NGO working in the Lemkuna area: namely: World Vision (Tanzania).
World Vision provides several types of humanitarian assistance, i.e. in terms of social services e.g. water supply, educational facil
as schools) as well as health facilities (e.g. health services).The focus of the organisation is on all districts of Manyara Region.
churches finance the organisation.
The organization operates Moipo Area Development Programme (ADP) operating which started in 1993 for the Msitu wa Tembo
within seven villages. The major issues of concem to be addressed by the ADP were community development and transfom
different sectors of health development, education, water.
In 1998 World Vision established another element of advocacy to sensitize the community on the rights for a girl child education a
of children in general, which includes effects of (FGM) Female Genital Mutilation. The project also worked close with the comr
shun harmful cultural practices and attitudes while promoting existing good cultural practices and attitudes.
However they also have been providing training on matters of leadership capacity development to sovernment leaders. mei
development committees, on how to manage funds, people who work with those committees, and at the same time howv to ma
utilize available resources.
3.2    WATER USERS ASSOCIATION
Villagers of Lemkuna have also duly formed their committees and/or co-operative movement i.e. the UWALE with 347 r
members whereby the number of farmers is 206. During the village consultation it was found that most of the members of th
govemment also belong to the village co-operative movement i.e. UWALE and vice-versa.
This guarantees continuity/sustainability of UWALE. By far the major constraint for operational functioning of the village
operative organization however, is poor transport/communication facilities to enable pulling together all villagers in the vast area.
UWALE's major interest is irrigation cultivation. Several members of UWALE are, however, also members of village gove
operational committee and vice versa. This ensures sustainability of the proposed Environmental and Social Management Plan.
3.3 STAKEHOLDER'S ROLE
3.3.1  Identified stakeholders
In order of vested powers in decision-making, enforcement roles and the identified stakeholders are as follows:
* District Council's i.e., through the District Executive, Director (DED) with his/her relevant coommittee and functional officers
District Agricultural and Livestock Development Officer (DALDO), District Water Engineer, District Council Development o
etc.
17



   Ward Executive Officers i.e., through the Ward Executive Officers (WEO) with their relevant committee and functional office
Ward Agricultural Officer.
*   Village Executive Officer i.e. through the village Executive Officers (VEO) with their relevant committee and functional offic
Village Agricultural Officer.
*   Water users association.
*   Farmers' groups/associations.
*   Private organization, e.g. NGOs, CBOs, etc
*   Donors
3.3.2   Analysis of stakeholders
In general for sake of sustainability influential role of all the identified stakeholders is synergetic. For example, at the highest I
District Council chaired by the council chairperson with all its relevant committees and functional officers has to be fully involve
they can put in their agenda and plans financial issues of the scheme. In that way further development of the scheme will get
support and the authority it requires.
Likewise even at the lowest level (i.e. at village government/farmers associations level) the stakeholders need to be fully involvec
being at grass-roots, they are capable of providing solution on a routine bases.
3.3.3  Involvement of stakeholders in environmental audit and implementation of ESMP
In view of the above therefore different stakeholders were and will be involved in environmental auditing and implementation of
follows:
Water users association
Managing water resources within schemes
Farmer's associations/groups
Carrying out routine activities/controlling actions
Identifying/formulating required action to VEO.
Savings and credit organisations.
V'illage Executive Office (VEO)
Grass-roots representation of local government system.
Mobilizes, receives, identified required action and forwards them to WEO for considerations.
Ward Executive Officer (WEO)
Grass roots representative of local government system.
Mobilizes, receives checks and controls identified required action and forvards them to District Council (through relevant its comt
District Council
District development planning.
Mobilizes, receives and deliberates identified required action and incorporates  them into the district development plan for financ
Finance/overseas implementation of the identified actions.
Private Organization/NGOs/CBOs
Promotes identification and implementation of identified action.
Helps to secure funding of the actions.
Donor agency
Promotes development cooperation.
Finances/overseas implementation of action plans
3.3.4   Ensuring incorporation of concern of stakeholders in ESMP
In order to ensure the concerns of stakeholders are incorporated in ESMP, it is proposed that the following measures be tal
finalization/submission of the ESMP:
Seeking government approval of ESMP
18



This government approval of ESMP is imperative because the councils are not allowed to implement a plan unknown to the gov
Under these circumstances the ESMP has to be approved firstly by MAFS, NEMC and then by PO-RALG.
Dissemination of the ESMP to relevant district
After govemment approval, then the ESMP should be disseminated to the relevant districts for implementation. This should be fol
by a series of workshops, seminars, etc. to allow for public discussions on the ESMP. The discussions should start at district level
percolate to lower and lower levels as indicated above.

4.     COMPLIANCE WITH TANZANIA'S POLICIES, LEGAL                                         FRAMEWORI
AND WITH WORLD BANK'S SAFE GUARD POLICIES
4.1    NATIONAL POLICIES
Relevant policies with a bearing on agricultural and rural development in general, and irrigation in particular, and therefore I
irrigation scheme, have been examined. These include the National Environment policy, the Land policy, the National Water p(
Energy policy, the National Agriculture policy, Draft Rural Development Policy, Poverty Reduction Strategy, Draft Rural Devi
Strategy, Agriculture S ector Development Strategy, the Forest policy and the Wildlife policy. These policies affect direct key
activities and were examined because they automatically affect important I and uses in the area vis-a-vis: agriculture. water, I
energy, forest and wildlife.
4.1.1  National Environment Policy of 1997
Implementation of the river basin management and smallholder irrigation project and particularly the irrigation schemes under op
consistent with the overall objectives of the National Environment Policy. The policy provides a framework for multi-sectoral parl
and cooperation to achieve sustainable development; and seeks to ensure sustainable and equitable use of resources for meeting
needs of present and future generations, without degrading the environmental resource base or risking health and safety. Tt
emphasize the need to prevent and control degradation of land, water, vegetation and air which constitute our life support sy
conserve and enhance our natural and man made heritage; including biological diversity; to improve the condition and prodm
degraded areas including rural and urban settlements; to raise public awareness and understanding of the essential linkages
environment and development and promote individual and community participation in environmental action, among others.
Furthermore the policy calls for improved agricultural practices, and better utilization of the scarce water for irrigation. ensure el
minimize looses and avoid salinization as well as proper use of agrochemicals to minimize reduce/pollution of water sources.
The design, re-construction and operation of the schemes have taken into account the above considerations. Additionally. plannec
of farmers in effective and efficient management of water resources intends to contribute to achievement of the objectivt
environnmenlt policy.
Agriculture Policy 1997
The implementation of the RBM-SIIP on the basis of farmer groups and rural community participation is consistent %Nith the Ag
and Livestock Policy (ALP) of 1997, which provides policy guidance on the development of the agricultural sector. The policy
ensure that the direction and pattern of development in the sector meets economic, social and environmental objectives, The polic
accelerated growth of production and exports through among others, assuring national food security, developing and introdu(
techinologies which will increase productivity of labour and land; promote integrated and sustainable use and management o
resources and providing agricultural support services.
The smallholder irrigation projects aims at providing agricultural support services; improve income of the rural poor, promote rat
of water resources and introduce appropriate technologies among others.
4.1.2   Land Policy of 1995
The National Land Policy of 1995 provides incentives for efficient use of land and its resources. It seeks to promote and ensure
land tenure system, encourage optimal use of land resources and facilitate broad-based social and economic development wi
setting or endangering the ecological balance of the environment. Farmer groups and communities participating in the proj
acquired customary rights of occupancy from their respective villages and some villages are processing granted rights. Both gra
customary rights of occupancy secure land ownership add incentives for farmers to maintain and develop their farms accordingl.
land use conflicts and increase the value of land.
4.1.3  Water Policy of 2002
The National Water Policy (2002) provides a comprehensive framework for promoting optimal, sustainable and equitable developi
use of water resources for sustainable development. The policy seeks to ensure supply of good quality of water to meet (
environmental and other priority development purpose. Emphasis is placed on the need to ensure more efficient utilization of existi
resources through institutional improvements, proper soil management to prevent soil erosion and flooding and improved moni
control water quality and contamination from industrial sewerage and excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers. These objective
on integrated and holistic planning and management in areas, water use and disposal of effluents. The planned project objec

supportive of the objectives of the water policy through education, awareness and training on better agricultural practices, effe,
efficient utilization of water, water conservation, and application of agrochemicals to minimize pollution of water sources to n
few.
4.1.4   Forest Policy of 1998
The main objective of the National Forestry Policy is to enhance contribution of the forestry sector in sustainable socio-e
development of the country, as well as conservation and management of the natural resource-base for the benefit of both the repn
future generations. In view of the general objective, the policy focuses its intervention in the following four area (i) fo
management
Conservation of the forestry resources in the upper catchment is crucial for ensuring sustainable flows of water for irrigation purr
other uses. The establishment of the scheme is thus an extra incentive for undertaking conservation measures in the catchment an
Meru.
4.1.5   Wildlife Policy of 1998
The main Wildlife Policy is to seek involvement of a broader section of the society in wildlife conservation, and in particular the n
communities, as well as the private sector with only a role of stimulating and duly guiding both the rural local communities and th
sector by administering, regulating and promoting management of wildlife resources. In view of this general objective, the policy
it interventions in the following area: (i) wildlife protection (i.e. incorporating management and development of protected a
wildlife utilization (i.e. incorporating promotion of establishment of Wildlife Management Areas conservation as well as mar
measures and (iii) intemational corporation and coordination. Within the scheme there are no wildlife management ar.
developments have also concentrated on the already existing scheme, with therefore little likelihood of encroaching into wildlife ar
4.1.6   Energy Policy of 2002 (Draft)
Sufficient and efficient supply of energy is crucial for national development. The objective of the energy policy is therefore to con
the national socio-economic development process by providing an efficient energy production, procurement, transportation. dih
and end-use system in an environmentally sound manner and with due regard to gender issues.
Provision of energy for scheme farmers in a convenient manner will allow more time for women farmers to participate in farm act
is against this background that communities are being encouraged to use fuel-efficient charcoal and wood stoves.
4.2 LEGAL FRAMEWORK
The smallholder irrigation project will be implemented in the overall context legal framework that govems agricultural z
development. Some of the few legal frameworks that are supportive of the project include but not limited to: -
4.2.1   Environment Legislation
Currently Tanzania lacks a single comprehensive environmental legal framework or environmental law. Efforts are underway t
such a framework. To-date, the management of environment and natural resources is govemed by fragmented sectoral pieces of It
that are yet to be fully harmonized.
There are some guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and the Govemment is working on an act to make ElAs m
for all development projects. In this regard an environmental legislation aimed at "promoting and managing environmental conser
the country" is in the making
The term "environmental" legislation incorporates nearly one hundred acts and ordinances and several additional subsidiary k
from all sectors of the economy, which affect the environment. However, given the broad policy goal of achieving sustainable dev.
and the specific policy objectives, issues of unsustainable utilization of resources, deforestation, desertification, salinizati
degradation, pollution of water resources, and impacts on rural land use have been emphasized.
The design and operational strategy of the Lemkuna scheme have taken these legal considerations into account.
21



4.2.2   NEMC Act no.19 of 1983
This act establishes the National Environment Management Council as a statutory body responsible for advising and coo
environmental management i ssues. A mong the many functions of the Council, the act seeks to provide a framework for evalt
existing and proposed development policies, programmes, plans and activities of both public and private that are likely to a
environment and recommend measures to ensure adequate account of environmental effects. Furthermore, the act provide!
specification of environmental standards, norms, criteria, guidelines for the protection and maintenance of the quality of the envi
cooperation between g ovemment, local authorities and bodies engaged in environmental programmes and stimulate public an
participation in environmental and natural resource management.
Relevant legislation pertaining to agricultural development in general, and irrigation in particular and how it relates to the
projects, including Lemkuna irrigation scheme was examined. The following are the sectoral environment legislations.
4.2.3   Land Act no. 4 and Village Land Act no. 5 of 1999
Both laws became operational in May 2001, following the approval of their regulations. The acts seek control land use an
controversial issues pertaining to ownership of land and land-based resources, transactions on land and land administration. The
act identifies three categories of land i.e. village (customary land); public/gazetted land (i.e. national parks, forest reserves) an(
land that does not fall in any of the above two categories for private investment.
Implementation of the project is consistent with both legislations. For purposes of controlling land in the village and to protec
alienation to foreign investors, village govemments would be given documents indicating their boundaries. However, in order to g
to land there i s a need for completion of the process of land survey and demarcation which amounts to land titling and allo
different land use categories to speed up investment in agriculture.
Land allocation at the Lemkuna scheme was guided by existing land tenure arrangements, which are in line with these legal pr
Both men and women have received irrigation plots.
4.2.3  Wk'ildlife Act 1974 (with amendments of 1978)
Wildlife act provides for protection, conservation, development, regulations and control in both acquisition and utilization of pr,
both fauna and flora. To this end, therefore the Act stipulates "modus operandi', i.e. required restrictions in the following an
protected areas: namely game reserves, game controlled areas, partial game reserves, national parks. etc. (ii) proper procedures in
capturing and photographing of wildlife and (iii) proper handling of trophies. Furthermore, in the wake of the Wildlife polic
stipulates for villagers' involvement in Wildlife Management Areas (WMA), the Act also provides modalities and proce(
designation. operation and involvement of local communities in the management of the WMAs. Within the scheme there are nc
management areas.
4.2.4   Water Acts of 1974
As mentioned before the Water Acts principally seek to ensure that water is utilized without sectoral conflicts, and withoul
pollution. This is the spirit of both Act no. 42 of 1974 and Act no. 10 of 1981. They were enacted to control and protect water n
The legislation defines "water" as all water flowing over the surface of the ground or contained or flowing in or from a spring or
natural lake, swamp or beneath a watercourse. The Act places a regime of water rights to govern access to water use. Pollutio
norms and standards are embodied in the water rights.
Apart from incorporating pollution control and having prevention conditionality in the water rights, the Act goes a step further by I
place a regime in consent with discharge of effluent. Under Section 15 A (I) of the Act, no person may discharge of effluent
commercial, industrial or other trade waste systems into receiving waters without a consent duly granted by a Water Officer. The
contains two schedules, which set standards for receiving waters and effluent. The Lemkuna irrigation has a water right in which f
and obligations of scheme operators, the farmers, are stipulated.
4.2.5   Forest Act 1974
The Forest Act deals with the protection of forests and forest products in forest reserves and restrictions and prohibitions in forest
The forest management plans are administered under the Forest Ordinance (1957). Any contravention of the restrictions and proh
considered an offence under this ordinance and subject to enforcement. However, the law is being revised to meet new requiremet
a new Forest Policy. There is no forest land within the scheme area.
22



4.2.6  The Town and Country Planning Ordinance, Cap 378 of 1956
The Town and Country Planning Ordinance Cap 378, Part IV provides for control of urban development while implementing a s
land development. Important aspects include the designation and allocation of adequate land for solid waste disposal in any urban
The law further stipulates the design of a good sewerage system to manage liquid waste from various major water consumers.
empowers local authorities to enforce such schemes and punishments as stipulated in the Act. The law further empowers neight
any individual to take to court anyone who injuriously affects others due to his/her unhygienic activities. The Water Users' Asso
the scheme may pass by-laws to this effect. However, they would need support from local authorities, particularly with X
enforcement.
4.2.7   Local Government Act (District and Urban Authorities) Acts of 1982
This Act provides detailed responsibility for urban and district councils in the administration of their day-to-day activitie
management is pointed out as one of the activities to be managed by urban authorities. This Act is the backbone of tht
Govemment's operation, powers, responsibilities of various local authorities and structure. The law requires that the Village As
act as the apex authorities in decision-making processes at the village level. However, such meetings rarely take place in most
leaving decisions to be made by few leaders without having consulted with the village public. This being the case, man)
Govemments fail to bring about development for their villagers.
4.2.8   Land Use Planning Commission Act of 1984
The National Land Use Commission (NLUC) was established under this Act as the principal advisory organ of the Govemme
matters related to land use. Among other things, it recommends measures to ensure that the Govemment policies, including
development and conservation of land are in harmony. It also takes adequate account of their effects on land use and seek
advancement of scientific knowledge of changes in land use; it encourages the development of technology to prevent, or minimize
effects that endanger man's health and his/her welfare; it also specifies standards, norms and criteria for the protection of benefi
and the maintenance of the quality of the land.
In accordance with the functions mentioned above, the Commission can indirectly help to prevent or minimize pollution by r
location of potential and actual pollution sources. The major issue is the sectoralisation of the Govemment's operations while n
holistic view of each activity on land and their impacts on others. There is a tendency of each sector making decisions %kithout c,
the others. For example, Wildlife Division can designate an area for game conservation without consulting the Agriculture E
Security Divisions to avoid grabbing land for agriculture activities.
The Lemkuna scheme is included in the National Irrigation Development Plan, which has been officially adopted by the Govemrnt
4.2.9  The Land Acquisitions Act of 1967
The Land Acquisition Act gives powers to the President to take "land" from private occupants for public purposes when the
interests to do so. The new Land laws declare all land in Tanzania as "Public Land" and vested to the President as trustee of all
However, the Land Acquisition law has been watered down by the New Land Laws, which restrict the President's powers not t
land without negotiation with the owners. Again the new laws stipulate detailed compensations to be paid on any acquired
amounts to deterring the President to do so without careful considerations.
4.2.10 By-Laws
All villages in Tanzania are allowed to form by-laws. This has been done in Lemkuna village whose by-laws address proper us
and water to ensure public health.
43      NATIONAL STRATEGIES
In order to guide national development more effectively and systematically, Tanzania has prepared a number of strategies a
operationalizing the various policies in key sectors. Some of the strategies that have a bearing on irrigation development and
below include: the Govemment Vision 2025, Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Rural Sector Development Strategy and the Ag
Sector Development Strategy.
4.3.1   Government Development Vision 2025
23



The Govemment Development Policy 2025 is guiding framework for national development to the year 2025. It aims at achievir
quality livelihood for the people, characterized by sustainable and equitable growth. It also aims at attaining good govemance thi
rule of law and at developing a strong and competitive economy by moving from a less developed country (LDC) to a middle
country by 2025.
Scheme irrigation committees and water users' associations are potential nuclei for promoting good govemance and democratic
in rural villages. By adhering to common practices and cropping pattems, farmers will realize more or less equal and higher incom-
4.3.2   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of 2000
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) concentrates on efforts aimed reducing income poverty; improving human car
survival and social well-being. The PRSP has set medium term goals to be achieved by the year 2010 through sustaining macroe
stability, rural sector development and export, and private sector development.
Improvement of food supply and security is the key to infant and matemity health as well as to income generation. A number of E
including construction and consultancy services have been performed by the private sector. This has contributed to local capacity b
4.3.3   Rural Sector Development Strategy (RDS) of 2000
The Strategy aims at reducing rural poverty as means of managing resources sustainably, since widespread poverty in rural areas
people, in search for survival, to over-exploit the natural resources. The RDS envisages the following:
*   Revising legislation and regulations with a view to enhancing community participation in management and utilization of natur
resources.
*   Revising the licensing procedures related to utilization of natural resources.
*   Introducing procedures for cost and benefit sharing of natural resources.
*   Introducing EIA as a pre-requisite for all development projects.
*   Developing procedures for natural resources with regard to entitlement of the state. communities and indix iduals.
*   Developing procedures for conflict resolution in matters of natural resources utilization.
The Lemkuna scheme will contribute to the principle objective of the RDS of poverty reduction through raising incomes ai
resource utilization. The work of the water users' association involves a number of elements targeted by the Strategy.
4.3.4   Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS) of 2001
The ASDS. which was formulated through a broad based consultative process. aims at transforming the agricultural secti
modernized, commercial, highly productive and profitable sector that shall utilize natural resources in a sustainable manner and sh
an effective basis for intersectoral linkages.
The ASDS will address the key weaknesses facing the agricultural sector, which include low productivity, poor coordination an
capacity, underdeveloped supporting facilities, erosion of the natural resource base, inappropriate technology, dependency on
agriculture, impediments to food market access as well as low public and private expenditure levels.
The investments and other interventions made in improving the irrigation system at Lemkuna are highly relevant and well in line
targets of the ASDS. These improvements will contribute to higher productivity, income generation, better water and land utilizati
which are targets of the Strategy.
4.4 COMPLIANCE WITH WORLD BANK SAFEGUARD POLICIES
A list of World Bank environmental and social safeguard policies is listed in Appendix 2. This part of the report contains an analy
compliance of the Lemkuna scheme with the Bank Safeguard policies. It is based on intensive field observation by the study tear
which discussions were held with the farmers and other local people, Village and District officials and project staff. The repo
based on the review of various existing documents.
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)
In order to ascertain that project proposals submitted for funding are environmentally sound and sustainable, the Bank
environmental assessment (EA) of the proposals. An Environmental Assessment (EA) of Lemkuna Scheme was carried out as p.
24



overall base line study of the scheme. The assessment also built on the work done earlier by the Environmental cell Unit (ECI
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security.
The findings of the study were discussed with farmers and their leaders at meetings held at the scheme and with District officit
opinions and ideas were taken into account in finalizing the Environmental and Social Management and Monitoring Plan.
The farmers, through their cooperative society and with support from extension staff are responsible for implementatio:
recommended mitigation measures in accordance with the Environmental and Social Management Plan.
The rehabilitation will improve the irrigation efficiency from the earlier estimated rate of between 10 and 20% to 30%. The i
system, together with further farmers' training in water management and scheme maintenance, plus the effectiveness of the Wat
Association will result in use of less irrigation water.
From the above-mentioned observation the Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme is considered to be in compliance with the Bank Envir
Assessment.
Natural Habitat (OP/BP 4.04)
Lemkuna irrigation scheme is a relatively old established scheme. It has only recently been rehabilitated and improved. It exp
restricted on all four sides in an extensively cultivated areas. There are therefore no neighbouring natural habitats which require p
and conservation. The scheme does not therefore trigger this safeguard policy of the Bank.
Pest Management (OP 4.09)
Use of pesticides at the Lemkuna scheme is currently at low level. The farmers, through the extension service, are encouraged
IPM approaches. Farmers are also trained on the safe use, storage and disposal of chemicals. These efforts will lead to greater co
with the Integrated Pest Management policy of the Bank.
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
Lemkuna is an old scheme which been rehabilitated. The scheme farmers have been living in the area since the end of the WorI
when they migrated to the area, the place was only bushland. There was therefore no resettlement undertaken. The scheme does n,
the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard policy.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)
The farmers of Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme belong to different ethnic groups, mainly Waarusha. Wachagga. Wapare. Wanyira
Wanyaturu. They are permanently settled in the area. These are not considered as indigenous people in the sense of this safeguar
There is full compliance with this policy.
Forests (OP/BP 4.36)
The irrigation scheme has no potential impacts on forested areas. The scheme may not trigger by this Safeguard policy.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37)
There is a dam upstream of Lemkuna irrigation scheme. The scheme does not trigger this policy.
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03 - draft OP 4.11)
The scheme does n ot h ave movable o r immovable objects, s ites, n atural features a nd I andscapes t hat h ave a rchaeological, palaentological.
architectural, religious, aesthetic, or cultural significance. Therefore, the scheme is not triggered by this safeguard policy.
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50)
The scheme is using Pangani River which does not flow to other states. It is not therefore triggered by this safeguard policy.
Project in Disputed Areas (OP/BP 7.60)
The scheme is not in disputed areas and it does not therefore trigger this safeguard policy.
Consultation and Disclosure Requirements (BP 17.50)
The baseline study findings and recommendations have been discussed with farmers' representatives at the scheme. They endor
findings and recotmmendations. The revised Environmental Audit report will be submitted to the relevant government authorities fi
and approval prior to the disclosure through newspapers, district offices, Kilimo and government websites.

5.0 TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES USED IN ASSESSING ENVIRONMENTAL AND
SOCIAL IMPACTS
5.1 INTRODUCTION
There are several tools and techniques recommended for predication environmental and social impacts as follows:
*   Checklists
* Interaction matrixes
*   Network
*   Geographical Information System
*   Mathematical modelling
In undertaking the assignment, the following tools and techniques were applied for assessing and analysing of environmental a
impacts of the irrigation scheme in the process of the EA study:
Checklist
The environmental checklist is used for physical observations in the assessment of the irrigation scheme.
Geographical information system (GIS)
GIS has been used in analysing hydrological changes and trends in water quality and soil study of the irrigation scheme.
5.2    IMPACT ASSESSMENT
lmpact assessment is a complex activity and is mainly based and depends on range and type of baseline date. Depending on
baseline data mainly techniques can be applied to study this for example the following:
*   Mathematical models (such as groundwater and river models, noise propagation models, air and water dispersion models
multipliers)
.   Physical models (such as hydrological models for trend analysis, wind tunnels and hydraulic models for estuaries)
*   Scientific experience. judgment and observations
*   Structured/semi-structured approaches (e.g. changes in landscape and social impacts)
Most EA use a mixture of these techniques - many appear to rely heavily on the latter two. Impacts analysis and assessment r
provide information on the following aspects:
*   Duration (time period over which they will occur)
*   Likelihood or probability of occurrence (very likely or unlikely, etc.)
.   Reversibility (natural recovery or aided by human intervention)
*   Area affected (size and whether near or far from the project)
.   Number (and characteristics) of people likely to be affected and their locations
*   Trans-boundary aspects - do impacts cross-national borders?
Due to lack of baseline data and time constraints the consultant was not able to conduct impact assessment based on mathema
physical models for the environment audit. For environmental and social impacts structured/semi-structured approaches, focus
discussions, scientific experience, observations and judgment and GIS were used to quantify and evaluate impacts.

6.0 CONSULTATIONS WITH COMMUNITY AND FARMERS
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Meetings
During the environmental auditing meetings held at district level village at scheme level. At the village level the govemment lead(
irrigator's association leaders participated in the meetings. The major aim of this meetings include the brief purpose of the envir.
auditing. but also to understand the District Development Plan how it has tackled environmental at social issue in the irrigation
while at the village level the major aim was not only to brief on the purpose of the environmental audit but to understand t
environmental and social problems and how to mitigate them.
On the same day there was a brief meeting with the Lemkuna irrigation village govemment leaders, members included th
chairperson, irrigators chairperson, treasure and other member including women; approximately ten of them. At the scheme the te
brief meeting with Area Development Program (ADP), which covers Lemkuna irrigation scheme too, they do have development
including educational, agricultural and health sectors.
On the day of 29h the team visited the Simanjiro district, which the Lemkuna irrigation scheme is located. The District Plannin;
acting while the District Director was on leave. The officer in charge provided us with the district development plan, which
different activities for the Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme.
Focused group discussion
For the Lemkuna irrigation scheme the focus group discussion was conducted for members of the irrigators association toge
village leaders and extension service officers.
Participants
While in Lemkuna irrigation scheme there were (9) nine participants including three women.
6.2     MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY STAKEHOLDERS
Polluted water
The irrigation scheme depends on the domestic and irrigation water from Nyumba ya Mungu Dam. Unfortunately the water i
polluted by the upstream users through bathing, discharging farm chemical to the river. But also the Nyumba ya Mungu reside
directed their sewage system to this Dam which is the source of irrigation and domestic water and therefore it affects the down stre
who are Lemkuna irrigation scheme and Ngage. This pollution has lead to water bome disease such as typhoid, diarrhoea. The po
also contributed by Moshi town industries which pour the waste products in the Karanga River, but also at the downwards wl
(Tanzania Plantation Company) is they use aerial spray to spray chemical for it's sugar plantation thus during rain season the chen
washed away and enter to the river. Moreover there are other people who cut down heavy logs and reduce the flow of water to the
Therefore the farmers request to have boreholes or another source of domestic water instead of depending on the river, however tl
Area Development Programme is thinking to introduce boreholes and get clean domestic water in three years time therefo
meantime the is a need to create awareness on the importance of boiling water to minimize the water bome disease through th
health officer and the ward health officer.
Soil erosion
In this village there is a big problem of soil erosion along the catch drain which is responsible for trapping the running water
mountains, it erodes soil near the banks of the catch drain and make possibilities to affect the main canal which is 2-3 mete
Therefore the farmers raise concem that there is a need to line the problematic areas with stones and motor so as to reduce the erc
guide the water to the rain drainage canal. Therefore stones can be the contribution by the farmers while the motor and technica
will be provided by RBMSIIP.
Crossways
In this scheme the constructor did not built any crossways in the field, this has cause difficulties in crossing within the fields
farmers and tractors. The canals are very deep for one to pass through.
Hence farmers elaborate there is a need to build these crossways in the field to easy the tasks and they suggest the contractor and I
to assist in building such cross ways
Absence of Turnouts
The scheme has been build with tertiary canal, but it misses the proper tertiary gate, which is used to close the water or open.
created problems such as water entering the field when not needed hence affect the crops harvesting period. Therefore there is a ne
iron gates in order to control the water and this will be done by RBMSIIC.
27



Weeds (Water Hyacinth)
In the irrigation main canal there are weeds, which are more or less recognized one of the water hyacinth species which they take a
weeks to grow after weeding has taken place. This has increased the water level of the main canal, since it occupies the canal an
the result it destroys the banks of the main canal and hence causes soil erosion.
Moreover the activity of removing is tedious because it take a lot of farmers time and reduce working hours in the field, but also I
enters into the field and affect the crop yield. However the farmers have tried to plant grasses along the canal as a control but it hi
failure due to salinity in the soil.
Therefore the farmers have suggested that the donor could line the main canal, which will reduce the amount of the weeds and
time for farmers to engage in farming however they also requested for the district to contact Plant protection office so that they cai
possibilities to control the problem.
Health
The scheme has several problematic disease which include malaria typhoid, diarrhoea, it have been realized that farmers need a
campaign in order to reduce the amount of these problem, and therefore they suggest to have awareness campaign to all farmers cc
the use of Ngao net to all group age not children alone, but also boil the water before drinking, and hence the village health of fice
of the district staff from the Ministry of health shall be responsible for the awareness campaign.
Gender issue
Farmers in this scheme are not aware of gender issue, most women have heavy workload per day to fulfil, while man can only
two hours a day, moreover women have no or very little participation in decision making especially when matters of access to I
and what to be sold after the harvest rises. Thus farmers suggest having workshops, seminars, study tour and film that can explain
of gender balance for the development of the family and the village as a whole.
Education
The village has very few educated members, this is because there are no proper facilities including teachers houses, other working
such as books and many of alike, but also most farmers do not know the importance of education both to the parents and the chill
hence the rate of dropouts is very high.
Although there are some children and families who are willing to continue with secondary education but they caninot afford to t
children very far for studies due to their economic situation.
Therefore it was suggest first to create awareness to most parents on the importance of education for their future life, also they pr
they could get an assistant for a new nearby secondary school with minimum expenses, hence could afford to take their children f
studies.
Lack of training
The farmers sho%ed they need more training on leadership. administration of the cooperative and the issue of integrated pest mai
but also study tour to the improved irrigation schemes.
Participatory environmental action plan developed by farmers during focus group discussions is presented in Appendix 3.
7.0 IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
7.1 INTRODUCTION
Key environmental and social issues/impacts identified for the Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme were based on the following sour
observations, LEE reports of 1998, and focus group discussions. Table 7.1 presents a summary of the issues that are considered
and significant now and in the future.

7.2    UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS
7.1.1  Demographic trend (population changes)
Beneficiaries of Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme come from two villages, namely Lemkuna A and Lemkuna B. The total population
Table 7.2 below shows the number of households and total population for each village.
Table 7.2: Population distributions in Lemkuna irrigation scheme

(Source: Village Executives Officers 2002)
According to the scheme improvement assessment report of July 1998, Lemkuna village had an estimated population of 171 1 peo
village had 329 households of which 192 households were involved in irrigation activities and the remaining 137 househo
pastoralists. There were 695 adults and 1016 children.
Upstream pollution
There is bad habit of trapping fish by using poisons which not only kill fish but also introduces toxins like DDT, thiodane, eupho
firucalli into the dam. High siltation at Nyumba ya Mungu Dam due to deforestation and other human activities near the vicinity ol
also contribute to contamination of the Pangani River. Sisal production activities are also potential sources o0 Comment: Could not locale this
the results of water quality tests upstream of the irrigation scheme.                         table
Catchment degradation
The catchment of Pangani River Basin upstream of Nyumba ya Mungu (NYM) is about 9000 sq. km. At the southern tip of whic,
NYM reservoir. The upstream flow into the reservoir has a significant impact in terms of siltation and water quantity. The c.
learned throigh discussions that the main threat to Lenikuna scheme is the storm runoff being generated from the surround
especially from hills located on the right side of the scheme. As a result, the drains constructed parallel to the main canal to divert i
runoff are being undermined by erosion. It is the fear of the farmers that the bank of the drains may be broken sooner or later and
with the maii canal. The major problem. according to the farmers, is salinity. Grasses can't grow in the vicinitN of the scheme. It
established whether the problem is a water quality problem from Pangani River or the nature of the soil in the scheme area.

7.2.2   Changed water quality on downstream users
Table 7.3 shows water quality data upstream and downstream of the scheme. All parameters measured except FC and dissolve(
increase downstream. The pH is 9.13, which is in the alkaline range. The dissolved oxygen (DO) ranged from 4.86 mg/I to If
indicating good aeration and fairly low organic pollution in the water. The salinity and total dissolved solids (TDS) values of the i
water (measured from the intakes and downstream) indicate that the water used for irrigation is slightly saline which may indicate
for regular monitoring. The salinity range in the entire scheme is 0.4 - 0.6 %, while TDS ranges between 164.1 mg/I to 165.1 r
water has started to show signs of degradation. This fact is supported with low values of total hardness (142-243 mg/l as CaC
turbidity ranges from 69 NTU to 27 NTU. The colour of the water is appreciably elevated (22-107 Hazens).

7.2.3    Socio economic impacts on downstream users
Lemkuna scheme is located in the downstream area and depends on domestic and irrigation water from Nyumba ya Mungu D;
upstream users, through bathing, agrochemical use and improper human waste disposal, are polluting the water. The Nyumba y
resident also direct their sewage system into the dam.
This pollution has led to waterbome d iseases such as typhoid and diarrhoea. Moshi town industries contribute pollutants to t
courses by pouring waste products into the Karanga River. The Tanzania Plantation Company (TPC) uses aerial sprays for
plantation which are eventually washed into the same river.
Mining activities along the river attract people from different areas and are increasing potential environmental hazards.
7.3 IRRIGATION SCHEME LEVEL IMPACTS
7.3.1   Wildlife Impacts: Past and Present Trends
Wild Animals
A lot of maize, sweet potatoes, rice, beans, cassava, bananas, sugar cane and vegetables are destroyed each cropping season
animals. Animals are known to raid and damage crops both during the day and at night. Animals that damage crops at l
hippopotamuses, bush pigs, and elephants. The daytime raiders were mainly warthog, primates, and reedbuck. The problems
animals are at present decreasing due to a community-based wildlife management programme developed in 1999.
33



Birds
The Red-billed Quelea (Quelea quelea) has been a serious pest in the irrigation scheme. These birds raid farms at different inter
the 1996/97 farming season there were heavy attacks resulting into a loss of about half a tonne per hectare. Villagers also estimate
Red-billed Quelea caused a destruction of about 100 tones of rice from the expected yields of 800 tones. Other seed-eating birds
been a serious problem because they forage on seeds from wild grasses and do not occur in gregarious flocks. Since 1997, Quelc
has not invaded the scheme.
Insects
Insects destroy crops both in the field and in granaries and other storage facilities. In the field, maize, vegetables, and beans are fi
attacked by insects like aphids and stock borers. Green locust, army worms and grasshoppers attack or destroy all types of crol
worms and green locust did not attack crops regularly, but when they occur in large swarms, they cause serious damage. Farmers e
that in the 1997/98 farming season, green locusts destroyed about 480 tones of rice from an expected yield of 800 tones. It was c
that stalk borers destroy about 0. I ton of paddy per hectare per cropping season. Weevils and maize borers caused post harvest
The focus group discussions revealed that, at present, crop destruction by insects has been in decline.
Rodents
Rodents, like insects, destroy crops both in the field and in granaries. Most of the destruction is on maturing and matured seeds. Dc
rats have been limited in their destruction because they can not ply between homesteads and crop fields. The main canal is a barrie
rats. The canals and channels also limit the movement of the wild rats from one irrigation block to another. It was estimated they t&
destroy about 0.2 tones per hectare. The rodent problem still persists in the scheme area.
Extent of loss
The following table shows the extent of loss of crops by wildlife and other biological agents as was presented by villagers during
group discussions. Only paddy was cited to be affected by pests.

During the scheme visit in September 2003. it was revealed that no plots of bananas: maize, vegetables or beans wvere affected fi
of manimiials.
Threat to life and livestock
It was reported during the group discussions that between 1991 and 1995 five people were killed by wild animals, including a
school pupil. Most of the attacks on people were from crocodiles. Lions and hyena were reported to have attacked livestock on
that period. Killing of people and livestock by wild animals has been observed after 1999. However, after the construction of tl
crocodiles have not killed people.
Wild animals access to water
The irrigation scheme does not block wild animals' accessibility to water in the Pangani River because animals can drink from othi
on the river outside the irrigation.
Wild life routes
At present, the irrigation scheme does not block wildlife routes. The watering areas at Selani, Lang'ata and lldebesilendilit art
they pass at the southem end of the irrigation scheme. The southem tip will remain open even when the scheme is expanded to 800
Pastoralists shared the same routes with no conflicts from wild animals.
Wildlife diseases
Pastoralists asserted that there are no significant disease transmissions from wild animals to livestock. This is believed to be d
limited interaction of livestock with wildlife.
Rare and Endangered Wildlife
34



There are no records of rare and endangered wildlife species in the Ruvu Game Controlled Area. Human activities such as deforest
and agricultural expansion pose a threat to wildlife, particularly those that have restricted habitat. The Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme
have an impact on the Reedbuck population because the animal only occupies riverine habitat composed of reeds and tall grasses.
7.3.2   Fuel Wood
Lemkuna villagers use fuel wood as their main source of energy. Young girls fetch firewood up to 4 km from the village spending
I and 11 hours per week. Interviews with villagers indicated that the total area under natural forest has declined in the past several
was easier to collect fuel wood ten years ago.
The major cause of deforestation (loss of vegetation) is the demand for firewood. This problem is recognized in Lemkuna villai
Simanjiro District in general. Population in and outside the village is likely to increase for a number of years due to immigratior
area. Therefore, trees are cut to satisfy the demand for firewood and timber.
The felling of trees has increased soil erosion. The irrigated land is exposed to rainstorms and to wind, which are especially stro
dry season when vegetation and trees do not cover the ground.
35



7.3.3   Soil erosion
In Lemkuna village there is a big problem of soil erosion along the catch drain, which is responsible for trapping the running w.
the mountains during the rains. It erodes soil near the banks of the catch drain. This is likely to adversely affect the main canal.
only 2-3 meters away. The farmers wish to line the eroded areas with stones and mortar in order to reduce the erosion and guide I
properly into the rain drainage canal. Villagers feel that they could contribute stones while the motor and technical support
provided by RBMSIIP.
7.3.4   Weeds (%Vater Hyacinth)
In the irrigation scheme's main canal, a species of water hyacinth has taken hold and now occupies large areas. The weed is a nu
has been causing soil erosion along the banks and has adversely affected-water levels. Therefore, the farmers have suggested that I
line the main canal to reduce the amount of the weeds. They also have requested that the district contact the Plant Protection Otffi
they can suggest further means of controlling the weed.
7.4     SOIL QUALITY
Four representative soil samples were collected from Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme to test the physical and chemical properties ol
The tests also checked for the presence of salinity and trends.

The soils upstream have a pH that is strongly alkaline almost over the whole farm. This has been caused by high sodium c
concentrations in the soil-locally called magddi. These salts are soluble in water; thus they can easily be washed out of the fie
irrigation water. The soil pH ranges from 8.3 to 9.8. Fertility ranges from very low-to-low, although there is good mineralization.
availability of phosphorus in the whole farm has been observed. Downstream samples have shown high cation exchange
Exchangeable sodium percentage shows that the upstream and the down stream farms are extremely sodic. Sites 3 and 4 are extrem
with non-sodic sub-soils. Farms located upstream of the scheme have extremely sodic topsoils.
The Pangani River has, by a significant factor, been contributing to soil salinization. Discussions with the villagers and farm visi
Consultant indicated that problems of salinity (magadi) are still prevalent in some of the irrigated farms. This is due to the excessi
river water for irrigation, inefficient irrigation systems, poor distribution systems, poor on-farm management practi.
inadequate/inappropriate drainage management.
7.4.1  Water quality
The water within the scheme has elevated levels (51-140 mg/I) of chemical oxygen demand (COD): though this is considered to b
values for irrigation schemes. Faccal contamination level ranges from 394 to 619 FC/100 ml-values indicating possible i
human/animal waste pollution.
According to the Water Resource Assessment Report (1998) for Lemkuna Irrigation Scheme, the water from Pangani Riser at I
has electrical conductivity of 9.6 micro ohms/cm at 25°C. Water analyses conducted revealed that pH and Sodium Absorption Rati
and 0.7 respectively. The water is classified as suitable for irrigation, particularly for high salt tolerant plants.
7.4.2  Waterborne diseases
The scheme has several problematic diseases including malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea. The upstream users diverting sewage into
contribute this problem. Moshi town industries also pour waste products into the river. A health center is available in Lemkuna I
Scheme at Nyumba ya Mungu village-about 6 km from Lemkuna village. The Govemment and TANESCO own the health centr
Another health center, privately owned, is also located at Nyumba ya Mungu village. A mobile clinic owned by World Vision (Tat

7.4.4   Drinking water quality and sanitation
The whole population (i.e. at the scheme and downstream) is supplied with neither tap water nor hand pump wells. So, the p'
depends on river water as its sole source of irrigation and domestic water.
7.4.5   Socio-economic: positive and negative impacts of villages within the scheme
According to the July 1998 Scheme Improvement Assessment Report (prepared by the Project Facilitation Team and the Consu
following facts are observable in the area:
*   Only about a half of the villagers (of not only Lemkuna but also of neighbouring villagers of Kirya, Ngage and Muunga
actually bom in the area. This indicates a large-scale influx of migrants into the area.
*   The influx of the people (mainly from outside the Arusha Region) has been gradual with the highest influx occurring between
1990. The main reason for this influx has been the search for fertile farming land. Of the four villages under comparison, I
leads in percentage of people who immigrated for purpose of practicing fishing activities. This immigration demonstrates
agriculture as a means of improving socio-economic well-being not only in Lemkuna but also in all the other neighbouring vil
Negative Impacts
* There is a water conflict between the irrigators and TANESCO due to the lack of an integrated sound water management plan ii
basin.
* The scheme has a high prevalence of water-related diseases. This problem has been attributed to upstream users (i.e. Nyumba
Mungu, Moshi town industries, and sugarcane plantations); however in the case of malaria. farmers have been sensitised to the
treated mosquito nets.
*  Deforestation in the area has led to increased soil erosion and scarcity of firewood.
*  Immigrants have contributed to increases in the number of HIV/AID cases.
Positive Impacts
*  Improved extension services in the area-especially in rodent and insect control techniques.
*  A farmer education programme has been implemented leading to the formation of focus community groups like women groups
vegetable grower groups, and a farmer association (Umoja wa wakulima).

8.      IDENTIFIED MITIGATION MEASURES
8.1 INTRODUCTION
This section presents a brief description of the identified impacts and subsequent mitigation measures. The description addressee
three categories of identified impacts as presented in previous chapter, as well as four categories of identified mitigation meast
categories of identified impacts include the following:
*   Impacts in up-stream areas of scheme
*   Impacts at scheme areas
*   Impacts in down areas of schemes
Furthermore, the categories of identified mitigation measures include the following:
*   Environmental management
*   Enhancement of social -economic activities
*   Improving health situation
*   Revisiting engineering designs and /or construction.
8.2 UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM
8.2.1   Environmental Management
In the case of the Lemkuna scheme the key impact is water pollution. The up-stream mitigation measures under category of envir,
management include the following:
*   Promotion of water pollution control and environmental protection in general in catchment area of the reservoir.
*   Promotion of soil and water conservation activities and environmental protection in general: not only in the area between the
and the scheme; but also all the way to the catchment area of the reservoir.
*   Strengthening capacity of institutions/mechanism whose functional roles and responsibilities is to enforce regulations which a
at avoiding e.g. pollution e.g. Pangani Basin Water Authority etc.
At both up-stream and down-stream of Lemkuna: drastic changes of the rivers hydraulic regime are taking place. The) ne

both the speed and the discharge. If this develops further, it will definitely affect the hydraulic of the xveir. Thence, there is .
revisit the extent to which the hydraulic design of the weir took this matter into consideration.
8.2.2   Enhancement of Social Economic Activities
In the case of Lemkuna scheme, up-stream, down-stream and within scheme mitigation measures under category of enhancement
economic activities include the following
*   Promoting irrigation agriculture as a potentially useful social economic activity for all age groups and for both sex c
promoting.
*   Preparation and implementation of a participatory land use plan (PLUM) in order to avoid conflicts/competition in uses
resources. In establishing mechanisms, which should facilitate easier transportation of products; as well as better access to
e.g. provision/organization of subsidized regular transport to Mwanga and/or beyond.
In down stream areas. among others, the key mitigation measures related to environmental management include: water manage
well-as embarking on educational programs seeking to improve irrigation practice, appropriate uses of agro-chemicals etc.
The mitigating measures in any fuel wood conservation, i.e. reforestation and afforestation, should aim to achieve several objecti'
species to be planted for fire wood, timber, wind breaks or other purposes should preferably be leguminous species, which enricl
with nitrogen contents. In interviews the villagers indicated that there is a shortage of fruits for domestic consumption.
Major earth works will be undertaken parallel to the existing canal, to construct flood bunds along the Pangani River and
drainage canals. Trees within the course of these structures should be planted to avoid exposure of the soil to water and wind eros
39



growing grasses are planted to protect the soil. A reforestation programme supports this measure. Major objectives are to minim
and wind erosion.
One part of the proposed mitigating activity attempts to increase the supply of firewood while the other attempts to reduce demand
Although it seems easy to plant trees, in practice it is not done. In Lemkuna village afforestation programme has existed in the past
at the Primary School plots. Land Environmental Management Project (LEMP), a Swedish environment project, support aftc
programme in villages in Simanjiro district, and other districts in Arusha and Manyara Region. The lessons from the successes an
should be gathered and understood before the project launches tree-planting programme in Lemkuna village.
It is proposed to investigate some of the issues involved prior to this programme is embarked. In a first step information should be
on the economics of fuel wood. Wood lots will only plant if there is a conSiderable economic incentive to do so. This is even truer
benefits accrue in the future while most of the costs are incurred during the first few years.
It should then be established who the beneficiaries of wood lots are and who bears the costs. If those who pay or work to esta
wood lots do not reap the benefits, they have little incentive, If, for example, women plant the trees and maintain them but men
right to harvest and sell the wood, women will be reluctant to plant trees.
There may be conflicts between the rights to own land and the trees, which grow on it, and the right to graze animals. There is n
planting trees that are palatable to cattle and or goats if animals can be grazed there. Even if there is no right to grazing, the owne
may not have the ability to enforce his right. For instance, distance from the homestead may be an inhibiting factor thus prever
from doing so. Thus, when sites for planting trees are selected this aspect needs to be considered.
8.3 IRRIGATION LEVEL
8.3.1   Environmental Management
Mitigation measures under category of environmental management would include the following:
*   Establishment and/or strengthening local-based e.g. scheme-based effective water management system; namely which can cor
allocation and distribution of water. This entails capacity-building of e.g. village government or committee 'water associati
enable them effectively control both allocation and distribution of water and hence ensuring its national use
*   Additionally establishing or strengthening local-based mechanisms for conflict resolution is still relevant in this case also.
*   Controlling destructive activities of wildlife; rodents etc.
*   Eradication of undesirable plant species e.g. water hyacinth.
*   Promoting afforestation/reforestation activities, especially for fast growing fuel wood species should help to alleviate
firewood deficiency.
*   Combating weeds infestation.

8.3.2   Control of wildlife, birds and rodents
Crop destruction caused by wild animals is not a very serious issue that jeopardise the irrigation scheme. On the other hand big
of birds, insects and rats cause heavy losses to crop yields. Proposed preventive control measures should address these two observa
Community based mitigation measures
The block farming and mono cropping- practised in paddy growing allows for community based pest control against wild animals
flocks of birds. The farmers use the following community-based control methods against wild animals and birds.
Scarring
Farmers use several methods to scare animals and birds from attacking crops. These methods include:
Lighting fire
This is done at night to scare hippos, bush pigs and other noctumal wild animals. The method demands farmers to spend nights in
crops and may cause them not to be productive during the day.
Scare Crows
Farmers construct different forms of structures to scare wildlife. They construct effigies to scare wild animals and construct flag 1i
together with tins packed with small-sized stones that make noise when blown by wind. Both the flags and noise made from t
effectively scare birds according to discussions with farmers. Shouts and other forms of noises accompany scares when there are a
in the field. This method is effective for diurnal wild animals like primates, reedbuck.
Task forces
When there are serious crop damages due to animals like bush pigs, reedbuck, dik dik and primates' farmers organise themselves
forces to flush these animals out of their habitats close to the farms. They mobilise dogs to flush and chase the animals out of
threatened by raids. Farmers denied killing animals during these drives but it is seemed possible that some animals are killed for

method because it requires a high degree of bravery and courage, which they possess and it is one built into their culture.
During the discussions and site visit it was clear that farmers were not using poisons to control wild animals There ssas also no ir
justification for the use of mechanical controls like constructing trenches, barbed wire or electric fencing due to low levels of vil
population and low intensity raids.
The following are recommended methods of controlling wildlife crop damages and livestock predation in the scheme:
Self defence
Individual farmers or groups can plan and organise ways of protecting their crop fields.
Watchmen
Individuals or groups can take active patrols and surveillance on crops threatened by marauding animals and birds. During
watchmen scare wild animals by lighting fires and using flashlights. At daytime they make noise to drive off both wild animals
beating drums, tins, gongs and other devices that can create sharp and threatening noise to the pests.
The capability to undertake effective self-defence against marauding animals and birds will depend on family size. Large fair
afford to have some of the family members undertake defence responsibilities while remaining are involved in other producti
Small size families are forced to concentrate most available human resources on defence responsibilities. They can not effectivel
themselves in other socio-economic activities. When there are serious raids families may discourage children to go to school a
them to go and assist in protecting the crops.
Individuals involved in night patrols are not productive during the day because they will spend that time resting ready for the ni
This reduces availability of human resource for other production activities in the household. These individuals are also ex
mosquitoes at night hence they are prone to frequent attacks from malaria.
41



Traditional defence groups
The Masai are well known for their traditional defence system against predatory animals like lions. They deploy young anr
warriors full of courage to combat predators. This method is considered to be socially viable and effective for driving lions out of
kraals. The warriors use traditional weapons to defend themselves and attack the lions. However, more than often lions are kil
when driven beyond the risk area. In future emphasis should be to drive such animals to safe areas and not kill them except ui
threatening situations.
Self-defence is often dangerous particularly at night. People can be seriously injured or killed by the targeted animals like hippo an
Frightening
Wild animals and birds can be frightened using scarecrows made from old clothes, papers, or leaves. The scarecrow figure must
swing in the wind. They should be moved from one place to another in the crop field after a few days interval.
Snaring
Snares can be set to trap crop-raiding animals. They should be placed on trails that are known to be used by the targeted animals.
be effective for small sized animals like dik dik and reedbuck. It should not be encouraged if other methods are effectively becaust
would encourage poaching in the name of crop protection.
Control Shooting
This method is suitable for large mammals like hippo, primates and lions. The decision to adopt shooting should be base
assessment on the extent of damage, frequency and failure of other non shooting methods. The gravity of the matter should be re
the wildlife authorities in the ward or district which will examine the justification for the shooting. Shooting can be for scaring an
off the animals or kill to reduce the risks.
Control of Rodents
The control of rodents is household responsibility. Domestic rodents can be controlled by: -
*   Fumigants: Farmers can fumigate crops and storage facilities against rodents. The Agriculture Extension Officers will al
farmers on the appropriate fumigants, handling and application.
*   Toxicants: Toxicants like anticoagulants are effective to control domestic rodents. The toxicants inhibit blood coagulation an,
breed to death. They should be placed where the rodents feed, water or routes they use to travel. The service of Agricultural E
Officer is needed just like in application of fumigants.
*   Traps: There are many types of traps that can be set to trap rodents. They can be used to control both domestic and %%ild rod
traps should be set where rodents travel through, feed or drink.
*   Pet: Cats can be effective predators to domestic rodents and socially and economically accepted in most households.
Control of Birds
Most raids from birds can be controlled using self-defence, frightening and trapping. In case of large flocks of Quelea quelea that e
effectively controlled by these methods then the following methods can be applied.
Destroying Breeding Colonies
Breeding colonies can be destroyed by chemical aerial spray. In the case of Lemkuna village, the TPC sugar estates are potential
sites for the Quelea quelea. Control from this site can give positive impact to other areas including the Lemkuna Irrigation Schemt
Attacking Roosting Sites
Chemical aerial spray can be applied to roosting sites where there are large concentrations of the birds. The spray may not yi
results because birds may move away from the roosting site before the spraying.
Both methods are not ideal to be applied for the Lemkuna irrigation scheme due to its small size, the birds do not breed in the arc
not have large roosting sites near the scheme.
Control Insects
Most insects can be controlled by application of appropriate pesticides. The farmers at Lemkuna are familiar with the use of pestic
was revealed during the group discussions.
In all chemical control methods, the farmers should properly advised on the appropriate chemicals, usage, handling and the impac
health and the environment. The need for the service of farmers' education can not be over emphasised.

Benefits from Wildlife
The villagers acknowledged that there was wildlife utilisation in their village. The village was part of a hunting block owned by
Wildlife Safaris (TAWISA), which had on several occasions' hunted lions and crocodiles in the village land. The villagers
received any direct tangible benefits from this form of wildlife utilisation. The only positive contribution from TAWISA is to rt
population of dangerous wild animals like lions and crocodiles. TAWISA has constructed classrooms in the village where its
located. The village is adjacent to Lemkuna village where no such benefits have been extended by TAWISA. The Simanjirc
Council has not benefited the village except on few cases related to controlling dangerous animals including crop marauders. TAV
not yet paid any monies to the village.
8.3.3  Improving health situation
Water bome disease control needs collaborative efforts among all members of the communities who in one way or another c
affected by, or are contributing to, the spread or increase of the disease. The irrigation improvement should contribute to control of
through design, operation and maintenance of the schemes.
Since Lemkuna scheme is located in an area prone to water bome diseases, improvement of the scheme should incorporate envir
management measures, which limit vector breeding, survival and contact with man. The measures will aim at eliminating conditioi
enable diseases vector to survive and reproduce.
The irrigation scheme depends water from the Pangani River through Nyumba ya Mungu Dam, for both domestic and irrigation I
Unfortunately the upstream u sers h eavily p ollute the w ater. I n o rder to a void domestic u se of the w ater, the local communit)
request the establishment of another source of domestic water instead of depending on the river. The Area Development Pr(
(ADP) is considering introducing boreholes in order to get clean domestic water in three years time. In the meantime there is;
create awareness on the importance of boiling water to minimize the spread and effects of water bome diseases. Much informatic
be disseminated on appropriate technology in the water supply and sanitation fields and should be directed to facilities for ih
household e.g. slow sand filters. A slow sand filter consisting of a layer of sand through which water is filtered at a relatively lo"
be used. The filter is cleaned by periodically scraping a thin layer of dirty sand from the surface at intervals of three %%eeks to
Slow sand filters are effective in removing organic matters and micro organisms from raw water of relatively low turbidity re5
savings in satisfaction. Thus farmers need to be advised to adopt this simple technology.
43



8.3.4   Reduction use of agro-chemicals
As for water contamination problems due to utilization of chemical fertilizer and agro chemical, it is crucial to extend necessary te,
and utilization practices to farmers for safe application of such chemicals. Change in production technology should emphasi2
introduction and use of organic farming practices. In the village agriculture extension officers should be the focus for introducini
farming. Some convincing ethics for change in production technology could be making a comparison between the cost of
chemical fertilizers and organic farmning. In the near feature like developed countries crop value, especially vegetables will depei
technology used in producing such crops.
In order to minimize and or reduce on accumulation of toxic chemical hazards in the drainage canal system, farmers should be ti
the following issues:
* Application ofjust sufficient water to minimize effluent discharge from fields to drainage canal. Avoid over watering.
*   Farmers should be made aware of the toxicity, handling process, application and storage precautions to be taken handling ii
with agro chemicals. Spraying of agro chemicals should be directed away from watercourses and from non-targeted areas ta
consideration wind direction and strength. Spraying of agro-chemical from the air can result in contamination of the surrounc
as the mist of the chemicals will be carried down by wind. Much of poison ends up in the soil and also in open water bodies. I
canals and watercourses may be affected.
Containers, which have contained chemicals, should not be bumt due to risk of explosion and/or exposure to toxic vapor. I
circumstances should empty pesticides containers be abandoned, reused or recycled for other purposes. Empty metals and glass c.
can be disposed off by burial away from watercourses as the last option available.
8.3.5   Revisiting engineering designs, construction activities
About lOOm from the weir, on the northem side of the river severe erosion of the bank of is going on suggesting shifting of the rive
course. Again, opinion of the consultant is that this too needs to be addressed because in the long run it may adversely affect the A
hence the scheme itself.
Farmers complained about inadequacy of structures such as culverts, etc. to enable them crossover when on their farms.
Desigrinig'constrtction should look into this matter

9.4 DESCRIPTION OF ELEMENTS OF MONITORING PROGRAM
Monitoring objectives
Monitoring refers to a systematic collection of data/information and due analysis, with the aim of following up on the su
phenomena in the wake of implementation of the ESMP. Activities are followed up, their status assessed, quantified and
accordingly. This process should be considered as part of the ESMP. The District Council will keep a close eye on changing condi
keep records, as accurately as possible, to check, among others, on compliance with statutory environmental protection provis
World Bank Safeguard Policies.
Description of performance indicators, which provide linkages to impacts and mitigation measures in the EA
Water quality
Water quality will be monitored as follows:
*   The water quality of the Pangani River will be assessed continuously to determine the overall impact of, fertilizers. insect
pesticides used in the irrigation project and upstream agricultural activities.
*   The water flow volume in the river will be measured through the established gauging stations. Water balance modeling shoulc
for predication proposes. This exercise will help to assess base flows, water yields, and hydrological characteristics of the c
area.
Ground water
* The ground water will be checked to determine salinity of ground water as a result of project operations.
   The changes in pH of ground water will be monitored to check the impacts on ground water of the various types of crops plant
* Changes in levels of water table will be monitored in sample areas of crops that consume too much of ground water including
documented eucalyptus species.
Soil Conservation
Soil composition, texture a nd structure i n the i mgation project area will be monitored in the sample areas to determine imps
various agricultural practices.
The fertility level of soils (i.e. nutrient concentration and soil moisture) in the sample crop areas will be monitored to determine
from the planted crops. Changes in salinity, porosity, pH level and types of biota in the soils will also be monitored in the san
areas. Alteration of these parameters could be expected in cases where crops are grown alongside water or nutrient demanding tret
may consequently jeopardize the well being of the crops.
Biodiversitv indicators
The following are pertinent indicators for catchment management: sedimentation rates, riverbank erosion. flashfloods and detc
rates. The District Natural Resource Office supported by other stakeholder and RBM should monitor these.
Other important ecological parameters include vegetation; (i.e. both on dry land as well as on river valleys); fish, (i.e. I
invertebrates); and birds, and other living organisms available in the area.
Crop Diseases
The type of diseases affecting planted trees will be monitored in the sample compartments to determine common diseases to vari
that will require special treatment in the next rotation of crop farming or application of appropriate pesticides for treatment of the d
The most damaging crop pests, especially those that have caused extensive loss of production in the farms in Tanzania will be m
The monitoring of emerging pests and insects in and around the project area will help determine the most suitable diseasi
mitigation measure.
Afforestation
*   Provenance and species resistance to diseases and pests for planting in the community and individual's forest plots within th
will be screened. Provenance and nursery plots will be established. DBH and heights will be measured.
   The amount of carbon and other greenhouse gases in the soils will be monitored in and around the project area. The al
greenhouse gases will be monitored to assess the impacts of forest sequestration of greenhouse gases, especially carbon.
Socio-economic
48



The District Office should monitor the characteristics, activities and attitudes of the adjacent communities in order to develor
extension programs. The major objectives will be to reduce pressure on the irrigation area inter a lia through encouraging al
enterprises. The steps would include:
*   Promoting agro-forestry in the local community farms.
*   Infrastructure development such as accessibility, marketing, education, health and other proposed activities by the local co
around the project area.
*   Net immigration monitoring of people in the local community. Population dynamics will be monitored in sub-villages and al
project.
*   Fuel wood requirements for the local community will also be monitored to determine local demand and develop possible
such as agro-forestry, community forest areas and conservation of natural woodlands in the villages around the project.
Health indicators
The main health indicators to be monitored are water-bome diseases such as malaria and bilharzias.
Description of parameters to be measures, methods to be employed, sampling locations, frequency of measurements, detecti.
(where appropriate) and definition of thresholds that will signed the need for remedial actions, institutional responsibilities, tir

9.5    INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
The fundamental area for consideration is empowerment of existing administrative and organisational arrangements. These
farmers, local communities, both as a group as well as in their individual capacities, in both upstream and downstream villa
empowerment has to be carried out through provision of capacity building, public awareness campaigns, tailor-made training, etc.
As a strategic approach SIIC should strengthen partnership among the Lemkuna community in the use of water and land resource
on the adopted organisational-structure and job descriptions of various committees to be established, for the operation of the s
framework should be established through which the stakeholders are able to actively engage in a dialogue aimed at equit
sustainable use of the common resources.
The project should firstly embark on a programme of key and strategic activities that are part of the above outlined Environmi
Social Management Plan and should enhance attainment of the above objectives. More specifically, the following are proposed:
*   Hold meetings of various committees as per agreement
*   Assist: (i) to organise ward or district- based farmers' day,
And (ii) participation in local and national events like farmers day
* Undertake joint study visits

10. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.1 CONCLUSION
10.1.1. General conclusion
Based on review of baseline information, field visits to Lemkuna irrigation scheme and data analyses; it is evident that
environmental and social impacts and problems that need to be addressed in order to ensure sustainable and sound operatic
irrigation scheme.
It is evident that wild animals are still not a serious threat to the Lemkuna irrigation scheme and farmers are able to control them.
Quelea quelea and green locusts' cases have not occurred since 1996/7 and also no serious destruction of crops has occurred and
capabilities to control them at the community level when they occur in small scale.
There are no wildlife corridors or routes that are immediately threatened by the irrigation scheme. However, the extension of the s
the southem tip will impact the Selani route used by both pastoralists and wildlife animals as watering areas on the river. The
should provide ways of maintaining this route.
There are no recorded endangered species but the reedbuck is relatively rare in the area. Clearing the
As outlined in above chapters (among others): in up-stream areas of the scheme, the key issues constraining sustainability is p(
quality at intake of the scheme as well as changes of the Pangani river's hydrological and hydraulic regime. In within the scheme
constraints are general poor soil fertility. In down-stream areas sustainability is mainly constrained by inadequacy of quality v
exposure threat to waterborne diseases.
Baseline data with comprehensive benchmark parameters related to various studies like hydrogeology, socio-economic, environme
quality. etc. at catchment and irrigation levels were not available in the area. Environment and social assessment impact require:

Biophysical environment
The Lemkuna scheme lies in semi -arid area of Tanzania, where without irrigation, agriculture is difficult to practice. It was theref(
that scheme improvement should have been very beneficial to the local community.
Socio-economic environment
The EA indicated that the original key socio-economic activity at Lemkuna is livestock rearing (pastoralism); but after realization i
economic benefits of irrigation most people went for it. However, inadequacy supporting services for the irrigation activi

In view of the above, therefore irrigation activities at the scheme are relatively not intensive, and as such, environmental and socia
are relatively also not significant. In any case, in brief, field studies identified the following impacts:
Negative impacts
Negative impacts identified upstream of the Lemkuna scheme are hydrological changes, i.e. in terms of e.g. change of regime of ri
Other identified environmental problems in the areas are fuel wood, water quality and quantity, use of agro-chemicals, wa
diseases, salinization, and socio-economic circumstances. Based on ecosystem and farming system approaches preventive an(
measures are proposed.
The impact of chemicals (fertilisers and pesticides) on the environment should be regularly monitored. It is quite possible that i
farming is going to assume a second position to paddy farming if market will be available. Unlike paddy, vegetable farming
chemical inputs to control insects and other pests. Chemical residues from the scheme will find their way into the water system an
impact on water biodiversity.
Positive impacts
It is important that the positive aspects of development emerge, especially because these are what motivate the people at villal
level and dictate the decisions they take or are willing to have taken on their behalf.
Mitigation measures
A number of mitigation measures were proposed to address the identified impacts. As far as possible, preventive management
should be given priority in combating soil and water pollution, catchment degradation, and pollution of the rivers and disease contr
Compliance with the Tanzanian legislation and World Bank Safeguard Policies
The study team has demonstrated that the Lemkuna irrigation scheme is in compliance with the Tanzanian legislation and policies.
World Bank Safeguard Policies, but the scheme triggers Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37. In line with this relevant authorities should p

10.2 RECOMMENDATIONS
*   Most of the identified mitigation measures are related with local community-based effective structural -organization. This
means that most of the measures can be implemented by local government authorities themselves %vith riniancial and
assistance of funded projects e.g. RBMSIIP.
*   The Lemkuna irrigation scheme has an active interaction with environment through wildlife biodiversity (wild animals
rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish). Wildlife is an essential component of a living environment and its presence oi
indicates the quality of the environment. The scheme should therefore seek to maintain a balance between these two
interactions. It is recommended that most of pest control methods should not use chemical methods except where there are
outbreaks of birds, like Quelea quelea and pests like Army- worms, Green locusts and cases of Rodents. Wild animals will f
time be effectively controlled using community-based interventions supported by stakeholder institutions.
*   Integrated soil fertility management and integrated pest management are participatory farmers centred approaches used
conservation and control agro-chemicals. These approaches can be considered as the most logical strategy to adopt in I
irrigation scheme due to rising costs of mineral fertilizers and agro-chemicals and the concem for environmental degradation
*   Most of key actors in irrigated agriculture production (farmers and extensionists) require frequent training at different levels
aspects of environmental management, disease prevention, [PM, ISMP, water management, crop husbandry management, etc
engineers are also given training in environmental management, ecosystem concept, ecological engineering, etc.
*   The co-ordination between the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security and the Simanjiro District should be strengthened.
*   Capacity building of farmers, district staff and other key stakeholders is needed so as to enable the scheme farmers and upsti
downstream of the scheme to a better understanding of inter-link between ecosystem and agricultural production.
60



*   A design of training programme on farm and project levels based on participatory approaches and training needs assessment s
developed in order to promote a common understanding, direction and adoption of environmental sound technologies for the t
farmers and poverty alleviation in general.
*   There are no recorded endangered species but the reedbuck is relatively rare in the area. Clearing the remaining riverine v,
will destroy the habitat for reedbuck. which has a narrow occurrence in the Pangani River Basin. The scheme should con
conservation status of this animal.
The farmers and pastoralists at Lemkuna village should consider wildlife as resource that can be of value to their socio-c
development together with their two major production systems. They only have this consideration when wildlife generates tangibkc
to the community. Such benefits can be accrued by establishing a Wildlife Management Area together with other villages where 1
does tourist hunting. Unfortunately, the village has not established a WMA as recommended in the 1999 report and has not
contributions by the Simanjiro District from tourist hunting.
Partnership building
In order to minimize water and land use conflicts, stakeholders of Pangani River Basin in general should work together as pE
improve production and sustainable development of the watershed management and the scheme's sustainable development.
Similar projects should develop institutional arrangements geared to share responsibility (decision making) for catchment mar
plan and prevention management activities in the Pangani River Basin. A partnership approach, however, also needs an ap
institutional framework, which clearly lays on the roles and responsibilities of each project, district councils and stakeholders. Co
and farmers participation could be solicited in planning, management, financing, construction and maintenance of catchment
receiving bodies.
Environmental and social impact management plan
A participatory environmental and social impact plan and monitoring system has been developed for the Lemkuna irrigation
There is need to establish process-based plan and monitoring, to build capacity of scheme management team and to develop a dat
the environmental and social impact management plan including the I monitoring plan.
Capacity Building
In order to ensure sustainability of the scheme stakeholders of all levels have to participate in the capacity-building program. T
include; namely the following; individual farmers, households, farmer's associations/groups/scheme committees etc.. vill
government, and all the way to district authorities as well as both public and private organisations: NGOs and CBOs.
Most of the identified mitigation measures are related with local community-based effective structural -organization. This means
that local government authorities themselves with financial and technical assistance of can implement most of the measures fundec
e.g. RBMSIIP.
Baseline Studies
It is vital for any sustainable smallholder irrigation development and management in the river basin that there is a minimum kr
about water resources and quantified (baseline data) related to environmental and social issues. It is therefore, proposed that some
studies and investigations should be undertaken in the future smaliholder irrigation improvement projects.

PROJECT BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has been implementing River Basin Management and Smaliholder I
Improvement Project (RBMSIIP) since 1996 through IDA credit. The project aims at (i) strengthening the government capacity t(
its water resources in an integrated and comprehensive manner that ensure equitable, efficiency and sustainable developmei
resource and address water related environmental concerns at the National level and in the Rufiji and Pangani basins: and (ii)
irrigation efficiency of selected smallholder traditional irrigation schemes in these two basins. The Ministry of Agriculture z
Security and the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development are implementing the project.
The Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Component of the project is focusing on the improvement of existing traditional i
schemes. Under existing World Bank Environmental Policy (OD 4.01), the River Basin Management and Smallholder I
Improvement Project (RBMSIIP) has been classified as a category "B" project requiring a limited environmental analysis and. if I
the inclusion of mitigation measures in project design. This is essence means that no major environmental impacts are expected
only mitigation measures can be incorporated into the scheme design, implementation and operation (SAR 1995)
SCOPE OF WORK
The Environmental Cell Unit (ECU) of the Irrigation section carried out the Initial Environmental Examination (IEEs) in 15 ti
Irrigation schemes to ascertain environmental issue and suggest mitigation measures that have to be incorporated during schem
Construction and Operation and Maintenance. Based on the IEE findings. IEE Reports were prepared as part of Scheme Impi
Assessment Studies.
The consultants in collaboration with ECU will be required to carry out Environmental Audit in seven (7) group B Scheme o
Majenje, Igomelo, Mangalali. Nyamahana. Soko, Kambi ya Tanga and Mahenge irrigation schemes. The consultant did enm ir
Review of Lemkuna irrigation scheme in 2001. thus it requires an Environmental and Social Management Plan only. The scheme5
in operation phase.
The assignment is a continuation of the last activities of Environmental Audit of group A and C irrigation schemes. This will bi
accordance with GoT and World Bank safeguard policies

AVAILABLE REPORTS
The reports available at the Irrigation Section (PFT) include Initial Environmental Examination, Engineering, Socio-E-
Topographical Surveys, Agronomy/Agriculture and Water Resource Studies.



The consultant is therefore required to compile quantitative and qualitative information from these supplemented by field visit in
have baseline information on environmental issues to develop a model for future review of Initial Environmental Examinatio
under RBMSIIP.
TIMING
The consultant is expected to spend about five month starting May 2003.
OUTPUTS
The consultant will be required to produce 17 copies of reports for each irrigation scheme for review by NEMC in hard copy ar
Word diskette for submission to World Bank for review.
The document should address the following issues:
* Analysis of Engineering, Socio Economic, Agricultural, Soils and Water Resources reports in order to provide quantitative inf
given the qualitative information in the IEE reports.
* Compliance with EIA procedures according to the Government of Tanzania and World Bank guidelines.
* Proper methodology and approach including criteria for assessment,
* Integrated Pest Management.
* Prepare Environmental Management plan to specify clearly who and when mitigation measures can be implemented.

APPENDIX        4              World Bank Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies
Environmental Assessment (OPIBP 4.01). Outlines Bank policy and procedure for the environmental assessment of Banki
operations. The Bank undertakes environmental screening of each proposed project to determine the appropriate extent and typ
The Bank classifies the project into one of four categories, depending on the type, location, sensitivity, and the scale of the projec
nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts. RBMSIIC is Category B.
Natural Habitats (OPIBP 4.04). The conservation of natural habitats, like other measures that protect and enhance the enviroi
essential for long-term sustainable development. The Bank does not support projects involving the significant conversion o
habitats unless there are no feasible altemnatives for the project and its citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overal
from the project substantially outweigh the environmental costs. If the environmental assessment indicates that a project will sigi
convert or degrade natural habitats, the project includes mitigation measures acceptable to the Bank. Such mitigation measures in
appropriate, minimizing habitat loss (e.g. strategic habitat retention and post-development restoration) and establishing and maint;
ecologically similar protected area.
Pest Management (OP 4.09). The policy supports safe, affective, and environmentally sound pest management. It promotes tU
biological and environmental control methods. An assessment is made of the capacity of the country's regulatory framev
institutions to promote and support safe, effective, and environmentally sound pest management.
Involuntary Resettlement (OPIBP 4.12). The resettlement policy is triggered when people are affected by loss of land, loss of
and/or loss of access to resources. It is therefore irrelevant whether or not the impact will entail physical relocation of the affecte'
the policy is triggered in all such cases This means that the impact may be of such k-ind that only compensation in cash or kind is n.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). This directive provides guidance to ensure that indigenous people benefit from development proj
to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of Bank-financed development projects on indigenous people Measures to address issues pert
indigenous peoples must be based on the informed participation of the indigenous people themselves.
Forests (OPIBP 4.36). This policy applies to the following types of Bank-financed investment projects (a) projects that have orr
impacts on the health and quality of forests. (b) projects that affect the rights and welfare of people and their level of dependenct
interaction with forests, and (c) projects that aim to bring about chan.ges in the management, protection, or utilization of naturalI
plantations, whether they are publicly, privately, or communally owned. The Bank does not finance projects that, in its opinio
involve significant conversion or degradation of critical forest areas or related critical habitats. If a project involves the Si
conversion or degradation of natural forests or related natural habitats that the Bank determiines are not critical, and the Bank d(
that thiere are no feasible altematives to the project and its citing, and comprehensive analysis demonstrates that overall benefits
project substantially outweigh the environmenital costs, the Bank may finance the project provided that it incorporates ap
mitigation measures.
Safety of Dams (OPIBP 4.37). For the life of any dam, the owner is responsible for ensuring that appropriate mleaSLures are t.
sufficient resources provided for the safety to the dam, irrespective of its fuinding sources or construction status. The Bank disti
between small and large dams. Small dams are normally less than 15 m in height, this category includes, for example, farm ponds,
retention dams, and low embankment tanks. For small dams, generic dam safety measures designed by qualified engineers ar,
adequate.
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03). The term "cultural property" includes sites having archaeological (prehistoric). palaentological, l
religious, and unique natural values. The Bank's general policy regarding cultural property is to assist in their preservation, andt
avoid their elimination. The Bank (i) normally declines to finance projects that will significantly damage non-replicable cultural
and will assist only those projects that are sited or designed to prevent such damage, and (ii) will assist in the protection and enht,
of cultural properties encountered in Bank-financed projects, rather than leaving that protection to chance. The management ol
property of a country is the responsibility of the government. The government's attention will be drawvn specifically to what is kno-
the cultural property aspects of the proposed project site. Appropriate agencies, NGOs, or university departments willI be consulte,
are- any questions concerning cultural property in the area, and a brief reconnaissance survey will be undertaken in the field by a sp
Projects on International Waterways (7.50). The Bank recognizes that the cooperation and good will of riparian is essentia
efficient utilisation and protection of international waterways and attaches great importance to riparian making appropriate agree
arrangement for the entire waterway or any part thereof. Projects that trigger this policy include hydroelectric, irrigation, flooc
navigation, drainage, water and sewerage, industrial, and similar projects that involve the use or potential pollution of inte
waterways. The riparian are being notified in accordance with this policy, no additional steps need to be taken at the lev,
subprojects.



Disputed Areas (OP/BP/ 7.60): Projects in disputed areas may occur between the Bank and its member countries as well as bet
borrower and one or more neighbouring countries. Any dispute over an area in which a proposed project is located require
procedures at the earliest possible stage. The Bank attempts to acquire assurance that it may proceed with a project in a disputed a
governments concerned agree that, pending the settlement of the dispute, the project proposed can go forward without prejudi
claims of the country having a dispute.
