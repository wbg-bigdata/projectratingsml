FIFTH AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Caisse Nationale de Crgdit Agricole (CNCA) has requested Bank
assistance to finance, with other cofinanciers, the Fifth Agricultural Credit
Project. The Project would follow four successful Bank-financed agricultural
credit projects implemented by CNCA. It would support Government's development
objectives through: (a) improving agricultural production by financing on-farm
investments; (b) shifting an increased share of investment in agriculture to
the private sector; (c) improving access by small farmers to institutional
credit; (d) promoting the mobilization of domestic savings; and
(e) strengthening CNCA's management efficiency and financial situation.
1.02     The Project would be implemented by CNCA and finance on-farm
investments undertaken by individual farmers and farmers' cooperatives,
investments for the creation or extension of small- and medium-scale
agroindustries, as well as the extension and rehabilitation of CNCA's branch
network and technical assistance to CNCA for the improvement of its Management
Information System (MIS).  The Project would be implemented over a three-year
period (September 1983 to August 1986).
1.03     The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$602.0 million, of
which US$191.0 million (32.0%) in foreign exchange. A Bank loan of US115.4
million to CNCA would finance part of CNCA's medium- and long-term lending and
institutional development during the Project period. The balance would be
financed by CNCA's own resources, sub-borrowers'contributions, Government's
grants and by loans from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the
Federal Republic of Germany, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development
(FADES) and the African Development Bank (ADB).
1.04     The Project was identified and prepared by CNCA with the assistance
of Bank missions supervising the Fourth Agricultural Credit Project
(1704-MOR). The Project was appraised in March 1983 by a mission composed of
Messrs. Chausse, van de Poll (Bank staff), and Bartoli (consultant).
II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Economic Background
2.01     To improve its rapidly deteriorating external financial situation,
the Government implemented an austerity program during the 1978-80 period.
However, government policies mostly centered on the reduction of investment
outlays and did not adequately address the fundamental structural weaknesses



-2-
of the Moroccan economy, such as the continuous stagnation in agriculture and
an inefficient industrial development based on capital intensive,
import-substitution projects.  The resulting short-term downward adjustment of
the economy was obtained at the expense of growth and employment: GDP growth
during the 1978-80 period slowed to 3.6% p.a. in real terms, from an average
of 6.7% p.a. during the 1973-77 period. In 1980, the IMF and the Moroccan
Government negotiated a three-year Extended Facility (EFF) Agreement in
support of a program aimed at containing the growth of domestic expenditures
and restructuring the supply side policies through the adoption of a tax
reform, the reform of management and financing of public enterprises, tariff
increases, interest rate increases and the reduction or elimination of a wide
range of subsidies. However, Government efforts to stabilize the economy were
hampered by climatic, political and economic constraints among which (a) the
impact of the 1979 oil price increase; (b) a severe drought in 1980/81 which
reduced agricultural production and induced a substantial increase in imports
of foodstuffs; (c) a steady appreciation of the US dollar against the Moroccan
dirham; (d) the rise in international interest rates which further increased
the country's debt service burden; and (e) a further decline in 1982 of the
world market price of phosphates, Morocco's principal export.
2.02     Because of Morocco's inability to meet IMF's credit ceilings, the EFF
was suspended and replaced in 1982 by a one-year Stand-by Agreement. The IMF
approved a new Stand-by Agreernent in September 1983, seeking a further
reduction of the budget defici t through comprehensive actions on both the
revenue and expenditure side. In the short- and medium-term, the constraints
on Morocco's economy will impose a severe limitation on investments and
growth. Planned public investmenlts under the 1981-85 Development Plan have
been drastically curtailed ancd the future growth of the economy will depend,
to a large extent, on the sectoraL allocation and the efficiency of
investments undertaken. Over the next few years, Morocco must address three
major issues: (a) improvement of t:he balance of payment by concentrating
investments in priority sectors and in projects which are export oriented or
aimed at import substitution; (b) increased domestic resource mobilization;
and (c) improvement of access to employment opportunities and basic services
in rural areas to slowdown rural migration. The present Project would help
Government in meeting all three objectives.
B. Place of Agriculture in the Economy
2.03     Morocco's population is E!stimated at 20 million (1982) of whom about
60% live in rural areas. During the last ten years, population growth has
averaged 2.6% p.a. (4.4% in urban areas and 1.4% in the rural areas). About
52% of the total labor force (2.75 million) is employed in agriculture. With
maximum total labor requirements of Moroccan agriculture estimated at about
2.0 million permanent jobs, effective employment in the agricultural sector is
about 70% of the total labor force!. While the proportion of total Moroccan
population estimated to live below the absolute poverty level dropped from 43%
in 1970 to 38% in 1980, the improvement occurred mainly i-n urban areas. The
proportion of rural families living at or below absolute poverty level (US$238
per capita in 1978-80) remained constant at 45% and the absolute number of
rural poor actually grew by about 1 million, reaching 5.4 million in 1980.



-3-
2.04     The value of agricultural output has grown at an average annual rate
of 1.5% (in constant prices) during the 1970-80 period, a lower rate than for
the output of other sectors of the economy. During 1978-80, it grew at a
faster rate of 2.1% p.a., but dropped sharply by 23% in 1981 because of a
severe drought. Agricultural output has not kept pace with the country's
demand. This has led to a rapid increase in imports of agricultural products
and a decline in the relative contribution of agriculture to the country's
GDP. Agriculture contributed 16.6% to Morocco's GDP in 1979-81 (in current
terms), down from 20.5% in 1969-71. In 1979-81, cereals and pulses
contributed 36% to total agricultural GDP, with livestock contributing 33%,
citrus and vegetables 11% each, and industrial crops and forestry about 6%.
2.05     In 1981, agricultural exports accounted for 28.6% of the value of
total exports, down from 54.1% in 1971.1  Agricultural imports accounted
for 24.4% of total imports in 1981 against 26.2% in 1971.!   There has thus
been a serious deterioration of the agricultural trade balance which is mostly
due to a substantial increase in foodstuff imports. The situation can be
illustrated through the evolution of self-sufficiency ratios for major basic
foodstuffs.
Table 1.1. SELF-SUFFICIENCY RATIO FOR BASIC FOOD PRODUCTS (1965-1980)
(in percentage)
1965-69       1970-74          1975-79         1980
Cereals            87             86              75             72
Meat              100            100              98            100
Milk Products      54             60              58             64
Edible Oils        38             31              19             23
Sugar              28             46              50             53
Self-sufficiency ratios have been maintained for meat, and improved for milk
products and sugar. However, there has been a deterioration in the ratio for
edible oils and cereals. Imports of bread wheat alone accounted for 45% of
total agricultural imports during the 1979-81 period.
C. Agricultural Performance and the 1981-85 Development Plan
2.06     Agricultural Performance, in recent years, has varied between
products.  While production in the irrigated areas has risen rapidly,
development in the rainfed sector has stagnated and yields have progressed
only marginally. Cereals, olives and meat production has shown no real
improvement and the production of pulses actually declined during the 70s.
Low overall yields in rainfed agriculture are mainly the result of climatic
and land tenure factors but also of poor farm technology and limited
investment, due in part to inadequate government support services,
particularly extension, and the lack of a coherent price policy. For those

-4-
crops for which price policy has not allowed farmers to generate sufficient
net income (oil seeds, cotton, maize), or where farming techniques have not
improved (cereals and pulses), government objectives of increased production
has met with limited or no success. Progress has been most rapid when prices
have permitted net income per hectare to be attractive and where effective
support services have allowed the introduction of modern farming techniques.
This has happened mostly in irrigated areas, where the introduction of sugar
beet and sugar cane cultivation and forage crops for milk production, under
the supervision of Regional Development Offices (ORMVAs), showed rapid
progress.
Government Objectives and Strategy for the Agricultural Sector
2.07     These objectives, as summarized in the 1981-85 Development Plan,
are: (a) the improvement of self-sufficiency through increased production of
staple food; (b) increased agricultural exports through intensified production
of off-season vegetables and fruit; (c) reduction of social and regional
income disparities through increased investment and employment creation in
depressed rural areas; and (d) better valorization of agricultural production
through processing of agricultural produce and improved marketing systems.
2.08     The strategy proposed to achieve these objectives includes:
(a) increasing the share of agriculture in the public investment program;
(b) giving greater emphasis to investments in the rainfed and small-scale
irrigation subsectors; (c) implementing price policies which will ensure
attractive returns to farmers and stimulate production; (d) revising the 1969
Agricultural Investment Code and strengthening the planning, project
preparation and monitoring capabilities of the Ministry of Agriculture;
(e) improving the land ownership structure to encourage intensive use of the
land; and (f) shifting a larger share of the financing of investments in
agriculture to the private sector and expanding the role and lending program
of the Agricultural Credit Bank (CNCA).
2.09     The priority given by the Government to the agricultural sector is
reflected in planned public investments for agriculture (dams excluded)
amounting to 22.5% of total investments in the 1981-85 Plan, as compared to
17.4% in the 1978-80 Plan. In practice, given Morocco's budgetary problems
and actual implementation rates in 1981 and 1982, public investments in
agriculture during the Plan period may not exceed 60% of Plan's targets or
about DH 6.0 billion (in current: prices). This would shift an even greater
role in the sector's development: to private investments and CNCA's financing.
D. Sector Issues Relevant to Agricultural Credit
Land Tenure
2.10     Land owned in free holc[ (5.4 million ha) represents about 74% of all
cultivable areas in Morocco, land collectively owned 13.8%, the balance
belonging to the state (7.2%) or being held under various other forms of
ownership such as religious fourndations. As indicated in the table below, the
distribution of land is very unequal.

Source; Agricultural Census, 1974.
More than 23% of all farms do not have any cultivable land. About 80% of all
farms have 5 ha or less and own less than 25% of the cultivable land, while
0.5% have more than 50 ha and account for 16.8% of total cultivable land. For
the country as a whole, average farm size is about 5 ha. Farms are highly
fragmented, with 1.93 million farms divided into 11.6 million parcels (six per
farm), and the average size of parcels (0.64 ha) is too small for efficient
rainfed farming. Most private farmers do not hold a recognized legal title to
their land and cannot offer the real guarantees required for long-term credit
for land improvement, irrigation works or constructions. In addition,
absentee landlords often hold land for speculative purposes and either do not
cultivate it or rent it to tenant farmers who have no security of tenure and
no incentives to invest or improve the land. About 1.0 million ha of arable,
collective land is distributed among 193,000 holdings (5.2 ha per lot). On
collective land, the farmers do not own individually their land and have
therefore little inducement to undertake improvements.
2.11     The Government has proposed several land reform measures which would
alleviate the above problems. They include limitation on the partition of
land below a minimum size, land consolidation, creation of viable, privately
owned holdings on collective land, formalization of tenant contracts and
imposition of a land tax to ensure that land is not left unproductive.
Implementation of these measures has so far been slow. Land consolidation has
been undertaken on about 500,000 ha in the modern irrigated perimeters. To
date, cadastral survey operations have been completed over 750,000 ha (about
10% of the total arable land) and are underway over an additional 1.5 million
ha, including 880 000 ha financed under Bank-financed Loukkos and Oulmes-
Rommani Projects.!/ Detailed information on land holdings is essential for
the planning of rural development, the establishment of a sound basis for land
taxation and the distribution of agricultural credit. Cadastral operations
and land registration and titling should be accelerated.

Research and Extension
2.12     Despite some positive results, particularly in the development of new
wheat varieties, the impact of research on agriculture has not been
sufficient. Reasons include (a) too little attention paid to practical
problems of farm production systems; (b) inadequate transmission of research
results to farmers by the extension system; (c) poor coordination of the
research programs; and (d) a general shortage of human, physical and financial
resources. To overcome these prDblems, the Government created in 1980 the
semi-autonomous National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA). With
Bank assistance, preparation of a Research Master Plan is underway as a first
step to improve INRA's organization and define research policies and
priorities.
2.13     Agricultural extension in Morocco is organized around 225
agricultural centers. Excepi: for industrial crops in modern perimeters,
extension efforts have not been successful in diffusing improved technology.
Many of the efforts of the extension agents have been directed to distributing
inputs to farmers, collecting statistics and enforcing regulations. Other
shortcomings include (a) the frequent lack of practical experience and
communication skills of the agenits; (b) weak research/extension links and
technical back-up; (c) organ-ization weaknesses including imprecise work
programs, poor messages and lack of supervision; and (d) shortage of vehicles,
equipment and operating budgets, with low salaries and poor incentives. The
result is a cadre of agents who are not motivated, ineffective and lack
respect from their clients. A reform began in 1980 witlh the establishment
within MARA of a Directorate of Extension and the definition of a program
aiming at (i) clearly defining extension objectives and messages; (ii) better
integrating research and extension; (iii) improving the training received by
extension agents; and (iv) increasing the accountability of extension agents
while establishing a better incenitive structure. Preparation for an Extension
Master Plan started early in 1983 with Bank assistance and is expected to be
completed by mid-1984. The P'lan would, in particular, develop a
cost-effective approach to extension in rainfed areas of Morocco.
Mechanization
2.14     Morocco's use of tractors and combine harvestors is limited.  In
1981, there were a total of 23,500 tractors and 2,400 combines in the country,
which amounts to one tractor per 330 ha of cultivable land and one combine per
3,000 ha. This is very low, even in comparison with neighboring countries
with similar climatic conditions (one tractor per 110 ha and 50 ha of
cultivable land respectively in l'unisia and Algeria). Moreover, 44% of the
total number of tractors in Morocco are used in the modern irrigated
perimeters which account for less than 13% of total cultivable area. It is
estimated that about 60% of the total mechanized work is carried out by
contract with more than 80% of ccntract work carried out by private farmers.
Because of Morocco's relativetly short rainfall period (October-April), with
few rainy days and an annual rainfall between 100 mm-800) mm, it is extremely
important that land preparation and planting is carried out at the most
opportune time. If planting under semi-arid conditions is not carried out
immediately after the first rains, a substantial part of the limited growing
season is wasted. Since ploughirng with the use of animal traction can only
commence after some 150 mm of rain has fallen to loosen the soil, sowing in
areas using animal traction usually occurs later than in the mechanized



-7-
areas. This late sowing results in lower yields because less moisture is
available for use by the plant and because the growing season is shorter.
Tractors, on the other hand, can prepare the land before the rains start and
generally do a much better job of seed bed preparation which allows better
infiltration and moisture storage. Applied research in Morocco indicates
that, as a result of timely land preparation carried out by tractors and early
sowing, cereal yields can be increased by as much as 0.3 t/ha. Farmers with
holdings of between 5 and 20 ha are becoming increasingly interested in
tractor rental as a way of improving farm production and decreasing the amount
of fallow land. At present, about 25% to 30% of the arable land in Morocco is
still under fallow.
2.15     During the last decade, combine harvesting of cereals, together with
baling of straw, has become increasingly attractive to medium- and large-scale
farmers because of the seasonal labor scarcity and the high labor cost of
migrant farm laborers. The inability to harvest in time generally results in
considerable grain losses. Grain losses are highest when the crop is left
standing, waiting to be hand harvested, as this is the critical period when
grain shattering and cattle encroachment occurs. Stationary threshing
machines are also gaining popularity and are replacing the traditional
threshing by animals in order to decrease grain losses on the threshing floor.
Poverty and Low Debt Service Capacity
2.16     The majority of farm families operate at or near subsistence level
and do not participate in the monetized economy. It is estimated that nearly
2/3 of the total cereal production in Morocco is used for subsistence
purposes, with less than 10% being marketed through official channels.'/ A
survey undertaken by MARAJ/ estimated the financial surplus generated by
different farm categories and available for investment in 1974. It is
summarized below (in 1960 dirhams):

The study indicated that, in 1974, a substantial financial surplus of DH 732
million was generated, representing about 18% of the country's agricultural
GDP, and that the agricultural sector had important self-financing
capacities.  The debt capacilty of rainfed farms below 10 ha appears severely
limited, in particular in areas with average annual rainfall of less than 400
mm.  On average, farms of less than 5 ha did not generate any financial
surplus and could not accumulate savings and undertake investments without
credit. However, their debt service capacity is minimal and prevents them
from having access to institutional agricultural credit.
Price Regulations and Subsidies
2.17     The Government purchases hard wheat and barley at official support
prices, while the prices of bread wheat, industrial crops and milk are fixed.
This price intervention is suppliemented by controls on imports and interest
rates. Subsidies are provided to maintain low retail prices for basic
foodstuffs (flour, bread, sugar, edible oil and milk)1' as well as for
agricultural inputs (fertilizers, improved seeds) and investments. The
Moroccan price control mechanism is cumbersome and inefficient. Support
prices for wheat and barley are higher than prices on the international
markets. However, because of poor official marketing arrangements,
stabilization of cereals producer price is ineffective, as only a small
proportion of total production is marketed through official channels and can
benefit from support prices. On the free market, cereal prices show sharp
seasonal fluctuations, with prices at harvest dropping to as low as 70% of
support price.
2.18     There are indications that the vast majority of agricultural input
subsidies go to a minority of wealthier farmers. Therefore, these subsidies,
which amounted to about DH 240.0 million in 1981, have had little impact on
stimulating the use of modern inputs by small farmers. For this reason, the
Government has decided to review and amend as necessary the dispositions of
the 1969 Agricultural Investment Code. A study of the impact of current
subsidies on agricultural produclion and government budget, and of the
required reforms to the Investment Code is being financed under the Loukkos
Development Project (Loan 1848-MOR).
2.19     Input Availability.  Fertilizer use has increased by about 11% p.a.
since 1956, reaching 264,000 t oi nutrient element in 1980. This represents
about one-fifth of the consumption required according to technical norms.
Fertilizers are used mostly by farmers in large irrigated perimeters, Agrarian
Reform Cooperatives, state agricultural companies and large farmers. Prices
of fertilizers are fixed by the Government and have so far incorporated a
substantial subsidy element (40% to 50% of the cost). The public sector
dominates in the upstream supply chain while the private sector is more
important downstream.  The public sector handles all imports, manufactures
over two-thirds of the locally produced fertilizer and distributes about
one-half of all fertilizer consumed in Morocco. The Office Cherifien des
1/ Subsidies distributed through the Caisse de Compensationl and ONICL for
basic foodstuffs exceeded DH 2.0 billion (US$250.0 million) in 1982.



-9-.
Phosphates (OCP) serves as the apex organization of the state enterprises,
with its subsidiary Maroc-Chimie processing phosphate-based fertilizer
products. FERTIMA distribute OCP/Maroc Chimie's products in addition to
having a monopoly over the import of other fertilizer products. The private
sector carries out some of the manufacturing (Societe Chgrifienne des Engrais)
and distribution functions in parallel with the public sector organizations.
Nine private companies participate on a limited scale in the wholesale
business and many small licensed private entrepreneurs account for much of the
retail trade, along with FERTIMA which has 200 distribution outlets in MARA's
Centres de Travaux (CTs) and Centres de Mise en Valeur (CMVs). However, the
present distribution network is insufficient. In addition, inadequate pricing
structure and lack of storage capacity at intermediate and retail levels are
unfavorable to early purchases by farmers and retailers. As a result, there
are problems with fertilizer availability during periods of high demand.
2.20      Seeds of high yielding varieties (HYV) of cereals, pulses, forage
crops, potatoes and sugar beet are sold mainly by the state-owned company,
SONACOS, through the 200 outlets of the CT-CMV network. In 1980, the use of
HYV seeds reached 50,000 t, almost exclusively for cereal production. This is
enough for about 1.2 million ha or around 35% of total area cultivated in
cereals (about 4.0 million ha). Use of HYVs has stagnated in Morocco (48,900
tons 1977) with large annual fluctuations (33,400 tons in 1979). Although
Moroccan farmers are aware of advantages of using HYVs, increased use is
constrained by several factors among which. (a) limited availability because
of insufficient production and problems with distribution similar to those for
fertilizers, and (b) limited purchasing power and debt capacity of small
farmers.
Savings Mobilization
2.21      Over the last few years, domestic savings mobilization in Morocco has
been poor and declining (16% of GDP in 1977, 11% in 1981). In 1981, gross
domestic savings financed only 46% of gross investment, the balance being
provided by external sources of finance. Improvement in the overall domestic
savings ratio will depend essentially on improvement in the current budget
balance. However, efforts must be intensified to mobilize private savings. A
constraint in this mobilization is the low level of interest rates (10.5% on
18-month deposits), which, with inflation at an estimated 10.5% in 1982,
discourages financial savings.
2.22     Rural resource mobilization appears very small.  Taxes collected from
the rural sector are low, amounting to DH 50 to 60 million annually, or less
than 1% of the total agricultural GDP and less 4% than the net financial
surplus!! generated by the sector. Agriculture contributes around 17% of
total GDP, but less than 2% of total tax revenues. In contrast, CNCA has been
relatively successful in mobilizing deposits. Deposits with CNCA have grown
from DH 136 million in 1975 to DH 544 million in 1982, a rate of growth of 22%
p.a. However, a large part of these deposits are institutional deposits (from
State-owned companies) and private rural savings are still not adequately
tapped by CNCA despite the establishment of banking facilities in many of its
branches. Reasons for this low mobilization of rural savings include; (a)
limited savings capacity of a large portion of farmers; (b) preference of
1/ See para. 2.16.



-10-
Moroccan farmers for real assets, in particular, livestock, over financial
assets; (c) diversion by some large farmers of agriculture-generated savings
into urban-based investments or consumption; and (d) interest rates on
deposits have been low and negative in real terms. The proposed Project would
assist CNCA in its deposit mobilization efforts by financing the extension and
rehabilitation of its branch network and providing technical assistance to
define and implement a more aggressive banking strategy (para. 7.02).
Issues of Agroindustrial Development
2.23     At present, some excess capacity exists for the processing of
oilseeds and olives, milk pasteurization, animal feed production, canning and
cotton ginning. Sugar beet and sugar cane processing factories and refineries
of vegetable oil and sugar work at near full capacity, as do industrial and
artisanal flour mills, slaughterlhouses and most small-scale agroindustrial
enterprises. Cold storage is used to full capacity. Financing of large-scale
investments (sugar factories!, industrial flour mills, grain storage) is
available from Government, foreign suppliers and the Moroccan Industrial
Development Bank (BNDE). However, small-scale agroindustries do not receive
adequate attention. About 60% of total investments in the sector envisaged
under the 1981-85 Plan (DH 4.2 billion) are allocated to three sectors (sugar
processing, cereal storage and fertilizers).-   Agroindustrial projects
promoted by the Office de D4veloppement Industriel (ODI), an arm of the
Ministry of Commerce and Industrv, are primarily large-scale investments.
Expansion of small- and medium-scale agroindustries is constrained by (a) lack
of entrepreneurs' technical and financial competence and experience in dealing
with financial institutions and Government; and (b) laclk of finance. As a
result, most agroindustrial investments are medium and large scale rather than
small scale, capital intensive rather than labor-intensive and located in
urban rather than rural areas. lJnder the proposed Project, CNCA would promote
the development of small- and medium-scale agro-industries lDy targetting its
lending to this subsector and providing technical assistance to rural
entrepreneurs (para. 7.12).
E. Bank Agricultural Sector Strategy and
Performance under Previous Project
2.24     The Bank's strategy in i:he agricultural sector has supported the
government objectives of increasing agricultural production wherever
economically justified while placing, for economic and isocial reasons, an
increased emphasis on developing rainfed areas where a large untapped
potential exists and most of the poorest members of the rural population
live. In the future, renewed emphasis will be given to (a) highly productive
projects which will increase foreign exchange earnings or savings; and (b)
strengthening agricultural services at the national level in order to provide
an efficient support for regional projects and to address certain sector-wide
policy issues.
2.25     Bank Group lending for agriculture in Morocco began in 1965, and to
date, 58 projects have been undertaken and supported by US$1,958.5 million
Bank/IDA funds (US$24.0 million of IDA credits).  They include six irrigation

projects; Sidi Slimane (FY65), Sebou I (FY70), Souss Groundwater (FY75),
Doukkala I (FY76) and Doukkala II (FY77), all completed, and Small- and
Medium-Scale Irrigation (FY83); five rainfed agricultural development projects
in the Meknes (FY75), Fez-Karia-Tissa (FY78), Loukkos (FY80), Middle Atlas
(FY82) and Oulmes Rommani (FY83) areas; an agroindustrial and flood control
project (Sebou II, FY74); a Vegetable and Marketing Project (FY80); a Forestry
Project (FY82); and four Agricultural Credit Projects (FY66, FY73, FY77, and
FY79), three of which have been completed. Project performance to date is
generally satisfactory. A major issue in the irrigation projects has been
inadequate cost recovery, but recently decreed increases in water charges are
contributing to a satisfactory solution. A Performance Audit Report for the
Sebou I Project was issued on June 21, 1982, stressing the project's success
in institution building as well as in increasing production. The Project
Completion Report for the Doukkala I Project was issued on June 4, 1982. The
project was successfully completed with actual production and cropping
intensity exceeding appraisal targets. Among rainfed projects, which are
mostly still in early stages of execution, implementation has also been
satisfactory, with the exception of the Meknes Development Project, the first
of the series, which has experienced substantial delays due to the complicated
land redistribution and consolidation program and inexperience in organization
and management of complex rural development projects. This has now been
overcome and the implementation of the consolidation program is progressing
satisfactorily. Performance of the Agricultural Credit Projects has been
good. OED reports are available for three of them.!/ These reports stress
the contribution made by the projects to agricultural development, their
success in establishing an efficient credit institution and the successful
expansion of credit to small farmers. A more detailed analysis of the results
of the four Agricultural Credit Projects is presented in Chapter V.
III. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
3.01     Morocco has a well developed financial sector.  It consists of (a)
fifteen commercial banks having a combined network of about 630 branches; (b)
five specialized credit institutions including CNCA; and (c) two savings
banks. Morocco has a Central Bank (Banque du Maroc) and a capital market
(Casablanca stock exchange) where shares of private companies are listed and
traded. Medium- and Long-term credit is provided to investors mostly by three
specialized institutions: the Housing and Tourism Bank (CIH), the Industrial
Development Bank (BNDE) and the Agricultural Bank (CNCA). Each of these
institutions caters to its respective economic sector and has received Bank
loans.
Commercial Banks
3.02     At the end of 1981, the fifteen commercial Banks had total assets of
DH 26.2 billion (US$3.3 billion). The degree of concentration is high with the
seven largest banks accounting for some 90% of total assets. Their branch
network is very unevenly distributed geographically, 25% of all branches being

located in Casablanca and another 50% in cities along the Atlantic coast. In
1981, commercial banks extended D)H 14.1 million in credits to the economy (or
62% of total credits), of which 93% were short-term. In spite of government
encouragements, banks have been cautious in extending investment credit,
partly because of the possibility of making high profits on short-term
lending. At the end of 1981, their medium-term lending (DH 1,043 million)
represented 14% of total medium- and long-term credits to the economy and had
not increased in current terrns from 1977 levels (DH 1,009 million). It
represented 5% of their deposits (DH 21,640 million) and only 16% of their
term deposits (DH 6,580 mill.ion). Transformation of short-term deposits into
longer-term lending by commercial banks has therefore not occurred.
Commercial banks' lending to agriculture is mostly short-term. They
participate, under the strict control of the Ministry of Finance, in the
syndicated financing of production and marketing operations of state-owned
agricultural enterprises.  They also offer seasonal and investment credit to
individual farmers. However, (a) their branches are mostly located in urban
centers; (b) they are profit--maximizers and avoid making small loans with
relatively high processing costs; (c) they lack adequately trained
agricultural staff; and (d) their lending is usually restricted to borrowers
keeping also sizeable deposit baLances and offering sufficient guarantees. As
a result, their agricultural lending to individual farmers is minimal.
Specialized Credit Institutions
3.03     Specialized credit iinstitutions are responsible for the bulk of
medium- and long-term lending. In 1981, they provided 86% of all medium- and
long-term credit to the economy, up from 84% in 1974. They have developed
their activities more rapidly than the financial system as a whole. Since
1974, credit extended by these institutions has grown at an average annual
rate of 22% p.a. (in current terns), against 18% for total credit to the
economy.
Distribution of Credit by Sector
3.04     An analysis of credit distribution by sector!/ indicates that,
between 1976 and 1981, loans to agriculture have increased less rapidly than
loans to other sectors (7.4% against 14.7% p.a. in current terms). As a
result, the share of agriculiture in total recorded credits has decreased from
13.1% in 1976 down to 9.8% in 1981. However, recorded credits underestimate
actual lending and it can be estimated that, at the end of 1981, the
agricultural sector, which contributed an average of 16.6% of the total GDP
over the 1979-81 period, accounted for about 13% of total credit to the
economy.
Interest Rates
3.05     The Government sets intierest rate ceilings on both deposits received
and loans granted by Morocco's financial institutions. Interest rates on
deposits have been increased recently to attract savings;  sight deposits
yield no interest, except current accounts with CNCA (up to 5% p.a.); term
deposits yield from 4.5% p.a. for 1-month deposits, to 10.5% p.a.
1/ Recorded credits only. Loans below a certain amount are not reported to
the Central Bank.



-13-
for 18-month deposits. The cost of rediscounting facilities with Bank of
Morocco ranges from 3% for agricultural loans to 7% (basic rate). The yield
of Treasury bills varies between 8.5% p.a. for 6-month bills, to 10.5% for
5-year bills. Local currency bonds carry interest rates up to 11.5% and are
mostly issued by specialized financial institutions (CIH, BNDE, CNCA) or
public enterprises.
3.06     For the first time since 1975, lending rates were raised across the
board in October 1980 then again in April 1982. Maximum rates charged by
commercial banks on rediscountable loans (including agricultural loans) are
now 10% for short-term loans and 11% for medium-term loans. BNDE is now
charging a single rate of 14% p.a. on all its loans. Until September 1, 1983,
CNCA interest rates ranged from 7% to 10% p.a. on short-term loans and from 8%
to 10% on medium- and long-term loans. With inflation rate at 12.5% in 1981
and 10.5% in 1982, interest rates on deposits and loans have generally been
negative in real terms. This has discouraged savings, encouraged credit use
and, because of limited resources for lending, required some credit
rationing. However, interest rates on CNCA's loans have been increased as of
September 1, 1983 (para. 7.13) and are now positive in real terms.
IV. THE CAISSE NATIONALE DE CREDIT AGRICOLE
A. Background, Organization and Staffing
Organization
4.01     Established in 1961, CNCA is a wholly government-owned institution
with independent legal status and financial autonomy. Its objectives are to
promote agriculture in Morocco by extending credit for agricultural inputs,
investments and marketing to individual farmers, farmers' groups and
cooperatives and companies. To do so, CNCA prepares and implements annual
lending programs which have to be approved by both the Ministers of Finance
and Agriculture.
4.02     CNCA is administered by a board of directors and a managing
committee. The board of directors is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture
and includes representatives of the Ministries of Agriculture, Finance,
Interior, of the Bank of Morocco and of farmers. The managing committee is
chaired by CNCA's Director General and includes representatives from the
bodies which are represented on the board of directors. CNCA's chief
executive officer is the Director General. He is appointed by Royal Decree
and is in charge of CNCA's day-to-day operations. He appoints CNCA's staff
with the exception of the Financial Comptroller who is nominated by the
Minister of Finance. The comptroller is responsible for supervising CNCA's
financial transactions and ensuring that they comply with pertinent laws and
the decisions of the board.
4.03     CNCA's credit is extended from the headquarters in Rabat, 36 Regional
Branches (CRCAs)l/ and 95 Local Branches (CLCAs).2 /  Since the appraisal
of the Fourth Credit Project in 1979, seven new CRCAs and four more CLCAs have
been created. In addition, 90 seasonal credit outlets, attached to CLCAs,
1/ Caisses R4gionales de Credit Agricole.
2/ Caisses Locales de Crddit Agricole.



-14-
have been opened during FY81/82 and 50 more in FY82/83. There are eight
Inspection Directorates (IRCAs)!/ in charge of banking inspection,
coordination of credit activities, and undertaking special surveys and
studies. In addition, CNCA has recently opened six deposit branches in major
urban centers.
Staffing and Staff Training
4.04     As of December 31, 1982, CNCA staff numbered 1,830.  Staff
productivity is relatively high. The number of loans granted annually per
operational staff is about 23C0 for CRCAs and 500 for CLCAs. However, with the
exception of FY81/82 which was an exceptional year following the 1980/81
drought, staff productivity has not increased over the last few years. This
reflects the fact that most bookkeeping operations at branch level are done
manually and that any increase! in the number of loan applications can be
accommodated only by a proportional increase in staff. Future productivity
gains will require some branch level bookkeeping operations to be computerized.
4.05     The level of education of- CNCA's staff is relatively high.  Most
administrative and account off-icers are high school graduates or have a
diploma in accounting. Middle and higher management staff are university
graduates.  Every newly appointed employee receives induction training from
two to seven weeks depending on his position. In 1972, following a
well-conceived strategy, a comprehensive training program was launched to
update CNCA's staff professiornal skills through courses, seminars and
on-the-job training. Management personnel was encouraged to enroll in
correspondence courses. In recent: years, however,-CNCA's training efforts
have been somewhat curtailed and concentrated on initial training of new
recruits. Only a few higher management staff members have received training
for short periods of time on specific subjects. CNCA management has recently
started to give renewed attention to the training needs of it-s staff. A new
department has been created to be in charge of training activities. This
department is preparing a detailed assessment of training needs of the various
categories of staff (para. 7.08).
B. Lending Policies and Procedures;
4.06     Decentralization of lending responsibility, simplification of
procedures and expansion of the range of investments financed have been the
main characteristics of CNCA's cretdit policies since 1975. CNCA's objective
has been to provide maximum access to credit, make the provision of credit
rapid and simple and adapt credit norms to regional agro--economic conditions.
Lending operations are governed by "Credit Guidelines" which are revised every
year in collaboration with MARA. These guidelines are comprehensive and cover
types of credit available, appraisal criteria, financing norras, sub-borrower
contributions, interest rates, loan approval authorities, security for loans
and maximum credit ceilings available to borrowers.  Lending procedures are
different for commercial farmers, clients of headquarters or CRCAs, than for
small farmers, clients of CLCAs:  Headquarters and CRCAs' loans are subject to
considerably more stringent appraisal criteria than CLCAs' loans for which
procedures are streamlined. Short-term loans are usually granted for periods

of 3 months (harvest loan) to 12 months and finance farm inputs and produce
marketing; medium- and long-term loans extend from 2 to 20 years and finance a
wide range of on-farm investments.
Head Office and CRCAs
4.07     The head office lends to a few large farmers whose borrowings exceed
CRCAs loan approval authority, state-owned companies producing or marketing
agricultural products, irrigation development offices and agroindustrial
enterprises. CRCAs lend to individual farmers with a fiscal income (FI)11
above DH 3,000 (actual net farm income of about DH 12,000 or US$1,500) and to
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives. CNCA has achieved a good balance between
thoroughness of appraisal and the objective of reaching a large number of
farmers with limited staff resources and operating costs. Field appraisal is
systematically undertaken for investments in land improvement, irrigation,
pure bred livestock, plantations, poultry farming and for all loans disbursed
by installments. On-farm appraisal is also carried out for other purposes
when considered necessary. Credit norms are set to cover about 70% of
estimated crop production costs and investment cost.
4.08     Loan applications are reviewed and approved by CRCAs' credit
committee, chaired by the CRCA director and meeting weekly. However, Internal
Credit Commissions (ICC) were created in 1976/77 to simplify and speed up
application processing. They are composed of the CRCA director and two of his
staff who can meet daily, if necessary, to approve short-term loans. The type
of guarantee required from borrowers is based on CRCA staff judgement of
credit risk. Short-term loans to individuals are generally secured by crop
liens and sureties and medium- and long-term loans by a chattel mortgage on
equipment. Loans for land improvement, irrigation and constructions are
secured by a mortgage.
CLCAs
4.09     CLCAs make loans to small farmers with a fiscal income between DH 50
and DH 3,000, which corresponds roughly to annual net farm income of about
DH 200 (US$25.0) to DH 12,000 (US$1,500). Comprehensive lists of farmers' Fl
are kept with CLCAs and consulted for every loan application. As in the case
of CRCA clients, loan amounts are determined on the basis of norms revised
annually. However, there is a ceiling on maximum borrowings intended to keep
borrowing within estimated debt capacity of CLCA clients. For farmers having
legal title to their land, maximum short-term borrowing is limited to
DH 15,000 (US$1,875) and maximum medium-term loans outstanding to DH 35,000
(US$4,375). For borrowers who cannot present evidence of ownership (which
represent about 95% of CLCA clients), short-term loans are limited to 150% of
their FI and annual medium-term loan installments to 120% of FI. The ceiling
on borrowing capacity minimizes CLCA lending risk. This is important, because
loan appraisal is based on desk review. Systematic field appraisal and
supervision of small farmers' loans (average short-term loan is DH 1,000 or
US$125) would not be administratively or financially feasible. However, the
fiscal income ceiling is necessarily arbitrary and often not related to
1/ Net income estimated for tax purposes. Depending upon the crops grown,
real annual net farm incomes range from 3 to more than 20 times fiscal
incomes.



-16-
investment cost or actual farmer's repayment capacity. As a result, credit
provided to CLCA clients often constitutes less than 70% of production or
investment costs.
4.10     In 1981, in the context of the Bank-financed Fez-Karia-Tissa
Agricultural Project (Loan 1602-MOR), CNCA introduced a pilot scheme to test
new credit policies for CLCA c'Lients. Under the new policies, the overall
ceiling on credit repayment capacity has been set at 50% of farmers' projected
annual gross farm income. Lending norms have been set to represent from 70%
to 90% of production or investment costs. Under the new lending policy
changes, the unit size of short-term loans to CLCA clients has about doubled
in the Project area. Results of field surveys to determine the impact of
increased availability of credit on input use and production are not yet
available. However, recoveries in the Project area have been satisfactory,
indicating that farmers' debt repayment capacity had not been grossly exceeded.
Interest Rates
4.11     Current interest rates (as of September 1, 1983) on CNCA's subloans
are presented below:

annual interest rate.
/b Maturity period more than 1L0 yesars.
In addition, an appraisal fee of 0.5% is char-ed on CRCAs and HQs loans.l/
Interest rates on CNCA's loans are now equival nt to those charged by
commercial banks for agricultural loans, whi ` range from 8% to 10% on
short-term credit and from 11% to 13% p.a. for medium-term credit. CNCA's
interest rate for agroindustrial subloans is 12% or 13% p.a. depending on loan
maturity. This is slightly lower than the net interest rate paid by
agroi dustrial enterprises on medium-term loans from BNDE which is around 14%
p.a.2/ Bank projections indicate a decline in the domestic rate of
1/  On loans of more than DH 5,000.  In 1981/82, the proceeds of this fee
amounted to DH 4.3 million.
2/ Including off-setting Government interest subsidy of 2% and appraisal and
foreign exchange risk fees amounting to about 2% of loan amount.



-17-
inflation to 9% in 1983-1984 and 7.5% in 1985. CNCA's current lending rates
would therefore be positive in real terms during the project period. However,
the institutional rigidity of interest rates with respect to short-term
fluctuations in domestic inflation and external financing conditions is an
issue. If real on-lending rates were to become negative, credit rationing
would result, with large, low risk borrowers obtaining most of the credit.
Increase in the cost of CNCA's resources might also undermine CNCA's financial
viability. A mechanism permitting the adjustment of loans' interest rate when
CNCA's financial situation so requires is proposed in para. 7.13.
C. Lending Operations
4.12                        In 1981/82, total CNCA lending reached DH 1,499
million, up from DH 835.0 million in 1977/78 for an average rate of growth of
15.8% over the period. In real terms, lending increased at an estimated 6.0%
annual rate.

Over the period, the share of short-term credit in total credit remained stable
around 55%. Short-term credit represented about 65% of total lending by HQs and
CRCAs but only 26% of total CLCA lending. However, the latter has increased very
rapidly over the period (average rate of growth of 57% p.a.). Because of this
increase, credit received by CLCA clients represented 27% of total CNCA lending in
1981/82 against 24% in 1977/78.



-18-
4.13     Short-term loans to private farmers have primarily financed crop
production (50%) and animal feed (27%). Short-term credit to State agricultural
companies, which represented 20% of total short-term lending, was used mainly (66%)
to finance, through the ORMVAs, industrial crop production (cotton, sugar beet and
sugar cane) in irrigated perimeters. About 45% of total medium- and long-term
credit went to CLCA clients, 42% to individual CRCA clients and the balance to
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives (4,), State companies (5%) and agroindustries (2%).
Four types of investment represfented more than 75% of total lending; livestock
(25%), construction (19%), mechianization (17%), and draft animals (16%).
Credit Coverage
4.14     Between 1970/71 and 1981/82, total amount of lending to individual farmers
increased from DH 185 million to DH 1,210 million, an average rate of growth of
18.6% p.a in current terms (about 10% in real terms). During the same period,
loans to small farmers increased faster, at an average annual rate of 24%, reaching
DH 435 million in 1981/82. Not included in that figure are loans to Agrarian
Reform Cooperatives, whose members are, by definition, small farmers, and loans
granted through ORMVAs to private farmers (many of whom are small-holders) for the
production of industrial crops. The extent of CNCA's credit penetration in rural
areas is illustrated in the table below;

-19-
350,000 individual farmers had an active file with CNCA. This corresponds to
26.3% of the total number of CNCA's potential clients. In addition, it is
estimated that another 100,000 farmers were receiving credit through Agrarian
Reform Cooperatives and ORMVAs.
4.15     About 58% of potential CRCA clients, but only 24% of CLCA potential
clients were receiving credit in 1981/82. For the latter, CNCA penetration
was relatively high for farms having a FI in the DH 1,400-3,000 range (which
corresponds to approximately 10 ha to 20 ha of rainfed lan3). However, very
few marginal farmers with FI below DH 800 (about 5 ha rainfed land) were
actual CNCA clients, reflecting their very low borrowing capacity and their
lack of participation in the monetized economy. The increase in the number of
CNCA clients has followed the expansion of the network of CRCAs and CLCAs
offices. In 1973, there were 21 CRCAs and 53 CLCAs; in 1977, 24 and 88
respectively; in 1982, 33 and 94. During this period the number of CLCA
clients has increased at an average rate of 18% p.a. A sharp increase in
1981/82 coincided with the opening of 90 seasonal credit outlets to bring
credit facilities closer to farmers, while containing distribution costs.
Although there is relatively little scope to substantially increase the
coverage of CRCA's potential clients, given the already current high coverage
level (close to 60%), the planned development of CNCA physical infrastructure
during the period of the project (8 CRCAs and 11 CLCAs) should permit a
sizeable expansion of CLCA's clients.
D. Financial Situation and Performance
Resources
4.16     As of August 31, 1982, CNCA's total resources amounted to DH 2,673.5
million (US$334.2 million), as follows:

/a End of CNCA's Fiscal Year.
/b Including provisions for bad debt (DH 96.7 million).
During the 1977-1982 period, total assets increased at an average annual rate
of 22.7% in current terms. This increase was mostly due to the growth of
long-term borrowings (26.8% p.a.) and deposits (20.4% p.a.). CNCA's own funds



-20-
(paid-up capital, special fundsl! and provisions) have increased very slowly
(4.0% p.a. in current terms, less than the average inflation rate) and they
represented as of August 31, 1982, 20.4% of total CNCA's resources, down from
46.6% in 1977. Although the increase in provision for bad loans was adequate,
retained earnings from annual profits were low and did not allow CNCA to
protect its equity from inflationary erosion. Long-term borrowings amounted
to DH 1,013.8 million as of August 31, 1982 and represented about 40% of
CNCA's total resources.  About 91% of long-term borrowings were external
borrowings of which DH 451.5 million (44%) from the World Bank itself.
Domestic long-term borrowings amounted to DH 93.1 million,, or less than 3.5%
of CNCA resources, which indicates insufficient efforts to mobilize domestic
resources.
4.17      Deposits.  Deposit's relative share of CNCA's total reources declined
from 18.8% in 1977 to 17.1% in 1982. They are primarily sight deposits (92%
of total) and are collected mostly by CRCAs (75.6%) and headquarters (20.6%)
but very little by CLCAs (1.8%). CNCA has introduced banking services in all
CRCAs and a few CLCAs, while all CLCAs offer savings passbooks (carnets verts)
to accustom small farmers to financial savings. Currently, 48 branches offer
banking services. This represents about 7% of the total Moroccan domestic
banking network. However, in spite of certain competitive advantages,2/
CNCA has been only moderately successful in mobilizing domestic resources.
The main constraints to deposit mobilization have been presented in para.
2.22. In addition, there are institutional constraints specific to CNCA
itself including:
(a)  Unfavorable Network: most of CNCA banking outlets are located in
small rural centers and not in the urban areas which are the major
savings-generating areas of the country;
(b)  Physical Infrastructure: many of the CRCAs' and most of the CLCAs'
physical lay-out and location are not favorable to the promotion of
banking activities;
(c)  Lack of Basic Banking Services;  CNCA does not offer many of the
services (discount of commercial paper, overdraft facilities,
personal loans) that commercial banks provide and which generate
deposits; and
(d)  Lack of Trained Staff:,  CNCA staff is mostly geared toward lending
activities and has not: received adequate training in banking
operations.
4.18      To channel more dcmest:ic resources into agriculture and to allow CNCA
to meet vastly increased credit: demand after the 1980,/81 drought, commercial
banks were required to invest 3.5% of their deposits into CNCA one-year bonds
(bearing a 3.0% p.a. interest rate). As of August 31, 1982, total amount of
these bonds was DH 544.2 million or 20.4% of CNCA's total resources. CNCA
1/  Special funds are managed by CNCA on behalf of the Government.  They
amount to an interest free loan from the Government for an indefinite
period and can be treated as quasi-equity.
2/ Payment of up to 5% p.a. oni current accounts, branches open on Saturdays.



-21-
will continue to benefit from these resources in the future. To accommodate
CNCA's seasonal liquidity problems, the Bank of Morocco provides CNCA with
rediscounting facilities for its short- and medium-term lending (up to DH 530
million as of September 1, 1981).
Loan Recoveries
4.19     CNCA recovery procedures are efficient and have the full backing of
Government. As a result, recovery rates have generally been good: out of
total loans of about DH 8,000 million distributed by CNCA since its inception,
DH 6,000 million had fallen due and DH 5,770 million (96.2%) recovered by
August 31. 1981.  The levels of recovery during the 1977-82 period are shown
below.

/b  After rescheduling.
The decline in recovery performance in 1981/82 was due to the 1980-81 drought
which reduced farmers' ability to repay their debts. The Government and CNCA
postponed by a year the repayment of DH 458 million of loans falling due
between July and December 1981. As a result, farmers had to face increased
repayment obligations in the period July-August 1982. In some regions again
affected by drought, farmers could not meet these obligations and CNCA decided
to reschedule part of their debt, converting it into medium-term loans.
4.20     As of August 31, 1982, total overdue stood at DH 511.5 million or
22.9% of total outstanding portfolio.  However, DH 414.6 million (81.L%) had
been overdue for less than 15 months and corresponded for the most part to the
aftermathi of the drought. Moreover, as loans normally fall due in the
July-August period, a large portion of the loans shown overdue as of August
31, the end of CNCA's FY, is in fact recovered before the end of the calendar
-year. Loans overdue for more than 15 months amounted to DH 97.0 million or
4.3% of total portfolio. As of August 31, 1982, total provisions for doubtful
loans amounted to DH 53.o million, i.e., 55% of loans overdue by more than 15
months or 2.4% of total outstanding portfolio. In view of CNCA's strict
recovery procedures it is considered satisfactorv.



-22-
Financial Position
4.21     CNCA's Balance Sheets for the period of 1997/78 to 1981/82 are
presented in Annex 7. In current terms, CNCA's total assets increased by
22.7% p.a. during the 1977-82 period (about 13% in real terms).  This growth
occurred more rapidly in liabilities than in equity with the result that the
Equitv to Total Assets Ratio declined from 27.3% to 13.7% over the period.
This ratio is still satisfactory and reflects an adequate capitalization.
CNCA's long-term borrowings grew at an average rate of 24% p.a. over the
period, much faster than its equity (2.6% p.a.). As a result, the Long-Term
Debt to Equity Ratio increased from 1.2 to 2.6 as of August 31, 1982.   This
is still relatively low and within the 4 to 1 ceiling set under the Fourth
Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1704-MOR).  CNCA's current ratio declinea
from 2.4 to 1.3, the latter figure still indicating a fiavorable liquidity
position. This drop indicates that, over the period, CNCA's negative

2L.9% over the 1977-82 periocl, more rapidlv than total assets (22.7% p.a.) or
average loans outstanding (19.0%), reflecting an increase in average return on
portfolio. CNCA's Income Statements during this period are presented in Annex

In 1981/82, CNCA's financial expenses represented 53.1% of total expenses up
from 46.3% in 1977/78. The average cost of borrowed resources was 5.4% p.a.
and the average cost of total resources 4.2% p.a. Staff expenses represented
32.6% of total expenses in 1981/82, down from 38.8% in 1977/78. Depreciation
expenses remained stationary in absolute terms and declined as a percentage of
total expenses (1.4% in 1981/82) reflecting the lack of investment in physical
infrastructure in recent years.
4.23     Net profits declined from 1977/78 to 1979/80 when they dropped to
0.1% of equity. Following an increase in CNCA's on-lending rates in October
1980 and the substantial increase in lending and outstanding loan portfolio in
1981/82, net profits increased to DH 19.1 million or 5.5% of equity for that
year. This low level of profitability has prevented CNCA from accumulating
adequate retained earnings. As a result, CNCA's equity only grew at 2.6% p.a.
in current terms over the period and decreased in real terms by 7.0% p.a., or
about 30% in total.
CLCA Operations
4.24     CLCA accounts are kept separate from HQs/CRCAs accounts, though the
two are consolidated at the end of the year. Because of the higher cost
involved in lending to small farmers,!/ CLCAs have consistently experienced
losses except in 1981/82. CLCA's operating losses are compensated by a
Government subsidy. A mechanism to ensure that CLCAs will generate sufficient
income through its future operations to eliminate the need for Government
subsidy and protect its equity from monetary erosion is proposed in para. 7.13.
E. CNCA Objectives and Development Strategy
4.25     The Government has recently re-emphasized the role of CNCA in the
development of the country's agricultural sector, and defined the main themes
of CNCA's future objectives and organization: (a) expansion of farmers'
coverage and regionalization of activities; (b) increased mobilization of
domestic savings; and (c) financial autonomy and viability of the
institution. To give CNCA an adequate basis to undertake this new phase in
its development, a new law is in preparation to modify CNCA's statutes. The
main provisions of the law have been approved by the Ministries of Finance and
Agriculture. They concern:
(a) the legal incorporation of CLCAs as CNCA branches because their
status of independent credit cooperatives, envisaged in the 1961
dahir, has not materialized in practice;
(b) the provision of the necessary legal basis for CNCA to regionalize
its activities at a future date by creating fully-fledged
subsidiaries or regional banks;
(c) the definition of principles to govern CNCA's banking activities;
(d) the elimination of direct administrative financial control (through
Government's Financial Comptroller) over CNCA's operations in favor
of a fully-fledged financial autonomy and accountability.
1/ Over the last 4 years, CLCA's incurred operating costs of DH 98/1,000
dirhams disbursed against DH 54/1,000 dirhams for CRCAs.



-24-
The new statutes will form a sound basis for the development of CNCA's credit
and banking activities. However, CNCA will have to tackle various
institutional constraints. The development of its credit activities will
require a greater decentralization of decision making and accountability to
the regional level. The development of its banking activities will require:
(a) the definition of a precise sltrategy for deposit mobilization; (b) the
extension and renovation of its physical infrastructure; and (c) the training
of its staff in banking techniques. In addition, the development of both
credit and banking activities requires that immediate action be taken to set
up, within CNCA, an efficient Management Information System (MIS) to allow for
effective planning, budgeting and monitoring of CNCA's activities. CNCA's
senior management has already taken preliminary steps to introduce some of
these institutional reforms. Its efforts would be supported under the Project
and most of the necessary reforms implemented or initiated during the Project
period.
F. CNCA Projected Lending Program and Financing Requirements
(1983/84-1985/86)
4.26     Based on past trends, Government's objectives and policies for the
development of the agricultural sector and on CNCA's own development strategy,
including a major program to expand credit outlets, CNCA's total lending could
reach as much as some DH 3,300 million in 1985/86, provided normal climatic
conditions are experienced. CNCA's projected lending programn is given in
Annex 1. The resources necessary to finance such a lending program will
primarily come from domestic sources through (a) increased deposit
mobilization, and (b) bonds floated on the domestic market.  The remaining
financing needs will be financed i-rom external sources. The Project's
cofinanciers would provide the ext:ernal financing necessary. Rediscounting
facilities available to CNCA from the Bank of Morocco and the expected
increase in deposits (mostly sight deposits) would provide CNCA with the
resources necessary to finance itS short-term lending program. The Project
would provide CNCA with long-term resources to finance its medium- and
long-term lending program.
V. PERFORMANCE UNDER PREVIOUS AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECTS
A. First and Second Agricultural Credit Projects
(Loan 433-MOR; Loan 861-MOR and Credit 338-MOR)
5.01     Under the First Project, a Bank loan of US$10.0 million!' helped
finance CNCA's lending program for the period 1966-69. It financed
investments undertaken by about 6,000 medium and large farmers and farm
equipment purchased by a State company (CGE 2).!/  The Project was audited by
the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)l/ which attributed the Project's
mixed results to CNCA's shortage of qualified staff and to Government's
interference in CNCA operations by directing CNCA subloans to small farmers,
which was not envisaged under the Project. Under the Second Project, the Bank
provided a Loan/Credit of US$34.0 million to CNCA to finance medium and large

farmers' investments over the 1973-76 period. About 17,000, mostly large
farmers benefitted from the Project. Based on the experience of the First
Project, the Bank's concern related to CNCA's institutional problems
including: (a) the need to introduce separate accounts for CLCA operations;
(b) the strengthening of CNCA capital structure; (c) the need to increase
profitability of CNCA's operations; and (d) the need to increase the
reliability of financial data. According to the Project Performance Audit
Report (PPAR) issued June 15, 1979, results were positive. CLCA accounts were
separated in 1972 and the increase in capital was made effective in 1973.
Following Bank insistence, interest rates on medium-term loans were increased
to 7% for cooperatives and 8.5% for CRCA clients. Auditing of CNCA's accounts
was begun by independent external auditors.
B. Third Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1361-MOR)
5.02      With the Third Agricultural Credit Project, which became effective on
August 11, 1977, the scope of CNCA activities financed under the Project was
enlarged to include medium- and long-term loans to Agrarian Reform
Cooperatives, farmer pre-cooperative groups and small farmers, the latter in
view of the good results obtained by CNCA. The Bank loan of US$35.0 million
was disbursed on schedule. According to PPAR No. 3248 dated December 23,
1980, the Project achieved its objectives in terms of expansion of lending
activity and farmer coverage, and of financing investment having a positive
impact on beneficiaries income (high financial rates of return), employment
creation (about 52,000 man-year of employment were created) and the Moroccan
economy (high economic rates of return). During the Project period, important
institutional improvements were achieved, among which;
(a) the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system to improve
internal and external reporting;
(b) increases in interest rates paid by cooperatives and small farmers
which improved CNCA financial position;
(c) the increase in the number of CRCAs and CLCAs, and in the number of
staff;
(d) improvements in CNCA's training programs; and
(e) increased decentralization of lending decisions to branch level and
the regionalization of lending norms which permitted to take into
account regional agro-economic conditions.
The OED Report pointed out possible improvements in the areas of the
Monitoring and Evaluation System, reporting to the Bank and lending norms for
small farmers. These issues were tackled under the Fourth Credit Project.
C. Fourth Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1704-MOR)
5.03      The Fourth Agricultural Credit Project included all CNCA lending to
individual farmers through Headquarters, CRCAs and CLCAs; to Agrarian Reform
Cooperatives and Pre-cooperatives Associations; and to small and medium scale
agroindustries. Also included was technical assistance to assist CNCA in



-26-
improving its monitoring and evalution system. Excluded fErom the Project were
CNCA short-term lending and medium-term lending to State companies. The
Project was to cover CNCA lending over the period September 1979 to August
1982. Total Project costs were est;imated at US$737.2 mil]Lion equivalent, with
the World Bank Loan of US$70.0 million, a loan from KfW otE the Federal
Republic of Germany of US$50.0 million equivalent and a loan from the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) of about
US$25.0 million equivalent financing 58% of the Project estimated foreign
exchange cost (US$250.0 million). The Loan was fully disbursed on August 25,
1983.
5.04     An analysis of a sample of CNCA loan recipients during appraisal of
the proposed Fifth Credit Project indicated that actual financial and economic
rates of return of on-farm investment financed under the Fourth Project were
generally adequate and close to what was anticipated and that, overall, the
Project has been very successful.  The main problems during irnplementation,
beside the severe drought in 1980/81 which depressed on-farm investments, have
been.
(a) Lending to Agrarian Reform Cooperatives reached only 32% of
projections. The shortfall resulted mainly from MARA's decision to
temporarily suspend the creation of new cooperatives, while taking
stock of the progress and problems of the sector. However, creation
of cooperatives resumed in 1982 (45 against 2 in 1981) and is
expected to continue in the future;
(b)  Lending to agroindustr ies reached only 21% of projections.  Reasons
for low CNCA lending are (i) general recession in Morocco; (ii)
competition from other financing sources; but mostly (iii) lack of
promotion efforts by CNCA itself.  To improve the situation, an
agroindustry department was recently created within CNCA.  Its
staffing is completed and CNCA has outlined a detailed strategy to
rapidly increase its role in the sector (para. 7.12);
(c)  Although interest rates on subloans were raised ito comply with
requirements under the Project,!' they were negative in real terms
and too low to ensure an adequate profitability. As a result, the
real amount of CNCA's port:folio and equity declined substantially;
(d)  The operations of CNCA's }{&E system were suspended in October 1980 by
CNCA's new management as cumbersome and ill-suited to CNCA's real
needs. Moreover, CNCAI did not undertake, contrary to what had been
agreed, the supervision of 5% of CLCA's loans until the end of 1982.
These two measures deprived CNCA from valuable tools to monitor the
efficiency of its credit norms and procedures and credit use at farm
level.
5.05     These issues are dealt wil:h under the proposed Project.
1/ In accordance with the Loan Agreement, CNCA is to increase interest rates
(a) when Government subsidy for CLCA's operations exceeded 30% of CLCA's
total expenses; and (b) to allow for adequate provision for bad and
doubtful debt and general reserves.

VI. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
6.01     The objectives set by the Government for CNCA in the 1981-85
Development Plan are (a) to increase its financing of Moroccan agriculture to
promote the growth of agricultural productivity and rural incomes; (b) to
reach a larger number of farmers, in particular small farmers; (c) to increase
domestic resources mobilization; and (d) to ensure the financial viability of
its operations. The proposed Project would assist CNCA in meeting these
objectives, as well as most of the Moroccan Government's essential national
and sectoral objectives (paras. 2.07 to 2.09).
6.02     With respect to CNCA's institutional development, the Project would
give particular emphasis to:
(a) improving the internal Management Information System (MIS) of CNCA
and establishing a new, streamlined, subloan monitoring system;
(b) adjusting on-lending rates to allow CNCA's operations to generate
sufficient revenues to build up adequate provisions and protect its
equity from monetary erosion;
(c) providing better access to credit for small farmers, through the
expansion of branch network coverage, and the review of credit
policies adopted under the Fez-Karia-Tissa Project;l! and
(d) Increasing domestic resource mobilization, through the expansion of
CNCA banking activities, the renovation of its infrastructure and the
training of its staff.
6.03     With respect to broader national and sectoral objectives, the
proposed Project would play an important role in Government development
strategy;
(a) by financing on-farm investments, it would promote investments with
quick return and low Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR), and
shift a relatively larger share of investments in agriculture to the
private sector;
(b)  because the bulk of on-farm investments would be undertaken in
rainfed areas, it would promote Government objectives of
self-sufficiency in foodstuffs and improved living standards in rural
areas insofar as (i) the rainfed sector produces 85% of cereals, all
the pulses and 95% of red meat; and (ii) 75% of the rural population
live in rainfed areas; and
(c) by allowing CNCA to rely on profits from operations to build up its
equity, it would eliminate the need for Government operating
subsidies and share capital contributions, thereby lessening the
burden on national budgetary resources.

B. Description
6.04     The Project would be implemented by CNCA and include.
(a)  a Credit Component to finance (i) on-farm investments undertaken by
private farmers and Agrarian Reform Cooperatives; and (ii)
investments in small- and medium-scale agroindustries; and
(b)  an Institution Development Component including (i) investments by
CNCA to expand and renovate its rural branch network; (ii) the
setting-up of an improved MIS and of a new loan monitoring system;
(iii) the definition and implementation of a medium-term strategy for
the development of CNCA's banking activities; and (iv) the
implementation of an expanded training program for CNCA's staff.
The Project would not incLude CNCA's short-term lending, or medium-term
lending to State enterprises. It would be implemented during the period
September 1, 1983 to August 31, 1986.  The paragraphs below present a detailed
description of the Project components.
Credit Component
6.05     Lending to Small Farmers.  This component would finance about 510,000
subloans for on-farm investments by small farmers, clients of CLCAs (para.
4.09). Investments would mainly consist of livestock, stables, draft animals,
wells and pumps, land improvement and small equipment. The cost of the
component (US$262.3 million) would represent some 44% of the estimated total
Project cost (US$601.9 million:).
6.06     Lending to Agrar-ian Reform Cooperatives.  This component would
finance investments undertaken by the Agrarian Reform Cooperatives in farm
mechanization and transport equipment, livestock, stables, plantations, draft
animals, wells and irrigat:ion equipment and small implements. About 5% of
total cost the Project cost would be in this component (US$28.1 million).
6.07     Lending to Medium and Large Farmers.  This component would finance
investments undertaken by medium and large farmers, clients of CRCAs or CNCA
headquarters (para. 4.07). About 70,000 subloans would finance investments in
livestock, agricultural machinery, stables, transport equipment, wells and
irrigation equipment, plantations, draft animals and land improvement.  In
addition, CNCA would finance sugar cane plantation establishment and
maintenance undertaken mostly by small-holders in large irrigation perimeters
under the supervision of ORMVAs.  The cost of the component (US$276.0 million)
would represent 46% of total Project cost.
6.08     Lending to Agroinduslries.  This component would finance investments
(including initial working capital requirements) in small- and medium-scale,
labor-intensive agroindustries. The main subsectors to benefit would be fruit
and vegetable processing and packing; olive oil processing; milk processing;
animal feed; flour milling; bakeries; meat processing; poultry farming; and
cold storage. About 4% of tot:al the Project cost woluld be in this component
(US$26.2 million).



-29-
Institution Development Component
6.09      CNCA Rural Branch Network.  The component would finance the
construction and rehabilitation of CNCA's branches to help improve physical
access of farmers to credit and assist CNCA in its deposit mobilization
drive. The cost of this component would be US$7.7 million or 1% of total
Project cost.
6.10      Institutional Development.  The component would (a) finance
electronic data processing (EDP) equipment for about 15 CRCAs to decentralize
the bulk of accounting operations; and (b) provide a total of 55 man-months of
technical assistance to CNCA to improve its MIS (para. 7.05), define a deposit
mobilization strategy (para. 7.02), set up a Monitoring and Evaluation system
(para. 7.16), and define a staff training program (para. 7.08). The cost of
this component would be US$1.6 million.
C. Project Cost Estimates
6.11      Total Project costs are estimated at DH 4,901.8 million (US$601.9
million) of which DH 1,555.1 million (US$l90.9 million), or 32%, would be in
foreign exchange. Cost estimates include an estimated DH 485.0 million of
taxes and duties (10% of total Project costs) on goods and services. Base
costs are estimated in September 1983 prices. The credit component of the
Project is essentially a line of credit to help financing a program defined in
financial terms and, although physical investment targets have been crudely
estimated, without a precisely defined physical content. Therefore, only
price contingency allowances have been calculated separately for the credit
component. For the Institutional Development Component, contingency
allowances have been calculated separately. Physical contingencies have been
estimated at 15% for CNCA physical infrastructure development and 10% for
technical assistance. It is estimated that the purchasing power parity
between the two currencies would be maintained over the disbursement period.
Accordingly, when the cost of the Project is expressed in US dollars, price
contingencies have been calculated by converting base costs in US$ dollars at
the exchange rate prevailing at the estimating date and applying expected
international inflation ratesl/ to both foreign and local costs. When the
cost of the Project is expressed in local currency, price contingencies have
been calculated by applying the expected local inflation rate to both foreign
and local currency elements of cost estimates. The average base cost of
consultant services has been estimated at US$10,000 per man-month (including
travel and subsistence). Details of Project costs are presented in Annexe 4
and summarized below.

6.13      A Bank loan of US$115.4 million would be made to CNCA to finance its
lending operations (US$110.0 million), the development of its physical
infrastructure (US$3.9 million), EDP equipment and technical assistance
(US$1.2 million) and a front-end fee of about US$300,000, equivalent to 0.25%
of the amount of the loan. The Government would guarantee the debt service of
the Loan and bear the foreign exchange risk. The loan would be for a period
of 17 years including a four-year grace period, at an interest rate determined
according to Bank's variable rate policy.
6.14      Sub-borrowers would finance about 23% of total on-farm investment
costs. The Government would provide investment subsidies amounting to about
7% of total cost of on-farm investments. The balance of US$414.0 million
would be provided by CNCA subloans. Resources to finance these subloans would
come from part of the Bank loan to CNCA (US$110.0 million), a loan from FADES
of US$26.0 million equivalent, a loan from ADB of US$32.0 million equivalent,
two loans from KfW totalling US$24.0 million equivalent, and from CNCA's own
resources (US$222.0 million equivalent). Government has given assurances that
it would provide or cause CNCA to be provided with any additional resources
required for CNCA's operations. The signing by CNCA of the ADB and first KfW



-32-
Loan Agreements and the receipt of satisfactory evidence that requests have
been made by the Moroccan Government for the FADES and second KfW loans would
be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan to CNCA. The table below

loans, as well as their contribution to each category of CNCA's sublending.

Cofinanciers' total contributions to the Credit Component (US$192.0 million
equivalent) would finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost of investments
financed by CNCA subloans (59% for the Bank Loan). The Bank loan would also
finance 50% of the total cost of CNCA's infrastructure development (100% of
foreign exchange costs and about 20% of local costs) and 100% of the foreign
exchange cost of EDP equipment and technical assistance! to CNCA.
E. Procurement
6.15      Investments Financed by CNCA's Subloans.  The range of goods to be
financed under the Project for on-farm investments is varied and would not be
suitable for bulk procurement. There are private dealers in Morocco who sell
and service a large variety of tractor makes and other farm equipment.
Competition is keen and prices competitive. Sub-borrowers would therefore
purchase agricultural machinery of their choice through existing local
channels. As in the case of other Bank-financed DFC projects in Morocco,l/
procurement for the agroindustry component would also be undertaken through
existing local channels and according to normal commercial practices in
Morocco where the inherent self-interest of entrepreneurs has led to almost
universal competitive bidding or shopping.
6.16      CNCA Infrastructure.  Contracts for the purchaLse of electronic data
processing equipment for CNCA's Management Information System (valued at a
total of US$1.0 million) would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines. Civil works for
the construction or rehabilitation of CNCA's branches would be scattered all
over the country and executed through small contracts (average unit cost of
1/  Eighth and Ninth BNDE Projects (Loans 1428-MOR and 2037-MOR).



-33-
about $0.3 million). These works, valued in total at about US$7.7 million,
would not be of interest to foreign contractors and would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally (LCB) in accordance with
procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. Sufficient construction firms
are established in Morocco to ensure competitive prices under LCB procedures.
6.17      Technical Assistance.  Contracts for 55 man-months of technical
assistance to CNCA, of a total value of US$0.6 million, would be awarded in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for the use of consultants issued in August
1981.
6.18      Contract Review.  Bidding packages for works estimated to cost over
US$300,000 equivalent or more each would be subject to the Bank's prior
approval. Prior Bank approval would also apply to the first two contracts for
civil works regardless of cost and purchase of computer equipment. This would
represent prior review by the Bank of about 83% of total contract value. The
other contracts would be subject to random post-review by the Bank after
contract award. Assurances to this effect were obtained from CNCA.
F. Disbursement
6.19     The commitment period for the Bank loan would be three years
(September 1, 1983-August 31, 1986), with eligible CNCA's lending and
expenditures during the period September 1, 198311 to Loan Signing being
eligible for retroactive financing (up to a total amount of US$11.0 million).
The proposed Bank loan would finance;

6.20     The Bank would finance CNCA's lending operations against certified
statements of expenditure.  Documentation for these staltements of expenditure
would be retained by CNCA for review by supervision missions and the external
auditors (para. 7.19). Prior BarLk review and approval would be required for
agroindustrial sub-projects having a total cost of DH 5.0 million or above
(para. 7.11). Disbursements for physical infrastructure and technical
assistance would be made on receipt of full standard documentation. An
estimated schedule for disbursements for the Bank loan to CNCA is detailed in
Annex 5, and summarized below.
FY1984   FY1985   FY1986   FY1987   FY1988

Cumulative                10.0      38.0       78.0    113.0    115.4
The loan is expected to be fully committed by August 31, 1986 and fully
disbursed by August 31, 1987.  The schedule of disbursernents is based on the
phasing of CNCA's lending program and is consistent with the disbursement
experience under the previous four Agricultural Credit P?rojects in Morocco.
VII. PRtOJECT IMPLEMENTATION
7.01     To reach the objectives assigned by the Government (para. 6.01),
which would also be the main objectives of the proposed Project, CNCA would
undertake a number of inter-relat:ed actions requiring careful medium-term
planning including: (a) the development of its banking activities; (b) the
extension and rehabilitation of i-ts physical infrastruciture; (c) the overhaul
of its Management Information System (MIS); and (d) the training of its staff.
Development of Banking Activities
7.02     During the Project period, CNCA would implement a program to increase
its deposit mobilization efforts and solve some of its institutional
weaknesses in this respect. CNCA would:
(a)  open new branches offering banking services (8 CRCAs and 11 CLCAs)
and introduce these services in existing branches located in rural
areas which are already relatively well integrated into the monetized
economy;
(b)  step up the promotion of its savings passbook l("carnet vert") in less
developed areas to familiarize small farmers with the use of
financing saving instruments;
(c) open banking outlets in important urban centers to capture urban
savings;



-35-
(d) rehabilitate many of its existing branches to improve their physical
appearance and facilitate banking operations;
(e) implement training programs to initiate branch staff to banking
techniques; and
(f) offer interest rates on its deposits competitive with those offered
by other banking institutions in Morocco.
CNCA has prepared the outline of a medium-term development plan for its
banking activities and a detailed plan would be submitted to the Bank before
March 31, 1985. About 4 man-months of consultant services would be provided
under the Project to assist CNCA with the preparation of this plan. Terms of
reference for the preparation of the banking activities development plan are
presented in Annex 8.
Physical Infrastructure
7.03     During the Project period, CNCA would open 8 new CRCAs and 11 new
CLCAs in areas where there is a high concentration of potential clients
currently without easy access to CNCA's branches.  CNCA has already prepared
(a) its construction and renovation program for the entire Project period,
with phasing of activities and estimated costs; and (b) the detailed program
to be executed during the first year of the Project. To promote its banking
activities, new buildings would be constructed for about 17 existing branches,
and the facilities of 14 others would be renovated. CNCA employs a full-time
architect and would be responsible for the preparation of tender documents and
supervision of construction. In addition, CNCA would purchase 18 prefabricated
units for its CLCA operations in remote areas, where the level of lending does
not justify, at present, permanent buildings. Detailed design of these units
is satisfactory. Each unit would include accommodation for CLCA staff, as
adequate accommodation is usually not available in these villages.
Management Information System
7.04     The current accounting system of CNCA is no longer adapted to CNCA's
size or objectives. It is based mostly on manual bookkeeping operations at
branch level, requires multiple checking, entails delays in the processing of
consolidated accounts at central level and makes control and inspection of
branches difficult. CNCA's current computer system is also outdated and not
suited to CNCA planned development and objectives. Moreover, the computer
hardware is old, unreliable and is starting to experience more and more
frequent breakdowns. CNCA management has decided to overhaul its entire
Management Information System. The first phase of this overhaul is already
being implemented;
(a) CNCA is revising its accounting system to adopt Morocco's new "Plan
comptable bancaire." The switch to the new system should be
completed by end-1983; and
(b) as a bridging arrangement before a new computer system is defined,
CNCA has decided to replace its aging central computer hardware by
similar but more powerful equipment, under leasing arrangements.



-36-
7.05     The second phase would be undertaken under the Project and would aim
at setting up within CNCA an efficient MIS. It would involve:
(a)  a review of CNCA's current accounting system, aimed at the
streamlining of procedures, in particular at branch level;
(b)  the development of an elfficient electronic data processing system
(EDPS) for provision of information needed for management
decision-making;
(c)  the introduction of medium-term management planning and budgeting for
each of CNCA functional units; and
(d)  the establishment within CNCA of an Internal Management Control Unit
("cellule de contr8le de gestion"), under the direct supervision of
CNCA's Director General and responsible for the planning/budgeting
process and the monitoring of performance.
Planning and implementation cf this program would be undertaken by CNCA with
the assistance of external consultants, and would require about three years to
complete and about 45 man-months of consultant services. Funds would be
provided under the Project for that purpose.  The proposed terms of reference
for the various elements of the program are presented in Annex 8.
7.06     CNCA has already prepare!d the prefeasibility sltudy outlining the
steps and phasing of the setting-up of such a MIS.  Assurances have been
obtained that CNCA would;
(a)  recruit before March 31, 1984 the consultants necessary to review its
current accounting system and design an efficient EDPS (para. 7.05(a)
and (b));
(b)  submit to the Bank before December 31, 1984, a detailed feasibility
study and implementation schedule for the setting-up of the new EDPS;
and
(c)  create the proposed internal management control unit for effective
planning, budgeting and internal monitoring mechanism before December
31, 1984.
Staff and Staff Training
7.07     Because of the projected growth of lending and deposit activities,
CNCA staff is expected to increase from 1,820 in 1981/82 up to around 2,400 in
1986. CNCA would not have any di'fficulty in recruiting the necessary
additional staff. Staff salaries have been recently increased and are now
competitive with other banking institutions for low and middle level staff.
They are still substantially lower for higher management staff. However, the
approval of its new statutes wouLd allow CNCA to offer fully competitive
salaries for high quality higher management staff. Asslarances were obtained
negotiations that CNCA would maintain a compensation and incentive system
fully competitive with that of comparable institutions.



-3 7-
7.08     CNCA management has already defined priority areas for staff training
activities (accounting, inspection). A new Training Department has been
created and is being staffed. CNCA has already prepared the program for its
future training activities. It remains however to design the detailed content
of these activities. The Project would provide about four man-months of
consultant services to assist CNCA in planning and implementing its new
training program. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that;
(a) the consultants would be recruited before June 30, 1984; and
(b) CNCA would furnish the Bank with a recommended training program
before December 31, 1984, and thereafter implement the program.
Lending Policies and Procedures
7.09     Existing lending procedures are generally adequate and would be
maintained except for those concerning subloans for on-farm mechanization. To
promote on-farm mechanization, CNCA recently lengthened maximum loan repayment
periods from 7 to 10 years for tractors and from 10 to 12 years for combine
harvesters. However, the current average life of tractors in Morocco is about
seven years and only 20% of existing tractors are more than 10 years old.
CNCA's new maximum repayment period therefore exceeds the life expectancy of
mechanical equipment under current Moroccan conditions. Assurances have been
obtained that maximum loan repayment periods would not exceed 7 years for
tractors and 10 years for four-wheel drive and crawler tractors and for
combine harvesters.
7.10     The impact of new policies in the Fez-Karia-Tissa and 0ulmes Rommani
Project regions would be analyzed under the proposed Project (para. 7.17).
Assurances have been obtained that CNCA would undertake, before December 31,
1985, a review of its lending policies to determine the advisability of
(a) regionalizing lending norms; and (b) extending the Fez-Karia-Tissa/
Oulmes-Rommani small farmers credit policies (para. 4.10) to other regions of
Morocco.
Agroindustrial Lending
7.11     Project lending to agroindustry would be oriented toward small- and
medium-scale agroindustries processing Moroccan agricultural products. The
component is intended to provide outlets for agricultural production, to give
incentives to primary producers to form marketing and processing enterprises
and thus capture an increased portion of value added, and to create employment
in rural areas. To achieve these objectives, the following criteria would be
adopted under the Project:
(a) agroindustrial investments would conform with the definition of small
and medium enterprises adopted under the Industrial Investment Code
dated January 17, 1983 (investment in equipment alone of less than
DH 5.0 million for new enterprises);>/
1/ This limit roughly corresponds to total investments of about DH 10.0-13.0
million (US$1.2-1.6 million) when land, buildings and working capital are
included.



-38-
(b)  sub-borrowers would be re!quired to have adequate input supply and
marketing plans as well cls a satisfactory administrative and
financial structure for t:heir enterprise, and the investments would
have to be technically arLd financially viable; and
(c) subprojects would be just:ified in terms of their economic return to
the country, with a minimum economic rate of return of 12%.
A free limit of DH 5.0 million would be established for total investment costs
above which CNCA's subloans would require prior approval by the Bank. In
addition, the first subloan approved by CNCA in each subsector (para. 6.08)
would be submitted to the Bank for approval to permit early discussion and
clarification of investment evaluation criteria.
7.12      CNCA's strategy to promolte agroindustrial lending operations is based
on four main components:
(a) promotional campaign of CNCA activities (brochures, radio and TV
program);
(b) technical assistance to entrepreneurs (legal, financial and
technical);
(c)  cooperation with the main institutions concerned with agroindustries
in Morocco; and
(d) gradual decentralization of agroindustrial lending activities.
This strategy, introduced in January 1983, has already allowed CNCA to
increase substantially its agroindustrial lending.!/  CNCA has also agreed
to select a pilot region with a sizeable but still untapped potential for
agroindustrial development whesre it would open, before December 31, 1984, a
representation of its central agroindustrial department, with staffing
satisfactory to the Bank, as a means of testing more efficient methods to
promote agroindustrial development.
Interest Rates, CNCA Profitability and Financial Objectives
7.13      It is expected that CNCA's cost of financial resources would increase
during the period of the Proj(ect, while administrative expenses would decrease
only marginally. As a result, with interest rates on subloans existing at the
time of appraisal, it was projected that CNCA's profitability would decline
further and that the institution would incur net annual losses by FY1985/86.
To protect its financial viability, interest rates on CNCA's loans were
therefore raised by a weighted average of about 2% p.a. in September 1983.
The new rates (Annex 6) range from 7 to 11% p.a. for short-term credit and
from 10.5 to 13% for medium- and long-term credit. They are similar to those
charged by commercial banks and the industrial development bank for similar
loans and are positive in real terms. To further protect CNCA's financial
1/  Subloans to agroindustries reached DH 19.0 million in the first 9 months
of FY82/83 against DH 7.0 million during the same period of FY81/82.



-39-
viability, assurances have been obtained that the following measures would be
taken under the Project;
(a)  Before June 30 in each fiscal year, starting in its 1984 fiscal year,
CNCA would review annually the adequacy of its interest rates and/or
fees on all its loans, and would take the appropriate measures to
achieve the following objectives: (i) the weighted average of
interest rates on CNCA's loans is positive in real terms; and
(ii) CNCA's net annual profits are sufficient to protect the real
value of its equity and represent a minimum return of 10% on its
equity in 1984/85 and 12% thereafter; and
(b)  CNCA would maintain separate accounts for its CLCA operations and
take the appropriate measures to achieve, at latest during its
FY84/85 and maintain thereafter, annual gross revenues from its CLCA
operations sufficient to at least (i) cover all its operating,
financial and administrative expenses; and (ii) make adequate
provisions against bad and doubtful loans made by CLCAs.
7.14     To assist CNCA in maintaining a prudent financial structure and
liquidity position, assurances were also obtained that:
(a)  CNCA medium- and long-term debt (including deposits over 12 months)
would not exceed six times its equityl/; and
(b)  CNCA's current assets would equal at least 120% of its current
liabilities.
CNCA had no difficulty in satisfying similar requirements under the Fourth
Credit Project and no difficulty is foreseen under the proposed Project.
Monitoring and Evaluation
7.15     The monitoring and evaluation system established by CNCA under the
Third Agricultural Credit Project was mainly designed to assess the impact of
CNCA lending on agricultural production, input use, employment and farm
income. The system was suspended in 1980 because of problems in its
implementation, including lack of representativity of the sample, excessive
information collected and insufficient analytical and data processing capacity
of CNCA. To be efficient, such a monitoring and evaluation system of farm
level economic parameters should be based on a large, representative sample
and operated by a well equipped and properly trained team. A sector-wide
monitoring and evaluation system is being set up for that purpose at the
Ministry of Agriculture to serve all agricultural projects, including credit
projects. It is anticipated that, in the future, it will be used as a
planning tool in testing government policies on representative farms and to
monitor the financial and economic viability of on-farm investments. CNCA's
M&E system should not duplicate MARA's.
1/ At present, CNCA's Debt/Equity Ratio is 2.6. It is, however, projected
that it would reach 4.1 by the end of FY1985-86 (para. 8.07).



-40-
7.16     Under the Project, CNCA would set up an improved subloan monitoring
system aimed at:
(a)  better characterization of clients of CRCAs and CLCAs through the
collection, during subloan application, of data on a selected number
of parameters on applicants. Most of the information needed is
already collected, but remains at branch level.  Under the Project,
it would be collected in a standardized form, then processed and
analyzed at the central level;
(b) improved supervision of subloan utilization. Every CRCA and CLCA
would supervise, through detailed field enquiries, at least 5% of its
medium- and long-term borrowers. Reports on these enquiries would be
sent to headquarters. The control of subloan supervision by branches
would be an integral part of branch inspection; and
(c)  investigating reasons for default in subloan repayment.
Such a system would provide CNCA management with an adeq[uate feedback from the
field about the effectiveness of its credit norms and policies. It would also
serve as an on-going monitoring of the proposed Project. Assurances have been
obtained that the new system, which is satisfactory to the Bank, would be set
up and operational in a pilot region before March 31, 1985. It would
subsequently be introduced nationwide. Funds would be provided under the
Project to finance two man-months of consultant services to assist CNCA in
setting up the proposed monitoring system.
7.17      In addition, CNCA would undertake special surveys of importance for
CNCA management. In particular, CNCA would carry out, in collaboration of
MARA' s services, an in-depth review of the impact of the new credit policies
introduced in the Fez-Karia-Tissa region (paras. 4.10 and 7.10).
Reporting
7.18     Understandings were reached during negotiations that CNCA would
provide (a) semi-annual reports to the Bank, within two months of the end of
each semester, in a format discussed during negotiations and including
disbursement data by purpose and category of beneficiary, loan recovery data,
financial situation, liquidity position, profitability, changes in lending
policies and procedures; and (b) CNCA would submit to the Bank annual reports
on the operations of its subloan monitoring system. Assurances have been
obtained during negotiations that CNCA would prepare and submit to the Bank a
project completion report not later than six months after the closing date.
A. Accounts and Audit
7.19     CNCA has a reliable and satisfactory accounting system.  CNCA
operations and financial statements have been in the past and would continue
under the Project to be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank. Statements of expenditures sent to the Bank f or disbursements under
Bank loans would be audited by the independent auditors to ensure that actual



-41-
CNCA disbursements under the Project are consistent with statements of
expenditures submitted to the Bank. Audit reports of adequate standard have
been received by the Bank for previous loans. The auditor's annual report and
audit of statements of expenditures would be sent to the Bank within six
months of the end of each CNCA fiscal year.
VIII. PRODUCTION, MARKETS, FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Production Generated by the Project
8.01      The Project would result in substantial incremental production.
However, estimates of this incremental production are subject to considerable
errors since (a) there are many cropping patterns that farmers may implement;
and (b) any price and subsidy shifts would induce changes in cropping
patterns. To give an order of magnitude of this incremental production,
estimates were derived from farm budget analysis and compared with current
production in Morocco:
Average                 Annual
Production      Incremental Production
Product               1978/1982          at Full Development
% of Current
('000 t)        ('000 t)  Production
Cereals                     4,900.0          176.2          4.0
Pulses                         220.0          16.2          7.0

Meat                           290.0          27.8         10.0
Source: MARA and mission estimates.
Production would increase through changed cropping patterns and increased
yields resulting from Project investments. Estimates of the quantities of the
assets financed under the Project are presented in Annex 2. The major part of
the project production would be used to satisfy domestic demand for food,
except for some pulses, fruit and vegetables which may be exported.
Projections of domestic supply and demand for agricultural products indicate,
for the medium- and long-term, a continuation of Morocco's current deficit in
agricultural commodities. Therefore, the incremental production generated by
the Project would easily be absorbed by the domestic market.



-42-
B. Markets and Prices
Marketing of Agricultural Products
8.02     Morocco's marketing system for agricultural products is relatively
free, although marketing arrangements vary by commodity. With the exception
of industrial crops (sugar beet, sugar cane and cotton), milk and a small part
of cereals, production is sold through a network of private intermediaries.
This network is relatively efficient and can handle the incremental production
generated by the Project.  Cereals can be sold by farmers to Government-
supported outlets (SCAMs/CMAs) at specified prices. Industrial crops are
grown on contract basis and sold to state-controlled processing plants.
Livestock is sold mostly to local butchers or shipped to municipal
slaughterhouses. Milk is sold to private operators for local consumption or
to cooperatives for further processing and distribution.
Distribution of Agricultural Inputs
8.03     Apart from phosphates, fertilizers are imported andl processed by
FERTIMA (Societe Marocaine des Fertilisants). FERTIMA dlistributes fertilizers
through its network of depots and through MARA's "Centres de Travaux" (CTs),
and "Centres de Mise en Valeur" (CMVs).  Fertilizers are also distributed by
licensed dealers and, in small quantities, by private traders on local
markets. Pesticides are imported and sold by private dealers and traders.
High-Yielding Variety (HVY) cereal seeds are sold exclusively by SONACOS
(Societe Nationale de Commercialisation des Semences) through the CTs and
CMVs. The main constraint to increased use, thus far, has been insufficient
supply of HYV seeds.  At present, the CTs and CMVs provide a few of the
smaller farmers with contract machine services for ploughing, cover cropping,
harvesting and hay-baling. It is, however, the private sector which provides
the bulk of contract machine services, with large farmers renting the spare
capacity of tractors and equipment to smaller farmers. Agricultural machinery
can be purchased from an extensive and competitive network of private dealers
which also provide satisfactory spare parts and maintenance services for the
most common tractor makes. Pure bred livestock and planting material for
fruit-tree plantations are sold mostly by government outlets. Local livestock
and draft animals are purchased at the local markets.
Prices
8.04     Farmgate prices have been collected in the field during appraisal and
are presented in the implementation volume of this report (Annex 15).
Producer prices for meat, milk and most industrial crops are above border
prices. For cereals, current Government's support prices are also above world
prices. However, farmgate prices fluctuate around the official support
prices, dropping to about 75% of the latter during harvest period for small
farmers not able to deliver their production to official outlets and selling
it to private traders on their farms. Despite the lack of packaging and
marketing cooperatives, which has resulted in a dependence of producers on
intermediaries and a downward pressure on prices, the profitability of fruit
and vegetable production is high and is expected to remain so. After
temporarily collapsing during the 1980/81 drought, farmgate meat prices are
now back to satisfactory levels. The nominal and effective protection
coefficients for industrial crops and dairy production are consistently above
1.0. Following recent increases in their support price, this is also the case
for rainfed cereal production.



-43-
8.05     Prices of inputs are generally subsidized.  The subsidy to individual
users of HYV seeds varies from 20% for wheat to 35% for forage and barley.
Farmgate prices of fertilizers are currently substantially below border price
equivalents, with a subsidy provided directly to the State-enterprises
producing or importing fertilizers, rather than to farmers at the local
level. Following the recommendations of a Bank study on Morocco's Fertilizer
Sector, the Government recently increased fertilizer prices by more than 30%.
Such increase should not discourage fertilizer use and will considerably
reduce current subsidy costs to the Government. The Agricultural Investment
Code provides the basis for Government subsidies for on-farm investments,
including for the purchase of tractors and implements (10% of list price),
draft animals and implements (50%), pure bred livestock (25%), construction of
livestock shelter (20%), land improvement (40%) and soil conservation works
(40%).
C. Financial Analysis
Illustrative Farm Investment Models
8.06     In order to quantify financial costs and benefits of the proposed
Project to participating farmers, farm models and budgets have been developed
for each major type of on-farm investment. The 11 models chosen represent the
typical farm sizes and farming systems found in various regions of Morocco and
give a good indication of the probable average financial rates of return of
Project's on-farm investments. Analysis of proposed on-farm investments was
based on data collected at farm level on actual investments financed by CNCA
during the 1977-1982 period and resulting farm development. The financial
rates of return (FRR) of representative investments are summarized below,
along with the result of the sensitivity analysis of FRRs to farmers'
resources:

These results suggest that the incentives to undertake envisaged on-farm
investments, under current conditions, are high. Farmers would have no
difficulty in repaying the subloans.
Financial Implication for CNCA
8.07     Projected balance sheets and income statements for years 1981/82 to
1985/86 are shown in Annex 7. CNCA's total assets would increase by 66% over
the period of the Project, up to DH 5,640.0 million (current terms). CNCA's
medium- and long-term portfolio would increase by 90% over the period (a 24%
p.a. rate of growth) to reach DH 2,145 million by the end of FY85/86, or 38%
of total assets.  The table below presents the projected evolution of CNCA's
major financial structure and performance indicators over the period.
1981/82   1982/83   1983/84   1984/85   1985/86

Net Profit/Total Assets (%)         0.8        1.1       1.2        1.4       1.4
CNCA would preserve a satisfactory liquidity position and financial structure
throughout the project period. CNCA's net worth would increase from DH 365
million up to DH 617 million as of August 31, 1986 through increased CNCA
profitability and retained earnings due to an increase in interest rates.
Income from loans would increase from 8.8% of average loan portfolio in
1981/82 to 10.6% in 1985/86.  As a result, annual net profits would increase
steadily over the period, from 5.5% to 12% of CNCA's equity and from 0.8% to
1.4% of total assets.
8.08     The projected specific f'inancial impact of the Project on CNCAId/ is
presented in the table next page. The main assumptions for the projections
are: (a) because the maturities of external Project cofinanciers' loans to
CNCA are considerably longer than the average maturity of CNCA's subloans to
its sub-borrowers, there is a positive float which can be reinvested by CNCA;
and (b) the net return on this positive float is equal to CNCA's average
return on total banking assets. Under these assumptions, the table below
shows that, during the 17-year pe!riod, CNCA would cover its operating costs
and accumulate net retained earnings of about DH 330.0 maillion. The
discounted (12%) net cash flow of' the Project has a Net Present Value of
DH 490 million. Moreover, the calculations do not take into account the
positive effect on CNCA's profitability and net worth generated by the
increase, under the Project, of interest rates on other CNCA loans, not
1/ Excluding CNCA's lending not financed under the Project such as short-term
lending and medium- and long-term loans to State enterprises.



-45-
financed under the proposed Project.!1 CNCA's participation in the Project
is therefore financially justified.
8.09     Projections of CNCA's overall sources and uses of funds2/ during
the Project period are presented in Annex 7. With the recommended interest
rates on subloans and increased efforts to mobilize domestic savings, CNCA's
structural resource gap over the period would be about DH 1,480 million.
After the contributions of Project's cofinanciers (US$l97.1 million or
DH 1,576 million), this gap would be eliminated.
Financial Implications for Government
8.10     The credit component would have various implications for Government
finances. It is estimated that, for the Project as a whole, Government
investment subsidies would amount to DH 350.6 million or about 7.3% of total
cost of Project on-farm investments and 7.0% of total Project cost. Import
duties and other taxes on farm assets would, however, amount to an estimated
DH 464.4 million and therefore more than cover the subsidy cost. The
allocation of subsidies and taxes between subloan beneficiaries is presented
in Annex 3 and summarized below.
Investment Subsidies           Taxes
Investment           % of Invest-           % of Invest.

Taxes would about equal government subsidies for small farmers, represent
around 50% of subsidies received by cooperatives and largely exceed subsidies
granted to medium and large farmers, for total net proceeds to the Government
from the Credit Component of the Project of about DH 114 million.
1/ An increase of 1% p.a. of interest rates on short-term loans alone would
yield estimated incremental revenues of DH 65.0 million over the three years
of the Project period.

8.11     As a result of CNCA's improved profitability, the Project would also
permit the elimination of government's annual operating subsidies to CNCA for
CLCA's operations (DH 9.6 million in 1980/81) and allow CNCA to increase its
equity base through retained earnings and sustain increased lending programs
without further government contributions to its share capital.
IX. PROJECT BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Benefits
9.01     The main Project benefits would derive from higher agricultural
production. A large part of the incremental production would generate foreign
exchange earnings or savings. The Project would also generate considerable
employment and promote an increase in farm incomes. Substantial but
non-quantifiable Project benefits would result from the financial and
managerial strengthening of CNCA, which is one of the main institutions
supporting the Moroccan Government's agricultural development strategy.
Beneficiaries and Farmers' Income
9.02     The table below indicates the projected number of medium- and
long-term subloans which would be made by CNCA to individual farmers under the
Project:

/a  Excluding subloans made through Agrarian Reform Cooperatives and ORMVAs
/b Farmers having subloans outstanding.
/c Mission's estimates.
Under the Project about 510,000 medium- and long-term subloans would be made
to small farmers through CLCAs, or about 88% of the total number of Project's
subloans (580,000). Small farmers would receive around 46.0% of total amount
of credit to individual farmers. They would therefore obtain less credit per
farm than larger clients, reflecting smaller farm size, productive potential
and debt capacity.In addition to CLCA clients, an estimated 8,500 members of
Agrarian Reform Cooperatives, who are mostly small farmers, would receive



-48-
credit under the Project. Thuls, about 520,000 families (around 3.1 million
people) living around or below Morocco's relative poverty levell/ would be
direct beneficiaries of the Project.
9.03      The effect of the Projeci: on farmers' income would be substantial, as
indicated by the table below.

Employment
9.04      The Project would generate substantial employment opportunities
despite the fact that it would provide investments for mechanization. It is
estimated that 50,600 man-years of additional family labor would be created.
In addition, the Project would generate approximately 3.6 million man-days of
hired labor, or the equivalent of about 28,000 permanent jobs. This compares
with the total rural labor force estimated at 2.8 million man-years in 1980 of
which only 70% is employed. Total average cost per job directly created under
the Project2/ would therefore be about DH 58,700 or US$7,340 (1983 prices).
The Project would also create sizeable indirect employmerLt opportunities
through backward and forward linkages.   These have not been quantified.
1/  Estimated at US$257 in 1979.  CLCA clients and Agrarian Reform Cooperative
members have fiscal incomes cf less than DH 3,000 which corresponds on
average to actual net annual farm incomes of less than DH 12,000 or less
than DH 2,000 (US$250) per person for an average family size of six.
2/ On-farm investments only (USI;566.4 million).



-49-
Mechanization and Employment
9.05     Project investments in tractors and harvesting equipment would reduce
total employment by about 16,000 man-years. It is estimated that investments
in tractors would induce a reduction of 13,000 man-years, mostly in family
labor for land preparation and planting. The most labor-intensive operations
such as the weeding of cereals and the harvesting of grain legumes would
continue to be done by hand. The impact of the Project's investments in
tractors on hired labor would, therefore, be relatively small. Its impact on
tenant displacement is difficult to assess, as there has so far been no study
of this problem in Morocco. However, it is likely to be limited because it is
estimated that, in Morocco, less than 13% of total cultivable is leased.l/
Project investments in harvesting equipment would reduce seasonal employment
by some 3,000 man-years. The main reason for investments in harvesting
equipment is the scarcity of labor at harvest time which has given rise to
very high seasonal labor costs.2/ In Morocco, most of the hired labor for
harvesting is migrant labor. Project investments would, therefore, not
substantially change the production system, nor the level of permanent
employment in agriculture.
B. Economic Analysis
9.06     Economic rates of return (ERR) have been calculated for each typical
investment, but not for the Project as a whole as projections of aggregated
incremental costs and benefits from investments undertaken under the Project
are subject to considerable error for the reasons given in para. 8.01. For
each representative investment, benefits quantified include gross revenues
from sales or consumption of incremental output; costs quantified include all
capital costs, including permanent incremental working capital requirements,
and operating costs. Transfer payments (taxes and subsidies) have been
excluded. All benefits and costs have been expressed in constant 1983 prices.
Economic Prices
9.07     Economic prices for tradeable outputs and inputs have been derived
from current international prices and World Bank's commodity price3/
projections, adjusted for transport, handling and processing in Morocco.
Non-traded inputs (including labor) and outputs have been valued at their
current market prices adjusted by the appropriate conversion factor. Detailed
calculations of economic prices used in the analysis are presented in Annex 16.

2/ Daily wages can reach 4 times the agricultural guaranteed minimum wage;
the cost of harvesting with hired labor and animals for threshing can
reach twice that of combine harvesting.

/a  At an opportunity cost of capital (0CC) of 12%.
/b For definition of farm models, see para. 8.06.
Although the ERRs above conceal large variations between farms depending
principally on agro-economic conditions and farmer management, they indicate
that the typical on-farm investments undertaken under the Project would be
economically, as well as financially, viable. Although t:heir economic rate of
return is satisfactory, mechanization and livestock investments generate a
lower rate of return to Morocco's economy than to farmers because of effective
subsidies provided by the Government on meat and milk prices and agricultural
equipment. Investment in irrigation equipment and fruit--tree plantations
generate higher ERRs than FRRs, suggesting price distortions against
agriculture.  Price distortions facing agriculture prevent an economically
efficient allocation of resources.  The review of the investment incentives
provided under the Agricultural Investment Code (para. 7.20) and the
Agricultural Production Incentive Study, to be carried oult by the Bank in FY84
and FY85, would analyze this issue and provide the basis for recommendations
to, and policy dialogue with, the Government.
1/  By computing their respective switching values, i.e. the variation in the
variable tested which would bring the investment's NP'V to zero for a given
discount rate (chosen as the estimated opportunity cost of capital) or,
alternatively, which would decrease the ERR of the investment below the
chosen discount rate.

C.  Project Risks
9.09      Several risks could affect the outcome of the agricultural credit
component. They are discussed in the conclusions and recommendations of the
OED report on Agricultural Credit Programs.!! As in any agricultural
project, the major risk would be the occurrence of severe climatic conditions
such as the 1980-81 drought, which would reduce crop and livestock output.
Lower yields would in turn reduce farmers' incomes, affect their ability to
repay their loans to CNCA, and induce them to postpone further on-farm
investments. Climatic pattern tends to show that a severe drought occurs one
year out of five. In the farm models used for project analysis, the estimated
average yields take this fact into account, and have been set at conservative
levels. Historically, reduced farmers' ability to repay their loans has not
resulted in losses for CNCA. Subloans have ultimately been repaid. However,
delays in subloan repayment could affect CNCA liquidity. This risk would be
reduced by Government's standing commitment to cover CNCA's temporary
liquidity needs. Farmers' decision to delay further investments would result
in lower than expected CNCA lending and a proportional slowing down of Bank
loan disbursements. A second risk would consist in the possibility of changes
in Government's agricultural policies, reflected in changes in the structure
of prices and subsidies. Such changes could cause some project investments to
become financially unviable.  However, such a major shift is unlikely during
the Project period.
