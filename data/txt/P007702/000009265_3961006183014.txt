MEMORANDUM AND RECOMhMENDATION OF TH1 PRESIDENr OF THE IlRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO:
NACIONAL FINANCIERA, SN.C WrT  THE GUARANTEE OF
E   NT    MEXICAN STATES
FOR A SECOND DECENTRAIZATION AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMT- PROJECT
1.    I submit f  your       the following memoraudum and       daon on a pr-os  
loan to Naonal Financiera, S.N.C (NAFIN) for US$500 million equalent with the guae of
the United Meaxica States.to help finance a Second Decentalization and Regiona Developmen-t
project. The proposed loan wdd be repable at the Bants standard variable rate with a maturity
of 15 years, inluding five years of gVae Te project wwld be imnlemented by the federa
Secwf(a de Desarrollo Soial (SEDESOL), with the participition of the state and municipal
governments of the eight project states.
2.    Background. Ibvr  remains a major problem in Mexico, even as its ecomy continues to
recover ofolowing the macroeconomic crisis of the 1980s. It is esdmated that in 1992, 16 percent of
the nadona population of 84 million were ling in conditions of extreme poverty, with over half of
the extreme poor living in rural areas. Pverty is concentrated in the southern statec: of the eight
project saes, all but one (Zacateca) are located in the southern half of Mexico. Although these
states represent only 32 percent of the national population, they contain 69 percent of the extreme
poor2 and 54 percent of the population without access to water. These eight states also contain 68
percent of Mexico's indigenous population, who mainly live in rural areas and make up a significant
proportion of the rural poor.
3.    Rural poyq bas been aggraated by the low leve! of growth and productivity in the
agriculture sector. Agriculture GDP growth has been very uneven, averagw   -0.3 prce  since
1985, while the productivity of agricultural labor has also remained poor, improving only marginaily
during the last three decades In recent years, agricultural profitability has declined with the removal
of many input and output subsidies combined with the low level of world prices fDr many crops. The
new program of direct income payments to producers (the PROCAMPO program) which will
accompany the phased elimination of the guarteed price supports for basic grains is expected to
provide some relief to small and subsistence farmers. Nevertheless, it is unclear what Impact the
prgram will have on rural povert, as povety alleviation will depend, in part, on whether firmers
are successful in investing this capital in the conversion to higher value crops. Moreover, it is also
uncertain what impact these policy changes wfll have on the demand for rural labor.
4.    The principal poerty alleviation program of the Mexican Government under the Salinas
administration (1988 to present) has been the National Solidarity Program (Solidarity), managed by
SEDESOL. Through Solidarity, the national government is channeling over US$2.2 billion in
matching grants to states and municipalities each year, principally for infrastructre investment (eg.,
water supply, roads, education, electrification, and health) and direct transfer progams to the poor
such as the school scholarship program and inorest-free production loans to poor famers managed by
municipalities and the National Indigenous nstitute. In each sector, Solidarity is used to direct fimds
to the poorest populations, to complement existing sector programs of the federal and state
govermets At their best, Solidarity progams have contributed tD the greater decentralization of

1992 household srvy. A new anlysis of the 1992 data indicas that the peente of the
poor living i rum! areas may be as high as 83 prcnt

-2-
the provision of basic infrastucture and encouraged active community involwment in oeCal
govenmn decision-making and the implementation of imestments.
S.    In addition to Solidarity, Government is taking steps to realign the role of the federal
govermnent and the ftcusof-rural Investment by: (a) reorienting agricultual research, services and
ivemn t to place higher priority on rainfed agriculture; (b) increasing decentralization of
gwoernment investments and services, strengthening the participation of state and municipal
government and conmnunities; (c) modifying the fbrmula for distributing federal revenue shariv&
making the per capita distribution more equitable and increasing resources going to poorer saes; and
-(d) increasig-national public expenditures 1br social sector invsm ents in health and education, and
reorienting those sector activities to better target the poor.
6.    Project Objectives. Mhe overal objective of tie project is to 1ncrease access Of rul  poor
and indigenous communities to basic social and economic irastrcure (especially roads, water
supply and schools), and to income-generat  activities and thus alleviate poverty.  he project
would continue efforts initiated under the first Decentralization and Regional Development (DRD)
project to strengthen the participation of poor, rural communities in local government investment
planning and implemenuation and to strngthen the institutional capacity of state and local
governments to support rural development efforts. The specific objectives are to: (a) improve basic
infstructure and support income-generating inmestments in poor rural areas of the eight states; (b)
strentWben instiutional mechanisms and capacity at the federal and state levels to plan, supervise,
monitor, and evaluate rural water supply, rural roads and other rura development strategies with the
participation of municipalities and beneficiary communities; and (c) strengen the capacity of rural
and semi-rural municipalities to finance, plan, implement, and operate rural infrastructue
investens, using appropriate technologies and participation of affected communities.
7.    Project Description. The five project components are:
(a)    Municipal Investment and Institutional Dewelopment (US$737 nillion). This
comnponent would finance small-scale community selected and managed works, for
water supply development, rural roads, school rehabilitation, productive activities, and
other small infrastucue works of priority to rural communities, thrugh
SEDESOUs Municipal Funds and school rehabilitation (Escuela Digna) progms.
The component would also develop the fiscal, administrative and tedhmical capacity of
rural and semi-rural municipalities, through studies, technical assistance, t   and
support for legislative and regulatory reforms at the state level. Individual
infastructure investments in this component would not exceed US$50,000.
Communities would be required to provide 20% of total project cost in cash or kind.
Approximately 54,000 small inestments would be implemented in the eight staes
under the project.
(b)    Rural Water Supply (US$178 million). This component would provide potable
water to small rural localities (between 500 and 5,000 inhabits), by financing
iunestments whose technical complexity and cost make them inappropriate or
ineligible for the Municipal Funds program. The component would also improve the
capacity of state water agencies and municipalities to manage wat supply invesme
and operations and maintenmce efficiendy and effectively. Subprojects would be
selected and contracted by state water agencie*, using established investment selection
criteria and standard parameters for engineering design. The averge watr supply



-3-
sub-project investment would be aproxmatly US$120,000, with V
1,300 ru  water supply systems to be cotucted or rehabiitaed under the project
(c)    Rural Reads Rehabilitt   and Mainteance(S     ilon). Tbis component
wuld fianc the rhabilion and mateance of priority sectios of the ru d
ne*tok, while dewlophig the capacity -of state road agencis and municipalities to do
so efflciently and effdcvely. Rabiitadon investments wod be maaed by sae
road agencies, selected bad on an esblished set of crea, and dsigned according
to st rd            prame    and   t  on averaw   US7,000 pri        .
Municipiies and        t  would have an active role in implemeation, with
_labor intnie works coaced to municipalities through 3ntergoernment
agreement  A mucipal minte    program to cover roads rehabilted would
-lso be finced. - Approimaely 15,60 km ofrural roads would be imprved and
included in a municipal ntenan  progam under the prject.
(d)   hncomreG     ng Component (US$12 millio). Ihis compovat- v.-ld pmvide
technical assistance, trainingt and limited iesment to develop and piloiew
staties to support income-geerat  projects in n- : areas, 'v sagtheing
incomeenerating activities in the Municipal Funds prgram and oy suppordtg the
development of income-generating programs by state agrdultu  agencies in one or
two pilot stae.
(e)    SEDESOL lnttuional Stregthening and Project Coordiudon (US$35 miMon).
SEDESOL's capacity to manage the project-financed progms would be stengtened.
Fiancing would be provided for a program of institutional developm    technical
asistance and traing, contactg of technical expertse required for the supervision
and revw of each component, and continued development of the project ilnrmation
and monitoring system. Annual project audits would also be financed.
8.    Projet Costs and Fhmang. Total project cost .is emated at US$1,095 million (Schedule
A). The proposed loan would provide US$500 million, the fideral and project state governments
US$443 million, and the beneficiary communities the balance of US$152 million. Of the toa project
cost, US$1,082 million involve imNestment and US$13 million incremental recureat cost, for the
nra roads mainteance progm. The proposed loan would finance appr4imately 46 percen Of tota
costs including 100 percent of all instittional development activities (technial assistmce and
trang), 90 percent of equipment costs, and 50 percent of engineering, project coordinaion, and all
inestment costs eucept flr inesments managed by communities (i.e, Municipal Funds, Escuda
Digna, and some water supply subprojects). In the case of communty-managed ivestments,
beneficiaries would contbute 20 percent of subproject costs and the Bank and Government wDUld
each finance 40 perent
9.    lb support the stt-up of instituional development activities and the Municipal Funds
progrm in the twur project stes not included in the fit DRD project, retroactive financing of up to
US$40 million is recommended for eligible technical assistance epdiue and Municipal Funds
invents Incurred after February 1, 1994. Schedule B shows the amount and methods of
procurent and disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule. The timetable of project
processing and the stu of Bank Group operations are gien in Schedules C and D, respectiely. A
map showin the eight project states is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13032-ME
dead Augu  19,194, is being distbud separately.



-4-
10. Project Implementation. At the nationaJ level, the (General Diueztorate fbr Regional
Development Programs of SEDESOL would be responsible for overall project implementation.
Responsibility fbr individual subprojects, -however, would lie with the municipalities and communities
for the Municipal Funds and Escuela Di8na programs and for small watr supply and rural roads
works contracted to them by ste agencies. Responsibility fbr the rural water supply, rural roads,
and income-generatng progms would belong to the state water supply, rural roads, and Wricultute
agencies, respectively. The link between SEDESOL, which provides a 75 percent matching grat to
finance these programs, and the state agencies and municipalities is the state Plannain Secetariat
which chairs the state Planning Commission (COPLADE) and is -responsible for planning all state
imnestment. The Planning Seretaat agrees on an overall budget allocation for Solidarity with
SEDESOL and the alloca.n of Solidarity funds within the over 30 Solidarity programs. lbgether
with the COPLADE, the Planning Secretriat is then responsible for reviewing, approving, and
channelling specific proposals for financing within each program to SEDESOL, and is responsible for
monitoring implementation activities.
11. Within this framework, communities participate in proposing investments for all components,
but are most involved in the development, selection and implementation of the small scale investments
under Municipal Funds and Escuela Digna. 7b develop proposals each year for financing by the
Municipal Funds, each community holds an open assembly to discuss and establish local priorities for
investment. To review and ,rioritize community proposals, the municipality fDrms a special
Municipal Solidarity Council made up of municipal officials, community representatives, and
presidents of the Solidarity Committees established for each inmestment. Once the annual Municipal
Funds investment program has been defined, the Solidarity Committees are advanced fimds necessary
to begin implementation.
12. Project Sustainability. Project investments are likely to be sustainable because: (a)
participation of communities and local gernment in investment selection and financing wodd lead to
greater commitment to local financing and management of operation and maintence; and (b)
investments focus on relatively simple technologies that can be maintaed with minimal expense and
technical expertise. In addition, mechanisms for bottom-up planning and community participation that
have been created and fostered by project components are likely to be continued as an effective means
of ensuring that federal povert. alleviation resources are well utilized. In the future, as sources of
direct revenue are developed for poor municipalities, the model provided by such programs as
Municipal Funds may assist municipalities in effectively programming and utilizing their own
investment funds.
13.   Lessons from Bank Experience. Mexico has a twenty-year history of support to regional
development efforts, many of them supported by Bank loans (integrated Rural Development I, II &
m as well as the current DRD project). Lessons learned from those experiences include: (a) the
importance of integrating poverty targeted investments into normal planning channels in order to
ensure political and institutional support for the effort and bring about sustunability of the efforts; (b)
programs in which communities participate in the selection and implementation of inmestments tend to
be more cost-effective, transparent, and responsive to community needs; (c) the financing of works in
many different sectors, by many different agencies (as occurred in the first DRD project), dilutes
project supervision efforts and reduces its effectiveness; and (d) oranizational arrangements and
incentives at the federal and sme levels continue to contribute to the lack of attention given to rural
areas in spite of project objectives. These four lessons have been take into account in the
development of the Second DRD project in that it will limit its major sector investment components to
financing specific investments in only two sectors (rural water supply and rural roads), and a majority
of project financing will go to inestmets which are selected and implemented by beneficiary



communities. State and municipal govemments will have a central role in planni'ig and implementing
each component, and the project institutionat development activlties -and organizton of intra and
in-stat groups to address rural development issues will assist state governments in r-orienting
their bureaucracies to provide greater assistance to poor, rural areas.
14.   Ratonale ftr Bank hnolvement. lhe proposed project is consistent with the Mexican
-goernmes broad srategies for improving poverty all viation tbrough its Solidarity program, and
with the Baks Country Assistce Stategy approved by the Board on June 9, 1994, which seeks to
expand and imprv programs atacking poverty and to strgthen the roles and capabilities of state
and municipal auhrities in the delivery of services. The first DRD project has provided an
opportunity tD test several approaches to achieving these objectives. The Second D1RD project would
build on tbis experience and seek to further devlop and institutionaliz strategies relating to
communty parction, municipal development, and strengthening of rurl water supply, nual roads
and pilot income-generating progras managed  by states and municipalities.
15. Agreements Reached. During negotiations, agreement were reached: (a) that all project
components would be carried out in accordance with the Project Operational Manual; (b) operational
mauals for the Municipal Funds and Escuela Digna programs and guidelines for the rural water
supply and rural toads components, including subpro3ect eligibility criteria fDr each; (c) list of
candidate roads fbr the rural roads component; (d) promotion by SEDESOL of the transfir of federal
roads rehabilitated under the project to the states' road inventory; (e) institutional development
program fbr each component; (f) model contracts and agreements for direct contracting of
communities and municipalities; (g) structure, role and responsibilities of the inter-state technical
groups (ITGs), municipal support units and municipal presidents working groups; O) staffing of
SEDESOL's central and stae level Project Coordination Units (PCUs); (J) reporting schedules and the
contens of semi-anmnal and annual progress reports, project performance indicators, and *, mid-term
project review; O) annual conduct of a project physical performance evaluation; (k) annual audit of
project accounts; O) conduct of a study of community proement by December 1995; (m)
maintenance of the project informatiok. and monitoring system; and (n) model agreement (anao de
ejecucidn) between SEDESOL and the project states for the implementation of the project.
16.   Conditions of loan effectivene  are  (a) SEDESOL would adopt the final version of the
Project Opational Manual with annexes, as agreed by the Bank (with the exception of the technical
annex for the inoome-generating component); and (b) SEDESOL would provide evidence that the
project Infmation and monitoring system is functioning in the SEDESOL delegation of each project
state and at the central PCU. A condition of disbursement for the income-generating component is
the completion of a Project Operational Manual annex for the component, including implementation
plan and related guidelines and indicators.
17. Project Benefits. Project investments would result in an improved standard of living for
approximately 10 million individuals living in relatively isolated rural aeas, with the improvement of
access roads, water supply, educational and other basic infrastructure. The rural water supply
component inxetments will result in raising access to water of rural population In the eight states
from 48 percent to 63 percent. Of the 50,000 kilometers of earthen, rural roads in the eight states,
29 percent (or 15,600 kIn) will receive spot imprvement and maintenance, resulting in greater access
of approximately 4 million rural dwellers to social services and economic activities. Approximately
10 million individuals are expected to benefit from the estimated 50,000 Municipal Funds and Escuela
Dg8  investments to be implementd during the project. More imporantdy, the project will
strengthen the capacity of municipal government and communities to work together to define and
address priority needs in poor rual areas.



-6-
18.   Eiwronmental Aspects 'Me pwposed project has been rated ZB, as no m;jor
Irne nal issues are foreseen. It would support rhabiliation and maintnan  of eistig ru
inftructure, including rura roads, water supply and schools. Construction of new inastructure is
limited mainly to small scale water supply systems, school buildhigs, and small producdve
enterprises. No new roads would be built under the ptoject and rehabiliation efforts would be
limited to spot impovements.
19.   Ibverty and Proa  ObjeiWve Categories. Progm  of Tlgeted Intevion  Project
invments wiSl be tageed to. the poor rral areas of eight of the poorest states of Mexico.
lugeting to the rural poor will be achieved though: (a) the kinds of projecs finaced (eg., small,
inexpensive projects for wat supply, earthen roads, and school classrooms); (b) implenion by
community groups avidin the selection of in ments not responsive to commity priorities;- (c)
payment of laborers for rurl road rhabilition and maintenance wrks, resulting in employment
genemion for the poor, and (d) distrbution of resources by formula to prwvide greater fundig to
poor rural areas. Indigenous communities and womens groups are to be specifically targeted within
the income-generating component.
20.   Project Risks Possible risk arise from: (a) the relatively weak institutions at stato and
municipal leels, leading to investment decision-making based on intests not conistent with
tecbnical criteria, and to poor technical Input in project design; (b) number of institutions inmlved in
project executon leading to overly heavy supervision burden; and (c) the extent to which genera
criticisms of Solidarity may reflect on the credibility of the project. Tb address these risks, the
project limits investment to techlicaly simple, but highly economic works (eg., spot improvement of
roads, small water supply schemes, etc.) for which simple selection citeria have ben designed and
agreed during project preparation. In addition, targeted programs of technical assistance have been
designed for each project component to stegthen the state line agencies. lb make project
supervision easier and improve the project management, iTOs wwld be formed and would meet
quarterly. In addition, the mnmber of sectors to be supported by the Second DRD project has been
reduced from ten covered in the first DRD project, to four, with strict critia fr subproject
eligibility The computerized monitoring system developed during the first DRD project wold
continue to be upgraded by SEDESOL and used to provide timely analysis of implementa progress
and issues in each state. lb maina  the credibility of the project, the project will use clesr and
rationa sets of subproject selection criteria, and will monitor implementaon closely, analyzing fDr
possible biasing of investments based on other than poverty and efficiency citeria.
21.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply wih the Articles of
Oe Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
