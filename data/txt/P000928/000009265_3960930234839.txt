MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO TE REPUBLIC OF GHANA FOR A
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROH           I7
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development credit
to the Republic of Ghana for US$22 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be for 40 years on standard terms to help finance a national
agricutural research project.
2.    BUground. Virtually all agricultural research in Ghana is undetaken by public
sector agencies. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) was set up in
1968 in order to advise Government and promote and coordinate research efforts, which are
divided amongst several ministries, the universities and parastal organizations such as the
Ghana Cocoa Board. IDA, through the Agricultural Services Rehabilitation Project, has
funded a review of the agricultural research system, undertaken mainly by Ghanaian sciendtsts
and users of research results, with tie assistance of the International Sarvice for National
Agricultural Research. The review identified the main constraints to agricultura research in
Ghana as: (a) the lack of mechanisms for policy formulation and for setting research priorities
that accord with national development objectives; (b) the deterioration of tesearch facilities
due to a shortage of funds over the past 1S years; (c) the inadequate operational funding for
research; and (d) the lack of well developed research/extension linkages. he review showed
that the agricultural research system has the potential to make a substana contribution to the
development of the sector, as there are well established national research institutes to
undertakA commodity and factor research programs, having a reasonable level of autonomy
and a we.. -talified cadre of research staff. On-going and planned improvements to extension
services me.n that their ability to transfer research resuts is being strengthened and action is
being taken to improve supplies of inputs such as fertilizers and seeds. The system is,
therefore, well placed to respond to improvements in research planning and management,
institutional arrangements and physical infrastructure. Proposals for such improvements were
put forward by the review team and discussed at a high-level workshop held in Accra in May,
1990, with the participation of other donors coordinated by Special Program for Afrian
Agriculural Research (SPAAR). Agreement was reached at that workshop on the main
proposals for the future management of the research system and the development of a
National Agricultual Research Plan.
3.    Rnationae for MIA In  mnt. The proposed project would support the sectora
objectives set out in the Country Strategy Paper and in the Medium Term Agricultural
Development Strategy. Thus, it would promote accelerated agricultural growth, through
improvements In the productivity of crops and livestock and through diversification of farmig
systems. Tbis would help to increase agriculture's contribution to mral incomes and
employment, to domestic food supply, to net export earnings, to efficient import substitution
and to government revenues. The proJect would specifically respond to elements of the
Country Strategy by increasing production through technology improvements; by developing
the research system as an essential supporting service to the agricultural sector; by improving
the planning, management and budgetary procedures of the agricultur resch system; by
human resource developmen; and by providing a mechanism to Improve donor coordination.



-2-
The project would be closely linked with the proposed IDA financed Agricultural Sector
Adjustment Credit and the National Extension Project.
4.    EMiect Objeciv. The project would iniiate a long-term process to revitalize
Ghana's agricultural research system, in order to generate improved technologies, thus
contributing to national development objectives and sustainable growth In the agriculur
sector. Emphasis would be given to the developmet of processes and Instutional
arrangements to ensure that research priorities accord with national development priorities, the
needs of farmers and the sustainable use of Ghana's natural resource base. lhe strategy
would be for research to be undertaken with a clear understanding of the existing socio-
economic franework, with particular attention paid to gender-specific tasks and
responsibilities within the farming system. Ihe formulation of a long-term Natonal
Agricultural Research Plan (NARP), support for its implementation and the improvement of
the research management system and research-eension linckages, would be important
objectives of the project. A more pluralistic approach to research would be promoted through
the provision of a Research Grant Fund, available to universities and other co   puic
and private sector agencies. The project would foster the development of lnkges wih
research orgnizations outside Ghana, in particular with the Int na    Agricultur
Research Centers, that would ensure the transfer of relevant technology in an efficient
manner.
S.    Proiect Qagdescrig. nThe project would be implemented over five years and include
five main components: (i) Research M=au=  Delome  which would ipro
maagement systems at nadonal, institute and program levels. It would include the
establishment of a National Agricultural Research Committee (NARC) and its Technical
Secreariat to set research priorities and coordinate the development of a Nationd Agricalture
Resech Plan; (ii) HuR       esur De        which would provie for I-country and
foreip post-graduate and technical training, with an emphasis on twinnn arranement wih
foreign intions to ensure relevance to Ohanaian conditons; (il) M kbtonut
Pacis through the completion or rehabilitation of exstig building, and the supply of
eenti equipment and vehicles to provide institutes with a core capability to undertake
research; (iv) ImprMient of Likr  SnW nPomation Syo  through the establishment of
the Ghana Agricultural Information Network System in resarch institte, university and
Miiry of Agriculture libraries; and (v) Rs2ugh ProgruamI= for the implementation
of the National Agricultural Research Plan and of selet8ed research progms; the
establism  of a Resech Grants Scheme, for use by the Universities and other competent
agencies; and the development of research/extension linages through on-fam  adaptive
research program.
6. The total project cost is estmated at US$29.5 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$19.9 million (67 percent). The costs and financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. The Brit  Overseas Development Administation wil provide
US$1.8 million equivalent, on a grant basis, to finan  technical assi    md training.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are
given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project procesing events and the sts of Bank
Group operations in Ghana are given in Schedules C and D respectively. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 9313-GH, dated April 24, 1991 is being distrbuted separatey.



7.    Agions. Because of the high level of Gbanaian participation in the
preparation and appraisal of this project many important decisions and actions have already
been taken. Outstanding actions that have been agreed are: (i) by project effectv the
National Agricultural Research Committee will be established, together with a Technical
Secretariat headed by a Deputy Director General of CSIR, the Research Grants Board will be
established and the first year training program will have been formulated and agreed with
IDA; (ii) disbursement of funds under the Research Grants Scheme will depend on the
agreement with IDA on criteria for assessing research proposas for grat funding within t
months of project effectiveness. The first four proposals would be reviewed by IDA;
(Wii) Government's incremental contributions would be provided in line with the agreed
finncing plan; (iv) a National Agricultural Reseach Plan reflecting both farmers' needs and
national agricultural development priorities will be prepared and reviewed with IDA within
two years of project effectiveness. This will be paralleled by the development of a Human
Resources Development Plan; (v) changes to the Manaugent Boards of the reseach  stitues
would be introduced six months after project effectiveness and programmed budgeting, with
the use of budgetary norms for common catWories of expenditure within one year; (vi) plans
for rehabilitation of research facilities and for research programs would be prepred for each
institute and agreed with IDA; (vii) a Memorandum of Understanding would be drawn up by
the MOA and the CSIR and signed within three months of project effectiveness, seting out
the services to be provided to the CSIR by the MOA at the Regional Resrch Centers and the
payments for providing these services; and (viii) proposals for twinning aragements between
Gbanaian universities and foreign institutions would be reviewed and agreed wih IDA within
six months of project effectiveness. Other actions relate to the incentives for reseah staff to
respond to farmers' needs, rwucing the number of research stations, improving the ratios of
researchers to support staff, timely preparation of contract documents, compatiblity of
equipment in diffng institutions and requirements for project accting and reporting.
S.    Enirotental Ag _ . IMThe project has a Rating of C as the project wil have no
adverse environmental effects. On the contrary, a fundamental objective of research is the
development of sustainable agricdultural systms suited to differing agro-eological zones,
through appropriate natura resource management.
9.    L       o d         . The project would support a key element of the
Government's strategy fo agricultural development as articulated in the Medium Term
Agricultura Development Strategy, by providing for research in agricultural technology that
would lead to sustained growth in the sector. Tbe project would eue   t Ghana's ptevi
invest_nts in agriculturl research infrastructure and trained manpowe would be fully
utilized. Inprovements to the research management system would lead to the idenification of
research priorities that reflect development objecives and the needs of the farmer. Assured
opertional fnding and rehabilitation of essential research infrstructure would enhance the
quality of research. By facilitating information flows from farmers to researchers and vice
versa, the improved research/extension linkages supported by the project would further
improve the relevance of on-going and planned research programs. The pimary risk facing
the project would be the slowing down of the pace of economic recovery that would affect
Govemment resources that could lead to shortfals ii operational fiuding, but it would be
minimized by the initidal high level of participation by MDA in funding operational costs.
Another risk relates to the effectiveness of mechanisms to ensure that research is responsive to
both development priorities and the needs of farmers. Agreements have been reached on
mechaisms to strengthen researchlextension linkages whilst the IMA financed National



.4-
Extension Project, now under appraisal, would reinforce the linkages between researchers,
extension staff and farmers. Unsatisfactory quality of reseach is one fiurher risk, but this
would be minimized through project support for manpower development and training and
linkages with international research institutes.
10.   Reomendaio. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
