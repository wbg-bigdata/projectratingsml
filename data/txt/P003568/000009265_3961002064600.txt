MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A TIANJIN UMBAN DEmVLOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to the People's Republic of
China for SDR 73.3 million, the equivalent of US$100 million, on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 35 years to help finance the Tianjin Urban
Development and Environment Project. The proceeds of the credit would be
relent to the Tianjin Municipal Government for 15 years, including 5 years of
grace, with interest at 4.5 percent per annum. The beneficiary will bear the
foreign exchange risks.
2.          Background.  Since the early 1980s, after two decades of
stagnation, the cities of China have been undergoing a rapid process of growth
and transformation, paralleling that of the country's economy as a whole. The
industrial growth has led to increased demand for labor and supporting
services, fueling a rapid growth in urban population and infrastructure. It
is estimated that China's urban population has grown by about 5 percent a year
since 1980 and has now reached about 600 million. The large population and
its rising income have resulted in a heavy and growing demand for housing and
urban public services. Reform of the country's economic management has also
involved a transition in the urban management system. Whereas the central
government formerly directed most aspects of local economies, it now limits
its role to setting the broad framework and parameters, devolving to local
governments broad authority to finance, plan, and manage urban development.
3.          Also since the early 1980. the Government has been pursuing an
active environmental protection policy. The policy and legal framework now
well established require environmental improvement plans as part of the
overall development plans of the central and local governments, environmental
assessment and permits for investment projects, and penalties for pollution
discharges beyond certain l1.mits. The Government has established
environmental protection offices in most sector ministries and recently a
separate ministerial agency to coordinate and promote environmental
improvement efforts. Environmental protection bureaus have been established
at all levels of local government, with major responsibilities to set local
standards, implement regulations, and coordinate improvement programs.
4.          Responding to the rising dem nd and the expanded authority placed
on them, the municipal governments have been investing heavily to reverse past
deterioration of urban facilities and the environment. A particularly
successful example has been Tianjin, the third largest city in China with an
urban population of five million. A major port and industrial center for
northern China, Tianjin suffered major devastation in the earthquake of 1976,
which severely damaged its industrial and urban infrastructure. Through
large-scale investments organized by the Tianjin Municipal Government (TMG),
however, the city has recovered remarkably fast, doubling its industrial
production and housing stock over the last decade. The serious pollution of
its air and rivers has also started to abate thanks to renovation of aging
industrial plants, TMG's strong regulatory enforcement, and its active
investment programs to reduce pollution.

5.          Lessons Learned from On-Gogng Bank Group Onerations. Experience
with sector work and four on-going urban and environmental projects in China
highlights the large potential benefits from institutional improvements and,
on the other hand, the need for major efforts to integrate the improvements
with current practices in overall municipal management contexts.
6.          Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Continued high levels of efforts
to improve infrastructure and the environment in Tianjin are called for by
remaining deficiencies and the city's v^i-id industrial growth. As it moves
beyond reconstruction of basic assets, tMg is finding it increasingly
difficult to assign priorities for allocating resources among the diverse and
changing demands of the city. It is limited in this by its traditional system
of infrastructure and environcental management, which relies heavily on static
norms and targets. It therefore needs additional financial resources and,
more importantly, institutional capacity to ensure efficiency, equity, and
sustainability of its policies and expenditures in the dynamic and
decentralized economy. The Association can help TMG to meet these immediate
and long-term challenges, with its expertise and experience in helping to
develop institutional capacities in market as well as mixed economies aimed at
monitoring and responding to actual demands and constraints.
7.          Such assistance would fit well into the focus of the Bank Group's
strategy for assisting China in the urban and environment sectors, on helping
to map a transition to sector management that is efficient, decentralized and
responsive to local conditions and the environment. It would also support the
central government's strategy to encourage market-oriented innovations in
urban and environmental management, especially in large cities at the
forefront of industrial and institutional development. The project also
supports the Bank Group's strategy to introduce improved institutional models
in prominent cities to maximize the demonstration effects.
8.          Proiect Obiectives.  The project aims at the long-term improvement
of Tianjin's urban infrastructure and environment, mainly through increases in
the efficiency and responsiveness of TMG's sector management systems and
public expenditure programs and through cost-effective physical improvements.
Specific objectives are to: (a) Improve infrastructure planning and budgeting;
(b) establish a sustainable and cost-effective mechanism for industrial
pollution control; and (c) reduce deficiencies in urban environment and
transportation and increase the efficiency of the existing assets.
9.          Pro1ect DescriDtion.  The project would include institutional
development and supporting physical investments. Under the infrastructure
planmnit and manaRement component, technical assistance and training will be
provided to improve techniques and procedures for monitoring infrastructure
needs, project planning and evaluation, budgeting and management for the
overall sector. The project will also support technical assistance for key
sub-sectors, to help develop solid waste disposal, public transport,
environmental monitoring and management systems. The project will support
investments for environmental sanitation and transportation to improve
drainage, sewerage, solid waste management, roads, traffic management, and
public bus operations. These improvements would be beneficial in themselves
and would also complement and hence increase efficiency of existing assets.
Many of these high priority works, in central locations of the city, involve
relocation of about four thousand households living in old residential areas
that are dilapidated and environmentally unsound. The project will support



- 3 -
reaettlemeat of these households in order to minimize disruption, ensure
Improvement of resettlers' housng and environmental health conditions, and
introduce procedures for expanded housintg choice. Finally, the project will
help establish and operate a Rund for Industrial Pollution Control (the Fund),
that will help finance investments by industrial enterprises to minimize
polluting wastes generated in the production process and thereby yield both
environmental and financial benefits.
10.         Imolementation.  The proposed project would be carried out by TNG
over a period of six years. The project is estimated to cost US$195 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$112 million, of which the
Association would finance US$100 million equivalent. An estimated US$19
million equivalent of the credit proceeds will be onlent, through TNG, to the
Fund for 15 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 5.0X p.a. The
Fund will combine this with revenues from a pollution levy to provide
pollution control loans to industrial enterprises for three to seven years at
market intevest rates, as well as limited grants for certain eligible
subprojects. Retroactive financing of up to US$10.0 million equivalent will
be provided for expenditures made after April 30, 1991 for urgently needed
consultant services and housing construction for initial resettlement. A
summary of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10284-
CHA dated May 22, 1992 is being distributed separately.
II.         Proiect Sustainabilitv.  TMG's budgetary policy favoring operation
and maintenance over investment as well as its past performance indicate that
physical assets created or improved under the project are likely to be well
maintained. The sustainability would be further enhanced by improvements in
resource mobilization and financial management that will be carried out as
part of the project. The Improvements in infrastructure planning and
management systems would be made through extensive testing and training, so
that the enhancements will be internalized, sustained and expanded. The Fund
established under the project would utilize part of pollution levy revenues,
currently used mostly for grant financing, in a sustainable combination of
market-rate loans and narrowly defined grants so that the Fund could be
expanded over time.
12.         Agreed Actions. Key agreements were reached during negotiations
with TMG on, among others, implementation of a planning and management
improvement action plan satisfactory to the Association, and implementation of
the resettlement component according to a plan and procedures acceptable to
the Association. As conditions of effectiveness, TMG will establish the Fund
for Industrial Pollution Control with an organization, operating procedures
and financing term satisfactory to the Association, and that an agreement
will be signed between the Fund and the People's Construction Bank of China
for necessary technical services.
13.        KEnvironmental As2ects. More than half of the total investments
under the project vould directly help control various sources of pollution,
from industrial effluent to solid waste. The resettlement under the project
would also greatly improve environmental conditions of the affected
households. In order to max4mize the benefits and reduce the risk of



-4-
disruption associated with resettlement in general, the project would
specifically help finance the resettlement under improved procedures.
Compensation, mainly in the form of new housing, has been agreed upon through
consultation with each affected household. Other environmental risks of the
project have been identified and mitigating measures incorporated through an
established environmental impact assessment process.
14.         Program Ob10ctve CategorLes.  The project would support
improvements in public sector management and environment.
15.         Aefito. While project benefits cannot be quantified fully, an
average economic rate of return of about 251 is indicated for components
accounting for about 402 of the total project costs.   Most of the physical
improvements of the project under drainage, sewerage, solid waste management,
resettlement, and industrial pollution control components will result in
health and environmental benefits difficult to quantify. The managerial
innovations and improvements introduced under the project will yield long-term
benefits by increasing efficiency and accountability of public expenditure
programs, and by mobilizing resources for pollutiva control in a sustL-4-nble
way. These improvements will enhance 11G's effectiveness in the increasingly
diverse and decentralized urban economy. Further, improvements in Tianjin
could bave wide demonstration effects for municipalities across China,
facilitating a needed transition in the country's urban and environmental
management system.
16.         Risks.  Principal project implementation risks relate to the major
institutional innovations to be introduced for the industrial pollution
control and overall infrastructure planning and management. To minimize the
risks, T1G managers and the Association staff paid particular attention during
project preparation to defining feasible scopes and details of the components
and the necessary organizational arrangements. Substantial levels of
consultant input and additional supervision input by the Association are
included to provide continued assistance for the institutional aspects during
project implementation.
17.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
