STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1.  BACKGROUND
A. COUNTRY CONTEXT
Demographic and Health Status Background
1.1          Turkey's population in 1990 was 56 million. The estimated mid-year population
for 1996 is about 64 million with an average density of 73 inhabitants per square kilometer. The
country is administratively divided into 80 provinces. There are considerable geographical
variations: eastern and south-eastern regions are less developed compared to other parts of the
country.
1.2          The demographic profile of Turkey is relatively young compared with other
European countries. Health status in Turkey, as measured by a range of indicators, is not
satisfactory given its level of socio-economic development. The most important causes of
mortality in the country are: in infancy, perinatal/neonatal, pneumonia and diarrhea; in children
aged 1-5, infectious diseases and their complications, mostly associated with malnutrition; in
adolescents and young adults, various types of accidents; in those aged 25-44, heart disease and
accidents; and in those aged 45-64, heart disease and respiratory disorders.
1.3          Infant mortality is one of the most significant health problems in Turkey at 42.2
per 1,000 live births. For the country overall, the under-five mortality rate is 52 per 1,000, with
significant regional and urban/rural variations. The maternal mortality rate is estimated by SPO
at around 100 per 1 00,000.
1.4          A major National Burden of Disease study is being undertaken under the Health
1I Project which should provide an important basis for setting priorities and targeting scarce
health care resources at effective interventions likely to improve health status.
B. SECTORAL CONTEXT
The Current Health Care System
1.5          Health services in Turkey are provided mainly by the Ministry of Health
(MOH), the Social Insurance Organization (SSK), universities, the Ministry of Defense, and
private physicians, dentists, and pharmacists.



- 2 -
1.6           The MOH is the major provider of hospital care and primary care and the only
provider of preventive health services. At the central organization level, the MOH is responsible
for the country's health policy and health services. At the provincial level, health services
provided by the MOH are administered by Provincial Health Directorates (PHDs). The PHDs
are accountable to the Provincial Governors, who are under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Interior.
1.7           The MOH operates 4,927 health centers and 11,888 health posts (at the village
level) which are the basic units of organization of existing primary health services. In
accordance with legislation, health posts are staffed by a midwife and serve a population of
2,500-3,000 in rural areas. Health centers serve a population of 5,000-10,000, and are staffed by
a team consisting of a physician, a nurse, a midwife, a health technician, and a medical secretary.
The main functions of health centers are the prevention and treatment of communicable diseases;
immunization; maternal and child health services, family planning; public health education;
environmental health; patient care; and the collection of statistical data concerning health.
1.8           Hospital services are provided by the MOH, the Ministry of Defense, the
Ministry of Labor and Social Security (SSK), some State Economic Enterprises, universities, and
the private sector. There is a total of 151,972 hospital beds in Turkey, or about 2.4 beds per
1,000 of population. Bed ratios to population vary markedly across the country. Of a total 1,051
hospitals, 677 are run by the MOH. These provide 50.7 percent of the hospital beds in the
country, with an occupancy rate of 55 percent.
1.9           There is not a well established referral chain in the Turkish health system.
Patients are able to self-refer to secondary care. Hospitals are used heavily as out-patient clinics,
with patients by-passing primary level services in health centers and health posts.
1.10          The estimated number of health service personnel in Turkey are: 929 people per
physician, 5,340 per dentist, 3,331 per pharmacist, 1,087 per nurse, 1,718 per midwife, and 1,986
per health officer. Ratios of population to medical personnel vary greatly among regions. The
eastern part of the country and rural areas have fewer personnel of all categories per unit of
population. The Ministry of Health is the largest health services provider in Turkey, employing
about 195,000 staff.
1.11          A high proportion of doctors, pharmacists and specialist doctors are employed in
the private sector, while other health personnel are employed mostly in the public sector. Many
specialist doctors work part-time in public hospitals in addition to having their own private
practice.
Financing Health Care
1.12          The annual growth rate of GNP in Turkey is currently about 5 percent. Since
1963, total health care expenditure has accounted for between 3.0 and 4.3 percent of GNP. The
allocation to the Ministry of Health from the national budget has been between 3 and 4 percent.
One hundred and five trillion TL was from public sources and 58.0 trillion TL from private
sources (including 53.0 trillion TL out of pocket charges). Since 1988, additional funding has
been available from earmarked taxation on fuel, new car sales, and cigarettes. Inflation has been
a major complication in controlling and planning public expenditure in recent years.



- 3 -
1.13          The financing of health care in Turkey is quite complex because of the large
number of agencies involved in providing and/or financing health care services. Approximately
one-third of the total expenditure is financed by taxation, 17 percent by social insurance funds,
and the remaining 50 percent by direct out-of-pocket payments. Only 67 percent of the
population currently has coverage under existing social insurance schemes, leaving
approximately 21 million people without coverage.
1.14          There are three major sources of funding for public hospitals: state budget
allocations (83 percent), revolving fund revenues (12 percent), and special funds (5 percent).
State budget allocations are prepared through simple adjustments, taking into consideration the
previous year's inflation rates, and are sent then to the MOH. Revolving fund revenues are
basically fees paid for service payments from individuals or third party insurers.
1.15          Fees paid for health services are determined by a commission consisting of
MOH and Ministry of Finance representatives without reference to the actual cost of the
services, and so are not likely to provide appropriate rewards and incentives.
Recognition of the Need for Change
1.16          The Turkish Government, in its National Health Policy Document (1993), and
subsequent documents, recognizes the following key problems with its current health system:
1.17          First, health indicators in Turkey are not satisfactory given its level of socio-
economic development. The most common causes of mortality are preventable or controllable.
1.18          Second, the health care system experiences equity problems. Although all MOH
hospitals are subsidized up to the amount of 60 percent of the actual costs, only insured people
are entitled to free access at the point of use. Equity problems occur in the utilization of health
services, as well, because the distribution of hospital beds and health professionals favors urban
and western areas of the country. Correspondingly, people living in urban settlements of a
western province utilize more health services as compared to people living in rural areas in the
eastern part of Turkey.
1.19          Third, there are major problems with the organization of current health services.
Highly centralized decision-making along programmatic lines and rigid control of service
providers makes effective coordination and delivery of services difficult. Recruitment and
placement of staff for all state health facilities is carried out by a Personnel Directorate within
the Ministry of Health. Remuneration is in accordance with the Law of Civil Servants, which
establishes a pay scale based mainly on education, duration of public service and job title. There
are automatic cost-of-living raises during the year, but the basic salary is not supplemented by
incentives for performance. Public employees are granted lifetime employment. Individual
hospitals or provincial health managers have little autonomy to recruit, fire or manage their own
staff.
1.20          Fourth, there is no effective referral system operating between primary care and
hospitals. Patients bypass health centers and health posts and use hospital out patient clinics and
accident and emergency facilities as first contact for non-emergency services while cost effective
primary care is underutilized.



- 4 -
1.21         In response to this need for change, the Government has embarked on an
ambitious health reform program, which is strongly supported by the World Bank through the
first two health projects, together valued at over $320 million.
Turkish Health Reform Program
Overall context of Reforms:
1.22         The aim of the Turkish Health Reform Program is to reduce inequality in health
status and in access to basic health services. The key strategies include:
(a)    introducing health insurance to provide coverage to the approximately 21
million of the population presently uninsured under the existing health insurance
schemes, and introducing provisions for block contracting for services to replace
fee-for-service;
(b)    reforming primary care, including establishing a family physician system to
improve the access to and quality of the care;
(c)    reforming secondary and tertiary hospital care, through the establishment of
autonomous health enterprises to promote efficiency and effectiveness;
(d)   introducing systematic, organizational, management and human resources
reforms; and
(e)    improving infrastructures, including development of health information systems
to facilitate decision-making, accountability and efficiency.
1.23         The National Health Policy Document (1993) and subsequent Turkish
Government documents outline the strategy of the Turkish Health Reform Program. The
Program has multi-party support, and is supported by health insurers and health sector personnel.
1.24         Three major pieces of draft legislation (prepared under the Health I Project)
provide the cornerstone for the fundamental reforms, namely: (i) Law on the Establishment and
Organization of Health Financing Institutions; (ii) Basic Law on Hospitals and Health
Enterprises; and (iii) Law on Primary Care Services and Family Physicians Services. Indications
from the MOH and Treasury are that this legislation is likely to receive high priority in the
current Parliamentary session. All three pieces of legislation provide for piloting and specify
Bilecik and Eskesehir as initial pilot provinces, followed by extension of piloting to two other
provinces in the same region, followed by nationwide implementation within four years of
passage of legislation. These two provinces were chosen by virtue of their representative social
and economic profiles and their proximity to the national project management coordination (see
paragraphs 2.27 and 2.28). Significant political consensus was developed over the selection of
the provinces.



- 5 -
Law on the Establishment and Organization of Health Financing Institutions
1.25          The purpose of this law is to extend to the approximately 21 million people
without health insurance comprehensive coverage of a basic package of insured benefits, and to
introduce new methods of contracting for these services in order to ensure efficient and effective
care.
1.26          The underlying principles of the draft health insurance law are that the HFI
should be actuarially sound, adequate in its revenue capacity to provide the basic package of
health services, and based on premiums with a targeted state subsidy of those premiums to
ensure effective 100 percent coverage (i.e., anyone who wished coverage would be able to
obtain it).
1.27          The targeted premium structure will be based around five categories, with
approximately 1/3 of the targeted population requiring a 90 percent subsidy and 1/3 of them
requiring no subsidy. In each category, estimates have been calculated on multiples of gross
minimum wage (e.g., those earning 1.2*gmw or less receive 90 percent subsidy, and those at or
above 2.4*gmw receive no subsidy).
1.28          Using the above premium structure, basic benefits and cost structures were
calculated (at US$50/capita) by existing social and insurance institutions. Estimated cost of 100
percent coverage (in year five of reform implementation) is US$1.2 billion gross. This
represents a US$200 million (net) increase above current spending projections, as these targeted
subsidies would replace existing low-income subsidies for the uninsured (the "green card"
program) and the social assistance fund. It would also replace insurance for the employees of the
proposed largest 140 health enterprises.
1.29          Reform under this law would be the first phase of the overall three-phase
strategy for social insurance reform. Because progress on the larger social insurance reform
agenda is only slowly progressing, the Government has determined initially to pursue health
financing reform separately. By separating this phase, the Government can prioritize providing
coverage to the presently uninsured. In the second phase, health and pension funds would be
separated to address the issue of cross-subsidies between the funds. All health insurance (e.g.,
including SSK) would be integrated into a common system in the third phase, addressing issues
of fully integrating health insurance where there are opportunities for efficiencies. This three-
phase approach is supported by the Bank.
Basic Law on Hospitals and Health Enterprises
1.30          This draft law will establish the legal framework under which the larger public
hospitals (including MOH, SSK and university hospitals) will be turned into publicly owned but
autonomous health enterprises. The major features of the law are to (i) clarify the relationship
between primary care and secondary/tertiary hospital care by developing an effective referral
system; (ii) introduce competition in secondary care through the creation of a managed or
internal market; and (iii) create incentives to promote efficiency, effectiveness and quality in the
provision of secondary care, through both autonomous decision-making and rigorous
contracting. Key features of the new enterprises will include:



-6 -
(a)    Governance. Public ownership will be retained but the enterprise will operate
under a governing Board of Directors. The Board will include three members
from the province and four members from the senior management structure. The
board structure may not be ideal, particularly given the strong presence of
management on the board, but is limited by current Constitutional and public
service legislation. The senior management will be nominated by the Board and
is subject to ministerial approval.
(b)    Provision for oversight . This will include establishment of independent audit
and audit under the control of the Prime Minister's Department.
(c)    Incentives to efficiency. Up to 50 percent of any profits generated by the
enterprise may be distributed to the employees, and 50 percent can be added to
the reserves of the enterprise. If an enterprise operates three consecutive years at
a loss, the enterprise will be put on "sale", unless there is no need for the service,
or there is no buyer, in which case the enterprise may be liquidated.
1.31          Of the approximately 825 public hospitals (including MOH, SSK and university
facilities), it is estimated that by the fifth year of reform implementation, 140 of the largest and
most complex enterprises will be established as health enterprises based on criteria developed by
the MOH. The timeframe and the criteria were developed to maximize the potential for success
given the current institutional capacity for managing change.
Primary Care Services and Family Physician Services Law
1.32          In addition to making small changes to the populations, functions and
relationships in the existing network of primary care posts and health centers, this law will
provide for private family physician practices. These practices will be able to provide primary
health care services under a capitated contract. Key provisions include:
(a)    Family physicians will be approved (licensed) based on prior training as a family
practitioner specialist, or as a general practitioner with certified additional
primary health care training.
(b)    Family physician contracts will combine a base operating grant with a capitation
payment for each registered person. They will have a maximum patient roster of
3,000, and will be contracted to provide a defined set of preventative and
curative services (as defined in the basic health package) free to the user,
regardless of the patient's source of insurance. Patients will be able to change
family physicians every six months. A new institution, the Public Health Center,
will be established in each district and will provide laboratory diagnosis and x-
ray services on referral by the family practice physician. Public Health Centers
will coordinate and support primary health care services and provide public
health services (health promotion and education, environmental health, etc.) in
their districts.
(c)    Access to secondary care will require a referral from either the family physician
or a health center. If no referral is made, the patient will be liable for personal
payment of the costs of secondary care under the health insurance law. This is



- 7 -
an example of the interrelationship between the laws and the importance that
they be viewed as a package.
C. JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PRIMARY HEALTH CARE REFORMS
1.33         In the context of the Health I and 11 Projects, Turkey's health reform strategy has
been assessed as appropriate for advancing the health sector's long-term development objectives.
Reforms are designed to achieve health care financing standards comparable to the EU, and
eliminate regional and gender disparities in coverage and health status, while increasing
efficiency and effectiveness of health care services. As outlined above, an essential component
of the health care reform program is the restructuring of primary care services by introducing
private family physicians into primary care. Development of an effective primary health care
system is a key strategy for furthering one of the three priorities in Turkey's development agenda
identified in the Seventh Five Year Plan (1996 - 2000): namely, reducing regional and gender
disparities in human development status and alleviating poverty.
1.34         Turkey is experiencing continued high levels of infant mortality (44.4 per 1000),
maternal mortality from preventable or treatable causes (100 per 100,000), and low life
expectancy due to chronic diseases associated with life style factors (67.9). Substantial
international evidence exists which supports the cost-effectiveness of primary health care and
preventative public health services in addressing these health status problems, therefore further
studies to justify the primary health care and public health policies in the Turkish health reforms
are unwarranted. The implementation strategies for primary health care changes in Turkey
prioritize the development of primary health infrastructure for the less developed eastern parts of
the country, and are consistent with the objective of reducing regional disparities in health status,
and investing first in areas most likely to produce the greatest health return.
D. RATIONALE FOR WORLD BANK INVOLVEMENT AND LINKAGES
To EXISTING BANK PROJECTS
1.35         The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussed by the Board of Directors during the presentation of the Bursa Water and Sanitation
Project, Report No. P-5897-TU, on March 11, 1993. It is also consistent with the new CAS
which is being finalized for submission to the Board of Directors in July. In keeping with the
priorities outlined in the previous and the new CAS, our support for the sector is intended to help
raise overall health indicators to levels more in line with Turkey's income level. Equally
important, we would help reduce disparities in the health status, support health finance reforms
aimed at universal health coverage, and strengthen health care management.
1.36          Funding has been provided under the two on-going health projects to support the
piloting of key activities for two of the three pieces of legislation, namely, the Law on the
Establishment and Organization of Health Financing Institution, and the Law on Hospitals and
Health Enterprises. However, when these two projects were designed and appraised, the need to
provide funding to pilot the Law on Primary Care Services and Family Physicians Services was
not identified. As a result, there is a financing "gap". Funding is now urgently needed to
develop a project for the proposed primary health care system. The gap would be filled by the
proposed Primary Health Care Services Project.



- 8 -
1.37         The two existing World Bank-financed loan projects (Health I and II) provide
strong support to the reform program. These projects are progressing well, both in terms of
implementation and the likelihood of meeting the development objectives. Health I is scheduled
to close December 1997 and Health 11 is scheduled to close in December 2001. These two
projects have major components supporting the development of (i) primary health care services
(particularly basic services in eastern Turkey); (ii) health management information systems (at a
national level), investments in civil works and equipment in some hospitals; (iii) development of
management and decision support skills and planning support; and (iv) the development of the
overall health reform program. There are strong linkages among all three projects. On a pilot
basis, the proposed project's components address gaps in primary care in the reform program
which are not filled in by Health I or II. In particular, this Project is directed toward piloting
development of the role of the family physician as care provider and gatekeeper to secondary and
tertiary care within an integrated primary health care system.
1.38         Moreover, a proposed major follow-on operation encompasses nationwide
implementation of the health reforms, including the key elements of the reforms contained in the
draft legislation outlined in paras. 1.22-1.35, and other measures, such as the reorganization of
the MOH. This Project is explicitly a trial for the critical primary health care component of the
national health reforms and therefore is an important building block for achievement of the
overall health reform design objectives.

2.   THE PROJECT
A. INTRODUCTION
2.1          A draft Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was reviewed by the Bank and is
being finalized by the MOH/PCU and appraised by the mission. The PIP which complies with
the Bank's requirements, includes a detailed description of each component and how the Project
will be implemented. The Table of Contents of the PIP is attached as Annex 3, and a copy of the
full PIP is available in the project files. This chapter, therefore, provides only a summary
description of the project objectives and project activities. A concise project design summary,
including key performance indicators, is attached as Annex 1. During negotiations the MOH
presented the PIP and provided assurances that the project will be implemented in accordance
with the PIP.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE
2.2          The overall goal of the Primary Health Care (PHC) Services Project is to
improve the access to and quality of primary health care within the two provinces (Eskisehir and
Bilecik) and to serve as the basis for extending the primary care health reforms nationwide. The
specific objectives of the Project are; (a) to develop a PHC system based on the family physician
and an effective referral system supported by financial incentives and improved infrastructure;
(b) to evaluate the developed PHC system for nationwide replication; and (c) to develop a
capacity for health economic analysis within the MOH.
2.3          The rationale for the proposed PHC system, which forms part of the health
reform program in Turkey, has already been considered in the context of the Health I and 11
Projects, and is outlined in Chapter 1. There is compelling international evidence that primary
health care and primary-level public health services provide the most cost-effective means of
reducing the major health status problems that Turkey faces, particularly in the rural and eastern
provinces. There is also international evidence that gate-keeping by family physicians with an
effective referral system, and a capitation compensation system, helps to constrain health care
costs and to foster a focus on population health status and preventive care at the primary level.
2.4          The principal justification for developing a project for the proposed PHC system
on a small scale under this Project is to reduce the risks and improve the quality of a proposed
major follow-on operation which will support nationwide implementation of health reform. This
phased project will also reduce the lead times for nationwide implementation of the PHC reforms
by six months to one year, by developing training programs that can be replicated rapidly and by
building up a pool of trained family physicians ready to be deployed to other provinces. It will
thus bring forward realization of the benefits of the PHC reforms, in improved health status and
more cost-effective use of health resources.



- 10 -
Rationale for Phasing
2.5           The PHC Services Project will consist of two phases. The first phase will make
the necessary investments in training, equipment and civil works, including the development of
the primary care and referral network which will ensure coordination in the delivery of primary
care and referral to higher levels of care. This phase of the Project will allow the evaluation of
the impact of these investments on improving the utilization of primary care services and the
consequent changes in the utilization of secondary care services. The second phase will involve
the piloting of family physician contracting and the introduction of financial incentives. The
main reasons for this two-phased approach are: (i) to allow for the separation of the effects of
the project investment on improving the capacity and efficiency of the referral system from the
introduction of financial incentives and physician contracting; and (ii) to allow additional time
for the passage of legislation for the financial reforms for the national health care system. A
draft description of these incentives and terms of employment for contracting physicians are
included in Annex 1 of the PIP. The draft Legislation is now before Parliament, and it specifies
that financial incentives and the physician contracting system will be piloted in four provinces
including the two Project provinces; consequently, the MOH will be mandated by law to
implement financial reforms under the Project. It is expected that the legislation will be passed
within 24 months, i.e., June 1999; however, if there are unforeseen delays in the passage of the
legislation, this will not affect the viability of the project, but implementation of the financial
reforms will be postponed accordingly. During negotiations the Government provided
assurances that no later than August 30, 1999 the Government will discuss with the Bank a
detailed plan for the financial system of incentives and physician contracting in the Project
provinces.
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
2.6           The proposed Project will provide training, fellowships, technical assistance,
computer hardware and software, medical equipment, office furniture, teaching materials, civil
works, and incremental recurrent costs (US$18.6 million equivalent total cost). Project
implementation will be managed over a three-year period by the PCU, in coordination with
MOH line departments, and in collaboration with Provincial Health Directorates and health care
personnel in the project provinces. The Project, which will focus on two selected provinces,
Bilecik and Eskisehir, consists of the following three components:
(a)    Improvement of PHC Services (US$ 17.2 million total cost) will include the
following four subcomponents:
(i)    Development of Family Physician and Referral System (US$0.6 million)
(ii)    Family Physician Training (US$2.8 million)
(iii)   Upgrading PHC Infrastructure (US$10.9 million)
(iv)   PHC Services Information System (US$2.9 million)



-11 -
(b)    Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.1 million) will include the following two
subcomponents:
(i)    Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.5 million)
(ii)   Project Management (US$0.6 million)
(c)    Institutional Capacity Development, Health Economic Analysis (US$0.3
million)
Component I: Improvement of PHC Services (US$17.2 million)
2.7          This component will develop a comprehensive PHC system in Bilecik and
Eskisehir provinces to test implementation and make any modifications necessary before
nationwide implementation. A proposed major follow-on project, planned for 1999, will provide
assistance for nationwide implementation of the PHC system as well as other elements of the
health reforns during 1999.
Development of Family Physician and Referral System (US$0.6 million)
2.8          This subcomponent will provide technical assistance and training to develop a
family physician and referral system in Bilecik and Eskesehir provinces to ensure an integrated
approach to primary care and referral to other levels of care. Local consultants will be used to
provide technical assistance on the design of the system. A communications campaign will be
financed to educate public and health sector personnel about the need for changes in the use of
health services in accordance with the referral system. The component will also finance a
training workshop for 20 persons from the central MOH and 10 persons from each project
province to introduce them to the operation of the new system.
Family Physician Training (US$2.8 million)
2.9          This subcomponent will provide technical assistance and training materials to:
(a) assess training needs, (b) design training programs, (c) develop curriculum and training
materials, (d) develop selection criteria for an initial group of trainees adequate to staff primary
health services in the project provinces, and (e) deliver training. In total, approximately 350
physicians are required for primary health services in the two project provinces. A larger
number (1,500) will be trained under this Project to reduce lead times for nationwide
implementation, to take advantage of the marginal costs of training and to demonstrate
commitment to nationwide reform of primary care.
2.10         Training programs include: (a) inservice training for health personnel in PHC
positions in the project provinces, including orientation training to introduce new personnel to
the provinces and to PHC services, and development training in family health, environmental
health, and control of common health problems; (b) a four-week training program for current
trained family physicians to introduce them to the new primary health system, primary health
care concepts and basic public health issues; (c) transition training consisting of a two-week
induction course, and six months of rotations in appropriate departments in training hospitals
(without family physician training) to upgrade the skills of 1,500 general practitioners; and (d) a



- 12 -
six-month distance-based training program in primary health care and public health issues for
groups (b) and (c).
2.11         The training programs and selection criteria will be developed by a working
group consisting of representatives from universities, professional unions and the MOH. The
working group will assist the PCU to select a university with both family physician and public
health departments to develop and deliver the training.
Upgrading Primary Health Care Infrastructure (US$10.9 million)
2.12         This subcomponent will improve access to essential primary health care
services, create Public Health Centers (PUHCs) in each district to provide diagnostic and other
support for family physician practices and a range of local public health services, and complete
the referral chain in the project provinces. In particular, it will provide: (a) upgrading and
renovating of existing PHC units; (b) procurement of basic diagnostic equipment, other
appropriate medical equipment and furniture for PHC facilities; and (c) a limited, but essential,
amount of medical equipment for one hospital in Bilecik Province to complete the referral chain
from secondary to tertiary care. The civil works will upgrade, renovate, furnish, and equip
health posts for use as family physician offices (33), rural health centers (35), urban health
centers (21), public health centers (26).
Primary Health Care Services Information Systems (PHCSIS) (US$2.9 million)
2.13         The PHCSIS Subcomponent provides basic computerized information systems
for the expected approximately 350 family physicians located in offices and in the Public Health
Centers in Bilecik and Eskisehir Provinces. These systems will:
(a)    automate and extend the current paper-based information systems employed in
the PHC facilities for statistical compilation and reporting, MCH/FP scheduling,
patient records, and inventory management;
(b)    provide new tools for managing the patient care and financial information
required to operate a PHC practice in a reformed PHC environment, including a
patient registry suitable to support a capitation payment system, a referral and
drug prescription tracking system, as well as basic accounting and personnel
systems;
(c)   record any additional data required to carry out the project monitoring and
evaluation activities envisioned under the Monitoring and Evaluation
Component.
2.14         For the sake of simplicity, no networking is envisioned under the PCHSIS
Subcomponent and all report submissions (i.e., to the Provincial Health Directorates - PHDs)
will be conducted through diskette exchange. The statistical and resource-related reporting
information will directly feed the Basic Health Statistics Module (BHSM) and Core Health
Resource Management Systems (CHRMS) which are in the process of being implemented
nationally in all 80 PHDs in Turkey and in the central MOH (under the Health I and II Projects).
The design of the PCHSIS also builds on some preliminary analysis of a single primary health
care facility, which is currently being financed by the Health II Project. Looking towards the



- 13 -
next major lending operation (Health FY99), the PCHSIS will provide a basis for nationwide
deployment, complete with updates for the necessary linkages to support the prospective health
finance reforms.
Component II: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.1 million)
2.15         The purpose of this component is to provide a basis for evaluating the
Improvement of PHC Services Component and fine-tuning the design of the PHC system prior to
nationwide implementation. This will be achieved by testing implementation strategies on a
small scale, putting in place a monitoring and evaluation system, and ensuring good project
management during the first phase. The Monitoring and Evaluation component consists of the
following two subcomponents: (a) Monitoring and Evaluation; and (b) Project Management.
Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.5 million)
2.16         This subcomponent will provide the necessary technical assistance (i) to set up a
monitoring and evaluation system for both the first and second phases of the Project; (ii) to
conduct the evaluation on the impact of the changes to the primary health care system; (iii)
prepare an evaluation report; and (iv) to disseminate and discuss the evaluation results in a
symposium. The purpose of the symposium is to obtain feedback from appropriate national
experts and stakeholders on the results of the evaluation and recommendations for modifications
to the PHC system. The symposium should therefore be attended by stakeholders and experts in
the central MOH, representatives of other key government departments such as the SPO, PHDs,
universities with family physician and public health departments, etc.
2.17         The monitoring and evaluation program includes the following elements:
(a)    monitoring whether the PHC system produces the desired increase in
consultation rates in primary care, and relative shifts away from use of
secondary care in the two provinces;
(b)    estimating the cost per primary and secondary care to evaluate whether the PHC
system is more cost-effective than secondary care;
(c)    surveying the workload of family physicians and Public Health Center staff at
the end of the project period to evaluate whether the network of PHC facilities is
appropriate in the light of actual demand for its services;
(d)    surveying changes in use of health information by Provincial Health
Directorates, Public Health Centers and family physicians' offices, as a result of
implementation of PHCSIS; in particular, evaluating whether the more accurate
and timely information is used to improve planning, resource allocation and
primary and public health practice;
(e)    surveying participants in family physician training programs at the end of the
training program and after a subsequent period in primary health care practice, to
assess the value of the training and suggested changes to future training
programs;



- 14 -
(f)    surveying Provincial Health Directorates, Public Health Centers, family
physicians, and hospital outpatients and Accident and Emergency service
doctors regarding their perceptions of benefits and shortcomings of the PHC
services; and
(g)    surveying changes in user-satisfaction with primary health services by surveying
users of health centers and users of family physician offices at the beginning and
end of the project period to evaluate whether improvements in training and
infrastructure in PHC services are reflected in greater user satisfaction.
Details of the monitoring regime and key questions to be answered about the PHC system
through the evaluation component are set out in Annex 2.
Project Management (US$0.6 million)
2.18          Based on the successful administrative and management arrangements under the
Health I and II Projects, the MOH has decided that the existing Project Coordination Unit within
MOH will be responsible for project management. This subcomponent will provide funding for
the necessary technical assistance and staff required to successfully manage project
implementation. In order to support the management of the PCU, the MOH may obtain
administrative and logistical support in the form of a management support services contract.
Component III: Institutional Capacity Development, Health Economic Analysis
(US$0.3 million)
2.19          The objective of this component is to strengthen the capacity for health
economic analysis in the central MOH, as part of a wider strategy to develop the MOH's skill set
for policy development. This component of the Project will establish the nucleus of a health
economic analysis capacity in the MOH, and encourage the MOH to build up this capacity over
time. The Project will provide training and mentoring for four health economists to be located
initially in the PCU, where their skills can be applied to evaluation and development of the
health reforms, including the PHC system. A number of aspects of the reforms require input
from health economists, including development of financing reforms, design of new
reimbursement mechanisms, measures to improve financial management, and measures to
improve planning and resource allocation.
2.20          Specifically, this component will provide technical assistance to train and
mentor four health economists. The component will finance a one-year fellowship for two
persons with an undergraduate economics qualification to undertake nine months overseas
training in health economics at Masters Degree level, followed by three-months of job-
shadowing experience in a health economics unit in a foreign Health Ministry (or other health
policy institution) with system characteristics or reform experience relevant to Turkey. The
Project will also finance a short-term fellowship for training of two assistant health economists,
to participate in a six-month shadowing experience and distance-based course work, or part-time
training in health economics. The four fellowship candidates will serve as core members of a
health economic analysis unit. The Project also includes some limited consultancy services to
support the establishment of the unit and to nurture the staff in a twinning arrangement.

D. COST & FINANCING
Project Costs
2.21           Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at US$18.6 million.
Total base costs, including recurrent costs, are estimated at US$17.6 million. Physical
contingencies calculated on investment costs are US$1.6 million, or 9 percent of base costs.
Price contingencies on base costs and physical contingencies are negative US$0.5 million, and
are based on most recent projections of local inflation and devaluation. I Price estimates for
investment costs are based on current prices for goods and works as invoiced recently for similar
expenditures incurred under the Health I and II Projects. Prices for consultant services are based
on current local and international rates in the respective areas of expertise. Recurrent costs are
based on current local government salaries and local costs for maintenance and supplies. The
foreign exchange component of the Project is estimated at US$8.5 million or 46 percent of total
project costs. Taxes and duties are estimated at US$2.8 million and are calculated at 15 percent
of all goods and services, and 18 percent of construction costs.
2.22           The Project investment costs include expenditures for construction, equipment,
furniture, consultancy services, production of training materials, and local and foreign training.
Project incremental recurrent costs include a maintenance and operating budget for the primary
health care facilities included in the project, plus the necessary maintenance and support contract
for the operation of the computers for the PHCSIS system for family physicians. Summary
tables of total costs by component and expenditure category are shown in Tables 2.1 and 2.2.
Detailed project cost tables for each component are included in Annex 2 of the PIP.
Local and international inflation rates are based on Bank estimates as of February 1997. Local annual
average inflation rate estimates respectively for 1997-2000 are 105%, 58%, 35%. and 19%.
International inflation rates respectively for these years are 2.0%, 2.4 %, and 2.6%. Average
exchange rates respectively for these years in Turkish Lira are TL283630, TL356220, and TL3923 10.
The negotiations exchange rate is TL137,440.

Project Financing
2.23             As shown in Table 2.3 below, the proposed Loan of US$14.5 million will
finance 78 percent of total project costs, or 100 percent of foreign costs for all direct and indirect
expenditures and 83 percent of local expenditures, excluding taxes. The Government will
finance 100 percent of incremental recurrent costs and 17 percent of total investment
expenditures, excluding taxes. Government funds will also finance 100 percent of national taxes.
All project counterpart funds are expected to be secured through the Government's central
budget for the Ministry of Health. The Project does not envisage retroactive financing. During
negotiations the Government agreed that as a condition of Loan Effectiveness the Project has
been included in the Borrower's 1997 investment program.

E. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Foundation for Future Economic Evaluation of PHC System
2.24             Consideration was given to the feasibility of evaluating each of the PHC system
components as part of the evaluation of this Project. However, it is not possible to estimate, with
currently available data, the cost of primary care consultations under the proposed infrastructure
of family physician offices and Public Health Centers compared to the present cost of meeting
primary care needs at secondary care facilities. Nor is it possible to forecast with any accuracy
the extent of the shift of resources from secondary to primary care that might be achieved under
the PHC reforms. The Project itself will make this information available by the end of the
Project. The monitoring indicators and evaluations required under the second component of this
Project ensure that relevant data and economic evaluation will be carried out for both the first
phase of the project, and the second phase when the contracting and financial incentives are
introduced following the passage of the necessary legislation.
2.25             The evaluation component of the Project also provides for evaluation of the
financial viability of private family physician practice in urban and rural settings. The National



- 18 -
Burden of Disease Study supported by the Health 11 Project will allow for further evaluation of
the impact of the PHC reforms on a range of health status measures.
2.26          A major part of the return on investment in this Project, then, is the benefit of
testing whether the proposed PHC reforms do indeed meet the expectations of more cost-
effective use of resources through a shift to use of primary care, and the resultant opportunity to
modify the design of the PHC system before nationwide implementation, in the event that
evaluation of the project indicates any shortfall relative to expectations. Component II
(Monitoring and Evaluation) and Component III (Institutional Development) of the Project will
ensure that these benefits are realized.
Consideration of Cost-Effectiveness of Project Alternatives
2.27          Evaluation of the sub-components of the project at this stage is confined to
assessing whether consideration of the cost effectiveness of alternatives has occurred, and in
light of this, whether the project design represents a reasonable basis for piloting.
Numbers and Selection of Provinces
2.28          Alternative numbers and choices of project provinces were considered.
Additional project provinces would increase representative significance, but would add to cost.
The two project provinces represent rural and urban areas, and so constitute the minimum
number of provinces required to achieve statistical significance. Criteria used to select the
provinces for the Project were:
(a)    accessibility (to economize on project management, monitoring and evaluation
costs);
(b)    appropriate population characteristics and size (to achieve statistical significance
at smallest feasible scale and hence cost);
(c)    a manageable number of people to be covered by the health financing institution
(those currently uninsured) to ensure later piloting of the health financing
reforms in these provinces is possible at low fiscal cost; and
(d)    completion of management and infrastructure development and strategic plans
for implementation prior to commencement of the project period.
2.29          The two provinces selected are relatively accessible from Ankara. Total
population in the project provinces is small (889,000, or around 1.4 percent of Turkey's total
population), but includes a growing urban area of around 500,000 in Eskisehir, and a rural area
of around 400,000 in western Turkey. The percentage of currently uninsured in the project
provinces is manageable at 11 percent in Eskesehir, and 14 percent in Bilecik. The two project
provinces are receiving management and information systems development under the Health I
and 11 Projects. Limited upgrades of PHC capacity in Bilecik and Eskesehir will be financed
with Government funds.

Consideration of Cost-Effectiveness of Family Physician and Public Health Center
Infrastructure
2.30          The network of family physician offices has been planned on the basis of one
physician for around 3,000 people, and on group practices of 2-5 physicians (except in sparsely
populated areas). This ratio is at the lower end of developed country norms, but represents an
increase over current actual ratios (one physician per 3,500 in the two provinces). Employment
of nurses and midwives in the family physician practices will provide a means of delivering
services to relatively high population ratios cost-effectively. The planned staffing of PHC
services thus appears to be lean, by developed country benchmarks. The Project will provide an
opportunity to assess workload for family physician practices as a basis for reviewing these
ratios.
2.31          The network of Public Health Centers is based on existing district boundaries,
which cover populations of around 20,000 on average in Bilecik and around 50,000 on average
in Eskesehir. That is, this network has not been designed on the basis of an explicit analysis of
the optimal distribution of these types of services. For this reason, evaluation will examine
workload at Public Health Centers and review scope for rationalization.
2.32          Physical infrastructure and equipment purchases for family physician offices and
Public Health Centers are to be determined by studies under the Health II Project, the range and
levels of services appropriately provided at these levels of care, and by Needs Assessment
Studies of existing premises in the project provinces. Upgrading of existing facilities will be
carried out, rather than construction of new facilities. The Project will increase utilization of
currently under-utilized PHC capacity in health posts, by converting them to properly equipped
and staffed family physician offices.
2.33          As part of the evaluation, the costs of the primary health care system, including
staff, premises, equipment and PHCSIS, will be compared to secondary care outpatient and
Accident and Emergency services between the provinces, in order to provide a check on the cost-
effectiveness of the network and infrastructure of PHC services.
Consideration of Cost-Effectiveness of Family Physician Training Alternatives
2.34          Alternatives were considered for the training of family physicians. The option
of adapting and using the existing three-year family physician training programs in universities
in Turkey was considered, but rejected as less cost-effective and as having too long a lead time
for the statutory implementation time frames for the PHC Services Project. In addition, these
programs do not have the capacity to train the 20,000 or more family physicians that will be
required for nationwide implementation of the PHC system reforms within four years of passage
of the health reforms legislation. The alternative of developing a shorter family physician
training program, which makes maximum use of cost-effective distance-based training methods
was therefore adopted. Consideration was given to training the 350 family physicians required
for the project provinces under this Project. Because of the lead times involved in training
family physicians for nationwide implementation of the PHC system, the marginal costs for
training additional numbers and the demonstrated commitment to extending the training as part
of the overall reforms, it was decided to train a larger number of doctors as family physicians
under this Project.



- 20 -
Consideration of the Cost-Effectiveness of PHC Information System Alternatives
2.35          It was not possible to meaningfully quantify the costs and benefits of the
PHCSIS with available data, and, in any event, information systems tend to be a hard-to-assess
intermediate input in the provision of health services.
2.36          Nevertheless, the PHCSIS is expected to generate savings in the time of health
professionals and the public. Experience with the BHSM, however, suggests that any efficiency
gains in processing are typically absorbed in efforts to raise the low level of information quality
in the MOH. The realizable benefits of this sub-component are thus expected predominantly to
be improvements in the quality (accuracy, relevance and timeliness) of information, largely as a
result of dramatically reduced errors in data entry, compilation and communication. The
PHCSIS will also create a platform for analysis and comparison of medical practice,
epidemiological information and resource use. The benefits are likely to accrue at all levels of
the health system: (a) the individual practitioner, through more efficient practice management
and the use of presentation and query tools to investigate connections between health
interventions and outcomes; (b) the group practice, or Public Health Center level, through the
use of comparison and benchmarks to address performance outliers; (c) the Provincial Health
Directorate level, through more efficient planning and allocation of resources across health
facilities and areas in the jurisdiction; and (d) the national MOH level, through more evidence-
based, outcomes-oriented health policies, planning and priority-setting.
2.37          During the Project, the PCU will monitor closely the impact of the PHCSIS for
lessons learnt and critical success factors. The project evaluation component includes provision
for a survey of changes in the use of information and user-feedback on the PHCSIS.
Financial Impact to the Public Sector
2.38          The project investment generates minimal incremental recurrent costs of
US$420,000 per annum for operating the enhanced PHC facilities in the project provinces. This
would be equivalent to around US$30 million per year if this expenditure increase per capita
were incurred nationwide, which is less than 1.5 percent of annual state budget expenditure on
health, or less than 0.02 percent of GNP. As well, the PHC reforms being studied have the
potential to generate some offsetting fiscal savings through reductions in numbers of secondary
care consultations and reductions in the need for future investment in additional hospital beds. It
is not considered feasible to realize such savings during the life of the Project. Firstly, the
project time-frame is too short relative to adjustment lags. Secondly, because of continuing
fiscal austerity, secondary care capacity utilization and new hospital investment are currently
below the levels likely to be required to meet population needs efficiently. The benefits of the
PHC investment in the project provinces are therefore expected to take the form of substitution
of more for less cost-effective forms of service delivery, within a resource constraint. However,
in the context of full-scale implementation of health reform in the longer term, some offsetting
savings from increased primary care expenditure should be feasible.
Private Sector Financial Impact and the Financial Incentives which Support the PHC
System
2.39          The PHC Services Project will not change the out-of-pocket costs for primary
care (which is already free to the user and will remain so). In the second phase, it will result in



- 21 -
significant increases in out-of-pocket costs for secondary care outpatient consultations for
patients without referrals from primary care. This financial disincentive is a critical part of the
strategy for achieving an effective referral system; it will create a desirable rather than
undesirable deterrent to access to secondary care. Emergency hospital attendances will be
exempt from this requirement.
2.40          The PHC Services Project will not change the average compensation to family
physicians and health center physicians. In the first phase of the Project, the physicians will
remain salaried employees. Once the necessary legislation is in place, in the proposed second
phase the new mixed compensation system, combining a base operating grant and capitation for
registered patients, introduces a desirable financial incentive for physicians to attract and register
patients. It does not reward them for consultations or any particular outputs, however. Given
that primary care consultation rates are currently very low (less than one consultation per capita
a year in health centers in the project provinces, excluding immunization and maternity care),
and that state hospitals receive a fee-for-service for each outpatient attendance (either from out-
of-pocket payment or third party insurance), there must be some doubt about whether the
financial incentives regime under the Project will be sufficient to produce the desired shift from
secondary care outpatient services to primary care. The Project provides an opportunity to assess
and review this, prior to nationwide implementation.
Rationale for Government Involvement
2.41          Consideration of the role of govemment in the design of health reforms in
Turkey led to the conclusion that the Government should regulate, finance (via health insurance
funds) and contract for family physician services, but that the Government does not need to
provide these services. The health reform legislation therefore provides for private family
physician practice. This will create financial incentives for family physicians to choose a cost-
effective mix of inputs in their practice, although their freedom to choose this mix will remain
somewhat constrained by MOH regulation under the health reforms legislation.
2.42          This Project, however, involves public provision of (private) family physician
premises and equipment. The rationales for this are: firstly, to provide an initial incentive to
attract family physicians into the project provinces rapidly in order to meet the time frames of
the Project; and secondly, to ensure that practice facilities are developed in rural areas where
family physicians may be unwilling to invest because of lower practice income and risk of
capital loss on property investment. Once the health reforms are fully implemented, rentals will
be levied to family practitioners on premises and equipment.
Impact on Poverty
2.43          Development of an effective primary health care system is a key strategy for
furthering one of the three priorities in Turkey's development agenda identified in the Seventh
Five Year Plan (1996 - 2000): namely, to reduce regional and gender disparities in human
development status and alleviate poverty. Turkey is experiencing continued high levels of infant
mortality and maternal mortality from preventable or treatable causes, and low life expectancy
due to chronic diseases associated with life style factors. These problems are more severe in the
poorer rural and eastern parts of the country. Substantial international evidence exists which
supports the effectiveness of primary health care and preventative public health services in
addressing these health status problems. The implementation strategies for primary health care



changes in Turkey (alreadV underway in the Health I and 11 projects) give priority to developing
primary health infrastructure in less developed, rural and eastern parts of the country, which is
consistent with the objective of reducing regional disparities in health status, and investing first
in areas likely to produce the greatest health gain withi incremental resources. The PHC structure
and services increase the resources and training of staff in the areas of child health, maternal
health and family planning services. I-he strategy is thus well-targeted at reducing gender
disparities in health and wsell-belin.
F. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
2.44           This is a Category C Pro ject: -'No appreciable environmental impact". Civil
works will be Iimited to small family physician offices and renovationi of existing health
facilities and this will not result in any significant impact on the environment.
G. PARTICIPATION
2.45           The quality and sustainabilitv of'the PHC reforms studied in this Project will be
supported by the participationi of key stakeholders in the design, implementation and evaluation
of a number of the componienits. Senior MOH and Provincial Health Directorate staff will
participate in a workshiop as part of developmenit of'the family physician and referral system. A
public communication campaign will educate the public about the changes to PHC services and
the referral chain. Universities, professional unions and MOH staff will participate in the design
and implementation of the family physician training programs. Stakeholders from the MOH,
other key government agencies such as the State Planning Office, universities, professional
bodies, health insurance organiizations and health sector personnel will participate in the
symposium on the evaluation of the Project. UNICEF, which is actively working on community
participation in eastern T'urkev. will contribute to and participate in the symposium. This
symposium. supported by Component II of the Pro ject. will seek feedback on the evaluation and
develop recom-imenidationis for anv chaniges to the PF1IC system that may be desirable when it is
implemented nationwide

3.  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. INIPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE
3.1           The Project is scheduled to be implcmented in two and a half years plus a three-
month evaluation period which is included to allow for data analysis and the preparation of
recommendations for the feasibility of a national expansion of the primary health care system.
The Loan would close November 30, 2000, six months following the completion date. The
implementation schedule takes into consideration that there will be no delays in start-up, due to
the fact that the PCU is well-established and the project is sufficiently prepared to start
implementation in September 1997. A detailed implementation schedule is included in the PIP.
B. IMPLENIENTATION MANAGEMENT
3.2           Management of the implementation of this Project is inextricably linked to
implementation of an agenda of health reforms under the I lealth 11 project. Thus, the overall
responsibility for management of this Project, jointly with Health I and 11, lies with the General
Coordinator of the MOH/PCU. who is directly accountable to the Undersecretary. The
PCU/MOH may obtain management support services to facilitate effective implementation of
overall project activities. Responsibilities for implementation of specific activities for the three
components and subcomponents are detailed in Section IV.C of the PIP, and are summarized
below.
Component I: Improvement of Primary Health Care Services
3.3           The MOH line departments for Primaryf Healtlh Care (PHCD) and for Maternal
and Child Health/Family Planning (MCH/FPD) have the main responsibility for overseeing
implementation of the activities under this sub-comiiponient. These departments also have
responsibility for working closely with the two Provincial Health Directorates (PHDs) to ensure
that the proposed network of family physicians has the required resources and support.
particularly, human resources, training, and operating budgets. The MOH/PCU will be
responsible for managing the investment program for construction, equipment, and MIS to be put
in place in the two provinces for the operation of the PHC system. A core management team
would be formed to oversee and guide the implementation of this subcomponent, and would be
composed of representatives from each of the concerned parties PHCD, MCH/FPD, PHDs, and
MOH/PCU. These five representatives would meet on a monthly basis to assess progress in
implementation, and to define an action plan to address any issues which may be affecting
implementation progress. The MOIHl/PCU representative w ill act as the Secretary for the
management team and will prepare minutes of the monthlv meetings and keep the General
Coordinator well-informed on progress and issues. The PCU w ill retain general responsibility
for project coordination and implementation, X\orking in close coordination with line
departments in the MOH and other agenicies.



- 24 -
Development of Family Physician and Referral System
3.4          The management team outlined above will be responsible for overseeing the
contracting of local consultants to assist with design of the system, the training workshop for
MOH and Provincial Health Directorate personnel, and the contracting of public relations
consultants to develop and conduct a public communications campaign.
Family Physician Training
3.5          The management team outlined above will also be responsible for coordination
and oversight of this component. However, this component will be carried out through the
General Directorate for Health Education under the supervision and guidance of a Family
Physician Training Advisory Committee working in close coordination with the PCU. This
committee would include representatives from the MOH, experts from Family Physician and
Public Health Departments of universities, and from professional unions. The Committee will
oversee the design, implementation and monitoring of the training programs and development of
training materials.
Upgrading PHC Infrastructure
3.6          Responsibility for implementation of this component rests on the MOH/PCU.
Upgrading/renovation of facilities will be undertaken through the Ministry of Public Works in
cooperation with the PCU. The Infrastructure Unit of the PCU which already exists and is well
staffed will manage this subcomponent. However, the Unit will contract an additional four staff
to assist specifically on the implementation of the Project. The Unit is headed by a manager
accountable to the MOHlPCU General Coordinator, and will work in close collaboration with
designated staff in the Provincial Health Directorates, the Ministry of Public Works, and with the
departments of the MOH responsible for infrastructure. The Unit will be specifically responsible
for: (i) managing and overseeing all aspects of development of the infrastructure, including
subcontracting of construction design and supervision of works; (ii) conducting procurement
according to World Bank Guidelines, and (iii) overseeing the installation of equipment and
furniture.
PHC Services Information System
3.7          The implementation of this subcomponent will be coordinated by a Health
Informatics Task Team (HITT) established in the MOH/PCU, working in close cooperation with
the Information Processing Department and the PHC Department of the MOH. The Task Team
includes staff appointed from the two relevant MOH departments, who will work closely with
the informatics staff in the two Provincial Health Directorates as well as with the turn-key
systems supplier. The PCU General Coordinator will appoint a Task Team Leader (TTL) who
will be responsible for planning and managing the work of the Task Team, and who will also be
the main counterpart to the contractor responsible for the development and implementation of
the system. The TTL is accountable to the PCU Director, and is responsible for keeping him
informed of progress and issues that need prompt resolution. As the PHCSIS is put in place, an
important task of the HITT will be to oversee the acceptance of the system at the provincial
level, and obtain user feedback while taking corrective action when needed, to avert problems
and ensure the success of the system. During negotiations the Government agreed as a condition
of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement that a Core Management Team, a Family Physician



- 25 -
Training Advisory Committee, and a Health Informatics Task Team (HITT) will be established
under terms of reference, staffing, functions and resources satisfactory to the Bank.
Component II: Monitoring and Evaluation
Monitoring and Evaluation
3.8          A Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist will be appointed under the Project to be
responsible for implementing this subcomponent. This person will be directly accountable to the
MOH/PCU General Coordinator and will work very closely with all the teams in implementing
the various subcomponents of the Project, and with the Monitoring and Evaluation System
already established for Health I and II. The Specialist will be responsible for; (i) data collection
for the specific Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) agreed for the Project Outputs and
Development Objectives (see Annex I); (ii) providing input into the semi-annual progress
reports on achievement of the indicators; (iii) overseeing the preparation of the Final Evaluation
Report which will address the feasibility of implementing the Project nationwide; and (iv)
organizing the national symposium to discuss the recommendations of the Final Evaluation
Report and to gain feedback and recommendations from key stakeholders, including high level
officials outside the MOH.
Project Management
3.9          The Project will be managed integrally with the Health I and II Projects which
are currently under the responsibility of the MOH/PCU General Coordinator. The MOH/PCU
will continue to function successfully as a fully integrated Unit of Ministry staff with short- and
long-term consultants. The MOHIPCU will be guided by the Project Implementation Plan and
will be responsible for coordinating and facilitating the work of the various teams in charge of
implementation of subcomponents, and for the day-to-day administration of the Project. The
MOH/PCU is also responsible for inter-agency coordination and for overseeing all contract
tendering and contract negotiations in the name of the MOH. The MOH/PCU will work closely
as needed with the technical and administrative line departments of the MOH and Provincial
Health Directorates. Administratively, the MOH/PCU's responsibilities are, among others:
producing timely and informative progress reports focusing on issues and progress towards
achieving KPIs (PIP, Section V); maintaining project accounts and records in a separate and
orderly manner, meeting intemational accounting standards to ensure clean audits; administering
contracts and monitoring and supervising the performance of contractors to ensure that
deliverables are met on a timely basis; and ensuring that all national budgetary provisions are
programmed and received. The PCU may contract management support services as in practice
under the ongoing Health I and Health 11 projects.
Component III: Institutional Capacity Development, Health Economic Analysis
3.10         The Project envisages the creation of a Health Economics Unit, initially housed
in the MOH/PCU, under the leadership of the General Coordinator of the MOH/PCU. The Unit
will be initially staffed with two consultants, who will be joined in the second project year by
two MOH staff who would come on board after an initial period of foreign training and job-
shadowing. The Unit will be supported by an experienced foreign Health Economist who will be
drawn from a partner organization which will mentor and develop a partnership with the MOH in
this field beyond the life of this Project. The MOH/PCU General Coordinator will guide the



- 26 -
work program of the Unit to ensure close collaboration and input into the development and
evaluation of health care reform initiatives. The Unit will, in the long run, become part of a
strengthened health policy capacity of the MOH.
C. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
3.11            A detailed procurement plan has been prepared which identifies all contracts to
be tendered for goods, works, and services under the Project. All tenders are expected to be
launched within immediate approval of the Loan, or within the next few months after Project
Effectiveness. A Procurement Schedule for each tender to be carried out under the project for
works, goods, and services is included as Annex 4. Procurement arrangements by expenditure
category are shown in Table 3.1 below:

- 27 -
Procurement of Construction (US$3.0 million)
3.12         The construction program will provide for upgrading and renovating of existing
primary health care facilities, and this work will be procured through National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) in accordance with World Bank Guidelines, using procedures and bidding
documents agreed with the Bank. It is expected that a total of four construction contracts will be
tendered, ranging from $500,000 to $1.3 million. There are no contracts expected above $1.3
million.
Procurement of Equipment and Furniture (US$8.6 million)
3.13         (i) International Competitive Bidding (ICB): Medical Equipment for the larger
facilities (US$4.2 million) and the PHCSIS system (US$2.6 million) will be procured through
ICB, respectively in two ICB tenders, in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for
Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits " published by the Bank in January 1995 and
revised in January and August 1996. Equipment procured under ICB procedures accounts for
45% of Loan expenditures. Contracts estimated to cost less than US$300,000 will be procured
through NCB or NS; (ii) National Competitive Bidding (NCB): Locally manufactured furniture
and small medical equipment will be procured through NCB up to an aggregate of US$1.8
million, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines, using procedures and bidding documents
agreed with the Bank; (iii) National Shopping (NS): Smaller medical supplies (US$460,800)
which are locally manufactured will be procured through NS, in accordance with the Bank
Guidelines, and on the basis of comparison of three price quotations from different local
suppliers. Much of the equipment is small breakable laboratory equipment and reagents which
are not economical to purchase through ICB; and (iv) UNICEF: Medical Equipment for small
facilities will be procured from UNICEF (US$0.1 million).
Training Materials (US$0.4 million)
3.14         The printing of training materials, and acquisition of other training materials
including video cassettes, will be procured through National Competitive Bidding (US$0.25
million) and through National Shopping (US$0.13 million) depending on the size of the
contract. It is expected that there will be several small contracts to be let as training materials
are developed.
Technical Assistance (Consultancy Services, Foreign Fellowships, and Local Training)
(US$4.8 million)
3.15         Technical Assistance will be procured according to the "Guidelines for the Use
of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" dated
January 1997. It is envisaged that about five TA contracts will be tendered and awarded on a
quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS), totalling US$4.3 million in aggregate. In addition, it
is expected that about eight individuals would be contraced (US$556,000 in aggregate) over
three years, based on competitive selection procedures and comparison of at least three curricula
vitae.



-28 -
Recurrent Costs (US$1.4 million)
3.16           All recurrent costs generated by the project and taxes and duties will be financed
entirely by the Government.
Contract Review Provisions
3.17           (1) Contracts estimated to cost more than $100,000 equivalent for goods and
works procured under ICB and NCB would be subject to prior review. Contracts below this
threshold would be subject to post review. (2) All contracts for technical assistance for both
firms and individuals would be subject to prior review.
D. DISBURSEMENTS AND FINANCING
3.18           The proposed Project is expected to be implemented over a period of two and a
half years, and will be disbursed over a period of three years. The short implementation period is
essential for a project which is well-focused on a specific program of interventions in primary
health care. The tight schedule is possible because of the limited geographical scope and the
well-established expertise and capacity of the MOH/PCU in implementing Bank-financed
activities and conducting procurement of works, goods, and services. The Loan Closing Date
will be November 30, 2000. The summary disbursement schedules by category and by semester
are as follows:

3.19         To facilitate the timely flow of payments for project expenditures, the
MOH/PCU will establish, maintain and operate a Special Account in the Central or a commercial
bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the World Bank. The authorized allocation for the
Special Account would be $1.4 million, representing the estimated average expenditures for a
four-month period for items financed under the project. At the beginning, the Special Account
deposit will be limited to $300,000 and the remaining portion of the authorized allocation will be
available for release when cumulative disbursements reach a level of $1.4 million.
3.20         Withdrawal applications for the replenishment of the Special Account should be
sent to the Bank on a quarterly basis, or when the balance in the Special Account is equal to half
of the initial deposit or the authorized allocation, whichever comes first. These applications will
be supported by appropriate documentation including a copy of the monthly bank statement of
the Special Account as well as its reconciliation with the Special Account transactions. All other
applications for direct payment or Special Commitments must be for an amount not less that 20
percent of the Special Account deposit.
E. ACCOUNTS, AUDITS, AND PROGRESS REPORTING
Project Accounts
3.21         The MOHIPCU will maintain, in accordance with Turkish and International
Accounting Standards, accounts and records to reflect all project resources, expenditures and
liabilities. Supporting records and documents will be available to Bank supervision missions
which will conduct random reviews, in particular, of those supporting withdrawal applications
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). The financial management system will
allow timely and reliable monitoring of the cost of each component of the project in comparison
with its physical implementation and of the utilization and availability of loan funds by category
of expenditure and in the currency of the loan.
Project Audit
3.22         Annual financial statements of the project will be audited in accordance with
Turkish and International Standards on Auditing by the Government's Treasury auditors. Audit
reports will be submitted within six months of the end of each accounting period. The first audit
report would be due to the Bank before June 30, 1998.



- 30 -
Progress Reporting
3.23          The MOH/PCU have agreed to report on a semester basis on the achievement of
Key Performance Indicators defined for project outcomes and for project development
objectives, as defined in Annex 1. Semester progress reports would be submitted to the Bank
within one month after the completion of each semester, and would include a concise summary
of progress and issues under each subcomponent, as well as progress on procurement, Loan
disbursements, and national counterpart expenditures in PHC facilities. The first semester
progress report would be due to the Bank on January 31, 1998.
F. SUPERVISION AND MONITORING
3.24          The Project will on average require fourteen staff-weeks per year for
supervision. The Project will be supervised to the extent possible jointly with the other two
health sector projects and this will achieve substantive savings. The role of supervision missions
will be primarily to assess progress towards achieving the objectives of the Project and to serve
as a catalyst to resolve issues and lobby for the achievement of the long-term development
objectives of the Project.

4.   PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. BENEFITS
4.1          The principal benefits of the Project are to reduce the risks and improve the
quality of implementation of the primary health care system to be established under Turkish
health reforms legislation, by piloting the PHC system on a small scale and evaluating it prior to
nationwide implementation. The Project thus has the benefit of reducing the risks of the much
larger lending program proposed for FY99 (Health FY99) in Turkey, which will support full
implementation of health reform.
Component I: Improvement of PHC Services
4.2           The Project will provide the opportunity to evaluate and better plan
implementation. The Project will be implemented in two phases, with the second phase being
triggered by the passage of the necessary legislation to allow the introduction of capitation
contracts and financial incentives. This component of the Project will also provide the benefits
of reduced lead times for nationwide implementation of the PHC reforms, by developing training
programs and building up a pool of trained family physicians ready to deploy in the project's and
other provinces. The Project will realize the benefits of the PHC reforms, in improved health
status and more cost-effective use of health resources in the project provinces and bring forward
realization of these benefits in other areas of the country.
Component II: Monitoring and Evaluation
4.3          This component will ensure that evaluation is comprehensive, supported by
appropriate technical assistance, and disseminated, so as to achieve greatest benefits from the
pilot. The two phase project will allow the investments in infrastructure, training and equipment,
as well as the development of the primary health care system to be evaluated separately from the
introduction of capitation contracts and financial incentives, thus allowing for the measurement
of the impact of each. The component will also ensure that there is sound project management
during the first phase.
Component III: Institutional Capacity Development, Health Economic Analysis
4.4          This component will strengthen the capacity for health economic analysis in the
central Ministry of Health, to help develop the MOH's skill set for policy development. It will
achieve benefits through application of economic analysis to evaluation and development of the
health reforms, including the PHC system.

B.    AFFORDABILITY
4.5           The project investments generate minimal incremental recurrent costs of
US$418,000 per annum for operating the enhanced PHC facilities in the project provinces. This
would be equivalent to around US$30 million per year if this expenditure increase per capita
were incurred nationwide, which is under 1.5 percent of annual state budget expenditure on
health (or less than 0.02 percent of GNP). As well, the PHC reforms being piloted have the
potential to generate some offsetting fiscal savings through reductions in numbers of secondary
care consultations and the need for future investment in additional hospital beds.
C.    RISKS
4.6           There is a risk that the Project will not have sufficient time or adequate
instruments to succeed in changing the public's behavior sufficiently to shift utilization from
secondary to primary care. In particular, the training and infrastructure improvements in primary
health care services may not make it sufficiently attractive, or the public may not be sufficiently
aware of the changes in quality, or the financial disincentives for use of secondary care included
in the second phase may not be sufficiently powerful to achieve this shift. There is a risk that the
health reform legislation will not proceed on a timely basis, and that the piloting of the second
phase of the family physician and primary health care reform, i.e. capitation contracting and
financial incentives, will not proceed as planned.
4.7           There is also a risk that it may not be possible to recruit sufficient numbers of
family physicians trained, in the programs financed by the project, into positions in the project
provinces, particularly in rural areas. Finally there is a risk that the piloted system will not be
adequately supported with consumable supplies (e.g. pharmaceuticals) to maximize the potential
contribution of the new training and infrastructure. This latter issue, though provided for with
the estimates in recurrent costs, will be closely monitored.
4.8           Nevertheless, the express purpose of the Project is to assess these risks on a
small scale, and create the opportunity for modification to the PHC system, including
strengthening the array of incentives introduced under the PHC reforms, if necessary. The
monitoring indicators and evaluation requirements set out in Annexes I and 2 provide for these
risks to be monitored and for appropriate remedial action to be taken. The sustainability of the
Project will be enhanced and implementation risks reduced by the participation of key
stakeholders and national experts in the design of the referral system, the family physician
training component, and in the symposium on evaluation of the Project which will recommend
any changes required to the PHC system in the light of lessons learned in the project.
Implementation risks are also reduced by the skills and experience of the PCU in project
management and implementation, developed and demonstrated in the course of the Health I and
Health 1I Projects.

Annex 2
Republic of Turkey
Primary Health Care Services Project
Staff Appraisal Report
Component II - Project Monitoring and Evaluation
1.    Because the project is to pilot the PHC system proposed under the health reforms prior
to nationwide implementation, the second Component of the project provides technical
assistance for monitoring and data gathering as a basis for evaluation of the pilot.
2.     While improvements in health status are a major rationale for the PHC reforms, it is not
realistic to expect to see significant changes in health status outcomes during the two-year life of
the pilot as a result of the new PHC system. As a result, proposed monitoring and evaluation of
the pilot is confined largely to intermediate process indicators, changes in health services
utilization, relative costs of alternative services, and stake-holder perceptions. Three outcome-
related indicators have been included (monitoring item (e) below).
3.     Beyond the life of this pilot, however, it will be possible and important to monitor
changes in health status that should be able to be achieved with effective primary health care.
The National Burden of Disease Study, financed through the Second Health Project, establishes
systems which gather this data. As well, the PHC reforms create a system of roles and
responsibilities which includes monitoring of health outcomes and coordination of PHC and
public health services by Public Health Centers and Provincial Health Directors. Thus, beyond
the life of the pilot, the MOH will have the capacity to evaluate the impact of the new PHC
system on health status. The pilot project builds in process indicators related to this ongoing
monitoring and evaluation of health status.
Monitoring Indicators
4.    In addition to monitoring of whether project outputs are achieved, Component II of the
project will monitor the following indicators to assess the success of the pilot project in
achieving objectives of the new PHC system. These monitoring indicators are also listed in the
table in Annex I to the SAR. For each of these monitoring indicators, baseline data will be
established by the beginning of the pilot period (end of CY 1997), and there will be regular
(generally semi-annual) monitoring throughout the pilot period (through to end of CY 1999 and
in some instances CY2000 for those likely to be impacted by phase 2).
(a)    Establish baseline rates of population registration with family physicians or
health centers by end of CY 1997, monitor changes in population registration
semi-annually by family physician practice thereafter, achieve targets of 50% of
population registered by end of CY 1998, and of 90% of population registered
by end of CY 2000.
(b)    Establish baseline rates of general primary care consultations per capita per year
(excluding immunization/well child checks and maternity consultations) by end
of CY 1997, monitor changes in consultation rates semi-annually by family
physician practice thereafter, achieve targets of at least 2 primary care
consultations per capita per year by end of CY 2000. Note: this proposed target



- 39 -
was suggested on the assumption that current consultation rates in health
centers are less than I per capita per year at present, based on the rates
reported in the health centers visited by the appraisal team.
(c)    Establish baseline volume and rates per capita per year of referred and self-
referred state hospital secondary care outpatient and Accident and Emergency
consultations for each state hospital by end of CY 1997, monitor changes in the
volumes, per capita rates and the ratio of referred to self-referred consultations
semi-annually thereafter. Develop targets for the change in the ratio to be
achieved by end of CY 1998, CY 1999, and CY 2000 (of at least 25%
improvement during the pilot period) once baseline rates are established.
(d)    Survey the workload of family physicians and their staff, by establishing
baseline rates of general consultations, immunization/well child contacts, and
maternity contacts per family physician per year by end of CY 1997, and
monitoring semi-annually thereafter. Develop targets for the change in rates to
be achieved by end of CY 1998, CY 1999 and CY 2000.
(e)    Survey the workload of Public Health Center staff throughout the pilot period,
by establishing baseline rates of consultations or other patient or community
contacts appropriate to measure workload of Public Health Center physicians
and other staff (e.g. rates of family planning contacts and of school health
contacts per physician per year) by end of CY 1997. Develop targets for the
change in rates to be achieved by end of CY 1998, CY 1999 and CY 2000.
(f)    Establish rates of immunization, contraception prevalence and home delivery to
hospital delivery (either for all births or for first births) in the pilot provinces by
end of CY 1997, monitor semi-annually thereafter. Achieve target 95%
immunization rate by end of CY 1999. Develop targets for contraception
prevalence and home delivery to hospital delivery for end of CY 1999 once
baseline rates are established.
(g)    Establish baseline rates of percentages of family physician offices and health
centers staffed by trained family physicians by end of CY 1997, monitor changes
in percentage of trained staff semi-annually thereafter, achieve targets of 50%
staffed by trained family physicians by end of CY 1998, and 90% staffed by
trained family physicians by end of CY 1999.
(h)    Establish baseline rates and timeliness of compliance with reporting of Basic
Health Statistics by family physicians and Public Health Centers to Provincial
Health Directorates by end of CY 1997, monitor changes in percentage
compliance and timeliness of reporting thereafter, achieve targets of 90%
completeness of reporting of BHSM within 6 weeks of end of each reporting
period by end of CY 1999.
Additional Data Collection to Support Evaluation
5.    In addition to regular monitoring, some additional elements of data collection are
required to enable evaluation of the success of the pilot in achieving the objectives of the PHC



- 40 -
system, and to obtain feedback about any aspects of the pilot PHC system that should be
modified before nationwide implementation.
(a)    Monitor changes in rates of inpatient admissions from polyclinics and Accident
and Emergency attendances by hospital semi-annually throughout the life of the
pilot. The purpose of this monitoring is to obtain a measure of whether the mix
of secondary care consultations shifts to those more appropriate for specialist
services. A higher ratio of admissions to outpatient and Accident and
Emergency consultations would be expected if the project succeeds in
establishing an effective referral system.
(b)    Produce an estimate of the average cost per primary care consultation (including
allocation of the costs of Public Health Centers attributable to support of family
physician practice) and per secondary care outpatient and Accident and
Emergency consultation at the end of the pilot. The purpose of this estimate is
to assist quantification of the benefits of the PHC system in producing a more
cost-effective first-contact health service at primary level.
(c)    Obtain a profit-and-loss statement (modified to include estimates of annualized
full costs of inputs that were subsidized in the pilot project, such as facilities
and equipment) for a sample of rural and urban family physician practices under
the second phase of the pilot project, to assess the financial viability of family
physician practices.
(d)    Survey changes in use of health information by Provincial Health Directors,
Public Health Centers and family physicians as a result of implementation of
PHCSIS. The purpose of this survey is to assess whether the PHCSIS achieved
the benefits expected.
(e)    Survey participants in family physician training programs at the end of the
program and after a subsequent period in primary health care practice, to obtain
feedback on the value of the programs and any recommendations for
modification.
(f)    Survey Provincial Health Directorates, Public Health Centers, family physicians,
and hospital outpatient and Accident and Emergency service doctors regarding
their perceptions of benefits and shortcomings of the pilot new PHC system and
any recommendations for modification.
(g)    Survey changes in user-satisfaction with primary health services by surveying
users of health centers at the beginning of the pilot period and users of family
physician offices at the end of the pilot period. The purpose of this survey is to
assess whether the improvements in training, facilities, equipment and
diagnostic support in PHC services are reflected in higher user satisfaction.
(h)    Establish data collection and a regular monitoring process (coordinated with the
National Burden of Disease study) for a set of primary care outcome indicators
to be collected during and after the pilot period, as a basis for producing an



- 41 -
evaluation report on the impact of the PHC system on health status within five
years of the end of the pilot period.
Elements of the Evaluation of the Project
6.     Using the above information, at the end of the life of the project, evaluations will be
carried out at the end of the project period to answer the following questions:
(a)    whether the project achieved the objectives of establishing a comprehensive
network of family physicians and an effective referral system, and if not, what
changes may be required to achieve this;
(b)    whether the project PHC system increased utilization rates of primary health
care and reduced rates of utilization of secondary health services, and if not,
what changes may be required to achieve these objectives;
(c)    whether the patient mix of referrals and self-referrals to secondary care
outpatients and Accident and Emergency services shifts under the pilot PHC
system to a mix with a larger share requiring specialist or hospital services;
(d)    whether the project PHC system provides lower cost first-contact health services
than secondary care outpatients and Accident and Emergency services and if not,
what changes to the PHC system or use of this system may be required to
increase cost effectiveness;
(e)    whether family physician practices are financially viable in urban and rural
settings, and in more and less developed provinces, and if not, what changes to
family physician cost structure or reimbursement regimes may be appropriate;
(f)    whether the family physician (and other PHC staff) ratios to population are
appropriate in the light of actual workload experienced in the project;
(g)    whether the numbers of Public Health Centers, their staff levels, and functions
are appropriate in the light of actual workload experienced in the project;
(h)    whether changes to training, PHCSIS, infrastructure or equipment would reduce
the costs or increase the benefits of the PHC system;
(i)    whether the PHC system is likely to be replicable in urban and rural areas, and
in more and less developed provinces, and whether modifications to the system
or its implementation are required in different settings (this will require analysis
of monitoring and survey information by district characteristics within the pilot
provinces).
7.     An evaluation report will be produced within a year of the end of the initial two-year
period with a follow up evaluation within a year of the implementation of the second phase of
the project. The project provides for technical assistance with evaluation, and assistance for
presentation and discussion of the evaluation results in a symposium. The purpose of the



- 42 -
symposium is to obtain feedback on the results and recommendations for responses to the
evaluation findings from appropriate national experts and stake-holders. The symposium should
therefore be attended by stakeholders and experts in the central MOH, representatives of other
key govemment departments such as the SPO, provincial health directorates, universities with
family physician and public health departments, etc.
