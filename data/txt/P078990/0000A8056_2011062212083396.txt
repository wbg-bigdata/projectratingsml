                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Ministry of Education has been complying with the agreed calendar dated December 2010 for the implementation of the remaining activities to be financed by the Project.

                         Several contracts for which the Government requested a six-month extension of the Project closing date have been completed. This includes the distribution of: (i) two computer
                         server units for the MINED network system; (ii) books for distribution to school libraries; (iii) various learning materials for the secondary non-formal education sector; (iv) school
                         supplies for primary schools in the non-formal education system; (v) 16 laptops for the Primary and Teacher Training Directorates of MINED; and (vi) the printing of learning materials
                         (guides, brochures, curriculum materials, and learning aids) for primary school teachers and school administrators.

                         The Ministry of Education requested in March 2011 to carry out another set of bidding processes in order to use the remaining Project funds available until June 30, 2011. The new
                         activities currently all under-way include the purchasing and distribution of: (i) primary school textbooks in mathematics to replace missing textbooks; (ii) teaching programs for
                         secondary school teachers; (iii) school supplies for primary and secondary schools; (iv) 5,500 school desks; (v) four vehicles; (vi) 19 laptops; and (vii) other computer equipments. All
                         the goods (some yet to be contracted) will be delivered before June 30, 2011. The total amount of the new contracts to be executed is estimated at US$1 million.

                         The Project has successfully contributed to the implementation of the Government Institutional Strengthening Plan for 2008-2011. Enrollment in early childhood (to 218,062 in 2009
                         from 199,422 in 2004) and secondary education (443,644 in 2009 from 394,347 in 2004) increased during the Project. Enrollment in primary education decreased by 1.5% over the
                         period (to 926,969 from 941,957) due in part to a decrease in the number of children of primary-school age. Net enrollment rates in early childhood (53%), primary (87%) and
                         secondary education (45%) are slightly below the expected targets of the Project. Student achievement on national standardized tests (baseline 2009) showed an increase in the
                         percentage of children achieving intermediate and proficient levels in 4th and 6th grades for Spanish and mathematics. Although these results can not be compared with the 2002 test
                         results, it is nonetheless encouraging to have a higher proportion of students achieving the new standards set by the Ministry of Education for learning outcomes. The Ministry of
                         Education completed the new collection of textbooks for all the grades of primary education. All the textbooks were distributed and are used in the classrooms contributing to
                         achieving a ratio of one textbook per child and per subject. The Project contributed to improving governance and institutional management capacity by training staff, improving
                         communication and setting up an education management information system (although not yet fully functional). The Ministry of Education regularly disseminated results of national
                         and international standardized tests in order to improve teaching practices in the classroom. This was an effort to provide better transparency on education quality and to empower
                         teachers in seeking to address teaching and learning weaknesses. The Ministry of Education until 2010 prepared a Common Work Program which provided a formal framework to
                         harmonize donor support in the education sector (a basket funding was in effect until this year). Donors worked together under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, which
                         organized at least twice a year education sector round tables and joint-review missions to discuss progress on the achievement of the Government Institutional Strengthening Plan
                         and future priorities. Donors together are currently supporting the Government efforts for preparing the new five-year Education Sector Plan.
