   1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

   1.1 Context at Appraisal

1. At the time of project preparation, the principal challenges in education were the low
   completion rate in primary education, low student learning levels, and limited capacity in
   the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECD) to manage the system. Only 50%
   of children who started grade 1 completed primary school and 20% completed secondary
   school. Domestic funding was limited while international donor financing was
   fragmented. Both the Government of Nicaragua (GoN) and donors gave high priority to
   education and the Completion Point on Highly Indebted Poor Countries debt relief
   required the passage of a school autonomy law. The Law of the Regime of Participative
   Education was passed in 2002, which provided incentives to schools to increase
   enrolment, through a formula based on per student financing, and accountability to
   parents through elected schools councils. The World Bank 2002 Country Assistance
   Strategy for the Republic of Nicaragua (CAS) supported this initiative, as did the ongoing
   series of Programmatic Structural Adjustment/Poverty Reduction Support Credits
   (PSACs/PRSCs). The CAS also supported greater country ownership and donor
   coordination, including specifically the GoN’s Common Work Plan (CWP) for all
   international donors, which incorporated common indicators for educational quality and
   harmonized financial management and disbursement procedures.

2. The Education Project in Nicaragua (PASEN), a Sector Investment Credit, was designed
   to support the GoN’s new approach in the education sector, and was approved by the
   Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank on September 2, 2004, becoming
   effective on March 17, 2005. The design of the PASEN was highly innovative. It
   incorporated new lessons from research on improving service delivery and accountability
   through community involvement and creation of incentives for front-line providers –
   which were elaborated in greater detail in the World Bank 2004 World Development
   Report “Making Services Work for Poor People? (WDR) – and envisaged new roles for
   the MECD, municipalities and schools in delivering education. The project’s approach to
   donor coordination and harmonization built on the recommendations of the 1999
   Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF) to enhance development results, the
   principles of which would become the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
   However, the school autonomy model encountered problems in implementation and
   began to lose support among key stakeholders in 2006, as schools lacked critical inputs
   and tensions arose between principals and elected school councils and other stakeholders.
   The MECD also abandoned the policy of per capita financing in March 2006. Finally, in
   November 2006, a new government was elected, which led to major policy and
   institutional changes in education. The renamed Ministry of Education (MINED) was re-
   organized, and the GoN’s new strategies, as described in the MINED’s 2008-2011
   Institutional Strengthening Plan (ISP), supported the improvement of the quality of
   preschool, primary and secondary education through the provision of key inputs to
   schools, and the establishment of a new decentralized and participative education
   management model. In order to realign the Project’s objectives with the renewed GoN



                                               1
   education sector plans, and due to earlier project implementation problems caused by an
   inadequate assessment of risks, a Board-approved restructuring of PASEN was
   sanctioned on June 30, 2008. (See Annex 2 for a timeline of project and country events.)

   1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

3. PDO. The Project aims to bring together donors and lenders to help the GoN implement
   its National Education Policy. Project objectives aim to: (i) increase enrollment for
   preschool, primary and secondary education; (ii) improve attention to quality and
   relevance of learning; (iii) improve systems of governance and accountability, including
   measures to strengthen community participation in the education sector; and (iv)
   harmonize donor assistance in the sector.

4. Key Indicators.1 (i) increased effective enrollment demand in autonomous schools; (ii)
   improved attention to student achievement on national standardized tests in Spanish and
   Mathematics for 3rd and 6th grades; (iii) increased # of autonomous schools as a % of all
   public schools; (iv) increased % of MECD employees hired by public recruitment
   process; (v) formal acceptance of 3 year rolling CWP evidenced by signed memorandum
   of understanding (MoU) by all donors; (vi) increased % of donor financing that shares
   harmonized financial management (FM) arrangements; (vii) increased # of donors
   attending joint supervision missions (as a % of total # of active donors).

   1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
   reasons/justification

5. The Project was restructured in June 2008 after extensive discussions with the new
   government that took office in early 2007, in order to realign the Project with the changed
   education sector policies and due to recurrent project implementation problems. The
   Project continued to support governance and accountability (including community
   participation), the improvement of the quality of education (including monitoring and
   dissemination of the learning outcomes from the national evaluation system), and
   international donor coordination. The improvement of the MINED’s institutional
   capacity and information systems was added (as compared to the improvement merely of
   MECD’s stewardship capacity to decentralized offices as a component under the original
   Project phase). The objective of increasing enrollment was dropped from the project
   (although it remained an imperative for MINED and other programs focused on this
   objective in the context of the CWP).

6. Revised PDO. The Project aims to bring together donors and lenders to help the GoN
   implement its 2008-2011 ISP, including the Education for All (EfA) goals. Project
   objectives aim to: (i) improve institutional management capacity and information systems
   to improve service delivery; (ii) improve systems of governance and accountability,
   including measures to strengthen community participation in the education sector; (iii)

   outcomes; and (iv) harmonize donor assistance in the education sector.

7. Revised Key Indicators.2 (i) student achievement on national standardized tests for 3rd
   grade (ii) student achievement on national standardized tests for 6th grade; (iii) textbook-
   to-student ratio for grades 1 to 3 of primary school; (iv) formal acceptance of a 3 year
   rolling CWP evidenced by signed MoU by all donors; (v) % of donor financing that
   shares harmonized FM arrangements; and (vi) # of donors attending joint supervision
   missions expressed as a % of total # of active donors.

   1.4 Main Beneficiaries

8. The main groups who benefitted from the Project were: (a) students, who benefit from
   the improved quality of inputs and better institutional design supported by the Project; (b)
   teachers, who participate in the training efforts of the Project; and (c) the MECD/MINED,
   which benefits from improved efficiency, including its testing strategy. Additionally, in
   its original design, the Project targeted students who were drawn into schools by its
   efforts to increase enrollment.

   1.5 Original Components (as approved)

9. Component 1: Strengthening the MECD Stewardship Capacity (US$3.41 million). To
   improve governance and accountability in the education sector. It had 2 subcomponents:
       Subcomponent 1.1: Stewardship at the Central Level, through (a) strengthening of the
   policy making, planning and budget formulation process of the MECD, and a clear
   definition of the roles and responsibilities of each level of the educational system; (b)
   professionalization of the civil service; and (c) sequenced process of reducing the size of
   the central unit of MECD.
       Subcomponent 2.2: Stewardship at the Municipal Level, to support capacity building
   at that level. Special attention would be paid to providing administrative and pedagogical
   support to schools, through a requirement of signed performance agreements between
   MECD and the municipalities where PASEN would be providing financing for the school
   autonomy program.

10. Component 2: Program Monitoring, Evaluation, and Continuous Auditing Systems
    (US$3.89 million). To improve the monitoring and evaluation function of the MECD, to
    contribute to accountability and education quality. It had 2 subcomponents:
        Subcomponent 2.1: Compilation, Analysis and Dissemination of Educational
    Statistics, with disbursement conditions for the strengthening of the educational statistical
    unit of MECD, and further financing conditional on the preparation and dissemination of
    agreed educational indicators in specifically determined outputs.

       Subcomponent 2.2: Evaluation of Competencies in Spanish and Mathematics for
   Primary and Secondary School Students, and a sound strategy of evaluation included in
   the government’s CWP. PASEN would contribute consulting services and software.

11. Component 3: Implementation of the School Autonomy Program (US$8.28 million). To
    provide finance for its implementation, through grants aimed directly to schools. The
    component would finance: (a) capitation grants for the increment in the effective
    enrollment of the school; and (b) the incorporation of 1,800 schools into the autonomy
    regime in the year 2006. Additionally, a signed performance agreement between MECD
    and the municipality was required in order for a grant to be made to schools.

12. Component 4: Pilot Program for Community Pre-Schools (US$0.12 million). To provide
    training and incentive payments to community preschool teachers, and didactic materials
    for teachers and students. Within the framework of the CWP, MECD would also revise
    the strategy for providing services to this level, with regulations in place regarding the
    age at entry for primary school and a better articulation with early childhood
    development services.

   1.6 Revised Components

13. Component 1: Institutional Strengthening of Management Capacities of the MINED
    (US$0.64 million, 7.09% of total undisbursed funds). Financed: (a) institutional
    strengthening workshops at department and municipal levels to implement and monitor
    the Decentralized and Participative Education Management Model, including the
    Autonomous Regional Education System (SEAR), which is in charge of the North and
    South Atlantic Autonomous Regions (RAAN and RAAS); (b) provision of a
    technological platform for the establishment of the National Management Information
    System (SNIGI) at central and departmental levels; and (c) technical support and
    planning tools to map the demand and supply of educational services.

14. Component 2: Quality Improvement of Preschool, Primary and Secondary Education
    (US$8.53 million, 93% of total amount of undisbursed funds). Had 4 subcomponents:
        Subcomponent 2.1: Establishment and Implementation of a National Strategy for
    Learning Assessments, to finance the development of the strategy (including the
    collection, dissemination and use of student learning outcomes for quality improvement
    interventions) and the construction of a baseline of learning outcomes (to evaluate the
    depth and effectiveness of the curriculum transformation process already underway).
        Subcomponent 2.2: Development of Learning Materials and Provision of Textbooks
    for pre-school and primary (in Spanish and Literature, Environmental Sciences, Social
    Studies, and Life Skills), and the provision of primary school libraries.
        Subcomponent 2.3: Quality Improvement Interventions in Targeted Rural Schools,
    including the development of teacher education workshops for multi-grade schools,
    provision of classroom materials, development of training workshops for pedagogical
    advisors at departmental level, and planning workshops for rural schools communities to
    develop local work plans to tailor activities to the local issues and circumstances.




                                                4
       Subcomponent 2.4: Quality Improvement Interventions Targeted to the Last Two
   Grades of Secondary Education, including the design, development and distribution of
   study guides in Spanish and Math, and the associated training of teachers.

   1.7 Other significant changes

   The main disbursement mechanism on the original project design was the capitation grant
   to schools under component 3. Due to challenges with the implementation of such
   formula (to be described below), school financing was modified by the government, and
   financing changed from being based on marginal enrollment to real expenditures (teacher
   costs). Project restructuring also made revisions to the financing plan, the allocation of
   credit proceeds and categories of disbursements, and the procurement plan. Finally, the
   Project closing date was extended on 3 occasions, from the original date of June 30,
   2008: first to December 30, 2009; second to December 31, 2010; and finally to June 30,
   2011.

   2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

   2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

15. The design of the Project was highly innovative and attempted to operationalize relatively
    new recommendations on decentralization, country ownership, and donor coordination.
    The project design was based on considerable technical analysis by both the World Bank
    and the GoN teams, including a MECD analysis of the CWP plan, and research by the
    Development Economics Research Group (DEC) on the positive impact of
    decentralization in the education sector. Academic documents, such as an assessment of
    lessons learned from Nicaragua’s school autonomy reform, were also reviewed3.

16. The scope of reforms supported by the Project was very ambitious, covering changes in
    governance, decentralization, accountability, results orientation and performance-based
    contracts. The risks of implementing such a wide-ranging reform were high and,
    although considered, were not sufficiently assessed at entry. The limited overall
    management and institutional capacity of the MECD was inadequately assessed
    (especially in regards to information monitoring capacity to track marginal changes in
    enrollment at the school level), although it was identified and efforts to mitigate this risk
    were written into the design of the Project (including financing technical assistance for
    municipal offices). However, some risks, such as the change of government and reversal
    of policies almost 3 years after Project approval, were difficult to anticipate at the time of
    preparation. Nevertheless, the risks proved to be substantial in delaying implementation
    of the first phase of the Project, which effectively interrupted almost all activities at mid-
    term, and contributed to the need for restructuring.

    A list of these documents can be found in the Project Appraisal Document (Report No. 29042-NI; May 28,
   2004).


                                                     5
17. The restructured design was more focused and successful in its assessment of the
    implementation risks, building upon the lessons learned from the original design. The
    World Bank team reacted promptly to re-align the Project design to the new government's
    priorities by supporting some of the key elements of the MINED’s 2008-11 ISP, such as
    financing essential inputs to schools (for instance, schools either had insufficient
    textbooks or the ones they had were outdated). The risk of continuous institutional
    reorganization within the MINED was recognized, and specific mitigation measures were
    included allocating responsibilities for sub-components to Directorates within the
    MINED and close project supervision by World Bank staff. Even so, it took a year after
    project restructuring for disbursement to resume, and the capacity of the government to
    hire trained procurement specialists was underestimated. However, the restructured
    Project succeeded in fulfilling most of its PDO and intermediate indicator targets.

   2.2 Implementation

18. The Project encountered problems in implementing the per capita funding formula almost
    from the beginning, leading to the adoption of an alternative financing mechanism by the
    government in March 2006. During the first year of project implementation enrollment
    stagnated, which jeopardized disbursements, as transfers to schools were based on growth
    in enrollment under component 3. Two main factors may have caused the registered
    decline in enrollment: (i) poor statistical capacity of the MECD that may not have
    produced accurate baseline levels; and (ii) a slight delay in project effectiveness
    prevented the per capita grant incentive for additional student enrollment to be fully
    operational at the start of the 2005 academic year (given lack of resources, in early 2005
    schools were reluctant to enroll students). In response, the MECD launched an initiative
    to encourage enrollment during the school year in which school principals were
    responsible for capturing additional students, adding 50,000 students.

19. The change of government in early 2007 implied a major change for project
    implementation, as some key policies that were supported by the Project were abandoned
    by April 2007. Project implementation had been rated satisfactory until October 2006, as
    the physical targets for the PDOs had been met for all components. Project disbursements
    were put on hold starting in December 2006, as were most activities starting in mid-2007,
    while the MINED established its new educational policies and completed its 2008-11
    ISP. Some time was also required to establish a good working relationship between the
    World Bank and the new government. The Project was then restructured in June 2008,
    which also served as the mid-term review. Implementation was slow after restructuring
    until late 2009, due to problems within the MINED such as continued staff turnover, lack
    of clarity about policies, lack of project implementation experience, and lack of
    familiarity with World Bank procurement rules and procedures. Implementation delays
    also reflected the difficulties associated with certain activities was underestimated – for
    instance, the unavailability of suitable candidates to be trained as teachers, particularly in
    rural areas and in RAAN (Region Autonoma Atlantico Norte) and RAAS (Region
    Autonoma Atlantico Sur), and the preparation of textbooks in some indigenous languages
    for the first time. However, Project implementation maintained an average rating of
    moderately satisfactory through closing.

   2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

20. Design. One of the innovative features of the Project was the incorporation of M&E into
    its development objectives of improving the quality of education (through measurement
    of student learning achievement) and the systems of governance and accountability
    (through implementation of a national strategy for student assessment). The project
    performance indicators and end targets were defined in collaboration with the GoN and
    the World Bank teams, and represented adequate and appropriate measures of project
    performance. However, some indicators for the PDOs of both Project phases were in
    some cases not clearly defined, leading to in inconsistencies between and within the text
    and annexes of the project documents (in the PAD of the original phase and in the
    Restructuring Project Paper of the restructured phase). In addition, the change in
    curriculum and national standardized tests during the restructured phase meant that
    baselines were not entirely comparable with the target indicators.

21. Implementation.      Baseline and indicator data was collected and monitored by
    MECD/MINED, using the already existing – albeit weak – information and monitoring
    systems within the institution. Although the indicators were deemed as adequate
    measures of Project performance, they were inadequately and inconsistently monitored,
    mostly due to inadequate capacity within the Ministry and local counterparts in terms of
    both insufficient staff and lack of technical expertise. For instance, in the case of the
    original Project, the PDO indicator of an increase in the percentage of MECD employees
    hired by public recruitment process was not monitored in implementation supervision
    reports (ISRs). Additionally, many of the original Project indicators ceased to be
    monitored after the new government took office and changed policies. Data was also not
    monitored as regularly as required, and there were monitoring delays throughout the
    project. However, steps were constantly being taken in efforts to improve this: in 2006,
    the MECD made some changes in management and technical staff that led to
    improvements; and the restructured Project design included financing to develop an
    implementation module to keep track of indicators and outcomes, though this was never
    fully developed. Standardized tests were implemented both phases of the project, but data
    processing was not automatized, which caused delays in the processing and the
    presentation of results to stakeholders.

22. Utilization. Some key educational indicators monitored under the restructured Project
    were universally shared with partners, such as the results of national standardized student
    assessments and the EfA-FTI Indicative Framework. Most importantly, the M&E
    activities implemented under both Project phases resulted in the development of the
    Manual for Educational Planning and Evaluation of Student Learning in Primary
    Education (Manual de Planeamiento Didáctico y Evaluación de los Aprendizajes en
    Educación Primaria), published in May 2010. It aims to serve as a guide to nationally
    standardize the quality of teaching and the assessment of student outcomes.

   2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

23. Safeguards. The Project was rated a Category C and the OP/BP 4.10 (Indigenous
    Peoples) safeguard policy was triggered. Both the original and restructured designs of


                                                7
   the Project included a strong emphasis on the development of quality education for
   indigenous populations – particularly in RAAN and RAAS where the majority of ethnic
   groups live – reflected in an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP). The Project
   also supported Law No. 162 of 1993 (which underlines the government’s commitment to
   the “development of bilingual and intercultural programs which respond to the needs of
   ethnic groups?), and Laws No. 28 of 2003 and 582 of 2006 (both of which grant the
   autonomous regions with the responsibility to financially manage the provision of
   education services). However, no activity targeted for indigenous populations in the
   original design was implemented (for example, no actions were taken to support RAAN
   and RAAS under Component 1). After the revision of the design, weak capacity of the
   autonomous regions and the need to adapt to local languages affected the speed of
   implementation of several activities, although the activities were indeed implemented.

24. Fiduciary. There were discrepancies in the interpretation of the per capita school grants
    (referring to original component 3). The Audit Report of 2005 and the Special Audit
    Report of 2010 found a discrepancy between government payments under the loan
    agreement and the refunds made by the Project: the government paid US$2,511,630 to
    schools, but the Project only reimbursed US$795,715. This stemmed from the fact that
    the government paid the grant to each school that increased its enrollment, without
    penalizing schools that “lose? students, while the Project reimbursed the government on
    the increase in aggregate enrollment, netting out student transfers between schools.

25. There were recurrent delays in the presentation of financial audits during the life of the
    Project, but the delays were more acute before restructuring, were particularly related to
    the school autonomy program, and were mostly due to implementation delays and low
    institutional capacity within the MECD.                 Also throughout the Project, the
    MECD/MINED demonstrated weaknesses of internal control systems, inadequate
    coordination between technical areas and the government’s FM Directorate, unreliable
    financial information mainly due to high staff turnover, and some delays in payments to
    providers. Thus, Interim Financial Reports and financial audits were frequently overdue,
    which in turn affected project implementation and created bottlenecks. The weak
    capacity at MECD/MINED to implement in a timely manner the procurement processes
    was also a major factor that delayed project implementation at various stages. Most
    crucially, the procurement unit of the MINED did not have the minimum fiduciary
    capacity or infrastructure to fulfill its responsibilities. Staff of the procurement unit had
    to be trained, and the Project financed several positions to improve performance (though
    it was difficult to recruit consultants) and provided routine technical support. However,
    in February 2011 MINED appointed a new Director of Procurement which caused
    improvements in the performance of the unit, and a new procurement plan was approved
    and published in March 2011.

   2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

26. The success of the activities under the restructured PASEN led to the development of a 4-
    year follow-up operation, currently under preparation and expected to be submitted to the
    World Bank’s Board of Directors in January 2012. The PASEN II supports increasing
    primary school retention and would continue financing activities begun under PASEN I,


                                                 8
   including the provision of textbooks and student learning materials, training of teachers,
   and capacity building for procurement and financial management in the MINED.
   Additionally, PASEN II would continue to finance the successful implementation of
   national and international standardized student assessments in Math and Spanish begun
   under PASEN I.

   3. Assessment of Outcomes

   3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

27. Project relevance is rated moderate for the original Project and substantial for the
    restructured Project. Some objectives of the original Project are no longer relevant to the
    education sector priorities of the GoN, but the objectives of the restructured Project
    remain relevant to the current priorities of both the GoN and the World Bank, including
    those defined in the MINED’s 2008-11 ISP and the World Bank’s 2007 Country
    Partnership Strategy for the Republic of Nicaragua for the Period FY 2008-2012 (CPS).
    The key objectives of the Project, however, remained the same throughout both phases,
    even though the means to achieve them changed.

   3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

28. The achievement of the project development objectives is rated moderate for the original
    Project and substantial for the revised Project. Despite the change in design and
    implementation difficulties, the achievements surpassed the shortcomings during the life
    of the Project: the favorable enrollment and dropout trends, and the improved results of
    student achievement on tests show clear improvements in education attainment;
    institutional capacity of the MECD/MINED increased; and a comprehensive mechanism
    for donor coordination and funding in the sector was established.

29. The timing of some political events and Project-related activities affected the outcome of
    some objectives, such as: in late 2005 a national curriculum reform began, concluding in
    mid 2007; in October 2006 the first national standardized test under the Project was
    applied; in November 2006 a new government was elected and took office in early 2007;
    the autonomous schools program was discontinued in 2007; in 2008 the Project was
    restructured; and 2 more national standardized tests were applied in 2009 and 2010.

   Original Project Objectives:

30. By the time of project restructuring, 48% of the credit proceeds had been disbursed, and
    most activities supporting the achievement of the original PDO targets were on track. Of
    the 4 original Project objectives, 3 were achieved and 1 was not achieved.

31. Objective i: Increase Enrollment for Preschool, Primary and Secondary Education. The
    key performance indicator (KPI) related to this objective was an increase in the effective
    enrollment demand in autonomous schools. The target for this KPI was for yearly
    increases of 3% in enrollment in autonomous schools. The number of autonomous



                                                9
   schools strongly increased between 2005 and 2007, therefore increasing the total
   enrollment in them, but the model was wrought with problems and eventually abandoned
   in April 2007. This indicator ceased to be monitored in mid-2006. Moreover, given
   adjustments in 2005 population census figures, it became difficult to ascertain the precise
   changes in the net enrollment ratio or effective enrollment. Nevertheless, it is clear that
   between 2004 and 2007, total enrollment in preschool, primary and secondary schools
   increased in Nicaragua, from 1.53 million to 1.62 million, a 5% increase. Another action
   realized under this objective was a reduction in the number of dropouts at primary and
   secondary school levels. The percentage of dropouts almost doubled between 2004 and
   2006, but rapidly decreased thereafter, especially in primary school. Thus, this objective
   was achieved.

32. Objective ii: Improve Attention to Quality and Relevance of Learning. The KPI related to
    this objective was an improved attention to student achievement on national standardized
    tests in Spanish and Mathematics for 3rd and 6th grades. The target was for the
    application of national standardized tests in years 1 and 3 (2005 and 2007) of the Project.
    However, as the tests were also administered in 2004, a decision was made jointly by the
    World Bank and the GoN to apply the tests instead in year 2, in order to have at least a 2-
    year gap with the previous round of tests, and so the tests were administered in 2006.
    The country also participated in the UNESCO regional student assessment test to
    benchmark student performance compared to other Latin American countries. Thus, this
    objective was achieved.

33. Objective iii: Improve Systems of Governance and Accountability, Including Measures to
    Strengthen Community Participation in the Education Sector. Two KPIs related to this
    objective. The first KPI was an increase in the number of autonomous schools as a
    percentage of all schools. The number of schools was monitored only until mid-2006,
    when the activities for this component were put on hold due to the changing educational
    priorities of the GoN. Additionally, from the beginning of the Project the school
    autonomy model had problems, and efforts to transfer schools were constrained by
    problems with the calculation of per capita funding, political sensitivities, lack of
    resources to train school staff in decentralized management, among others. The second
    KPI related to this objective was an increase in the percentage of MECD employees hired
    by public recruitment process, but activities for this objective were not implemented due
    to unclear goals within the MECD, and the indicator was never monitored. Thus, this
    objective was not achieved.

34. Objective iv: Harmonize Donor Assistance in the Sector. Three KPIs related to this
    objective. The first was the formal acceptance of a 3-year rolling CWP evidenced by
    signed MoU by all donors, where a CWP did not exist at the time of project effectiveness,
    and with an end target of an updated one in 2007. A MoU was signed in 2006, and a
    CWP was updated in 2006 and in 2007, even though the 2007 CWP was little used in
    practice due to the altering political environment at the time. The second KPI for this
    objective was an increase in the percentage of donor financing that shared harmonized
    FM arrangements, and the final KPI was an increase in the number of donors attending
    joint supervision missions expressed as a percentage of the total number of active donors.



                                                10
   The target for both KPIs was for at least 2 other donors to be sharing FM arrangements
   and attending joint missions, and these targets were exceeded: by the close of the original
   phase of the Project, 100% (more than 10) of the donors in the education sector were
   working in partnership. Thus, this objective was achieved.

   Revised Project Objectives:

35. Of the 4 restructured Project objectives, 3 were achieved and 1 was partially achieved.

36. Objective i: Improve Institutional Management Capacity and Information Systems to
    Improve Service Delivery. There were no KPIs directly linked to this objective.
    However, actions realized under this objective were successful, aiming towards the
    reduction of the average time lag (in number of days) to complete key processes and
    common transactions in the education sector (no baseline for number of days was
    established, but the general efficiency of processes increased, for example by
    development and continuous use of 7 modules of the SNIGI); and the strengthening of
    the SEAR to improve service delivery in the RAAN and RAAS (equipment was provided
    – such as computers, office equipment, boats – 21 modules of the SEAR were integrated,
    and information and communication technology (ICT) support for regional and municipal
    delegations was provided). Thus, this objective was partially achieved.

37. Objective ii: Improve Systems of Governance and Accountability, Including Measures to
    Strengthen Community Participation in the Education Sector. There were also no KPIs
    directly linked to this objective. However, an action implemented under this objective
    was the development of a national student assessment strategy. (The indicator
    monitoring this was renamed in July 2009 to the “development of a system for learning
    assessment at the primary level,? in order to correspond to the revised World Bank
    education sector core indicators.) A new strategy (linked to the implementation of the
    new primary education curriculum) was developed, and included the continued
    application of national standardized tests, but with modifications from the previous tests
    (although both versions were curriculum-based). The MINED successfully applied the
    first round of new student testing in November 2009 (referred to in the following
    paragraph for PDO iii), and results for these tests were published and disseminated in
    April 2011 to the regional and municipal education offices, participating schools, and the
    community. The new accountability mechanism also generated more voluntary
    involvement of parents in schools in the form of non-monetary work. An additional
    action implemented under this objective was the strengthening of the institutional
    capacity and improvement of the communication flows between governmental
    departments and schools (equipment was provided to departments, especially ICT
    equipment, and staff in the departments were trained, specifically those in charge of
    statistics and information technology). Thus, this objective was achieved.

38. Objective iii: Improve the Quality of Education Through Monitoring and Disseminating
    Student Learning Outcomes. Three KPIs related to this objective. The first 2 were the
    measurement of student achievement on national standardized tests in Spanish and
    Mathematics for 3rd and 6th grades, respectively. Changes to the primary education



                                               11
   curriculum established in 2007, on which subsequent tests were based, meant that the
   latter were not comparable to the previous test baselines in Spanish and Math established
   in 2002, 2004, and 2006. Therefore, the MINED decided to collect a new student
   learning assessment baseline for grades 4 (rather than 3), 6, 9 and 11 based on the new
   curriculum. Tests for the 4th, 6th and 9th grades were conducted in 2009 and 2010 (the
   11th grade test was dropped by the MINED), and the results disseminated. The results for
   the 2009 test also served to establish a national baseline to measure learning
   achievements, and a pilot testing in 11th grade will take place in 2014. More importantly,
   even though the results of these tests are not strictly comparable with the 2006 baseline
   data, the 2009 test results show a large percentage of students achieving the intermediate
   and proficient levels in both Spanish and Math, which is an indication that students were
   meeting the learning standards of the new curriculum and is a trend in the right direction.
   The third KPI under this objective was an improvement in the textbook-to-student ratio
   for grades 1 to 3 of primary school. The Project’s end target was for 100% of students in
   all 3 grades to have books in Spanish, Math and Life Skills, and this was achieved. New
   pedagogical materials (textbooks, workbooks and teacher guides) for early childhood
   education and all the grades of primary school were also produced. Additionally, the
   actual unit cost of the books was below the original estimated cost, generating great cost
   savings in their acquisition and allowing for the purchasing and distribution of extra
   books, including an additional 35,000 Math primary school textbooks to replace some
   that were missing. With this, a ratio of 1 textbook per subject matter per child was also
   achieved. A further action realized under this objective was the reduction in the
   percentage of unqualified teachers in rural schools and disadvantaged regions, as
   professional training programs for pedagogic advisors, multi-grade primary schools
   teachers, and Spanish and Math secondary teachers were launched in primary schools in
   rural areas. Thus, this objective was achieved.

39. Objective iv: Harmonize Donor Assistance in the Education Sector. Three KPIs related
    to this objective. The first indicator was the formal acceptance of a 3-year rolling CWP
    evidenced by signed MoU by all donors, and had as a target that the MINED’s 2008-11
    ISP be adopted by donors, and that a MoU and/or Partnership Agreement be developed
    between the MINED and local donors. This target was achieved as all donors developed
    and signed the 2010 CWP, and adopted the ISP. However, MINED published its new
    2011-2015 Education Sector Plan in August 2011, replacing the CWPs henceforth. The
    second KPI was the percentage of donor financing that shared harmonized FM
    arrangements. The target was for there to be 3 donors in the common basket and the rest
    supporting the MINED’s 2008-11 ISP, and this target was exceeded, with 4 donors in the
    basket even before project completion and all donors supporting the ISP. The final KPI
    measured under this objective was the number of donors attending joint supervision
    missions expressed as a percentage of total number of active donors, for which the target
    was for 90% of donors to be attending by Project completion. This indicator also
    exceeded its target, with 100% of the donors attending the joint supervision missions. All
    the donors involved in the education sector met 3 times a year to review progress in the
    sector, improve the harmonization of their interventions in reference with the MINED’s
    sector policy, and discuss the sector plan. Therefore, this objective was achieved.




                                               12
   3.3 Efficiency

40. PASEN provided broad support to the education system in Nicaragua that clearly
    contributed to the improvement in education indicators registered by the country during
    its implementation years. Based on household data between 2005 and 2009, the
    education attainment for the particular cohort that started schooling around 2005 is
    expected to increase by 0.53 years of education. The gains would reflect a larger share of
    students finishing primary and staring secondary education. The data also shows that the
    education attainment was concentrated in the populations with fewer economic resources,
    as the attainment of the 2 poorest quintiles increased by almost a full year of education.
    As a result of the improvement in education attainment, an increase of US$500 in life
    income (up to age 65 and discounted at 5%) is expected, while the additional cost to the
    education system of providing the extra education is calculated at US$100 (see Annex 3).
    The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 0.13. A faster implementation of the product would
    have had a higher implementation of students’ outcomes. Thus, the economic efficiency
    of the Project was moderate.

   3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

41. The relevance of the Project is rated moderate for the original phase and substantial for
    the restructured phase; the achievement of PDOs is rated moderate for the original phase
    and substantial for the restructured phase; and the economic efficiency of the Project is
    rated moderate through both phases. Thus, the overall outcome of PASEN is rated
    moderately satisfactory.

   3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

   (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

42. A Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) carried out for the Project included
    consultations with the Regional Autonomous Education Councils of RAAN and RAAS,
    the Intercultural Bilingual Program Coordination, the National Preschool and Primary
    Education Directorates, and other relevant international donors. The PSIA also reviewed
    various World Bank and GoN data and documents on the education sector in indigenous
    and Afro-Caribbean territories in Nicaragua. The original Project design supported
    Nicaragua’s National Development Plan, which emphasized improving social inclusion
    in education and MECD’s stewardship role to transfer decentralization of administrative
    and pedagogical functions to the economically disadvantaged regions of RAAN and
    RAAS.      The restructured Project design continued to support the institutional
    strengthening of the MINED but also placed greater emphasis on improving the quality
    of service delivery in remote rural communities and in the RAAN and RAAS, in order to
    reach impoverished indigenous communities with a larger package of services. These
    communities were also actively involved in the development of targeted interventions
    that were culturally relevant. The national evaluation strategy that PASEN implemented
    also included an ethnic variable in the M&E system at the central, regional and local
    levels.


                                                 13
   (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

43. Institutional strengthening, capacity building, accountability and governance within the
    MECD/MINED were explicit objectives of PASEN, as the weak managerial and
    institutional capacity of the Ministry was negatively affecting educational quality within
    Nicaragua for years. Despite some shortcomings in fully achieving these objectives,
    contributions the PASEN made to institutional strengthening include: (i) the creation and
    implementation of a national student assessment strategy, which can improve learning
    outcomes; (ii) the strengthening of communication flow between governmental
    departments and schools; (iii) the development of a national management information
    system, which can improve efficiency; (iv) the training of MINED divisions on how to
    plan and execute institutional activities, such as drafting terms of references, preparing
    budgets and following up on implementation; and (v) the coordination of donor financing,
    which ameliorated the problems of governance and accountability that were being caused
    by the fragmented efforts of donors.

   (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

44. Not Applicable

   3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

45. Not Applicable

   4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Moderate

46. The overall risk to the development outcomes of the restructured Project is moderate,
    mostly due to the risk that there could be continued changes in policy. However, the
    follow-up project PASEN II will continue to aid the strengthening of institutional
    capacity and stability within the MINED. In addition, a strategy for increasing
    enrollment and improving teaching quality in preschools (an aim of component 4 under
    the original design) is currently being finalized by the GoN, and the 11th grade national
    standardized tests will be applied in late 2011. In regards to harmonized donor financing
    and coordination, although this was accomplished under the Project, the common
    financial basket was dissolved after June 2011 following announcements by Canada,
    Netherlands and Denmark that they would not finance education anymore. However, the
    E.U. will continue supporting education and will participate in a new partnership that is
    being established with the World Bank, IDA and the Global Partnership for Education
    (EfA-FTI), expected to become effective in June 2012.

   5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

   5.1 Bank Performance
   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory


                                               14
47. The World Bank team worked closely and collaborated well with the GoN in preparing
    both the original and revised Project designs, bringing in relevant technical expertise and
    restructuring PDOs appropriately when the GoN priorities were revised. Nevertheless,
    many of the operational details of the per capita funding formula were not worked out in
    detail, nor were some implementation risks to the original project design adequately
    assessed at entry (especially the instability surrounding the autonomous schools program
    and the limited institutional capacity of the MECD), leading to significant
    implementation delays.

   (b) Quality of Supervision
   Rating: Satisfactory

48. Regular bi-annual supervision missions including the appropriate technical specialists
    were conducted by the World Bank team throughout the Project. Supervision teams
    always noted issues that needed immediate attention, constantly monitored the
    accomplishments (or lack thereof) of activities, and continuously provided technical
    assistance to MECD/MINED on how to improve planning and implementation of project
    activities. The World Bank continued supervision during the political transition,
    although it became more difficult due to constant changes in leadership within the
    MINED and lack of clarity on the new strategy. Once the Project was restructured and
    the new GoN education strategy was established, supervision was able to resume normal
    activity, with a few periods of more intense and frequent supervision in order to
    accelerate implementation and prevent further delays. Three changes in project TTL
    during the life of the project did not affect supervision efficiency.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

49. The original Project design was highly innovative and the shortcomings in the quality of
    entry were partly related to lack of experience in implementing reforms of this scale. The
    World Bank team identified problems in implementation and also showed a high level of
    flexibility when confronted with changed priorities and institutional arrangements, and
    adapted the Project design accordingly in order to support educational outcomes in
    Nicaragua. Thus, the overall performance of the World Bank is rated moderately
    satisfactory.

   5.2 Borrower Performance
   (a) Government Performance
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

50. The commitment to the Project by both administrations was evident throughout, as
    education remained a policy priority, with the current administration emphasizing
    improvements in the quality of education. Additionally, there was strong support from the
    Ministry of Finance on fiduciary issues. The change in policies and approach between
    the 2 administrations, however, contributed to implementation delays, and the World



                                                15
   Bank team experienced some operational difficulties in its cooperation with the
   government.

   (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
   Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

51. The main challenge throughout the life of the Project was the weak institutional capacity
    within the MECD/MINED, but especially during the original phase. At times, there was
    no specific unit within the MECD in charge of the Project. The MECD/MINED made
    continuous efforts to address these difficulties – albeit with mixed success – including
    efforts to ensure implementation readiness while waiting for the restructured project
    proposal to be approved, by preparing detailed arrangements to maximize coordination
    across National Directorates accountable for the implementation of the restructured
    package. Project restructuring also caused a renewed emphasis in implementation efforts
    within the MINED, and it made noticeable efforts to increase the pace whenever there
    were delays and rating downgrades (including more systematic monitoring and
    supervision as well as the personal involvement of the Minister of Education), usually
    with successful results. The main shortcoming during this phase was the lack of capacity
    of the procurement unit within MINED. However, a new Director of Procurement was
    hired in February 2011 in order to ensure successful completion of Project activities
    before June 2011.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

52. Since the commitment of the GoN and the MECD/MINED to the Project was strong, and
    compensated for the weak institutional capacity of some of the units of the implementing
    agency, the rating for overall Borrower performance is moderately satisfactory.

   6. Lessons Learned

53. Feasibility of new initiatives should be piloted, evaluated and tested before scaling up.
    In order for PASEN to work smoothly, the per-capitation grant mechanism had to be
    fully operational, making it important to track students as they entered and exited the
    educational system and transferred across schools. Future projects that have per capita
    grant mechanisms should ensure the existence of sound information systems that allow
    the tracking of individual students. Given the importance of information systems in
    terms of providing positive externalities to the education system beyond the monitoring
    grants, such information systems and their use should also be piloted in advance before
    scaling up.

54. Risks associated with changes of incentives, accountability mechanisms, and institutional
    mandates need to be clearly spelt out and mitigation measures adopted. The inadequate
    assessment of risks at the beginning of the original Project design was a major factor in
    the discontinuity of certain activities and in the need for restructuring. Support of all
    stakeholders matters, and it is important to maintain coalitions to support reforms.



                                               16
   Project preparation should clearly identify possible fragile points in the coalitions to
   support reforms. Even though identifying the exact reasons why the government decided
   to abandon the school autonomy program goes beyond this document, there is evidence
   of dissatisfaction with the model from parents and teachers at its early stages, in most
   cases due to challenges in the relationship with principals.

55. As the focus on education remains centered on quality, efforts to measure it should
    guarantee comparability through time. The original and the restructured Project designs
    had 2 very different concepts of decentralization embedded in them, with different
    accountability mechanisms – in the original design, decentralization was at the school
    level, while during the restructured design, decentralization was at the departmental level.
    Nonetheless, under both approaches, information is the key to accountability. But
    information coming from test can be affected by curriculum changes. Therefore, in order
    to achieve comparability through time tests could focus on student competences.
    Another option to assess evolution of the education system is to participate in
    international tests to provide benchmarks through time. These considerations have been
    taken into account in the design of the new project.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

(A timeline of Project and country events can be found at the end of this annex.)

Original Design Components:

One representative intermediate outcome indicator per component was measured. Other
indicators were qualitative and thus not measured, but corresponding activities were
implemented and monitored. In addition, almost all original component activities were
put on hold starting in mid-2007 while the MINED finished establishing its new
educational policies and completed its ISP 2008-11.

Component 1: Strengthening the MECD Stewardship Capacity. The representative
indicator for this component was an increase in the number of signed performance
agreements between MECD and municipalities with 100% of autonomous schools. The
autonomous schools program was dismantled by the GoN in April 2007, and thus this
indicator ceased to be measured. However, by the end of 2006, the target of 50
performance agreements had been signed, thus this target was achieved. Further
activities that had been achieved by the time of project restructuring included the
establishment of a decentralized and participative education management model, and the
establishment of an Education Management Information System at the central and
departmental levels.

Other qualitative intermediate indicators under this component were: the development
and full implementation of an action plan for modernization of the MECD designed with
the technical assistance of a management firm hired through an international competitive
bidding process; the percentage of reduction in centralized expenditures of MECD; the
number of supervision visits by municipal support staff to autonomous schools; and the
number of qualified technical staff in municipal supervision teams. By the time of
project restructuring, the implementation of the first phase of a modernization plan for the
MECD was underway, encompassing: an in-depth institutional assessment; conceptual
design of a reengineering plan; design of organizational systems aimed at improving
functions; and institutional processes and transactions to improve: planning and
management, quality assurance mechanisms, communication flows, human resource
planning, and regulation and certification of educational programs and learning
institutions. Additionally, supervision capacity and logistical support was being
strengthened to implement decentralization policies and programs, and the associated
staff training had also been completed to improve pedagogical supervision of schools and
institution-based planning, budgeting and management.

Component 2: Program Monitoring, Evaluation, and Continuous Auditing Systems. This
component aimed at improving the monitoring and evaluation function of the MECD,
and the performance indicator was the full dissemination of student testing results
analyses to all classrooms and school communities, highlighting suggested areas of
correction. This was done by means of Student Report Cards. The original target was for
item-wise analyses to have been distributed to all public schools by the end of 2006.



                                            19
However, this activity and the Student Report Card initiative were discontinued by the
new GoN administration in July 2007 due to its changing educational policies. Before it
was discontinued, the tests had been applied, the results had been gathered and digitalized,
and the data analysis and dissemination processes were being initiated, thus this target
was partially achieved. The World Bank team expressed concern to the GoN over the
discontinuation of this activity, as the objective was to rigorously measure how
information and the participation of the community in education could improve the
quality of the service. Additionally, the government later continued to disseminate the
results through municipal and departmental MINED offices.

Other activities under this component that had been implemented successfully by the time
of project restructuring included the design, development and distribution of study guides
for the 4th and 5th years of secondary education in Spanish and Mathematics, and the
associated training for teachers in their use and classroom application; the development
of learning materials and provision of textbooks for primary schools; and the
development and implementation of professional development activities for school
pedagogic advisors and multi-grade teachers in targeted rural schools.

The qualitative indicators for this component were: random surveys on school council
members’ awareness of the contents of their school’s report card; the number of schools
with school development plans using educational statistics; the number of municipal
agreements with educations statistics as part of the agreement; periodic testing of students
in the areas of Spanish and Mathematics carried out at the primary and secondary school
levels; periodic observation of teacher methodology and interaction in the classroom
carried out; and results of the teacher observations disseminated to all classrooms and
school communities.

Component 3: Implementation of the School Autonomy Program. This component
provided finance for the implementation of the program, through grants aimed directly to
schools to increase effective enrollment and incorporate schools into the program. This
component faced continuous challenges throughout its implementation, such as teachers
being hired under precarious conditions and students paying large school fees.
Additionally, there was weak capacity in the MECD to effectively monitor additional
student enrollment and misunderstanding of the implications of the per capita financing
formula – but most importantly, there was mixed support towards the school autonomy
program even before it was discontinued by the new GoN administration in April 2007.
However, there was flexibility the part of the World Bank and the GoN to adapt to these
challenges and many activities were implemented.

The indicator that measured achievement of this component was to carry out a study that
analyzed the variation in performance among autonomous schools. The target was for
this study to be performed by the end of 2006, and for it to then be carried out across
municipalities by the end of 2007. A national student assessment was carried out in
October 2006 and the preliminary results were presented in November 2007. However,
since the school autonomy program was discontinued, the study was never extended
across municipalities, thus this target was partially achieved.       Other activities



                                            20
implemented under this component by the end of 2006 included: the incorporation of
almost 80% (1,800 schools) of the total number of primary and secondary schools into
the Autonomous School Model (registering an additional net increase in enrollment of
21,000 in a 2-year period); and the development of a program to support children aged 6
to 9 who were identified as being at risk of dropping out in the first 2 years of primary
education (reaching and retaining 55,000 students in a 2-year period).

Component 4: Pilot Program for Community Preschools. This component aimed at
providing payments to preschools in order to increase their enrollment and improve
teaching quality. Qualitative indicators were the enrollment of children in the pilot
preschools and an evaluation of the pilot. The achievement of this component would be
measured by the elaboration of a strategy and financing plan for the attendance of
children in the pilot preschools, with the target being for the strategy to be included in the
updated CWP by the end of 2005. All activities under this component were implemented
during the first 2 years of the Project, including: provision of incentive payments to
teachers; training of teachers; provision of didactic materials for teachers and students;
execution of a primary school readiness program (to prepare students aged 5 and 6
identified as at-risk of not enrolling on time in the 1st grade, which reached about 17,000
children); and preparation of a draft action plan to consolidate and improve community
preschool programs. The preschool strategy was not elaborated, this component was put
on hold by the GoN in mid-2007, and measurement of this indicator was discontinued,
thus this target was not achieved. However, a strategy for preschool is currently being
finalized by the GoN.

Restructured Design Components:

The Project achieved most targets for the intermediate results indicators of the
restructured components.

Component 1: Institutional Strengthening of Management Capacities of the MINED. The
activities under this component were successfully implemented, with their outcome
indicators either achieving or exceeding their targets, or falling insignificantly short.
Much of this components’ activities contributed to the MINED’s Global and Integrated
Model for School Organization and Curriculum Management for primary and secondary
education, in terms of education quality improvement. The indicators for this component
were:

   The percentage of departmental delegations and municipalities implementing the new
    decentralized and participatory education management model.
The target for this indicator was completely achieved, as the new model was being used
throughout the country by 100% of delegations and municipalities even before project
closing. 2,216 MINED staff of departmental delegations, municipalities and schools
were trained on: human resources management, administration, finance, educational
planning and education statistics.




                                             21
  Percentage of departmental delegations and municipalities equipped with information
   communication technology (ICT) to implement the National Management
   Information System (SNIGI).
The target for this indicator was also completely achieved, as 100% of delegations and
municipalities had received ICT to implement the SNIGI also before project closing. The
Project financed the purchase of computers, printers, motorcycles, cellular phones, fax
machines, office furniture, and generators to ensure good quality communication and
management within and between the local and central levels.

 Improvement in the percent of budget execution.
This indicator fell insignificantly short of its target due to not being able to overcome
delays resulting from changed GoN educational policies and project restructuring, which
in turn caused implementation delays in project activities. The target was for an
improvement reaching 96% while the actual value was 95.1%. However, it is still a
commendable achievement.

   Number of modules of the SNIGI integrated at the end of 2008 and number of
    modules implemented at the end of 2009.
This indicator exceeded its target of 16 modules by project closing with the elaboration of
31 modules and the implementation of 26 (19 at the central level and 7 in the education
offices of the departmental delegations). The development of the system platform,
however, requires further training of IT specialists at the decentralized level. The
provision of ICT equipment by the Project aided in the success of the implementation of
these modules. Additionally, although the Project closed, the success of this activity
encouraged MINED to continue to finance the development of the SNIGI.

Component 2: Quality Improvement of Primary and Secondary Education. The activities
under this component were also successfully implemented, with most of their outcome
indicators either achieving or exceeding their targets. The outcome indicators for this
component were:

 Dissemination of 2006 national student test results in 768 schools.
 Dissemination of 2006 national and international student test results in 239 schools.
The targets for these indicators were achieved, thanks in part to the strong commitment
towards student testing by the GoN which facilitated the implementation of the national
and international tests and their related measures. For the national tests, 22 workshops
were organized at the departmental level and all of the 768 schools participating in the
2006 national standardized test received a detailed school result report. 443 school
directors, 1,062 teachers and 144 pedagogical advisors participated in the workshops.
For the international tests, 11 workshops were organized at the departmental level and
230 schools (96%) participating in the 2006 international standardized test received a
detailed school result report. 214 school directors, 429 teachers and 134 pedagogical
advisors participated in the workshops.

   Number of teachers and school principals participating in the dissemination
    workshops for the national tests.


                                            22
   Number of teachers and school principals participating in the dissemination
    workshops for the international tests.
The targets set for these indicators were estimated numbers, and though they were not
achieved, the actual number of teachers and principals participating in the workshops
corresponded to representative samples of all schools participating in the tests. For the
national test workshops, 1,649 were trained while the initial target was of 2,465 (768
directors; 1,536 teachers; 161 pedagogical advisors) – corresponding to 33% below the
estimated target. 22 workshops were organized at the departmental level with the
participation of 443 school directors, 1,062 teachers and 144 pedagogical advisors. For
the international test workshops, 777 were trained while the initial target was of 864 (239
directors; 478 teachers; 147 pedagogical advisors) – corresponding to 10% below the
estimated target. 11 workshops were organized at the departmental level with the
participation of 214 school directors, 429 teachers and 134 pedagogical advisors.

   Number of schools receiving teaching guides in Spanish and Mathematics for the 3rd
    and 6th grades in primary, to improve the pedagogical practices of teachers.
The target for this indicator was exceeded, as 34,350 teaching guides in Spanish and
Mathematics were distributed to 9,000 primary schools, while the aim was for 9,000
guides. The teaching guides were also based on an analysis of the 2006 national
standardized test results.

   Round of student tests in Spanish and Mathematics for grades 4 and 6 of primary
    school, and 9 and 11 (3rd and 5th year) of secondary school at the beginning of 2009 in
    30% of schools participating in training courses.
Here again the target was an estimated number, and while the actual value achieved did
not reach 30%, it still corresponded to a nationally representative sample of schools and
students. Schools could not be selected on the basis of having participated in a training
course if one wanted to have a national representative sample to apply the standardized
test. 517 schools participated in the 2009 national standardized test in Spanish and
Mathematics covering a total of 16,359 students in 4th, 6th and 9th grades. The test in 11th
grade was not applied in 2009 because the MINED dropped it due to the new changed
curriculum, and it will now be applied in late 2011.

   Development of a baseline for 2009 student test results to improve the curricular
    transformation initiative.
The target for this indicator was achieved. The national standardized student test for 4 th,
6th and 9th grades was carried out in November 2009 and results were published in April
2011, therefore establishing the baseline for student learning achievements for Spanish
and Mathematics in these grades. The baseline for 11th grade will be collected at the end
of 2011 after the new national standardized test is applied.

   National strategy for learning assessments developed that includes rounds of national
    tests according to MINED criteria.
This target was achieved, as the national tests were applied (as aforementioned) and a
national strategy was developed.



                                            23
   Number of authors participating in the design and validation of the textbook design
    for 1st through 6th grades of primary school in the areas of Spanish and Literature, Life
    and Environmental Sciences, Social Studies, and Life Skills.
The target for this indicator was exceeded, as more than the targeted 30 authors were
hired to design the textbooks. The initial target was an estimated number predicted in
June 2008, and ultimately the high volume of work required to design the textbooks
(including preparing new teaching materials in 5 local languages of the RAAN and
RAAS) caused the hiring of more authors.

 1st to 3rd grade textbooks in Spanish and Life Skills printed and distributed.
The target was exceeded, as 1,120,252 was the total number of books printed and
distributed, and 974,134 was the target. For Spanish & Literature, the number was
318,858 1st grade, 215,713 2nd grade; and 184,984 3rd grade books. For Life Skills, the
number was 215,713 2nd grade; and 184,984 3rd grade books. All these categories
exceeded their individual targets as well. The number of books exceeded the target due
to the actual unit cost of the books being below the original estimated cost.

   Number of departmental and municipal staff members trained according to the
    formation plan.
A training plan was implemented and the target for this indicator was exceeded, as almost
double the targeted number was trained: 324 staff of departmental and municipal
education offices trained, while the target was 181.

   Number of pedagogical advisors trained in classroom techniques, statistics
    management, communication and leadership.
A training plan was implemented and the target was also exceeded, with almost four
times more the targeted number receiving training: 1,356 pedagogical advisors were
trained by the end of the Project, while the target was 344. 344 pedagogical advisors
participated in monthly workshops with primary school teachers called Educational
Evaluation, Planning and Training Workshops (TEPCEs) in 2007 and 2008, around 806
in 2009 and 2010, and 206 in 2011.

 Number of rural teachers trained in pedagogical techniques for multi-grade settings.
This indicator was another one whose target was exceeded. A training plan was
implemented and while the target was for 1,000 teachers to be trained, 1,424 multi-grade
rural primary school teachers were actually trained (1,000 in 2010 and 424 in 2011).

   Study guides for 4th and 5th year of secondary education in the areas of Mathematics
    and Spanish developed and distributed.
This indicator fell short of its target of 60,000 study guides, producing and distributing
instead a total of 35,000 guides (17,500 in Mathematics and 17,500 in Spanish) to subject
teachers and to secondary school libraries to be used by students enrolled in 10th and 11th
grades. The study guides were intended to provide extra help and training for students
preparing the university entry exam. This indicator fell short of its target due to not being
able to overcome implementation delays resulting from project restructuring, the MINED

responsible for preparing new teaching materials in local languages.

   Number of secondary teachers trained in Mathematics and Spanish in the usage of
    study guides.
Study guides were designed and a training plan was implemented, training 2,309 teachers
in the use of the Spanish and Math guides (922 Mathematics and 992 Spanish secondary
school teachers in 2010, and 239 Mathematics and 226 Spanish teachers in 2011). This
number also exceeded the target, which was of 1,984.

   Number of workshops for rural multi-grade teachers in planning and evaluation of
    curricular activities (strategic planning workshops to improve the quality of education
    – TEPCEs).
15 TEPCEs for rural multi-grade teachers were implemented successfully, 4 more than
the targeted 11. 11 TEPCEs were carried out in 2009 and 2010, and 4 in 2011, for a total
424 multi-grade rural primary school teachers of 28 municipalities trained.

Other activities under this component that were successfully implemented included: the
purchasing and distribution of primary school textbooks in Mathematics to replace
missing textbooks; training programs for secondary school teachers; the provision of
school supplies for primary and secondary schools; 5,500 school desks; and 4 vehicles.
Furthermore, additional activities were added to the Project in early 2011 because of the
availability of remaining funds or were already included in the project action plan but
were only expected to be completed during the first semester of 2011. These included:
(a) the finalization of the elaboration of workbooks and teacher guides for the three
grades of preschool in five local languages of the RAAN and RAAS; (b) the printing of
the curricular program for preschool; (c) the elaboration of 10 teacher training modules in
bilingual education in the RAAN and RAAS; (d) the elaboration of a first draft report on
the Autonomous Regions socio-education diagnostic; (e) the distribution of workbooks
for the third graders of preschool (excluding the Autonomous Regions) and 11,158
packages of school supply for preschools; and (f) the printing and distribution of a
complete set of programs and modules for teachers and students in the accelerated over-
age primary school program.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

During the implementation of PASEN, Nicaragua maintained the upward trend in
education attainment of its school age population, an evolution that has a strong potential
to increase the lifetime earning of individuals that receive more years of education and, at
the same time, to create externalities that could improve long-term economic growth
performance. Given that the Project supported a broad set of activities, including broader
coordination with other donor agencies, it is impossible to single out the specific impact
of PASEN. Nonetheless, this economic analysis presents the broad impact of education
changes in Nicaragua, and clearly justifies interventions in education.

This economic analysis calculates potential life changes in income for those students that
were entering into school at the start of the Project in 2005. Based on changes in
education attainment registered in 2009, it was expected that the educational attainment
for that particular cohort would increase in 0.53 years of education. The gains reflect a
larger share of students finishing primary education, and starting secondary education
(see Figure 1).

                                                                 Figure 1:

As a result of the improvement in education attainment, an increase of US$500 4 in
discounted life income (up to age 65) is expected, while the additional cost to the
education system of providing the extra education is calculated at US$100 (see Table 1).
The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is a solid 0.13.

  At a discount rate of 5%. Given that PASEN beneficiaries would have been in school only for
approximately 5 years, the extra years of education are calculated following the enrollment patterns of
older cohorts.

  Includes a projection of education attainment for those still in school.

Household data shows that gains in education attainment between 2005 and 2009 have
concentrated in the populations with fewer economic resources. As presented in Figure 2,
in 2005 the education attainment of the 2 poorest quintiles in Nicaragua was 4.97 years of
education, while the education attainment registered in 2009 was 5.92 years, an increase
of almost a full year. During the same interval, the education attainment for the
population of 15 year olds increased from 5.66 to 6.05 years, approximately a half year.

Given the population dynamics and greater educational attainment, total costs of
education for this particular cohort increased by US$31 million. The PASEN
contribution for this particular generation was approximately US$2 million (US$10
million benefitting 6 generations), a relatively small share of total additional costs. The
economic analysis shows that the expected lifetime income gain for this cohort is
approximately US$390 million. This clearly justifies further investments in education,
like the ones supported by PASEN.

PART 1: Borrower ICR

This report contains an analysis of the Education Sector Support Project in Nicaragua –
PASEN – implemented from 2005 to 2011, in line with the completion of the Project.

II) GENERAL ASPECTS

A. BACKGROUND:

In September 2004, the International Development Association – IDA – agreed with the
Republic of Nicaragua to start the implementation of the Project to Support the Education
Sector in Nicaragua – PASEN – in the form of a loan.

The IDA agreed to lend the Republic of Nicaragua the amount of SDR 10,400,000.00,
equivalent to US$15,000,000.00.

In March 2005 the Project began implementing the PASEN project agreement, whose
total cost increased to US$15,700,000.00, of which US$15,000,000.00 were funded by
the World Bank and US$700,000.00 were counterpart resources from the National
Treasury.

The PASEN project mainly supported preschool and primary educational programs, as
well as institutional strengthening, emphasizing its contribution to the implementation of
the National Student Assessment.

The new restructuring of the Project starting in 2008 redesigned the Project, adjusting to
the new policies, perspectives and goals of the Government of National Unity and
Reconciliation – GRUN – towards a model of participatory and decentralized education
management in order to contribute to the transformation of the curriculum in elementary
and secondary education, including the Caribbean coast through the Autonomous
Regional Education System – SEAR.

B. PROJECT COMPONENTS:

The PASEN project initially comprised 4 components to run through 2005 to 2007
focused on the management policy within the model of education system decentralization
and of school autonomy.

In 2007 the GRUN assumed the administration of the government at which time the
scope of the Project was reviewed and it was decided to restructure the components
moving towards a model of participatory and decentralized education management.



                                           33
In 2008, the restructuring of the Project is implemented focusing on the policy of quality.

INITIAL COMPONENTS (2005-2007)

 1. Strengthening the Leadership Capacity of the Ministry of Education – MINED

Based on two subcomponents which were "stewardship at the central level" (design of
the action plan for the modernization of MINED) and "stewardship at the municipal
level" (aimed at strengthening municipal capacities to provide administrative and
pedagogical support to schools).

The amount funded for this component amounted to a total of US$3,410,000.00.

 2. Program Monitoring, Evaluation and Auditing Systems

Consisted of two subcomponents, which were "collection, analysis and dissemination of
statistics of education" and "assessment of competence in Spanish and Mathematics for
students of elementary and secondary school."

This component was intended to have a rigorous process of audit and ongoing student
enrollment to strengthen the process of setting goals at, local and school levels and
reduce the risk of misallocation of financial resources due to poor data.

The amount funded for this component amounted to a total of US$3,890,000.00.

 3. Implementation of the School Autonomy Program

This component was established to provide resources to schools and increase the number
of students enrolled, contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction.

The amount funded for this component amounted to a total of US$8,280,000.00.

 4. Community Preschool Pilot Program

The fourth component was established by the Common Work Program – CWP – to fund
community preschools, as well as training and pay incentives for teachers of community
preschools. This component also contained the provision of materials for teachers and
students.

The amount funded for this component amounted to US$120,000.00.

RESTRUCTURED COMPONENTS (2008-2010)

Starting in 2008, the focus of the PASEN project components were redefined, in which
were continued the support to the educational programs of preschool, primary and



                                            34
secondary school, as well as institutional strengthening, implementation of the
Performance Assessment System, Teacher Professional Development and National
System of Integrated Management Information – SNIGI.

 1. Institutional Strengthening for the Management of the MINED

This component is aimed at officials of MINED to ensure increased education quality,
meetings with the coordinating committees and joint actions between the SEAR and
MINED’s Elementary and Secondary Education Subsystem, procurement of goods to
equip the municipal and departmental delegations (motorcycles, cellular phones, fax,
electricity), under the model of decentralized and participatory management, in order to
ensure communication with a high degree of quality.

 2. Improving the Quality of Primary and Secondary Education in Nicaragua

Based on two sub-components which are "creating and implementing a national strategy"
and "development of educational materials and provision of textbooks."

B. RESTRUCTURED PROJECT (2008-2010) BY COMPONENT:

The Participatory Education Revolution began, by putting in the people's hands the power
to define and decide on how education in Nicaragua should be improved in the short and
long term, for the benefit of the Nicaraguan population.

The introduction of a participatory culture of corporate planning, as a management
method of MINED’s, initiated a process of coordination among all educators in the

VI) CHALLENGES

Of Internal Basis:

 The integration of various procurement processes in the Annual Procurement Plan
from different areas of the MINED influenced the management process, as they required
more time.
 The time available for the design and reproduction of the modules was insufficient,
taking into account the degree of complexity administrative requirements of this task and,
this caused the postponement of the professionalization meetings to months later than
planned.
 The subcomponents of the School Development Plan (PDE) and self-assessments of
the Educational Centers were discontinued due to changes in government and education
policy of the institution as a result of the management changes in July 2007.

Of External Basis:

 Changes in administrative processes of the World Bank and of the Procurement
Directorate regarding the contracting of premises, on the progress of the process and
transfers of funds to the delegations, which affected the required timetables.
 Delay in the delivery time by the firm Information Services – SIF – of the Financial
Physical Planning and Monitoring Subsystem – SPSFF – and Procurement Management
System – SISGA – funded by Canadian cooperation, delayed the completion of the
integration and development of some modules of the SNIGI.
 Delay in the management and approval of No Objections resulted in some processes
being put at risk or being initiated too late.

VII) LESSONS LEARNED

      When MINED directorates are well matched, the decision making processes in
       programs are more successful.
      Ensuring standards and working mechanisms in the program helps ensure that no
       significant changes are needed to be made in the processes.




                                           41
        The use of computer systems and resources ensures that operating processes
         increase their efficiency and effectiveness, significantly improving internal
         controls.
        The frequency and different channels of communication between the central level
         of the MINED and departmental and municipal delegations improves student
         attendance at the training courses.
        It is necessary to monitor the proper use of the materials once they reach their
         territory in order to maximize their use.
        Ongoing monitoring of the bidding process from the beginning leads to optimal
         results in the procurement processes.
        It is advisable that for future processes of development of pedagogical materials
         to remain within budget, the training of teachers on the documents be
         implemented and the validation of documents to be enriched before final printing.
        Management administration has an impact on the achievement of goals and
         proposed activities.

IX) PROJECT ASSESSMENT

The Project in its first stage supported the modernization of the MINED, decentralization,
and school autonomy in selected schools according to the educational plans and policies
established during that period.

In 2007, as result of the new guidelines and policies of the government and the MINED,
the project activities in the second stage were adapted in terms of support for the model
of educational, participatory and decentralized management, in which the flexibility of
the World Bank was essential in response to the requests of the Government of National
Unity and Reconciliation.
However, there was flexibility the part of the World Bank and the GoN to adapt to these
challenges and many activities were implemented.

The national educational benefits obtained with the PASEN project are countless, and
directly and indirectly influenced the improvement of educational quality, where the
direct beneficiaries were the students, teachers and pedagogical advisors who were
trained, advised and received pedagogical materials, in turn benefitting parents of
families and the education community in general.
