APPRAISAL OF THE FINCHA. HYDROSIECTRIC PROJECT
THE ETHIOPIAtI ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER AUTHORITY
SUMNARY
i.       This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Ethiopian
Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA) consisting of the construction
of the 100 MIW Finchaa hydroelectric plant and associated transmission in
Ethiopia. The project is estimated to cost a total of US$33.8 million
equivalent and the proposed loan would cover the foreign exchange cost
amounting to US$23.1 million equivalent, including interest during con-
struction. The project represents the major portion of the overall
expansion program of EELPA, the total cost of which is estimated at
about US$49 million during the project construction period 1969-73
inclusive.
ii.      The project was to have been financed by an AID loan but when
it appeared in October 1968 that the cost would be substantially higher
because of the lack of international bidding the Ethiopian Government
requested the Bank to finance it instead.
iii.     The borrower would be EELPA, a statutory corporation of the
Ethiopian Government. One previous loan for power, No. 375-ET for
US$23.5 million, was made to EELPA in 1964 for the construction of the
Awash II and Awash III hydroelectric stations and associated transmission
and distribution. While commissioning of the Awash III station has been
delayed two years because of construction difficulties, experience with
the loan has otherwise been satisfactory and EELPA is deemed to be a
0              suitable borrower.  Since its formation in 1955 it has developed into an
efficient utility and has made good progress in deveLoping its organization.
iv.      The project is technically sound, the estimated cost is reason-
able and the arrangements for engineering, procurement and construction
are satisfactory. The facilities to be provided are necessary to enable
EELPA to meet the expected demands for power.  The financing arrangements
are satisfactory.
v.       The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$23.1 million
equivalent for 25 years including a grace period of five years.

APPRAISAL OF THE FINCHAA HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
THE ETHIOPIAN ELECTRIC LIGHT AID POWER AUT)O0RITY
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of a project of the Ethiopian
Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA), consisting of the 100 MW Fincha2.
hydroelectric development and the associated 215 km, 220 kv transmission
line and terminal substation, The Bank has been asked to make a loan of
US$23.1 million to cover the astkmatted fo:.'eign exchazLge co.sI, including in-
terest during construction.  The proposed loan would represent 68% of the
total cost of tne project, estimated at US$33.8 million equivalent, and 50%
of the total cost of EELPA5s oxpansion program during the 1L69-73 project
construction period. The Borrower would be EELPA, a statutory corporation
of the Ethiopian Government.
1.02      The Ethiopian Government had made a loan agreement with AID for
the construction of Finchaa and about US$700,000 was actually disbursed for
consulting services. However, when bids were received from United States
contractors for the civil works, EELPA and its consultants deemed them to
be too high. Representations were then made to AID to enlarge the scope of
the bidding to include foreign as well as U.S. contractors but this was not
found possible under the provisions of AID assistance. The Ethiopian Govern-
ment and EELPA were not prepared to pay the extra cost which they consi-
dered would result from lack of international competition, AID having indi-
cated that it would not be able to increase the amount of the loan to cover
the increased costs.  Accordingly, in October 1968, the Ethiopian Government
and EELPA requested the Bank to finance the project. However, AID has agreed
to continue to finance consulting services until the proposed Bank loan is
signed, additional AID disbursements of US$400,000 being estimated in this
connection, up to a maximum cumulative amount.of US$1,200,000.  The remainder
of the AID Loan would then be cancelled  repayment cI the amount actually
_0            lent commencing in 1975 in accordance with the provisions of the agreements.
1.03      This is the second loan to EELPA, Loan 375-ET having been made in
1964 for an amount of US$23.5 million to finance the construction of the
Awash II and Awash III hydroelectric plants and associated transmission and
distribution facilities. The Awiash II plant has been in service since 1967
and is operating successfully. However, when Awash III was about to be
placed in service in February 1968 damage occurred to the pressure tunnel
when it was filled with water and the plant was shut down. An investigaticn
determined that the failure was due to a combination of factors including
poor design and construction. It appears that the consultants and contrac-
tor are at least partially to blame. It is expected that the repairs for
which some contracts have been let will cost about US$700,000 equivalent
which will be financed from the remaIning funds in L,oan 375-ET, resulting
in its full disbursement. The plant should be placed in service duiring the
first half of 1970. It has been necessary to postpone the Closing Date of
Loan 375-ET accordingly.  Other than the difficulties with Awash III, the
performance of EELPA has been satisfactory under Loan 375-ET.
1.04      The appraisal and this report were made byy Hessrs. D. King and
M. J. Reis.



II.  TE34 ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
2.01      Ethiopia has a population of about 23 million and an area of
450,000 square miles.  The population is widely distributed and the larges-..
urban center is the capital, Addis Ababa, with a population of about 700,000.
The country is predominantly agrarian, agriculture accounting for about two-
thirds of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Population is increasing at the
rate of about 2% annually and GDP increased at an average annual rate of
about 4.3% in the first five years of the 1960-70 decade.
2.02      While manufacturing, small scale industry, construction and trade
represent the minor part of the GDP, as distinct frorm agriculture and public
services, they achieved a high rate of growth in the period, outstripping
that of the agriculture sector. As a result, the growth of electricity use
has been substantial and, moreover, at least half of the amount consumed is
for industrial and commercial purposes.
2.03      Government policy in the power sector is to extend service to the
larger population and administrative centers as capital and other consider-
ations permit.  There are now about 35 centers with a total population of
about 1.5 million people served by EELPA. In addition in the province of
Eritrea adjoining the Red Sea electricity service is provided by an Italian
investor owned utility to Asmara, the second largest; city in Ethiopia, and
to Ptassawa. The prospect is that electricity supply will be confined to
population centers for considerable time to come; thllere is no significant
rural distribution and given the dispersed nature of the agricultural com-
munity and its low, monetary income the prospect of any rural electrification
in the foreseeable future is unlikely.
The Borrower
2.04      E3PA was established by Imperial Charter in 1955 as a statutory
corporation of the Ethiopian Government which is the sole oxmer thereof.
The authority is well organized and functions with a high degree ofE autonomy.
It is responsible for public electricity supplies in Ethiopia with the ex-
ception of the enterprise referred to in paragraph 2.03 and a few thermal
plants owned and operated by industries to supply their own needs. Respon-
sibility for EELPA's operations are vested in a Board of Directors consisting
of a Chairman and not more than nine other merbers appointed on the recom-
mendation of the Minister of Finance. At present there are six directors,
predominantly from the field of Government enterprise and public affairs,
all of whom are experienced in administration and finance.
2.05      The General Manager is appointed by the Government on the recom-
mendation of the Board. The present General Manager, appointed to the post
in February 7, 1969 is an experienced engineer and administrator who has
been with EELPA for 13 years.  His predecessor, who directed EELPA for 16
years, was appointed to the cabinet.
2.06      The authority is reasonably well managed, operated and organized.
Over the course of time Ethiopians have replaced foreigners in the senior
positions and for several years the only senior post held by a foreigner
has been that of financial comptroller. Loan 375-Fn' provides that the Bank
will be consulted before appointments to the posts of General Manager, Chief



- 3 -
Ehgineer and Financial Comptroller are made. The Gorrernment and EEePA hav
agreed to continue to consult on new appointments to these posts. EELPA has
anproximately 1,700 employees exclusive of temporary labor hired for constru-
tion purposes. Approximately 1,000 are engaged in operations, 200 in
accounting, and 500 in clerical and administrative work.  Some 35 engineers
are responsible for engineering and supervision of operations. The design/
engineering of large projects is entrusted to consulting engineers.
2.07      EELPA has a training school for operators and maintenance men,
operated by foreign personnel under the auspices of Electricite de France
(EDF) under French Government assistance. TELPA sends some of its more
promising employees to the Haile Selassie University in Addis Ababa for
engineering training. In addition it is planning to send some employees
abroad for post graduate technical training and the proposed loan includes
an amount of $100,000 for this purpose.  EELPA has retained the services of
77DF to review the administrative practices of the organization.  W1hile the
Accounting Department is well administered it continues to have the probletn.
of staff leaving for better paid positions, leading to insufficient middle
level staff. EELPA is making efforts to improve this situation.
2.08      The number of employees, of which there are 55 per thousand con-
sumers, the training programs and the organizational structure are appropriato
to the services EELPA provides, and operating costs are reasonable. Power
system losses amount to 14% including station auxiliary services, TJhich is
reasonable.  EELPA should be able to satisfactorily undertake the constructioin
of the proposed project with the assistance of its new consultants, Karza
Engineering Co., and operate it satisfactorily therea-Pter.
Facilities of the Borrower
2.09      EMLPA's main electricity facilities are interconnected and the
interconnected system, shown on the map, accounts for about 85% of sales.
In addition EELPA serves some 23 communities by isolated or self-contained
power systems, each such system having its owen thermal or hydroelectric
plant and distribution system. Annex 1 lists the generating facilities of
the interconnected and self-contained systems, the former having an. aggre-
gate generating capacity of about 126,000 kJ and the latter of about
26,000 kw.  The main generating stations which supply the interconnected
system are located on the Awash River. IWhile some sltorage capacity, is pro-
vided, the generating stations are subject to a substantial reduction in
capacity during dry years. The Finchaa generating station, the object of the
proposed loan, will be located on another river, with adequate storage.
Integration of its operation with existing generation stations would improve
the overall system characteristics.
2.10      in 1967 the high voltage transmission system comprised 560 km
of transmission circuit operating at 132 kv.  There were approximately
1,000 km of primary distribution circuit and 2,200 kImn of low voltage lines.
Distribution transformer capacity totalled approximately 120,000 kva.
Secondary distribution is almost entirely of overhecad construction..



- 4-
Future Expansion Program
2.11     In addition to the proposed project EELPA has planned a program
of expansion during the 1969-73 project period estimatted to cost US$15
million equivalent approximately. This would provide for expansion. of the
distribution systems and for the establishment of self-contained systems
at 17 new communities, involving installations aggregating about 9,000 kw
of hydroelectric and diesel electric generating capacity.
2.12     This program is contingent on further study, and review, the
availability of capital and the priorities established by the Government.
As noted in paragraph 2.03, the Government decides on the provision of
electricity supply to communities on the basis of their size and importance.
The program, therefore, is flexible and should less capital than foreseen
be available to EELPA it would be reduced, or phased out over a longer
period.
2.13     Given that thermal power is very expensive (para. 4.11), EELPA
would likely start the construction of a new hydroelectric facility in
1974 to have additional power available about 1977/783 when the full
output of Finchaa is expected to have been utilized. WJhile there are a
large number of hydroelectric sites in Ethiopia many of them are too
distant from the present interconnected system, or too large for the
immediate future needs of EELPA. There is no proper inventory of hydro-
electric resources within reasonable transmission distance of Addis
Ababa to assist in making a choice. EEIPA plans to have an appropriate
reconnaissance made and is seeking a grant from UiNDP, or some other
source, for this purpose.

III. THE PROJECT
3.01     The project would comprise the construction of the 100 Mg Finchaa
hydroelectric station and associated 220 kv transmission line with a
length of 215 km, and terminal substation located near Addis Ababa. The
project cost of US$33.8 million equivalent including interest during con-
*              struction would represent 68% of the total cost of EBOMPA's expansion
program during the project construction period, 1969-73.
Finchaa Hydroelectric Station
3.02     The Finchaa hydroelectric station would be located on the Finchaa
River, a tributary of the Blue Nile, approximately 170 km northwest of
Addis Ababa, as showm on the map. A low earth-filled dam located slightly
upstream from the escarpment over which the river faLls would enable a
large storage reservoir to be created with a useful volume of 650 million
cubic meters. Annual average firm production is estimated at 532 million
kwh, gi-ving a 60p plant factor.
3.03     The power station would be of the above graund conventional type
equipped wTith three 33.3 MW generators, operating at a head of 590 meters.
Pelton type turbines suitable for high head operation would be used. The
main features of the civil works would be the earth-fill dam, the pressure
tunnel and penstock system and the access road from the dam to the power-
house. The dam would have a height of 20 meters andl a length of albout
340 meters with a total volume of earth and rock fill of 180,000 cubic
meters.  The 3.0 meter diameter pressure tunnel would be 4,200 meters long,
leading to an inclined surface penstock 1,450 meters long. The geological
conditions have been thoroughly investigated and the route of the tunnel
and penstock laid out to minimize construction difficulties. No serious
problems arising from geological conditions are expected.
3.04     There is no existing access to the floor of the canyon in which
the power station is to be built and it is necessary to build a road,
partly in tunnel, about 7 kmn in length.  Access to the dam site on the top
of the escarpment from the nearest highway will necessitate the construction
of a road 90 kma long following an existing trail.  It is necessary to start
construction of the latter road in advance of that of the project proper
and a contract for this purpose has been awMzarded to a local firm. This
road will not, therefore, be financed from the propcsed loan. However,
its cost is included in the cost estimate of the project.
3.05     The transmission line would be single circuit, steel tower con-
struction, 215 kmn in length, generally following the route of the main
access road and highway leading to Addis Ababa. It would be impractical
to route it in a straight line between Finchaa and P.ddis Ababa in view of
the rugged gorges of the Blue Nile tributaries which lie in this direction
and which are almost inaccessible for construction purposes. At the Addis
Ababa end of the line there would be a terminal station of 105 MVA capacity.

GRAND TOTAL             26.7    57.8    84.5      10.7    23.1    33.8
The total cost of the project would be US$33.8 mill:ion equivalent including
interest during construction of US$3.5 million. The proposed loan of
US$23.1 million is for the foreign exchange cost of the project including
consulting services and interest during construction. The loan would
represent 68% of the estimated cost of the project. No reimbursements
would be made for expenditures incurred prior to signing of the proposed
loan.
3.07     The unit cost of Finchaa would be US$240 per kw excluding trans-
mission and interest during construction and US$303 per kw when transmission
is included.  This is a reasonable cost for a hydroelectric plant of this
size and type. The cost estimate was made by Harza Engineering Company of
Chicago, consultants for the project.  It is based on the feasibility study
1/ The local cost of engineering services includes the amounts to be
disbursed by AID for engineering (para. 1.02).

made by Harza in 1965/66, modified for increases in cost during the
interim period and reflecting the detailed design work carried out in
1968. Contingency allowance of 10% on equipment andL 15% on all other
construction costs have been included. Given that the tunnel-penstock
system and the access road to the powerhouse, works on which considerable
cost over run can be experienced, together represent almost one-third of
the cost of the project, the possibility of increasinig the contingency
amount for construction costs was considered.  Howevir, this is considered
unnecessary as the consultants are confident that the amount incorporated
for contingencies is adequate given the extensive and detailed nature of
the geological and other studies which have been made.
Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Disbursement
3.08      The consultants are responsible for the deitailed design of the
project and supervision of construction. With the e-xception of the 90 km
access road to the dam site, which will not be financed by the Bank (para.
3.04), construction will be carried out under a civil works contract
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Procurement
of equipment would be on the basis of international competitive bidding
except for certain minor items for which such bidding would be impractical.
Disbursements would be made for 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the
installed/erected goods and services. The provisiorus contained in Loan
375-ET requiring the employment of consultants and contractors satisfac-
tory to the Bank are repeated in the proposed agreement.
3.09      Tenders for the main contracts are to be called during the first
half of 1969 and most of them should be awarded by t1he middle of the year.
The access road to the site should be substantially completed by the rainy
season in the fall of 1969 and construction would then start. The three
generators are scheduled for service in 1972.
3.10      The project has already experienced some dcelay because of the
change from AID to prospective Bank financing, since it was necessary to
call for completely new bids. The construction schedule is therefore
quite tight, although it can be met if undue delays are not experienced.
Nevertheless, there is a considerable possibility of delay, the results
of which possibility are assessed in paragraph 4.09.

IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Load Growth
4.01     Annex 3 gives the actual and forecast energy sales for the period
1964-74 for the entire system and for the interconnected system and self-
contained systems, respectively. Finchaa would increase the generating
capacily of the interconnected system. which as noted previously, accounts
for 85% of total sales.
4.02     During the five years, 1964-68, total systemn sales have increased
at an average annual rate of about 18%, those of the interconnected system
by 15$ and of the self-contained systems by over 40%. The very large in-
crease in sales of the self-contained systems reflec-ts the provision of
electricity supply to localities not previously served as well as the growth
of those which were already supplied.
4.03     An average annual increase of 15.2% of tota:l system sales, 13.0%
for the self-contained systems and 15.8% for the interconnected system, is
forecast for the six-year period of 1969-74. The forecast for the self-
contained systems is based on past trends in the localities served and
estimated sales to the areas in which new facilities are to be established;
the relatively low growth rate forecast is due in part to the discontinuance
starting in 1969 of off-peak sales to a textile factory. The forecast of
sales to the interconnected system is based on past trends, the prospective
increase in the number of consumers to be supplied, and industrial prospects.
4.04     On the interconnected system there were approximately 70,000
consumers in 1968, representing an increase of 70% during the previous five
years   In 1969-74 it is estimated that the number of consumers wilL in-
crease to approximately 129,000, or at roughly the same percentage rate.
This is consistent with the outlook for the domestic and light commercial
load category which increased at an annual average of 14.1% in the 1964-68
period and i-s projected to grow at an annual rate of 14.2% in 1969-74. The
estimated growth of this category of service seems reasonable.
4.05     In the industrial category there are on the interconnected system
some 25 consumers each purchasing more than 300,000 kwh annually.  Among the
larger industrial and heavy commercial consumers are textile, cement, sugar
plantation and processing, tanning, fiber and other factories, and various
large hotels and buildings.  Prospective new large consumers include a
large sugar plantation expansion involving sales of 5 million kwh annually,
a pulp and paper plant with a demand of 2,000 kw, a cement plant to take
about the same amount of power, the possibility of a new artificial fiber
plant which might require about 40 million kwh annually, and various smaller
projects including a milling plant, a tire factory, zad a glass factory.
4.06     Growth of heavy commercial and industrial load on the inter-
connected system increased at the rate of 21.2% annually in the 1964-68
period and is estimated to grow 17.6% annually in 1969-74. Given the
background of present and prospective industrial proJects the projected
rate of increase is reasonable.



- 9 -
4. 07    This outlook is reinforced by the pattern of industrial develop-
ment in Ethiopia. WJhile industry as noted in paragraph 2.02 is comparatively
limited for the size, population and resources of the country, it has in-
creased in recent years at a comparatively rapid rate. Given the necessarv
organization and capital, future industrial growth should continue, at a'
high.,rate. Since industry is predominantly in the area presently served
by the interconnected system, centering in Addis Ababa, it is probable that
the forecast of industrial growth on this system wil:L be realized. If
anything, the estimate might be on the conservative side.  For this reason,
it is important for EELPA to plan for a reasonable capacity reserve so that
in the event of accelerated industrial development, power supply would not
be a limiting factor. In view of the foregoing and the explanations con-
tained in paragraphs 4.o4-4.06 the load forecasts are considered sound.
System Capacity
4.08     .4nnex 1 tabulates existing and planned generating capacity and
Annexes h and 5 give in chart form the relationship between capacity and
demand for the peak and energy requirements of the interconnected system.
It is evident that by placing the Finchaa project in service in 1972 the
capacity of the interconnected system would keep pace with the demand, and
some reserve capacity would be provided. The energy production from the
hydroelectric stations of the interconnected system is based on dry year
conditions. The reduction in output, which can be experienced at the Awzash
River plants in such years (paragraph 2.09), is of particular concern; in
1966 a dry year was experienced, unfortunately coinciding with a several
months' delay in comrmissioning of the Awash II station, resulting in
rationing of power. In determining the firm peak capacity, allowance has
been made for the reduction in output experienced during dry years at the
Awash stations, and for equipment outages.
4.09     Annexes 4 and 5 further indicate that the commissioning of Finchaa
might be delayed by some six months without serious riskl of a shortage of
capacitv. This margin provides some leeway in the event construction of
Finchaa is delayed.  The schedule of construction is tight (paragraph 3.10)
because of the delays resulting from changing from AID to Bank financing
and there is considerable possibility of delays of six months or possibly
more.  In any case, given the possibility of a larger industrial electricit;
growath than forecast (paragraph 4.07), it is advisab'le to maintain some
margin of reserve.
Rate of Return
4.10     Annex 6 discusses the rate of return of the Finchaa project.
The present worth of the revenue from the project, less expenses, over its
life was determined as equalizing the cost of the project at a discount
rate of 19%.  The expenses applicable to the project exclude, for this
purpose, the income taxes which would be payable by EELPA to the Ethiopian
Government on the profits from the project, since they are a direct
benefit to the economy and constitute an internal transfer. The opportunity
cost of capital in Ethiopia is difficult to determine since there is no real



- 10 -
capital market in the country. However, the various forms of loans and
credit available bear interest rates of from 6-1/2% .. 9-1/2%. It is highlly
probable, therefore, that the estimated rate of return of the project of
19% would be in excess of the opportunity cost of capital.
Alternative Sources of Capacity
h.11     The Finchaa project represents the most economic form in which
additional generating capacity can be provided, inasmach as the cost of
fuel oil is very high. There are no known fossil fuels in Ethiopia and
fuel oil for use in the Addis Ababa region has to be imported through
Djibouti on the Indian Ocean and transported over 700 lkm
by rail, resulting in a cost of US$40 per ton delivered to Addis Ababa.
Power produced from a thermal plant the size of Fincluea would cost about
US 1.3 cents per lkwh for the fuel alone.  Calculation has determined
that the present worth of the cost streams of the capital and operating
costs of Finchaa, over its life, equals that of a sinilar sized thermal
plant at a discount rate of about 17%. This is further indicative of
the high cost of thermal power.
4.12     In view of the foregoing comments concerning load growth
(paragraphs 4.01 - 4.07), system capacity (paragraphs 4.08 and 4.09),
rate of return and alternative sources of capacity thle project is well
justified.

V. TARIFFS
5.01     EELPA's charter gives it the legal power to establish rates
and regulations for the sale of electrical energy as it sees fit.  However,
in practice EELPA has in substance obtained the approval of the Government
before changing rates.
5.02     No changes in tariffs have been made since L960 when the Awash I
hydroelectric plant went into operation. At that tirme rates were made
uniform and were reduced about 30% for tlhe interconnected system and by a
larger percentage for the self-contained systems.
5.03     Government policy is to have aELPA charge uniform tariffs throughoLt
the service area. The great majority of customers are served under general
tariffs providing for a service charge of $1 Ethiopian per month and a kwh
charge of 15¢ Ethiopian (60 US) for the first 100 kwh per month and 100
thereafter. Approximately half the customers used 2'5 kwh or less per month
and only 13% used over 100 kth per month.  The other major and lower tariff,
that for commercial and industrial sales, is comprised of a charge of 10¢
Ethiopian per kih for the first thousand kwh per month and 50 thereafter.
This tariff includes a customary demand charge and provides for discounts
of from 5% for customers purchasing more than 100,000 kwh per month to 20%
for customers purchasing more than one million kwh per month.  The street
lighting rate is 100 Ethiopian per ,kwh plus a service charge which
results in an average price of 10.3¢ per kwh. The tariff structure is
enerally satisfactory but has not been studied for a number of years.
Therefore a review of the tariff structure is under consideration by the
management.
5.04     In 1968 sales of the interconnected system tnder the variouls
tariffs were as follows:
IWH             Revenue              Average
Sold        Eth$        5 of      Rate per KWH
(millions)  (millions)    Total         Eth cents
General                    68.6         9.18        58             13.4
Commercial and
industrial             103.4        6.42         40              6.2
Street lighting             3.2         0.33         2             10.3
175.2       15.93        100%             9.:L
5.05     Loan 375-ET requires that EELPA finance at "Least h0% of the cost
of expansion from net internal cash generation, which percentage may be
revised by agreement of EELPA and the Bank. It is esftimated that the
expansion program can be met without a general adjustment in rates.  Pro-
jected earnings after income taxes in relation to the book value of average
net fixed assets in operation vary between 7.1% and 8.8% which is satisfactory.



- 12 -
Since the projected capital requirements in relation to internal cash
generation show considerable year to year fluctuation the administration
of this covenant is difficult even though it has been met in the past.
Therefore there has been substituted in the proposed 'Loan agreement a rate
base-rate of return provision that the tariffs be sufficient to provide
annual operating income, after deduction of income tacxes, equal to no less
than 7% of average net fixed assets in operation valued or revalued on a
basis satisfactory to the Bank. (This approximates 51% before deduct-ion of
income taxes.)



- 13 -
VI.  PAST OPERATIONS
6.01     Actual income statements for the fiscal years 1965-1967 and on
a provisional basis for 1968 are shown in Annex 7. During this period
kwh sales increased from 153 million lkwih in 1965 to 221 million kwh in
1968, an annual average increase of 13%. Between 1965 and 1968 operating
revenues, of which 5/6ths are obtained from the interconnected system,
increased 49% and operating expenses including depreciation and income
taxes increased only 37,%l. EELPA follows conservative accounting policies
and charges all overhead expenses in connection with construction to
operating revenues and does not capitalize interest cluring construction.
6.02     The year 1966 was a dry year and was not normal.  In that year
EELPA discontinued off peak sales to a steel arc furrnace plant thereby
reducing sales by 10 million kwh. As a result total sales increased
about 9% and the average price per kwh increased 4%.  lioreover, low
river flows necessitated substantially higher than normal fuel expenses
for  steam generation, a situation which wjas rectifiecl in 1967 when the
Awash II hydroelectric plant came into operation.
6.03     Incoiae taxes in accordance wjith applicable tax laws were levied
on a graduated scale to a maximum rate o' 36% with the tax payable at the
top rate varying in inverse proportion to the paid-up capital. The three
rates of taxation with Eth$55 million of share capital were 16% on the
first Eth$i412,500 of income, 26% on the next Eth$1,65;0,ooo and 36% on the
remainder.
6.04     Operating income after meeting all expenses including income
taxes of E3LPA and the rate of return, representing the relationships of
operating income to average net fixed assets in operation, were as
follows for the past four years:
Operating Income                 Rate of Return
Fiscal Year       (million Eth$)    Before Income Taxes  After Income Taxes
1965                  3.65                  8.7%                   6.4%
1966                  3.98                  8.8                    6.51
1967                  5.77                  9.7                    7.6
1963 (provisional)   6.53                   9.3                    7.2
Interest charges were covered by operating income before income taxes no
less than 3.0 times in any of the years in the four year period. Past
results have been satisfactory.



- 14 -
VII. PRESEIT FINANCIAL POSITIOM
7.01     EELPA's financial statements are audited by Miann Judd and Co.
These arrangements have been satisfactory and thb prcoposed loan agreement
contains a provision    that independent auditors satisfactory to the
Bank will continue to be employed.  Improvement in the time lag (11 months
in the 1966 fiscal year) in preparing past financial statements has been
made by EELPA. Provision has been made in the proposed loan agreement that
audit reports be sent to the Bank within five months of the close of each
fiscal year.
7.02     The financial state of EELPA is shown in the actual and estimated
balance sheets attached as Annex 8. The following summary balance sheets
presented belot, show the actual audited data as of the end of the 1967
fiscal year and provisional data as of the end of the 1968 fiscal year.

7.03     Fixed assets are recorded on the basis of an independent evalua-
tion in 1957 when total fixed assets were only Eth$l4.00 million which is
very small in relation to subsequent additions which have been recorded at
cost. The price level has been relatively stable in Ethiopia in recent
years.
7.04     The provisional balance sheet indicates a st,rong cash position
but this arises from delay in construction of projects and cash has been
built up in anticipation of the substantial construction program. The
Finchaa project is estimated to cost more than 60%o of the book value olf
total fixed assets as of the end of fiscal year 1968. Capital structure
is satisfactory with long term debt amounting to 43% of total capitaliza-
tion.  Long term debt was comprised chiefly of Eth$53.36 million dralwn
down under Bank Loan 375-ET out of a total loan of Etth$58.75 milliorl. The
remaining debt of EELPA is comprised of Eth,$1.82 million owed to AII) and
a small remaining balance owed to a supplier.
7.05     Accounts and other receivables as of September 10, 1968 amounted
to about Eth$3 million and bear a reasonable relationship to operating
revenues of approximately Eth$20 million in that year. The figure of
Eth$3 million is net after Eth$1.6 million provision for doubtful debts
of w-hich government debts dating back to 1964 and prior years accournt
for approxim,ately Eth$0.9 million.  This debt was reduced moderately in
1968 and will be discussed with the Government during negotiations.

VIII. PROPOSED FINANCING PLAN
8.01     As shown in the forecast of the source and application of funds
(Annex 9) the total expansion program is estimated to be financed through
the retention of all earnings, proceeds of the proposied Bank Loan, proceeds
of the existing Loan 375-ET which have not yet been i3ully drawn downi, and
modest additional borrowing from AID (paragraph 1.021.  In addition it is
projected that EELPA would make use of bank overdrafts which are expected
to be paid off before the close of the forecast period. The following is
a summary of the source and application of funds for the years 1969 through
1973:

would be drawn down and repaid during the forecast period as mentioned
above.



- 17 -
8.02     Construction expenditures on the proposed Finchaa Project are
estimated at Eth$75.75 million of which Eth$73.75 million will be spent
during the period 1969 through 1973. Eth$2.0 million was spent in 1968.
The estimated cost of the foreign portion, Eth$49.00 million, would be
financed by the proposed Bank Loan which will also cover interest during
the construction period amounting to Eth$8.75 million.  Net internal cash
generation would provide about 35% of the funds required during the period,
the proposed and existing Bank loans would provide 55% and the balance of
10%o would be provided principally from existing cash balances without
jeopardizing EELPA's working capital position. Net internal cash generation
would provide 43% of funds required over the years 1969-1974 which period
includes an additional year with less heavy construction. As previously
mentioned bank overdrafts would be used and paid off during the period.
8.03     For the purpose of the financial forecasts it has been assumed
that the proposed Bank Loan would have a 5-year grace period, a 20-year
amortization period and interest at the annual rate of 6 1/2%.
8.oL     In accordance with the stated policy of EELE'A, it has been assumed
that no dividends will be pajable in the foreseeable future, but the question
may be re-examined by EELPA and the Government near the completion date of
the project.  The Charter of LELPA provides that dividends may be paid "only
out of the surplus of net profits remaining after payment of all expenses
of operation, segregation of legal and other reserves, allowancesfor depre-
ciation and amounts necessary for the approved plans of expansion and
extension of the business."
8.05     The projections indicate that during the construction period
EELPA will temporarily require additional funds. The Authority has arranged
for an increase in existing overdraft facilities to 3th$5.00 million from the
Commercial Balk of Ethiopia, a state institution.  The rate of interest on
overdrafts is currently 9% compared with 7%0 at the time of consideration of
Loan 375-ET.
8.o6     The proposed financing plan is reasonable.  During negotiELtions
assurances were obtained that the Government, if necessary, will provide
E2PA with sufficient funds to complete the Bank project.

IX. ESTI_ATED FUTURE OPERATIONS
9.01     Forecast income statements for the 6-year period 1969 through
1974 are included in Annex 7. The basis of the estirmates of kwh to be
sold are set forth in paragraphs 4.03-4.07 inclusive,, and projected power
sales are shown in detail in Annex 3. Estimated revenues assume a decline
in the average price per kwh reflecting expectations of an increase in
average consumption for general customers on two-part tariffs and an in-
crease in the proportion of commercial and industrial sales to total sales.
9.02     With respect to operating expenses, somewhat higher than average
increases in operating, administrative and maintenance expenses are shown
in the years 1971 and 1974 when new hydroelectric plants are expected to
be in operation for a full year. Expenses for fuel and lubricants are
expected to decline moderately toward the end of the forecast period due
to expansion of the interconnected system to include part of the self
contained systems and the related replacement of diesel electric genera-
tion with hydro po-wer.
9.03     Depreciation is projected at a 3 1/2% annual straight line rate
on plant in service at the end of 1968 plus subsequent additions other
than hydroelectric projects.  This corresponds closely to past average
rates of depreciation.  A straight line rate of 2 1/2% is used for the
Awash III and Finchaa hydroelectric projects. These rates are reasonable.
9.04     The calculation of income taxes assumes an -increase in share
capital to Eth$75 million at the start of the 1970 fiLscal year.  With
such an amount of share capital and existing higher tax rates the first
nth$562,500 of income is taxed at 20%, the next Eth$2,250,000 at 30%
and the balance at 40% (see paragraph 6.03).
9.05     Operating income after income taxes as a percentage of average
net fixed assets in operation is estimated over the period at between
7.1% and 7.8% with a substantially higher ratio of 8.8% in the year 1972
when there is projected practically no increase in average net fixed
assets in operation. The related percentages before income tax show a
range betwleen 8.8% and 11.3%. This is satisfactory.
9.o6     Estimated interest coverage before income taxes ranges generally
between 2 1/2 and 3 times.  After the relatively high income taxes, the
ratio averages 2.1 times. Internal cash generation is expected to cover
annual debt service 2.3 times on average.
9.07     Provisions-have been continued in the proposed loan agreement
that without approval of the Bank, EELPA will not incur any additional long-
term debt unless internal cash generation (operating income before depre-
ciation) for the fiscal year preceding such incurrence or for a later 12-
month period prior to the incurrence of such debt shall be not less than
1.4 times the maximum debt service requirements for any succeeding friscal
year on all debt, including the debt to be incurred.
9.08      The capital structure of EELPA should remain sound.  Long-term
debt is now 43% of total capitalization and is projected at 50% at -the
end of the 1974 fiscal year.

X. CONCLUSIONS
10.01    The project is technically sound and the facilities to be pro-
vided are necessary to meet the expected demand for power.  The estimated
cost is reasonable and the arrangements for engineering, construction and
procurement are appropriate. The financing arrangements are satisfactory.
10.02    3ELPA is operating satisfactorily and has made good progress in
improving staff organization and methods.
10.03    The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$23.1 million
equivalent for 25 years including a grace period of '; years.

Rate of Return on the Project
1.        The rate of return of the Finchaa project is taken for the
purpose of this calculation to be the discount rate at which the present
worth of the cost of the project equals the present worth of the net re-
venue deriving from it over its life.
2.        The following information and assumptions were used in calcu-
lating the rate of return:
a. To the capital cost of the project has been added the cost
of transmission/distribution facilities which would be pro-
vided to distribute the output of Finchaa., A project life
of 40 years is assumed.
b. Annual net revenue equal to annual gross revenue less
operating costs. Annual gross revenue is equal to the
annual kwh sales attributed to Finchaa mu:Ltiplied by the
applicable tariff. For the purpose of calculating the
rate of return, operating costs exclude tbe income tax
levy on profits. That is, net revenue is the revenue
before incom, taxes are applied since income taxes are
a direct benefit to thle economy, and constitute an
internal transfer in the economy of the country.
c.  It is estimated that it would be 1978-79 bLefore the full
energy output of Finchaa would be utilized.  Annual kwh
sales applicable to Finchaa in the 1973-751 period are based
on its estimated contribution to sales each year.
d.  It is assumed that the average revenue per kwh from Finchaa
wauld be US 3.2 cents per kwh in the period 1973-79 and
US 2.4 cents thereafter. The fonner corresponds to the
average price which would apply about 1974h, and which is
slightly less than the average in the 1970-74 period.
However, it is expected that as the Finchaa output becoxes
absorbed into the system the benefits of the comparatively
low cost power produced from it would be reflected in some
reduction in tariffs. The tariff assumed starting in 1980
is based on this premise.  This is admittedly an arbitrary
assumption.  The ultimate tariff is not Likely to be less
than 2.4 US cents.  If it should prove higher, the reveniue
and consequently the rate of return, wou ld be larger.



ANM2£X 6
Page 2 of 3 pages
e.  Gross operating expenses include the incremental costs of
operation applicable to Finchaa as well as the cost of
operating and distribution facilities over which Finchaa
production would be distributed.
3.        The rate of return is estimated at 19%.  The assumptions
are on the conservative side and the figure of 19% can likewise be
assi.med conservative.  Moreover, it is reasonable to believe that the
real worth of the output from Finchaa to the economy is somewhat higher
than the rates charged by EELPA.
4.        There is no real capital market in Ethiopia from which the
opportunity cost of capital can be ascertained.  However, the various
forms of loans and credit available, including commercial bank loans
for periods up to five years, saving association le:ndings, government
bonds, and bank overdrafts all bear interest rates in the range of
6.5 - 9.5%. It is therefore probable that the rate of return of 19%
on Finchaa is substantially greater than the opportunity cost of
capital in Ethiopia.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.     Ethiopia is still at a very early stage of economic and social develo-
ment. Per capita income is approximately Eth$ 150 (US$ 60r per year, one of
the lowest among developing countries and the economy is based largely upon
subsistence agriculture. Coffee is the major cash crop zmd the source of
more than half of Ethiopia's export earnings. A few larger commercial plan-
tations have provided the basis for some import-substituting industries such
as sugar and cottorn and provide some other agricultural exports such as oil-
seeds, fruits and vegetables.
2.     From 1960 until 1966 the economy grew at a rate cf 4.6% per year,
largely as a result of a relatively rapid expansion of thle non-agricultural
sectors.  The growth rate of agriculture, howxever, was onily 2.1%, approxi-
mately the same as that of the population. The Governmzntts development
strategy had been to build up the public services, mainly roads and power,
and to establish some import substitution industries. There has been rela-
tively little development in agriculture which provided 90% of employment,
two-thirds of GDP and almost all exports.
3.     The Government has traditionally followed conserrative monetary and
fiscal policies. Throughout most of the post-war period there have been
surpluses on the current budget and in the overall balance of payments so
that foreign exchange reserves have been accumulated antd generally maintai.eu
at comfortable levels.  However, over the last two or tharee years the pcsits u
of the current budget deteriorated and the Government ejncountered an acute
licuidity problem early this year. A number of measures have been taken tc
alleviate the Governmentts cash position but in the longer run the Goverrmerne
will have to deal with the underlying causes which brought about the preser,t
difficulties. These developments are discussed in more detail later in th.is
memorandum.
II.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS - THE GROWTH CFP CDP
4.     From 1965/66 to 1967/68 gross domestic product in-creased by 4.3% com-
pared to 4.6,% in the preceding five years. This slowdown was the result of
a fall in the rate of growth of the monetary sector of the economy from ar.
average rate of 7.6% in the preceding five years to 6.5C% in the last two
years. (Table 1).
5.     The agricultural sector has, however, shown a marked improvement, inp-
creasing its rate of growth from 2.1% to 2.8%. The downlward tendency of fund
grain prices in the urban areas proves that the agricuLtural sector has pro-
duced enough marketable surplus to feed the growing urban population since
there was little import of food grain in this period.  Generally favorabl.
weather largely accounts for the better agricultural production, but the
development of private commercial agriculture in the lcw-lying northwesterii
provinces bordering the Sudan has also contribuited to the increased cutpt,-,

6.     While the manufacturing sector maintained a fairly rapid growth rate
of about 15%, the rate of growth of the handicrafts and s:mall industries,
which arm more important than manufacturing proper, declined significantly.
The sharpest decline was that of building and construction which fell from
11.5% to 5%. Similarly, the growth rate of commerce, transport and communica-
tions fell from 9.7% to 4.8%. The recession in the monetary sector of the
economy was largely due to a decline in Ethiopia's foreign trade. Export
earnings, which were rising at an annual rate of 9%, showed actual declines
eater 1965 owing to a fall in the price of coffee and, after 1967, they wele
adversely affected by the closure of the Suez Canal.
III. PUBLIC FINANCE
7.    Until about three years ago the Government's fiscal situation was
generally good. The current budget produced a surplus a:nd revenue was te:A-
ing to rise somewhat faster than expenditure. Public savings were able to
finance about 60% of the capital budget over the period 1963/64 to 1965/66.
During the last three years, the situation has gradually become more diffic2t(l
Revenues became less buoyant largely because external trade was depressed
owing to a fall in coffee prices but also because certain changes in the tax
system which the Government introduced in an effort to increase revenue did
not prove as successful as was expected.  At the same time current expenditure
increased at the same rate, or even somewhat faster, as the rising cost of
education, health and other social services was supplemented by growing ex-
penditures on defense and internal security.
8.     In 1966/67 the effect of these developments was hidden by certain
receipts of a once for all nature, such as improved colLection of tax arrears
on business enterprises and a change in the method of collecting the tax or,
sugar. These windfalls prevented any increase in the budget deficit although
the overall Treasury deficit increased from Eth$ 7 million to Eth$ 15 mtllion
as a result of lower receipts from foreign loans. In 1967/68 current expertdi-
ture continued to increase at almost the same rate as the previous year owing
to a sharp increase in expenditure on defense and education; expenditure Xcr
economic services did not increase at all.  However, for the first time in
many years, the increase in expenditure was not matched by any increase irn
revenue; consequently both the budget deficit and the Treasury deficit gzew
substantially and the Government was left with unpaid bills at the end cC
the year. The failure of revenue to increase was partly the result of th.a
continued mild recession in the economy which was in turn due to the absence
of any revival of external trade.  However, the Government also intrcodueed
some changes in the income tax legislation. An agricultural income tax W&
introduced to replace the age-old "tithe" system and the income tax was in-
creased in the higher income brackets. But the yield of the new agricultura'J
income tax only partly offset the loss of the "tithe" and the revenue from
the higher income tax rates did not come up to expectations.
9.     By the end of 1967/68 the Treasury deficit was Eth$ 45.4 million hi&r 
was three times that of the previous year and about six times the average
figure for the early 1960's (Table 4). The original budget for 1968,/69 ii-9



- 3 -
therefore based upon the assumption that a number of new tax measures woul.d
be introduced which, together with the trend increase, were intended to .ni
crease total current revenue by 24%. However, the new measures were not
implemented so that the actual revenue increase is more likely to be around
10%. At the same time current expenditure continued to increase mainly as a
result of higher salaries paid to the Army and to teachers. With expenditure
rising more rapidly than revenue and with the legal limit on Central Bank
borrowing reachled the Government was forced to make severe cuts in expenditture
and work on a number of development projects had to be stopped or slowed du'a.
In an effort to meet this situation the Government has obtained parliamentar
approval for an issue of Treasury Bills which will ease the cash situaticn
and has also introduced a revised budget.
10.    Although the cash difficulties which the Governenflt encountered cama
in 1968/69, the budgetary outcome this year will probably be better than that
of 1967/68. The short-term problem arose because of the rigidities of thd
monetary system and can be overcome by introducing more flexibility into tae
regulations controlling Government borrowing from the Central Bank. This the
Government proposes to do, following certain proposals put forward by a
mission from the IMF, although the situation in 1969/70 is likely to remain
somewhat difficult. There is, however, also a long-term aspect to the Etilio-
pian budget problem since rising current expenditures are pressing against
revenues which will be less buoyant than before unless exports, which are
heavily dependent on coffee, grow more rapidly than is now expected.  TMhis 1iS
one of the important economic problems facing the new Government which was
formed in February this year.
11.    Throughout the last three years the Government's capital expend,iture
has remained fairly stable although expenditure on economic developmernt has
declined slightly while expenditure on health and education has increased.
The ccntinuation of an adequate volume of capital expenditure in the future
will obviously depend upon satisfactory measures being taken to restore the
fiscal situation and the level of public savings.
IV. BALANCE OF PAMENTS
12.    In 1966, for the first time in the 1960's Ethiopiats balance of pay-
ments closed with an overall deficit (Table 5). In 1964 and 196' there >-ewi
relatively large surpluses amounting to Eth$ 27 and EttO 34 million respec-
tively.  The d6ficit in 1966 was small, Eth$ 8 million,, but became much
larger in 1967 amounting to Eth$ 44 million. In 1968, however, thera was a
surplus of Bth$ 8 million.
13.    The change from surplus to deficit in 1966 was brought about in the
first instance by a fall in coffee prices; export earrULngs from coffee de-
cdined from Eth$ 188 million in 1965 to Eth$ 156 million in 1966, and fur-
ther to Eth$ 139 million in 1967 (Table 6).  In addition to lower prices:
the volume of coffee exports was also reduced because the traders held bank



- 4 -
stocks in anticipation of a price recovery. When coffee earnings were at
their lowest the closure of the Suez Canal in June of that year adversely
affected the exports of most other products, such as hides and skins, oil-
seed cakes and pulses, which had been showing an increasing trend. A sub-
stantial decline in capital inflows added to the problem and led to a laxge
overall deficit in 1967.
114.    Ethiopia's imports increased rapidly until 1965 mainly as a result
of rising imports of machinery and transport equipment. In 1967, however,
total imports declined owing to the reduction in economic activity resulting
from the decline in export earnings and the dislocation caused by the closure
of the Suez Cana'. Imports of some consumer goods, such as textiles, sugar
and shoes, declined as a result of the establishment of domestic industries.
15.     In 1968, export earnings recovered to Eth$266 million from the lcx
level of Eth$250 mialion in 1967, but were still lower -than the earnings
of l965 and 1966. This recovery was almost entirely due to coffee (Eth$l1-3
million)--there was a slight price recovery and export volume increased
substantially--earnings from most other exports declined further on account
of the continued closure of the Suez Canal. Despite higher export earnings:
there was a record trade deficit (Eth$ 158 million) because of imports to
replenish depleted stocks and the purchase of two jetliners costing about
Eth$ 40 million.  The surplus balance of payments was made possible by a
substanitial improvement in the services account, transfer receipts and
capital inflows. The significant improvement in the services account was
mainly due to higher receipts from travel and transpor-tation, indicating
the growing importance of tourism. The inflow of public capital showed a
particularly high figure because it included a greater part of the financill
of the two jetliners bought in that year.
16.     The net foreign assets of the banking system stood at Eth$ 214
million at the end of 1965, but declined to Eth$ 171 million by the end
of 1968. For Ethiopia the year-end reserves are normally low, because
the coffee export season starts at that time.  However, the reserves at
the end of 1968 were equivalent to more than five months' imports.
V. THE PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE DEVEIOPMENT
17.     The immediate problem that faces the Ethiopian Government is the
current budgetary position and some important cuts in current expenditure
for 1969/70 have already been proposed. Iwhile the relatively high foreign
reserves and a revision of the banking law permitting the Government to
have recourse to a larger amount of central bank borrowing provide some
time for Government to overcome its immediate cash problems, it will be
necessary to restore the volume of public saving, without which the
Government will be unable to carry out a desirable pu1clic investment
program. In the long run, this will be much easier if measures can be
taken to increase export earnings.

18.    An important potential new export resource is the potash deposit
in Dalol. The Ralph M. Parsons Company, which had held a concession in
thisarea for ten years, relinquished it in 1968, and the Government has
recently awarded a new concession to Kaiser/Ludwig Group. However, pro-
duction is not expected to start before 1975 so that there will be no
imm.ediate benefits to the economy from this project. The preparation and
execution of quick-yielding, export-oriented agricultural projects is there-
fore of high economic priority. There is some scope for producing and
exporting greater quantities of oilseeds (sesame) and earnings from hides
and skins and coffee could be increased by improving their quality.
19.    In the longer run, Ethiopia's development prospects will depend
upon the degree to which it can encourage the developmernt of the directly
productive sectors of the economy, particularly agriculture and mining.
Ethiopia has considerable fertile land which could be brought under irri-
gation, and the yields of the rain-fed agriculture could be increased through
improved techniques. 5ommercial agriculture can be developed in a reasonably
short time in the Awash Valley, particularly in the middle valley area.
Some additional public services will be needed to consoLidate and expand
the recent agricultural developments in the northwest region. The Bank is
assisting Ethiopia in the preparation of projects for these areas.
20.    Increasing the productivity of subsistence agriculture is hampered
by many institutional and social problems. One of these is the complexity
of the traditional tenure system, involving not only large private holdings
but also church and communal ownership in some districts, and the absence
of registration for most land prevents any rapid progress in land reform.
The Government has prepared a set of land reform bills for submission to
Parliament, which providesfor cadastral surveys, registration of titles,
regulation of landlord-tenant relationships and for taxation to penalize
landlords for leaving land idle. These reforms will be put into effect
at first in the areas where comprehensive regional development projects
have been or are about to be launched.  One such project has already started
with Swedish financing, and another has been prepared and is currently being
considered for Bank/IDA financing. Ethiopia has a large livestock population
which could make a substantial contribution to national income and export
earnings, provided a program of disease control and improved cattle nutrition
could be successfully carried out.
21.    In Ethiopia, modern education is in its infancy, and there is a
great scarcity of personnel for identification, preparation, execution and
management of development projects.  Investment in educ:ation needs to be
increased, particularly technical education and teacher training. The
emphasis that is required on agriculture and education gives added impor-
tance to sound long-run fiscal policies since both these will create
pressure on current expenditure. A development plan for the period 1968
to 1973 has been prepared which sets out the Government's fiscal and
general policies for development in the next few years. A mission from
the Bank is to visit Ethiopia later this year to assess the plan in the
light of the recent economic and fiscal developments.

22.     Ethiopia's total external public debt as of June 30, 1968, was
US $127 million net of undisbursed loans, and US $234 rnillion including
undisbursed amounts. The net foreign reserves, which were equivalent to
seven monthst imports at the end of 1966, have since declined but were a
little over five months' imports at the end of 1968. 'The debt service
ratio has been rising slowly and had reached 10.6% in 1L967. Although,
therefore, Ethiopia has some margin for additional borrowing on conventional
terms, the predominant role in export played by coffee makes it advisable
for her to obtain as much capital as possible on concessionary terms.
