REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
STATE AND PROVINCIAL ROADS PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:              Republic of Turkey.
Beneficiary:           General Directorate of Highways.
Loan Amount:           US$300 million equivalent.
Terms:                  Seventeen years, including 5 years grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Proiect Obiectives     The objectives of the proposed project are to (i) keep
and Descri2tion:       transport costs low in Turkey by ensuring adequate
renewal and maintenance of the road network; (ii)
reduce the backlog of road strengthening; (iii)
continue the downsizing, modernization and improvement
of the management of KGM's equipment fleet; (iv)
strengthen and modernize the planning and design
capabilities of KGM; and (v) improve the management and
safety of the road system through reforms,
modernization and training.
The project includes:
(a)   strengthening of high priority sections of
existing state roads;
(b)   improvement of selected provincial roads;
(c)   procurement of equipment and materials for road
maintenance, research, planning, survey and
design, reorganization, computerization and
training;
(d)   improvement of road safety;
(e)   training for KGM's staff; and
(f)   consulting services.

Benefit                The proposed project will facilitate the efficiency of
and Risks:             the road transport sector by reducing overall transport
costs. Benefits will be in the form of reduced vehicle
operating costs. The improvement of provincial roads
will facilitate all weather access and transport in
predominantly rural areas, which are presently isolated
by the poor condition of existing roads. Also the
present value of road expenditures will be reduced by
road strengthening now and avoiding more expensive
reconstruction at a later date. Road maintenance
expenditures will also decrease on newly paved
provincial roads. The benefits will accrue to a large
and widespread number of beneficiaries. Private users
such as individual car owners, bus passengers and own
account transporters will capture benefits directly.
Benefits accruing to common carrier trucks and buses
will be passed on to producers and consumers in the
form of lower freight rates and fares, given the very
competitive nature of the road transport industry in
Turkey. The provincial roads included in the project
will provide access to lower income rural populations
and directly contribute to mitigating the effects of
poverty in these areas. The road safety component will
contribute to the reduction in accidents. The
principal risk is any unanticipated shortage or
delayed availability of counterpart funds which may
delay disbursements and lengthen the project execution
period. Past performance in this regard, even under
severe macro-economic pressures, has been quite good.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
STATE AND PROVINCIAL ROADS PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Sector Overview
1.01      Transport is vital for the economic development and integration of a
country as large as Turkey. With population and activities widely spread,
people and goods have to travel long distances over difficult terrain under
severe climatic conditions. While Turkey has a very long sea coast of 8,400
km from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, the large Anatolian land mass
makes for long distances between the ports and interior cities. For instance,
Ankara is over 400 km from any of its nearest ports i.e. Samsun, Istanbul and
Mersin. Turkey is also the major transport bridge between Europe and the
Middle East. Again the distances are long, 1,750 km from the Bulgarian border
to Iran and 1,900 km to Iraq.
1.02      The backbone of Turkey's transport system is the 360,000 km of roads
(60,000 km state and provincial roads and 300,000 km of rural roads) and to a
lesser extent the 8,200 km rail network. Private and state owned
international and coastal shipping serve some 70 ports and 100 other
facilities, ranging from open roadsteads to small jetties. Airports and
pipelines complete the transport infrastructure.
B. Transport Demand and Capacity
1.03      Turkey's freight transport demand includes not only domestic freight
and import/export traffic, but also transit traffic between Europe and the
Middle East. The domestic traffic amounts to some 70 billion tkm of which
some 80X are carried by road and the rest by rail (111) and coastal shipping
(91) (Table 1.1). In addition some 9 billion tkm of crude oil and products
move by pipeline. Major bulk commodities are coal and lignite, iron ore,
cement, fertilizer and grain. Imports amount to some 35 million tons
(including over 20 million tons of oil and oil products), exports total nearly
15 million tons. Transit traffic increased rapidly in the early 80s but in
1989 was down to only half of its 1985 peak of 5 million tons mainly due to
unrest in neighboring countries. About two thirds of this transit traffic
passes through Turkish ports, while the other third goes by road all the way
from Europe to the Middle East. In addition, Turkish ports have been shipping
almost 45 million tons of mostly Iraqi crude oil and products annually in
recent years.
1.04      Demand for intercity Passenger services is approaching 150 billion
pkm. About 95% of this demand is handled by buses. Intercity rail passenger
services have become insignificant. Mainline passenger traffic has not
increased since 1955, while bus traffic has been booming, increasing over five
fold in the last twenty-five years. Since 1983, private car registration has
increased dramatically, exceeding GNP growth rates by almost 501.
1.05      Cagacity of the TransRort System - Domestic freight increased faster
than GNP between 1984 and 1988, at 6.71 p.a. Public intercity passenger



- 2 -
traffic grew only at 5.1X p.a. during the same period, which may be explained
by the rapid growth in automobile ownership. Generally, the capacity of the
transport system has been sufficient to handle the growing demand without
major bottlenecks. A large increase in transport investment took place after
publication of the first National Transport Master Plan (NTNP) in 1983. Road
transport services for freight and passengers are deregulated and highly
competitive and the market responds quickly to demand. For instance,
privately operated buses run frequently to virtually every point of the
country, offering different levels of service at different prices.
International trucking also developed rapidly in the 1980s and Turkey now has
the largest fleet of trucks operating between Europe and the Middle East,
generating substantial foreign exchange earnings (US$600 million in 1989).
Recent deregulation of air transport has seen a flourish of new companies,
competing with the national sirline.
C. Effliiency of Operations and TransDgrt Costs
1.06      Road transport, operated entirely by the private sector, handles
over 80X of the freight and 951 of the passenger demands and therefore sets
the stage for competition by the other modes. Its costs are low in comparison
with those in other countries. In early 1990, truck charges ranged from TL
80/tkm to TL 300/tkm depending on the region and road characteristics, with a
median around TL 100/tkm (US 4.3 cents/tkm). This compares with truck costs
in Germany of about 11 US cents/tkm. On average, railway costs for freight
are about the same as trucking costs, because of the low average density of
traffic on the rail network (less than a million ton-km per route km).
1.07      Given Turkey's size and corresponding long transport distances,
there is an economic case for more bulk movements by rail. Indeed, major rail
customers typically require more rail transport than they can obtain from
Turkish State Railways (TCDD). A shift of some 4 to 5 million tons p.a. or
about 2 billion tkm from road to rail would make economic sense and reduce the
overall transport bill. A rough estimate indicates that such a shift would
save US$28 million equivalent p.a. Recent experience indicates that indeed
rail costs can be reduced substantially when volume increases. Between 1981
and 1989, rail freight increased 35X, thus recouping traffic losses sustained
in the late 1970s, and unit costs per tkm, in constant terms, came down to
almost half their earlier level. There is an urgent need for the railways to
concentrate their resources on the movement of bulk freight and cut down  eia
operation of poorly patronized passenger trains, but realistically, this is
expected to take considerable time and effort to achieve.
1.08      Even more important than this relatively small shift in traffic to
the more economic rail mode is the need to maintain road vehicle operating
costs low, since trucks and buses will continue to handle most of the
transport demand in Turkey. This would require that resources allocated to
maintenance and strengthening of the road network be kept at adequate levels
to prevent deterioration of the network. A 20X increase in vehicle operating
costs would engender, each year, a US$570 million equivalent increase in the
transport bill of intercity trucks and buses alone.



-3.
1.09      Other operating cost savings in the sector could result from
improvements in port productivity which usually results from unitization,
including containerization, of break bulk generel cargo. At present, less
than 20X of general cargo trade is containerized; although the number of
containers handled at Turkish ports is now increasing rapidly. Approaches to
increase port efficiency are under study.
D. Institutional Setting
1.10      There are two main institutions responsible for the transport sector
at the central government level, the Ministry of Public Works and Settlements
(MOPW) and the Ministry of Transport (MOT). The MOW, through its Directorate
of Roads (KGM), is responsible for the development and maintenance of state
and provincial roads, a network of about 60,000 km. The MOT is responsible
for developing the infrastructure of the rail, maritime and air transport
modes; the regulation of transport operations in the various modes and the
supervision of state economic enterprises (SEEs) in the transport sector,
except for the two pipeline SEEs which come under the Ministry of Energy. In
addition, the Ministry of Agriculture deals with rural roads, through its
Directorate of Village Services.
1.11      The seven major state economic enterprises in the transport sector
are:
TCDD        -    operating the railways and most major ports
THY         -     the national airline
DHMI        -     operating the civilian airports
TDI         -    operating a variety of maritime services such as
ferries, passenger ships, rescue and salvage
vessels, pilotage and the remaining major ports
D.B. DENIZ
NAKLIYAT  -     the national shipping cargo line
BOTAS       -     operating pipelines
DITAS       -     operating a variety of petroleuz. transport
services, including oil tankers
1.12      Planning units within the various modal agencies and SEEs are
responsible for identifying and proposing capital investments and operating
budget estimates. They provide the technical, economic and, in the case of
SEEs, financial feasibility studies for investment projects. The State
Planning Organization (SPO) has the responsibility for reviewing the agencies
investment proposals and establishing the medium-term as well as the annual
investments programs.



- 4 -
1.13      There is considerable scope for institutional and organizational
changes in the overall transport sa tor; however, this is a slow and
particularly difficult process.   On one hand, KOM, under the Ministry of
Public Works is well organized and effective; on the other, the Ministry of
Transport and the SEEs under its jurisdiction such as railways, ports and
civil aviation need to modernize their structures and operations.
E. iSetor lsaues
1.14      Due to macro-economic pressures and budgetary constraints, the
allocations for the state and provincial road network decreased in real terms
between 1984 and 1988. As a result, the backlog of road sections needing
strengthening and improvement increased to a point where maintenance costs
were becoming excessive. Recognizing the importance to build on existing KGM
strength and ensure protection of   ts major asset base, thus avoiding costly
road failures In the future, budgetary allocations were increased in recent
years (para. 2.20). The proposed project is highlighting the need to focus on
this issue. The project would also give impetus to the shift from force
account work to contract work being gradually implemented by KGM as all civil
works under the project will be carried out by contractors.
1.15      The most important issue in the sector, from a budgetary
perspective, concerns the future role of the railways. Like in most other
countries, Turkish railways have lost their monopoly in the face of road
competition and their share of the market has decreased considerably.
Deficets are large and TCDD losses constitute the dominant sectoral problem in
macroeconomic terms. Revenues from freight barely cover marginal costs while
those from mainline passengers cover less than 301 of total costs. The drain
on public funds from the railways has reached the equivalent of almost half a
million US$ per day. The losses are covered by Government subsidies and by
port operating profits and proceeds of the wharf tax from TCDD ports.
Government controls tariffs, and increases are granted late, lagging behind
inflation. Tariff increases are however only one side of the problem as they
are constrained by the very competitive truck charges. Another way to reduce
deficits is by reducing costs through increased efficiency and productivity,
and by focusing operations on the more profitable aspects of the business,
i.e. freight rather than passengers.
1.16      This would require the railways to move away from the traditional
"production-driven" operation toward a more "customer or market-driven"
operation. This would also imply that the railways should be fully
compensated for operating services (particularly passenger) deemed necessary
by the Government for social reasons. Similar reforms in Europe and Japan
have taken some twenty years to bear fruit and some are still continuing.
Therefore, while Government and TCDD are pursuing some reforms in these areas,
progress is expected to be slow as many difficult issues have to be tackled
such as discontinuing certain services, reducing and relocating staff and
profoundly changing the ways of conducting business and operations.
1.17      Another issue concerns the ports.  The present organization of the
sector should be improved to be more conducive to modern efficient operations



and responsive to the needs of Turkish freight traders and transit customers.
Also, trade facilitatiorn, including streamlining of customs procedures, has
not yet followed international developments. Therefore, the full benefits of
modern logistics, including door to door movement of containers, are not
available in Turkey. As with railways, a more market oriented approach is
needed in the maritime and foreign trade sector. Some larger degree of
privatization, of port activities in particular, would be helpful in achieving
the shift to greater market responsiveness. The Government is launching a
series of studies in the port sector with Bank assistance, to address the
above issues (para. 1.21).
F. Previous Bank ExRerience in the Sector
1.18      The Bank's involvement in the transport sector has been small and
sporadic. In thirty years, the Bank has made only seven loans to the sector;
three for ports and two each for railways and roads. Project implementation,
although experiencing delays, has generally been satisfactory in achieving
physical targets, but implementation of policy reforms has been less
satisfactory. For instance, the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) of
the first railway project of 1973 concludes that "the far reaching railway
and transport sector reforms were either not accomplished at all or fulfilled
only in minor parts, and the railway's transformation into a modern enterprise
functioning in a commercial environment has not come about". The report
however recognizes that the scope of intended changes was over-ambitious. The
second railway project of 1986 took those findings into account and set more
modest targets, which are showing a mixed performance. While some operational
targets are being reached, financial ones remain unmet. The absence today of
a clear definition of the future role of the railways, a weakness which is
expected to be rectified in the coming few years, has greatly hampered railway
efficiency.
1.19      In February 1991, OED issued the PPAR for the Ports Rehabilitation
Project (Loan 1741-TU) of 1979 and the Highway Rehabilitation Project (Loan
2137-TU) of 1982. Regarding the port project, the main conclusions are that
all physical components were executed, albeit with delays due to unfamiliarity
with the Bank's procurement guidelines; but that little progress was made in
strengthening planning and operations. Regarding the highway project, the
conclusions are, again, that physical implementation was successful, but
little institutional changes could be attributed directly to the project.
However, KGM has actually sought to implement management and analytical
techniques which Bank staff brought to their attention in the course of
supervision. The Second Highway Project (Loan 2439-TU) of 1984 is almost
completed and 93X disbursed. Institutional strengthening of KGM has been
addressed and considerable progress is being made (para. 2.13).
G. Role of the Bank and Lending Strategv
1.20      With four projects in the 80s against three in the previous 30
years, the Bank's strategy has beer. to introduce greater continuity into our
involvement in the sector by more careful planning of our lending operations
and by focussing on those areas which' can yield the highest returns in the



-6-
shortest time. Since the highway subsector handles most of the freight and
passenger traffic, ensuring its efficiency will have the greatest economic
impact and warrants particular emphasis. Also, the implementing agency (KGM)
is responsive and progressive, has developed feasible investment and
maintenance programs but requires Bank support to ensure their effective
implementation.
1.21      At the same time, by monitoring the transport sector as a whole, the
Bank hopes to identify areas of potentially major economic gains notably in
the railways and ports subsectors. For the railways, we are continuing to
advise the Government and TCDD to define the future role of the railways in
the sector and the conditions under which the railways should perform certain
social services mandated by the Government. For ports, we are discussing a
broad set of studies of the sub-sector involving master planning,
institutional reforms including possibilities for privatization, costing and
financing, trade facilitation and marketing. However, in light of the
difficult political and social issues raised by necessary reforms, progress in
these areas is expected to continue to be slow. The Government is acutely
aware of the economic costs of the inefficiencies in these areas and, some
important rationalization has been undertaken when the authorities judged that
the timing was opportune, eg. rail station closures, discontinuing of certain
passenger trains and staff reductions in both railways and road subsectors.
1.22      In summary, therefore, we propose to continue our involvement in the
sector through continued monitoring of the sector and studies, identifying and
pressing for key policy changes entailing major economic gains and selective
project lending, with suitable support to sustain strong performance and
worthwhile reforms undertaken by the agencies themselves. The proposed
project is consistent with this strategy
II. THE HIGHWAY SUB-SECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      Public roads in Turkey are classified in a four-tier system:
motorways (multi-lane access-controlled highways), state roads, provincial
roads, and village roads. The General Directorate of Highways (KGM) of the
MOW is responsible for the administration of motorways and state and
provincial roads. The Directorate of Village Services of the Ministry of
Agriculture has jurisdiction over village and forest roads. In addition,
there are tourism, irrigation and power project roads. Although not included
in KGM's network, construction and maintenance of these roads is, from time to
time, entrusted to KGM by the relevant Ministries.
2.02      In 1989, the road network totalled over 350,000 km compared to
270,000 km in 1980 and 160,000 in 1970. In the last decade, all the increase
in length occurred in rural roads, the network of state and provincial roads
remaining constant at some 60,000 km. Work on the latter concentrated on
their maintenance and some upgrading to handle rapidly increasing traffic.
Shortage of funds, however, prevented the carrying out of the full
strengthening and upgrading program included in the 1983 NTNP. The 10-year
plan had recommended the laying of over 1,000 km of new asphaltic concrete



-7-
(AC) surfacing, to reinforce all roads with more than 500 heavy vehicles/day
and 1,500 km of new surface dressing per year. Actually, due to the
Government's inability to fully fund the program, only some 1,400 km of new AC
pavement were laid during the entire decade. Progress was somewhat better
with new surface dressing, adding about 1,000 km/year (Table 2.1).

Source: KGN
2.03     The need for pavement strengthening is becoming acute.  Almost
10,000 km of state roads have an average annual daily traffic (AADT) exceeding
2,000 vehicles, of which over 1,000 are heavy vehicles. Under increasing
traffic volumes and heavier truck loadings, all these roads are candidates for
pavement strengthening including AC surfacing. At present only about 4,300 km
of state and provincial roads have an AC surface.

Pavement strengthening is the highest priority item in KGM's capital
investment program, as the current practice of very frequent surface dressings
is likely to prove a less economical option than AC surfacing, when assessed
in terms of total life cycle costs, inclusive of user costs. Asphalt concrete
surfacing i) brings a greatly reduced surface roughness with consequent
lowering of vehicle operating costs, ii) has a considerably longer life than
surface dressing and iii) is better able to resist the surface stress caused
by high axle loads. As already noted, AC has lagged significantly behind
desired levels in the past due to shortages of funds. The proposed project is
focusing on this priority.
B. Road Transport
2.04     Road transport is deregulated and both the trucking and bus
industries are mainly privately owned. Road transport companies, both
domestic and international, vary greatly in size and many are grouped into



- 8 -
associations and cooperatives. Competition between operators keeps tariffs
low, but they at least cover operating costs.
2.05      There were 2.4 million motor vehicles registered in 1989, compared
to 1.1 million in 1979; i.e. an annual growth rate of over 8% (Table 2.2).
Commercial vehicles--buses and trucks--account for 35X of the fleet with cars
comprising the remainder. Cars are concentrated in the urban areas, and so
traffic on major intercity roads often consists of over 50X heavy vehicles.
2.06      Annual vehicle-kms on the state and provincial road network amount
to about 26 billion and have been growing at an average rate of about 8.61
p.a. since 1985 (Table 2.3). Traffic counts are conducted regularly on all
state roads, but only occasionally on provincial roads.  KGM will introduce
more systematic traffic counting and other studies on provincial
roads. Average daily traffic densities are highest (over 20,000 vehicles/day)
in the vicinity of large cities such as Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, and in a
few major corridors where motorways are now under construction.
2.07      In 1984, the legal axle-loads were increased to 13 tons for single
axle and 19 tons for tandem-axle. The maximum gross weight is 19 tons for
two-axle trucks, 26 tons for three or more axle trucks and go up to 42 tons
for five or more axle semi-trailers. Sample data from loadometer surveys
indicate that 5-10 of single axle loads are in the 10-13 ton range, while
less than 31 exceed the revised 13-ton limit.  At present, KGM operates over
200 portable weigh-bridges, some of them financed under a previous Bank loan.
They operate as mobile teams stopping vehicles at random and fining the
overloaded vehicles. Their primary purpose is the policing of vehicle loading
capacity and only incidentally to provide data on axle loads for pavement
design purposes. The proposed project will include weighbridges for the
planning department in order to improve data collection for pavement design.
KGM is in the process of soliciting private sector bids for the establishment
of 54 fixed weighing stations throughout the country. The development and
operation of these stations will be done by contract. Overloaded trucks will
be channeled into a parking area where they will have to unload the excess
weight before being allowed to proceed.
C. Road Safety
2.08      Road traffic accidents are a serious socio-economic problem in
Turkey. In 1989, there were 104,000 accidents injuring 80,000 people and
causing 6,300 deaths. The incidence of fatalities on Turkish highways is
about 6-10 times higher than in other European countries, but comparable to
rates found in other developing countries. The fatality rate on state and
provincial roads has been falling and is now less then half its level in the
early 1970s (Table 2.4). Over the last few years Government has begun to
address the road safety problems through education, enforcement and
engineering. Traffic safety is being introduced in the school curriculum, the
traffic police is being trained under bilateral assistance, and KGN is
emphasizing the technical aspects of road safety, which are supported by this
project.



- 9 -
2.09      For instance, in the mid-80s, KGM started a program of guardrail
construction which resulted in 300 km of hazardous sections being equipped
with guardrails. Guardrails are installed when traffic is in excess of 500
vehicles per day and where warranted by road conditions, for instance where
embankments are more than 3 m high. Due to lack of funds, the program slowed
down considerably in recent years. Unless the pace of recent years is speeded
up, it would take some 10 years to complete the remaining 200 km of critical
sections. Vertical signs are deficient on about 501 of provincial roads, and
the current material used for horizontal markings is not very durable,
requiring frequent renewal. Provision is made in the proposed project to
assist with development in the above areas.
D. Highway Administration and Organization
2.10      KGM is a mature organization and has proved to be a satisfactory
agency of the borrower with respect to implementation of the physical and
institutional aspects of the projects. The KGM present organization is shown
in Chart 1. In 1990, KGM employed a total of 35,000 persons down from 44,000
in 1985 (Table 2.5). The work force consists of 5,000 technical and
administrative staff and 30,000 laborers (801 permanent). About 201 of
technical and administrative staff and 31 of labor are stationed at
headquarters in Ankara. The headquarters staff is organized in 11 departments
with 33 divisions. The number of people reporting directly to the Director
Genral is excessive. This problem is now being addressed (see below).
2.11      The field organization consists of 17 regional divisions (b8lge) and
112 sub-divisions (sube). A division comprises 4-9 sub-divisions, each one
covering about 500-600 km of the state and provincial road network. Within
each sub-division are based an average of seven maintenance teams. There are
730 maintenance teams in all; each team has a crew of 5 to 8 with
responsibility for 50-100 km of road. There are in addition three equipment
and workshop groups at Maltepe (Istanbul), Iskendurun, and Akkopru (Ankara).
Winter maintenance is a major activity of KGM, to keep the roads free from
snow and landslides. None of the roads included in the winter maintenance
program are allowed to remain closed to traffic for more than two days.
During 1987/88, 55,300 km or 941 of the state and provincial road network was
covered by the winter maintenance program.
2.12      The division Directors of KGM exercise a large measure of executive
authority. They are accountable to the Director General for operational
matters and to the various department heads for technical matters.
Construction and periodic resurfacing works are managed from the divisional
offices while routine maintenance work is done at sub-divisional level.
Equipment is allocated to the 17 divisional offices according to the
construction and maintenance programs of the divisions. The workshops and
stores organization in each division are under the divisional director for
day-to-day operations. The Head of the Equipment Department in Ankara is
responsible for the overall inventory control of the fleet and the operation
of central stores and equipment pools in Ankara, Istanbul and Iskendurun, and
through divisional directors for the provision and maintenance in running
order of sufficient equipment for KGM's road maintenance and construction
activities.

2.13      With the assistance of the U.S. Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), KGM has begun a process of reorganization and modernization of its
structure to adapt it to the greater emphasis on contract work at all levels.
KG4 intends to continue reducing its force of permanent laborers.  At the same
time, the quality and number of the technical and administrative staff has to
be strengthened to assume the supervision of the contractors. This process
has only commenced in the past 2 years. It is estimated to require between 5
and 10 years and is fully endorsed by the Bank. Provision is made in this
project to cover some of the expenses of implementing the reorganization.
E. EngineriLng. Construction and Maintenance
2.14      Engineering, construction and maintenance functions for state and
provincial roads are performed to satisfactory standards by or under the
supervision of KGM.  Road design standards are appropriate to traffic flows
and physical characteristics. In 1980, about 25X of covstruction work was
carried out by contract, this has now increased to over 60X and the long term
target is 751. For maintenance work over 30X is now also done by contract.
Force account operations have been greatly reduced in the western and coastal
areas, with the 751 target already achieved in Istanbul and Izmir regions.
KGM is now making a concerted effort to increase the share of work done by
contractors in the interior and eastern regions. KGM's force account
operations and training have proved beneficial to the economy by providing
trained personnel for the construction industry.  KGM remains the primary
source of trained highway personnel in the country with a fairly high turnover
of professional and skilled staff from KGM to private contractors. The
forthcoming opening of a new training center on the outskirts of Ankara, which
will, in addition to training KGM staff, offer courses to the private sector
and to foreign highway personnel, will further respond to the demand for
better trained road specialists in the public as well as private sectors. The
proposed project will finance equipment and technical staff training for this
new training center.
2.15      Maintenance is always given top priority by KGM.  When funds are
short, as in recent years, investments have been deferred so that more funds
could be used for maintenance including periodic resurfacing. As a result,
the surface condition of the state road network is rated as 801 good, 151 fair
and 51 poor. Condition ratings are not available for provincial roads, but
conditions have improved since 1980. The percentage of bituminous surfaced
provincial roads increased from 351 in 1980 to 641 in 1989.
2.16      KGN's equipment fleet consisted of some 14,000 units in mid-1990
with a replace.ment value of US$600 million including $79 million for 1,760
units in scrap condition. About 201 of the fleet is over 15 years old and
some 501 is over 10 years old (Table 2.6). In 1982, by comparison, the
equipment fleet included 18,700 units with a replacement value of $555 million
(at that time), including $184 million for scrap units. About 341 of the
fleet was over 15 years old. KGM is actively pursuing a policy of reducing
the size and age structure of its fleet, consistent with its policy of
reducing the role of force account work. Considerable modernization of the
fleet was accomplished with financing under the Second Highway Project. Under



- 11 -
that project, KGN is also implementing a computerized equipment management
system to control the use of the fleet and spare parts, i.e., to decide when
to repair, when to scrap, what stocks of spares to hold and the level of
rental charges to cover the cost of owning, maintaining, and repairing
equipment. Further reduction of the fleet will continue, with another 4,000
units to be retired over the next 2-3 years. Unlike many agencies, KGM has
good procedures for the sale of surplus equipment. Fleet modernization and
improvements to its management will be continued under this project.
F. Highway Planning and Design
2.17      Planning for the state and provincial roads is the responsibility of
KGM, with virtually all the work carried out "in house" by the planning
department. Methods for evaluating the economic feasibility of road
investment projects have been developed by KGM on the basis of Bank models.
In the early 1980s, the Bank's Road Analysis Model (RAM) was used for project
evaluation and over the last few years, KGM has been adapting parts of the
Bank's Highway Design Model (HDM3), particularly its vehicle operating cost
module. Large numbers of projects are analyzed and ranked according to their
economic rate of return. This approach is satisfactory and places KGM in the
forefront of Turkish organizations with a country-wide approach to investment
planning based on sound economic criteria. One problem is that there are far
more economically justified projects than resources available to carry them
out. Therefore, KGM, like many other agencies in Turkey, has a tendency to
start too many projects at the same time and extend their execution over too
many years. A benefit of this project will be to concentrate resources on
road sections which can be improved within a normal contract period of 2-3
years.
2.18      Under the ongoing project, the concept of pavement management was
introduced, and some experimental sections of highway were built on the
Ankara-Izmir Road. Further development and refinement of the planning process
will be obtained by the introduction of a more formal pavement management
system (PMS). This will be phased in parallel with the reorganization and
furtfer improvement of staff qualifications through training which are
prerequisites to the introduction of a more systematic pavement management
system. Under the proposed project, a range of specialized equipment will be
procured for acquiring the comprehensive database needed for a fully developed
computerized PMS, and monitoring of the experimental sections will be
continued. Initially, this data will be fed into the HDM3, but it will be
suitable for KGM's own system when it comes on line.
G. Highwav Expenditures
2.19      The total volume, as well as the composition, of highway
expenditures, have fluctuated substantially during the last decade in Turkey.
After being rather constant over five years somewhat above TL 3 trillion p.a.
in constant 1990 terms, expenditures dropped dramatically in 1985 and 1986,
regained their earlier level in 1987 and quickly increased in 1988 and 1989 as
the construction of motorways gained momentum. In 1985, the Government
initiated an ambitious motorways' program along 1,200 km of the most heavy
transport corridors of Turkey; namely from the Bulgarian border through



- 12 -
Istanbul (including the Second Bosphorus bridge) to Ankara; in the South
between Mersin and Iskenderun through Adana; and around Izmir. All motorway
sections under construction have acceptable economic rates of return, although
some of them might have been deferred for a few years in order to lower public
expenditures. Notorways are financed by extra-budgetary funds and external
borrowings.

Actual Expenditures through 1989 and Budgeted Expenditures for 1990
Source: KO and SPO
2.20      Budget allocations for state and provincial roads decreased
continuously in real terms between 1984 and 1988, and in that year amounted to
only two-thirds of their level in the early 1980s. As a result, strengthening
and upgrading programs included in the 1983 NTMP fell further and further
behind. Only a few investment projects were started on state and provincial
roads over the last years, as scarce funds were wisely concentrated on
maintenance. While the frequent surface dressing of roads has maintained them
in reasonable condition, many sections built in the 1950s and 60s were not
designed for today's axle-loads. Therefore, catching up on the deferred
strengthening program has now become a major priority to avoid deterioration
and postpone major reconstruction. The importance of this point has been
recognized by SPO and higher allocations were granted for state and provincial
roads both in 1989 and 1990; with the 1990 allocation being 24X above that of
1988 in real terms (Table 2.7).
2.21      In the next few years, until the hump in motorway expenditures has
passed, annual allocations for state and provincial roads are expected to
remain at their 1990-91 level of about US$700 million; of which about US$200
million are from the recurrent budget and US$500 million from the investment
budget (Table 2.8). KGM's five-year program (1991-95) indicates its intention
to use this 241 increase in allocation to accelerate its program of
strengthening of state roads to some 500 km per year while continuing with
about 1,000 km of new surfacing of state and provincial roads every year.
This project supports this objective. Meanwhile, the periodic resurfacing of
roads with bituminous surface treatment will continue at around 7,000 km
annually, giving an average resurfacing cycle of 6 years. The overall



- 13 -
criteria for applying KGM's budget is satisfactory and they consistently
allocate their resources to priority items in their work program.
H. Highway Financing
2.22      State, provincial and village roads are financed primarily through
the budget; motorways have been financed from extra-budgetary funds and
foreign borrowings. It is Government policy that road users shall pay the
cost of roads by means of road user charges and tol4a. The revenues from road
user charges in recent years are as follows:

Source:  MOF and Bank Estimates
In most years, the road user charge revenues exceed the total of capital and
recurrent expenditures on state, provincial and village roads. Motorways,
when completed, will be tolled and therefore generate their own revenues, in
addition to common road user charges.
2.23      Fuel prices are basically deregulated in Turkey and exceed border
prices by a substantial margin. For instance, fuel prices were rapidly
adjusted after August 1990, and in November, the pump prices of gasoline and
diesel were TL 2,162 and TL 1,796 per liter (about US$3.1 and US$2.6/gallon).
The substantial margin previously existing between gasoline and diesel prices
has been reduced and a recent study of road user charges by KGM indicates that
all classes of vehicle now pay at least the cost of the damage they impose on
the roads.
I. Environmental Asgects
2.24      Turkey has established general laws and regulations for the
protection of the environment, which provide a framework for the specific
guidelines and institutional development measures now being devised and
implemented by sector ministries. In 1989, a regulation was approved giving
the authority to KGM to introduce proper technical inspection of road
vehicles, with adequate equipment to measure various technical parameters
including vehicle emissions. A decision was made to have the private sector
invest, build and operate the testing stations.  Since then, KGN has built two
experimental stations, with the assistance of Germany, for demonstration to
potentially interested private sector groups.



- 14 -
2.25      The standards adopted for emission control are those of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) which have been accepted by 21
European countries (regulation 15.00, 4th revision). There is some concern
that these standards would have to be considered only as targets since the
average age of vehicles in Turkey is high and the quality of vehicle
construction and maintenance and of fuels, lower than in other European
countries. One of the immediate objectives is to reduce the sulphur content
of diesel fuel; originally around 1%, it has already been reduced to about
0.6% and will be down to 0.3% by 1993. Unleaded gasoline is also being
introduced. Turkey is also planning to retrofit its refineries which would
assist in achieving the above targets.
2.26      KGM is also taking measures to minimize the impact of road work on
the environment. These are discussed in relation to the project (para. 3.22).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The objectives of the proposed project are to (i) keep transport
costs low in Turkey by ensuring adequate renewal and maintenance of the road
network; (ii) reduce the backlog of road strengthening; (iii) continue the
downsizing, modernization and improvement of the management of KGM's equipment
fleet; (iv) strengthen and modernize the planning and design capabilities of
KGM; and (v) improve the management and safety of the road system through
reforms, modernization and training.
B. Project Descrigtion
3.02      The components of the proposed project are:
(a)   strengthening about 650 km of high priorit:: sections of
existing state roads;
(b)   improvement of about 300 km of selected provincial roads;
(c)   procurement of equipment and materials for road maintenance,
research, planning, survey and design, reorganization,
computerization and training;
(d)   improvement of road safety;
(e)   training for KGM's staff; and
(f)   consulting services.
Strengthening and Rehabilitation of State Roads
3.03      Sections of state roads, totalling about 650 km, will be
reconstructed and improved, including asphaltic concrete paving. The road
sections to be financed under the project will be selected based on the
following criteria:



- 15 -
-     road sections with around 1,000 heavy vehicles/day plus
road sections with particular features such as selected
sections on the northern TETEK-J road (the designated trunk
road in northern Turkey, used by TIR, international traffic to
Iran). See Map IBRD 22758.
-     Economic Rate of Return (ERR) greater than 15%.
These criteria were reconfirmed at negotiations
3.04      Sections selected will generally follow the existing alignment, but
with minor improvements of curves, widening of the roadway in some cases to
dual standard and/or shoulders, and improvements to drainage being included
where required to meet current Class I design standards. In a few cases,
short realignment may be included to shorten the route length or improve the
alignment. Works will include widening or replacement of bridges and
structures and intersection redesign appropriate to traffic levels. A list of
roads meeting the above criteria has been prepared by KOM (Table 3.1). The
first-year program of road strengthening and rehabilitation has been
identified. It includes 8 sections located along the Black Sea coast, in the
west of Turkey and along the northern TETEK alignment. Most sections will
have two lane pavements of 7 m width and partly paved shoulders of 2.5 m.
Design standards are generally acceptable. Detailed engineering is complete
for 7 road sections totalling over 550 km and is underway for the remaining
sections.
Improvement of Provincial Roads
3.05      Sections of provincial roads, totalling about 300 km will be
improved to all weather standards, including asphaltic surface dressing. The
road sections to be financed under this project will be selected according to
the following criteria and designed generally to KGN's Class II standards:
-     For roads with existing traffic:  The projects will consist
mainly of paving existing gravel roads plus minor
improvements. Economic Rate of Return greater than 12%.
-     For new roads:  Design standards will be the minimum necessary
to provide access in good weather, accepting road closures in
winter where snowfall is severe. Design standards will be
reduced in areas of severe terrain to KGM's service roads
(Cl. III standards). Economic Rate of Return greater than
10%.
These criteria were reconfirmed at negotiations. Typically, the level of
quantifiable benefits of improved and new provincial roads is lower than for
state roads as the traffic level is much lower. Nevertheless, these roads
provide access to lower income rural populations and directly contribute to
mitigating the effects of poverty in their service areas. They also improve
1/ Trans Turkey Highway.



- 16 -
access to a number of public services. Therefore, the threshold for
acceptance under the project is lower than for state roads. The design
standards will be adapted to the traffic volumes. A list of roads meeting the
above criteria has been prepared by KGM (Table 3.1).
Equipment
3.06      Road Maintenance Equipment.  KGM is continuing to restructure and
modernize its equipment fleet to concentrate on routine and emergency
maintenance as construction and periodic maintenance activities are gradually
shifted to contractors. Turkey's climate and terrain, particularly in the
East, result in the need to respond immediately to reasonably frequent land
slides, avalanches, heavy snowfalls, etc. Because of the emergency nature of
these events, which often occur in sparsely settled areas, intervention by
contractors is not feasible. As a consequence KGM needs to have an emergency
response capability. Under this project, KGM will acquire some 300 multi-
purpose 4-wheel drive maintenance trucks, together with attachments for these
trucks and similar trucks acquired under the previous project, and 100 dump
trucks. These 400 new trucks will replace some 1,400 overaged trucks and
increase the efficiency of the maintenance crews. Other main items to be
procured are 50 front end loaders and 30 dozers to replace respectively 106
and 199 overaged items. The new loaders and dozers will be deployed mostly in
Eastern Turkey. For routine asphalt resealing works, the project will finance
16 asphalt distributors, replacing overaged and outmoded ones, and one slurry
seal plant. KGM will use the latter to experiment with slurry technology,
which if successful will be introduced into the private sector. A list of
equipment to be procured under the project is in Table 3.2 .
3.07      Research. Planning. Survey and Design Equipment.  The project will
provide equipment to assist KGM in upgrading the capabilities of certain
Headquarters Technical Departments. As part of its program to introduce more
sophisticated management of its road system, KGM plans to acquire equipment
for its Technical Research Department which will enable it to monitor the
condition of its pavements. Data collection equipment will also be acquired
for the Planning Department for building a database on road geometry, axle
load spectra and traffic counts. In particular. KGM confirmed at negotiations
that traffic counts will be extended to grovincial roads. To modernize its
Survey and Road Design Department, KGM will acquire through the project some
modern photogrametric plotters and surveying equipment to replace obsolete
models, as well as software for bridge design and management. The
introduction of this equipment will enable KGM to improve the quality of its
planning decisions and enhance the technical and cost effectiveness of its
design work. A list of equipment to be provided under the project is given in
Table 3.2.
3.08      Reorganization and Computerization.  As mentioned above, KGM has
sought the assistance of US FHWA for the reorganization and computerization of
its management systems. Provision is made in the project to acquire equipment
for implementation of the recommendations of the KGM/FHWA reorganization
study.
3.09      training.  Equipment will be procured for KGN's new training center
in Ankara. It will include laboratory equipment and visual aids (Table 3.2).

Improvement of Road Safety
3.10      KGM is making a serious effort to improve the engineering aspects of
road safety. The project will cover: a) the procurement and installation by
contract of guardrails on about 150 km of hazardous road sections;
b) materials for traffic signs and markings; and c) portable weighing devices
(Table 3.3). The project would finance new signing materials and modern line
marking materials for use by KGM's traffic teams and signs factory. There are
some 400,000 traffic signs on the 60,000 km of roads under KGM; 250,000 are
standard traffic signs and 150,000 are information signs. Each year about
100,000 signs are renewed, of which half are manufactured by KGM and half by
the private sector. Thermoplastic painting will double the life of horizontal
marking on the 4,500 km of asphaltic concrete roads which are the ones with
the densest traffic. The new markings will be more visible, longer lasting
and reflectorized, and will greatly enhance road safety. Portable weighing
devices would complement the program of fixed weighing stations now being
developod (para. 2.07 ). The project would finance the replacement of some 50
of the existing 200 portable weigh-bridges which are no longer functioning
effectively.
Training of KGM staff
3.11      In addition to equipment for the new training center, the project
will finance fellowships to train trainers for the center, and KGM staff.  The
fellowships will provide training opportunities with contractors, consultants,
highway departments and universities abroad. The program will be arranged by
the Training Department. Detailed programs will be reviewed by the Bank.
Consulting Services
3.12      The project includes a provision for KGM to retain consultants to
advise in such fields as (i) pavement research and management;
(ii) improvement of highway safety; (iii) general management of the
organization; and (iv) training and operation of the training center.
C. Cost Estimates
3.13      The total project cost is estimated at US$480 million equivalent.
The proposed Bank loan of US$300 million, to be disbursed over a six-year
period, would finance only about 12X of KGM's total investment program over
the period. The cost estimates are given below:

3.14      The cost of the civil works for state and provincial roads have been
estimated on the basis of average cost per km for similar works at
US390,000/km for strengthening of state roads and US$290,000/km for improving
provincial roads. Base cost estimates reflect January 1991 prices including
taxes. Because of the program nature of the civil works component, no
physical contingencies have been included. Price contingencies have been
applied to base costs following the Bank guidelines as follows:
IBRD FY          22     29        94      95       96      97
Local X          50      40       35      30       25      25
Foreign X       9.5     3.3      1.2     1.8      2.7     3.2
The foreign exchange component for civil works is based on estimates of the
direct and indirect foreign cost.   Prices for equipment and materials are
based on those obtained recently through international bidding for similar
equipment or direct enquiries. The cost estimates and contingencies are
considered reasonable and have been confirmed during negotiations.
D. Financing
3.15      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$480 million
equivalent. The foreign exchange cost of US$300 million (631), will be
financed by the loan, and the remaining US$180 equivalent (371) financed by
the Government.

E. Implementation. Monitoring and Auditing
3.16      KGM will be responsible for implementing all components of the
project and for the overall loan and project administration. To ensure co-
ordination of activities under the Loan between the different depa;tments and
regions of KGM, KGM will appoint a Project Coordinator with appropriate staff,
and convene, as necessary, an ad hoc committee under a Deputy Director General
to guide the implementation of the project. These arrangements and their
timing were confirmed at negotiations.  The project will be implemented over
the period necessary to complete civil works contracts let primarily during
the calendar years 1991 and 1992. The cut-off date for the signature of civil
works contracts is June 30. 1993. Contracts signed after this date will not
be eligible for financing. The project comnletion date. confirmed at
negotiations is December 31. 1996 and the logn closing date June 30. 1997. An
implementation schedule is given in Table 3.5.
3.17      Proiect monitoring and reporting procedures include the preparation
by KGM of: a) a detailed program for contracts to be let in 1992, to be
available to the Bank before the end of 1991; b) semi-annual progress reports
on Bank financed project components; c) feaeibility study reports as required
for the road sections to be financed by the Bank; bid evaluation reports; and
d) audit reports prepared by Treasury controllers on Bank-financed elements of
the project. For the proposed project KGM will follow a reporting format
agreed upon at negotiations. Within six months after the project closing
date, KGM will prepare and submit to the Bank a project completion report.
All the above arrangements have been reconfirmed during negotiations.
F. Procurement
3.18      Procurement of Bank financed project elements will be carried out as
shown in the table below:

3.19      Civil works cortr.cts would be let through ICB among prequalified
contractors in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. Some
contracts may be let in a&-ance of Board Presentation to take advantage of the
1991 construction season (sn'e para. 3.20).   Bitumen would be procured in bulk
on the international markes. under ICB rules by KGM, which operates a chain of
port and regional heated st'orage depots, continuing an arrangement made under
the Second Highway Project. Most items of equipment and road safety materials
would be procured under ICE, though certain specialized items for research and
road design, manufactured by only a few suppliers, may be purchased by
international shopping, on tL basis, normally, of three invited quotations.
Guardralls and thermoplastic Line marking will be procured through ICB supply
and install contracts. If iu is not possible to assure supply and
installation under one contract, supply would be through ICB and installation
may exceptionally be through LCB or force account. Consultants for training
and studies would be appointed on the basis of proposals invited from agreed
shortlists of appropriate specialists, under the Bank's guidelines for the
engagement of consultants. All civil works and the bitumen contracts will be
subject to prior review by the Bank. For equipment and materials purchases
exceeding US$300,000, all specifications and award will be subject to prior
review.

5       Unallocated             =13
Total:             300
A schedule of estimated disbursements has been prepared based on historical
profiles of transport projects in Turkey (Table 3.4). Since KGM's past
disbursement performance has been above average, actual disbursements may be
faster than shown in Table 3.4. In order to facilitate disbursements., a
Special Account would be opened in the Central Bank of Turkey, with an
authorized allocation of US$20 million. The Loan Agreement provides for
retroactive financing of eligible contracts entered into by KGM after April 1,
1991, in an amount not to exceec. $25 million. Disbursements have been handled
well by KGM throughout the previous projects and the Central Bank has operated
the Special Account in a satisfactory manner.
H. Project Supervision
3.21      Two Bank supervision missions per year during the five years of
project implementation (July 1991 to June 1996) would be adequate to supervise
project activities. The missions are expected to be longer in 1991 and 1992
when review and clearance of road sections to be contracted under the project
will be necessary. These missions should consist of a highway engineer and an
economist. Sufficient time should be allowed also to review contract
documents and specifications, particularly for the varied equipment to be
procured under the project. During the construction phase 1993 to 1996,
missions can be shorter, particularly for the economist. In sum, project
supervision would require about 16 staff weeks in 1991 and 1992 and 12 staff
weeks after 1992.

I. Environmental Impact
3.22      This project has been classified as "B" for purposes of OD 4.00,
Annex A on Environmental Assessment, meaning that only limited environmental
review is required. Proposed ^ivil works are inostly improvements of existing
roads including improved side and cross drainage, overlays on old pavements,
and bituminous surfacing on gravel roads, all of which will improve conditions
along the roads through reducing dust, noise, water ponding and erosion, and
eliminating safety hazards. Requirements for additional land are minimal and
there are no resettlement issues. KGM, who is directly preparing or
supervising detailed design for these projects, applies acceptable design
criteria for erosion control and drainage. Contractors are responsible for
maintaining worksites pollution free and returning sites to their original
conditions. The new bidding documents cover these points specifically. In
particular, the contract documents specify that asphalt plants be equipped
with dust collectors. The Undersecretariat for Environment has issued
guidelines for the emissions of asphalt plants and crushers. KGM has
introduced these guidelines in its bidding documents for this project. The
contract documents also contain adequate protection for any archeological
sites discovered during excavations. The road safety component will help to
reduce accidents at black spots.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The proposed project will improve the efficiency of the road
transport sector by reducing overall transport costs. Quantifiable benefits
will be in the form of reduced vehicle operating costs (VOC), i.e. lower fuel
consumption, tire wear and general vehicle maintenance costs, time and wage
savings. Also, the present value of road expenditures will be reduced by
undertaking road strengthening now and avoiding more expensive reconstruction
at a later date. Road maintenance expenditures will also decrease on newly
paved provincial roads. The improvement of provincial roads will facilitate
all weather access and transport in predominantly rural areas, which are
presently isolated by the poor condition of existing roads. The road safety
component will contribute to the reduction in accidents.
4.02      The benefits will accrue to a large and widespread number of
beneficiaries. Lower road transport costs and time savings will benefit
vehicle owners as well as users. Private users such as individual car owners,
bus passengers and own account transporters will capture benefits directly.
In the case of trucking and inter-city bus services, the benefits accrue first
to the vehicle owners, but will be passed on to producers and consumers in the
form of lower freight rates and fares, given the very competitive nature of
the road transport industry in Turkey. The service areas of provincial roads
to be improved will benefit from the employment generated from works,
increased opportunity to market their products at competitive prices; also the
living conditions of the populations served by these roads will improve and
the effects of poverty will be mitigated.



- 23 -
B. Costs and Beneflts
4.03      KGM has prepared feasibility studies for over 20 road sections
meeting the criteria to be financed under the project. All costs and benefits
were evaluated in constant 1990 prices. Financial costs and prices have been
converted to economic prices. Traffic growth rates have been assumed at 5S
p.a. for freight vehicles and 61 p.a. for cars and buses which is
conservative. VOC have been estimated using the Bank's HDM model; the unit
VOCs are summarized in Table 4.1. Road roughness coefficient have been
estimated based on engineer's evaluation of the road surface.  KGM has agreed
to purchase a bump integrator with the remaining funds of the Second Highway
Project (Ln 2439-TU) in order to improve the quality of inputs to the model.
Time savings were valued at the predominant wage rates for drivers, no time
savings value was inputed for passengers. At negotiations. KGM' confirmed that
it will preRare or update similar feasibility studies for any additional roads
which may be submitted for Bank financing.
4.04      The economic rates of return (ERR) for roads identified by KGM and
calculated over an assumed 15 year service life, range from 17X to 671 for
state roads and from 10% to 39X for provincial roads (Table 3.1) . The
weighted average return for all roads is 30X. The lower rates accepted for
provincial roads are justified given the substantial unquantified benefits to
improve access in less developed regions.
4.05      The proposed list of equipment to be procured was agreed based on an
evaluation of the total equipment required for KGM's maintenance operations.
These requirements have been compared with the present fleet, its condition
and the need to scrap overaged equipment. All the proposed equipment is for
the maintenance program. The procurement of modern maintenance trucks with
multi-purpose attachments will greatly enhance staff productivity and enable
KGM to continue its very commendable program of staff reduction.  The new
trucks will enable KGM to reduce staffing of its basic maintenance crews from
6 to 8 persons at present to 3 to 5 persons with the new equipment. Combined
with lower operating cost, these personnel reductions will generate total
savings of some US$25,000 per annum per unit, i.e. annual savings equal to 20X
of the purchase price of a new maintenance truck. Similar savings will accrue
to the other equipment to be acquired by the project.
4.06      It is more difficult to estimate the economic return of road safety
components, but it is proven that guardrails, for instance, save lives.
Although their installation in Turkey is too recent to show statistically
meaningful results, some typical sections where guardrails were installed in
1987 and 1988 clearly prove their usefulness. On five such sections, the
number of deaths were cut in half after the installation of guardrails.  In
other countries, the usefulness of lateral marking in reducing accident
frequency has been demonstrated. Since 1986, the Middle East Technical
University has been engaged in a long-term contract with KGM to monitor
accidents on state roads, with a view to identifying black spots where
remedial measures should be taken. They are also monitoring the results of
various types of improvements being implemented by KGM.  This activity will
continue in the future.

C. Overall Evaluation and Risks
4.07 The prospects for satisfactory project implementation are good
considering that KGM has the capacity to meet the proposed expansion of its
activities and contractors are avidly looking for work after some lean years.
The principal risk is any unanticipated shortage or delayed availability of
counterpart funds which may delay disbursements and lengthen project execution
periods. Past performance in this regard, even under severe macro-economic
pressures, has been quite good.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01 During loan negotiations, the Government confirmed:
(a)   the cost estimates for the project (para. 3.13);
(b)   the implementation schedule (para. 3.16); and
(c)   the disbursement schedule (para. 3.20).
5.02 During loan negotiations agreement was reached on the following:
(a)   the criteria for selecting the road sections to be improved under
the project (paras. 3.03 and 3.05);
(b)   that KGM will extend traffic counting to provincial roads (para.
3.07);
(c)   that KGM will appoint a Project Coordinator and an ad hoc Project
Coordinating Committee (para. 3.16);
(d)   the reporting procedures for the project (para. 3.17);
(e)   that the Government will prepare the required audit reports (para.
3.17);
(f)   the procurement procedures, including the bidding documents for
civil works (para. 3.19);
(g)   the disbursement procedures for a special account (para. 3.20);
and
(h)   that appropriate feasibility studies for road sections to be
improved under Bank financing will be submitted to the Bank by KGM
for review before construction bids are invited (para. 4.03).
5.03 Based upon the above assurances and agreements, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$300 million equivalent to the Republic of Turkey for a
17-year term including a 5-year grace period.
