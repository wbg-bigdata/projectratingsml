MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A STATE AND PROVINCIAL ROADS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan of
US$300.0 million equivalent to the Republic of Turkey is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard IBRD terms with a 17-year
term, including a five-year grace period and would help finance the
improvement of state and provincial roads.
2.        Background.  Road transport is vital for the economy of Turkey as it
handles over 80X of the freight and 951 of the inter-city passenger demands.
Road transport is deregulated and operated very competitiTaly by the private
sector. It is therefore imperative that the road infrpstructure also be
managed efficiently to keep transport costs low, inctease safety and minimize
the negative impact of road transport on the enviro.%nent. The Directorate of
Roads (KGM) in the Ministry of Works and Settlements is responsible for the
development and maintenance of motorways and of the state and provincial road
networks, totalling about 60,000 km and catering to most of the transport
requirements given above. Rural access roads (300,000 km) are provided by the
Village Services Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1985, the
Government initiated an ambitious motorways' program along 1200 km of the most
heavy transport corridors of Turkey; namely from the Bulgarian border through
Istanbul (including the Second Bosphorus bridge) to Ankara; in the South
between Mersin and Iskenderun through Adana; and around Izmir. All motorway
ections tmuder construction have acceptable economic rates of return, although
some of them might have been deferred for a few years in order to lower public
expenditures. They will be operated on a toll basis.
3.        Road traffic on the state and provincial roads network has continued
to increase rapidly, at an average rate of 8.5X p.a. since 1985. A third of
the 30,000 km s 'ate road network, or some 10,000 km, now carries over 1,000
heavy trucks da.;~y. With the rapid traffic increase, the high proportion of
heavy vehicles and the increase in legal axle load, the network could
deteriorate rapidly if strengthening and rehabilitation is not carried out.
Because of the constraint on public expenditures over the last few years, the
road strengthening and improvement program has fallen behind the targets set
in the 1983 Transport Master Plan. Scarce funds have wisely been concentrated
on maintenance and resealing rather than strengthening. However, allowed to
continue, this would result in sharply reduced life of the roads and major
reconstruction expenditures in the future. The proposed project is focusing
on assuring an adequate level of road expenditures to improve, maintain and
operate the system at the least cost to the economy.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  In spite of the size of the road
network and its key role in the Turkish economy, the Bank's involvement with
Turkish highways is relatively recent. Two loans (2137-TU and 2439-TU) were
made in 1982 and 1984. The first was completed satisfactorily in 1988 and the
second is 95X disbursed, only a little behind the original disbursement
schedule. Both loans focused on rehabilitation of the Trans-Turkey Highway,
to accommodate the sudden increase of traffic between Europe and the Middle



- 2 -
East in the early 1980s. Both projects included training of KGM staff and the
modernization and rationalization of the road maintenance equipment fleet
through acquisitions of new equipment, purchase of spare parts and development
of an equipment management program.  Considerable progress was made by KGM's
planning department which adopted methodologies developed by the Bank for
investment analysis. This project will continue to support the modernization
and increase the efficiency of KGO through technology transfer, managerial
reforms and training.
5.        The main lesson learnt from our past involvement with KGM is that
the agency responds flexibly and enthusiastically to sound professional
advice, but strongly resists advice which could appear to have been imposed
from the outside. KGN is a mature organization and has proved to be a
satisfactory borrower with respect to implementation of the physical and
institutional aspects of projects. It has quickly developed the necessary
skills and benefitted from the training programs included in the first two
projects. Maintenance of existing roads is always given priority. Over the
last five years, KGM staff was reduced from 44,000 to 35,000 as work
previously done by force account is now contracted out. KGM has also begun a
process of further modernization and reorganization, with the assistance of
the U.S. Federal Highway Administration.  KGM is great.y concerned with road
safety and in addition to monitoring and improving black spots, is also
working with the Ministry of Education and the police to improve road safety
in Turkey. In 1989, KGM was given the authority to introduce proper technical
inspection of road vehicles, including vehicle emission control.
6.        The objectives of the proposed project are to (i) keep transport
costs low in Turkey by ensuring adequate renewal and maintenance of the road
network; (ii) reduce the backlog of road strengthening; (iii) continue the
downsizing, modernization and improvement of the management of KGM's equipment
fleet; (iv) strengthen and modernize the planning and design capabilities of
KGM; and (v) improve the management and safety of the road system through
reforms, modernization and training.
7.        Project Description.  The project would include:
(a)   strengthening about 650 km of high priority sections of
existing state roads;
(b)   improvement of about 300 km of selected provincial roads;
(e)   procurement of equipment and materials for road maintenance,
research, planning, survey and design, reorganization,
computerization and training;
(d)   improvement of road safety;
(e)   training for KGM's staff; and
(f)   consulting services.
8.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$480 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$300 million (63X). The
Loan Agreement provides for retroactive financing of eligible contracts



- 3 -
entered into by KGN after April 1, 1991, in an amount not to exceed US$25
million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule are shown ln Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Turkey are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 9362-TU dated April 29, 1991, is being distributed separately.
9.        Aereed Actions.  Agreements have been reached that KGM would:
(a)   select the road sections for reconstruction and improvement
under the project according to agreed criteria;
(b)   appoint a Project Coordinator and set up a Project
Coordination Committee;
(c)   submit to the Bank the appropriate feasibility studies for
road sections to be improved under Bank financing for review
before construction bids are invited; and
(d)   extend traffic counting to provincial roads.
10.       E m rotmental AsDects.  KGM has demonstrated a high level of
environmental awareness in the implementation of its road works. Proposed
civil works are for the improvements of existing roads, requirements for
additional land are minimal and there are no resettlement issues. Contractors
are responsible for maintaining worksites pollution free and returning sites
to their original conditions. The new bidding documents cover these points
specifically and specify in particular that asphalt plants have to be equipped
with dust collectors. The Turkish Standard Institute is working on standards
for asphalt plants which will be enforced by KGM! once issued. The road safety
component will assist in reducing accidents at black spots.
11.       hnifts.   The main benefits expected from the project are lower
transport costs for freight and passengers and reduced accident rates.
Benefits accruing to truck and bus owners will be passed on to users as the
road industry is competitive. New equipment will enhance staff productivity
and enable KG? to continue its very commendable program of staff reduction.
The economic rates of return for roads to be strengthened and improved range
from 10 to 67X, with an average estimated around 301. The reason for
including in the project some lower return provincial roads is to provide
access to lower income rural populations ln poor underpopulated regions and
thereby directly contribute to mitigating the effects of poverty in these
areas.
12.       Rl3ka. The principal risk is any unanticipated shortage or delayed
availability of counterpart funds which may delay disbursements and lengthen
the project execution period. Past performance in this regard, even under
severe macro-economic pressures, has been quite good. We are confldent that
GOT and KG?! will continue to make the policy and instltutional changes they
have announced in the following areas: vehicle inspection, road safety,
emission control, pavement management and motorway operations.

13.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
