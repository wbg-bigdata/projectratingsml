ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
RAINFED NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
Credit and Program Summary
Borrower:             Islamic Republic of Mauritania
Implementing Agency:   Ministry of Rural Development and Environment (MDRE)
Beneficiaries:        Farmers and herders (approximately 75,000 inhabitants) from 250
villages located in the rainfed area of 9 of Mauritania's 13 Regions.
Povertv:              Program of Targeted Interventions
Credit Amount:        SDR 13.2 million (US$18.0 million equivalent)
Terms:                Standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity and 10 years grace
period
Project Description   The project would be the first five-year time slice of a long term (20-
year) natural resource management program. The project has three
components: (i) allocation of funds for community investments; (ii)
provision of technical support and strengthening of the institutional
environment; and (iii) establishment of a comprehensive training
program.  The result of the implementation of these three
components is expected to be: (a) the empowerment of organized
rural communities; and (b) the creation of an enabling institutional
framework. These results are, in turn, expected to have a positive
impact on two major development-related phenomena, namely: (i)
the rehabilitation of land, water and vegetation; and, consequently
(ii) improved production, increased income and a better quality of
life for communities participating in the program.
Economic Rate of Return: Investment scenarios expected to provide 12%, 13% and 14% ERR
for pastoral, agro-pastoral and agro-sylvo-pastoral systems,
respectively.
Benefits:             The proposed project contains features that would increase crop and
livestock production, in addition to laying the groundwork for solving
other, more persistent, social and environmental problems in the rural
sector. At the village level, the project would: (i) preserve village
habitat; (ii) improve subsistence production; and (iii) increase
beneficiary revenues. At the national level, the project would help to
(i) retain people on the land, thus reducing rural outmigration; (ii)
reduce environmental degradation over the medium to long terrn; (iii)
improve the institutional environment, thus reducing social conflicts;
and (iv) ensure more sustainable maintenance of rural infrastructures.
Risks:                Risk factors which could hamper project implementation are: (i) the
administration's ability to implement this project; (ii) conflicts arising
among potential beneficiaries; (iii) the availability of relevant
technologies to be disseminated; and (iv) natural conditions (rainfall)



- 11 -
which could prevent environmental rehabilitation from taking place.
Finally, risks associated with the project's ability to reduce poverty
overall include the persistence of traditional forms of social
organization which could prevent the equitable distribution of project
benefits to all segments of the population. Each of these issues has
been addressed by, respectively, (i) designing an effective
institutional setup for the project; (ii) taking full advantage of the
existing legal framework; (iii) facilitating the exchange and extension
of appropriate technologies; and (iv) establishing drought
preparedness contingency plans.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
RAINFED NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I.    BACKGROUND
A. THE COUNTRY
1.01        The Islamic Republic of Mauritania covers a territory in the Western Sahara of
over one million km2, and consists largely of desert, except for its southern fringe. Its
population of 2.3 million, which is growing at an annual rate of 2.5 %, depends to a great extent
on agriculture and stockraising for its livelihood. The prolonged droughts of the 1970s and early
1980s have caused great social upheaval: the population, about two-thirds of which was
nomadic in 1965, has become largely sedentary and/or has moved to urban centers. More than
half the population now lives in cities (compared to 5% in 1960) and Mauritania has one of the
world's highest urban growth rates (6.9 % annually). In the countryside, the rural population has
mainly settled in the Senegal Valley (which is now home to about 30% of the total) and in the
rainfed zone adjoining it to the north (15% of the total). Only 10 % of the total population
remains nomadic. These large population shifts have put great stress on the limited land, other
natural resources and on Government services. This was a factor in the political unrest that
occurred in the 1989-1992 period.
B. THE ECONOMY
1.02        Mauritania is a low-income country, with a per capita GNP estimated at US$460
equivalent in 1995. Over two-thirds of the population depends on agriculture, livestock and
fishing for a living; together, these activities account for about one third of GDP. Mauritania is
also an important iron ore producer and has rich fishing grounds; iron ore and fish products are
the mainstay (over 90%) of its exports.
1.03        Mauritania's economic development through the mid-1980s was uneven and
marked by major financial imbalances and highly interventionist government policies. Despite
investment rates as high as 36% of GDP in the early 1980s, the long-term rate of growth
averaged only 2%, which was slower than that of the population. Faced with a deepening crisis,
the Govemment adopted an economic adjustment program in 1985, which improved macro-
economic performance considerably: from 1985 to 1989, real GDP growth was 3.4%. During
this period, key reforms were enacted: price liberalization, abolishment of all import licenses and
quotas, and privatization of rice processing and marketing. From 1989 to 1992, however, the
country suffered a series of intemal shocks (unfavorable weather, institutional bottlenecks, the
Senegal-Mauritania crisis of 1989, and the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990-91), which had a severe



-2 -
impact on economic and financial performance. Real GDP growth fell to 1.7% in 1992, and the
public sector deficit (excluding grants and restructuring operations) doubled from 1.6% to 3.1%
of GDP. To counteract these trends, the Government launched in 1992 a renewed adjustment
program that provided for a 27% devaluation of the Ouguiya (UM); liberalization of foreign
exchange; reduction of inflation (from 10% in 1992 to 4.7% in 1996); and a reduction in the
fiscal deficit (from over 3.1% in 1992 to 0.8% in 1995.) This has resulted in an annual GDP
growth rate of 4.9% over the past four years (1993-96), a remarkable recovery from the
stagnation of the three preceding years. The underlying strategy of the adjustment program, to
which the Government fully subscribes, has been (i) to create an environment conducive to
private sector development as a basis for economic growth; (ii) to check public sector deficits
through structural reform of public enterprises; and (iii) to increase public sector efficiency
through more decentralized decision-making and increased institutional capacity.
C. THE RURAL SECTOR
1.04        In an arid country where nearly 90% of the land area is desert (i.e., receives less
than 150 mm of rainfall annually), the raising of drought-tolerant livestock (cattle, sheep, goats
and camels) is the activity best suited for survival. In Mauritania, it is the most important
agricultural occupation, accounting for about 80% of agricultural GDP. This percentage has
remained remarkably stable: during the drought years, when large numbers of animals died or
were slaughtered for lack of fodder, it declined to 74%, only to rise again to 81% in the better
rainfall years after 1985. By contrast, crop production contributes less than 20% to agricultural
GDP and fluctuates more, since it depends on rainfall. Over the past ten years, it has increased
overall by only 0.6% per year, while ranging in individual years from a 41.3% decline (1990) to
37.0% growth (1993) over the preceding year. Until the late 1970s, the country was self-
sufficient in cereals and milk and a net exporter of meat. Subsequent droughts, as well as a shift
in demand by an increasingly urban populace towards wheat and rice at the expense of sorghum
and millet, have made the country more dependent on food imports, including a declining
proportion of food aid.
The Resource Base
1.05        Cropping. The availability of water is the main determinant of agricultural
production in Mauritania. This factor limits the cultivable land area to about 0.5% of the total.
Table 1 shows land potential, as distinct from its actual utilization. Only in the southeast of the
country (Guidimaka and Hodh regions) is rainfall sufficient (450 - 550 mm. annually) to allow
rainfed cropping; on average, about 120,000 ha are cropped here annually. Everywhere else,
cropping depends on supplementary water supplies. The latter are used most extensively in flood
recession cropping (on residual soil moisture after flood waters have receded), which is practiced
in the Senegal River Valley on about 35,000 ha, and water harvesting (on some 30,000 ha in
bottomlands and behind retention dikes) in the area north of the Senegal Valley but south of the
"Route de I 'Espoir", where rainfall ranges from 150 mm to 400 mm. annually. In all of these
systems, sorghum and millet, sometimes in rotation with cowpeas, are the main crops. Finally,
the Senegal Valley has some 19,000 fully irrigated hectares, almost all under rice. The area



-3 -
under irrigation has been increasing since private irrigation development was permitted four
years ago.
1.06        Annual consumption of grains, the basis of the Mauritanian diet, is around
300,000 tons a year. Of this, about 200,000 tons can be supplied by domestic producers in a
good year: some 150,000 tons in the form of sorghum and millet, which are subsistence crops
mainly consumed on the farm; and about 50,000 tons as paddy, a cash crop sold in urban
markets.
1.07        Livestock raising. Mauritania's livestock herd is large, and grazes on almost 14
million ha of sylvo-pastoral land, or 14% of the country's area (Table 1). The livestock
population breaks down into approximately eight million sheep and goats, 1.4 million cattle and
one million camels. Annual meat production, which satisfies domestic demand, is estimated at
60,000 tons per year, of which 50% is sheep and goat meat, 35% beef and 15% camel meat.
Milk production does not currently meet the country's needs. Veterinary services are generally
available, but animal husbandry is largely traditional and productivity is low, since pasturelands
have been stagnating in productivity and declining in quality.

1.08        The livestock industry has been undergoing great changes which, although
painful, have laid the groundwork for higher productivity growth and better security against
droughts.  First, the drought years have largely eliminated the purely nomadic system of
transhumance (except for camel herds), and those pastoralists who did not become city dwellers
have largely settled in the southern fringe of the country, in or near the Senegal Valley. They are
now more likely to grow crops, and in the dry season will only trek short distances with their
animals to watering points in the area. With increased settlement density in the southern areas,
the competition for water resources and good pasture and cropland has increased. Thus, there is
a more widely felt need for broader application of irrigation and water harvesting techniques for
cropping, better maintenance of watering points, and pasture improvement technologies.
Second, demographic shifts within the country have created an important urban market for meat



-4 -
and milk where little or none existed before. Hence, while livestock raising was largely for
subsistence in the past (with some live cattle exports to neighboring countries),  it has
increasingly become a commercial undertaking which is spurring the demand for productivity-
and quality-improving technologies, as well as for more efficient marketing circuits.
1.09        Fuelwood Production.  As the prime source of household energy, fuelwood is
important in the Mauritanian economy, even in urban centers. Total wood resources, primarily
in the sylvo-pastoral steppes in the south and in the Senegal Valley, were tentatively estimated in
1991 at 700,000 m3 per year, of which some 10% to 20% was considered accessible for cutting.
1.10        Several developments have put a severe strain on wood supplies. Successive
droughts have retarded growth, and even destroyed part of the resource. Increased cropping and
grazing in the area where most of the forest and bush are found have further exacerbated this
trend. Most importantly, the explosive growth of cities has pushed the demand for charcoal to
such levels that forests (including gazetted forests closer to cities) have become depleted. The
supply response to this growth in demand has consisted of little more than accelerated cutting of
existing wood resources. Forest protection measures by the Government (in gazetted forests)
have been relatively ineffective, and reforestation has so far been insignificant. Under the
Domestic Energy Strategy (SED) launched by Government in 1990, incentives were created to
substitute gas for fuelwood. This policy has been relatively successful, with gas consumption
increasing from 9,000 tons in 1991 to 14,000 tons in 1995. But gas is considerably more
expensive than charcoal per BTU, so the gas market will be limited to affluent urban consumers
for a long time to come. Therefore, this policy has not really been able to substantially reduce
charcoal consumption or halt environmental degradation. In fact, the major charcoal-producing
areas shifted from Rosso (200 km east of Nouakchott) during the 1980s, to Kaedi (450 km east of
Nouakchott) during the early 1 990s, finally ending up in Selibabi (600 km east of Nouakchott) at
present.
1.11        An important obstacle thus far to the development of a wood supply strategy has
been that forest and bush areas are considered "open" territory, where cutting, grazing and
clearance for cropping can be carried out without interference. Typically, charcoal makers need
only a permit from the Regional Governor to cut wood, and villages with wood resources have
had little or no say in the exploitation of that resource.  Under such conditions, there is no
incentive to maintain or replant wood: charcoalers will simply move to other areas after
depletion of the forest. It is now acknowledged that villagers should have a greater say in the
exploitation of their wood resources. A legal framework exists for such a shift (para. 1.25), and
they should be helped to arrive at agreements with charcoalers ("contrats participatifs") in the
interest of more rational forest exploitation and the creation of rural wood markets.
Production Systems
1.12        Farming systems in Mauritania typically embrace each of the above-mentioned
activities (livestock raising, cropping and wood gathering), but their interdependence varies
according to rainfall. In the drier areas of the rainfed zone, a pastoral production system will
predominate, in which stockraising provides the bulk of subsistence and monetary income, and



-5 -
cropping is marginal. Transhumance is still necessary under this system to provide sufficient
feed for the herd. In areas with somewhat more rainfall, agro-pastoral production systems are
found, in which cropping is more important (although seldom predominant). They have a higher
degree of sedentarization, and transhumance is practiced only over short distances. Finally, in
the most humid areas, where wood resources are still fairly abundant, a2ro-sylvo-pastoral
production systems predominate. These are usually well integrated, as in flood-recession areas
where dry season pastures are among the richest in the country. Even here, however, cropping
seldom predominates unless full-scale irrigation is practiced (as in the Senegal Valley).
1.13        In addition to the poor natural endowment of the rural sector and the harsh
climatic conditions, the constraints common to all production systems are: (i) the low level of
empowerment and the inadequate application of the existing legal framework, which prevent
rural communities from dealing effectively with the increased competition for land and water
resulting from population shifts; (ii) poor technical knowledge, on the part of both rural
populations and technical services, of relevant natural resource management technologies
(especially in rangeland management) which would be economically replicable and technically
sustainable; and (iii) the fact that, even when the institutional environment is not an issue and the
technology is available, these cannot be implemented for want of the required financial
resources.
D. THE ENVIRONMENT
1.14        Fragmentary data on natural resources exists in Mauritania, but it is currently
scattered among various ministries, project management units and NGOs, in addition to being of
variable quality and reliability. There is considerable redundancy and confusion between the
data produced by different agencies. Topographic maps are often outdated or unavailable, and
some thematic maps are imprecise or inconsistent in their use of geographic place namnes. Also,
there is a general lack of circulation and exchange of information at all levels in Mauritania, a
problem that severely compromises the quality of planning, monitoring and evaluation of
environment-related activities.
1.15        Land degradation is considered the major challenge to Mauritania's future. The
stages in the fight against desertification are closely linked to international and regional
initiatives. Landmark documents and activities include: (i) the adoption of the PDLCD (French
acronym of the Program of Desertification Control) by the Council of Ministers in 1987; (ii) the
preparation, with support from ESMAP (Energy Sector Management Assistance Programn), of a
domestic energy strategy (1990); (iii) the preparation of a Tropical Forest Action Plan (PAFT -
1990); (iv) the preparation of the PMLCD, or Multisectoral Desertification Control Program,
based on the  PAFT and the PDLCD (1991); (v) the Mauritanian Country Environmental
Strategy Paper (CESP), which identified major problem areas; (vi) Government's signature of
the Convention on Desertification (1994); and (vii) the preparation of a National Environmental
Action Program (NEAP), begun in March 1995 and due to be finalized by the end of 1997.
1.16        The Country Environmental Strategy Paper of 1994 identified three major
problem areas: (i) the absence of sustainable, equitable and efficient management of natural



-6 -
resources; (ii) the overfishing of coastal waters, which is depleting a formerly rich resource base;
and (iii) the rapid emergence of water supply and sanitation problems in urban areas. It cites four
natural resource management issues: the development of irrigation in the Senegal River Valley;
land degradation in the rainfed zone, especially sand dune encroachment and deforestation;
problems associated with pastoralism; and overexploitation of water in the oases of the desert
zone.
1.17        To a large extent, the natural resource management issues developed in the CESP
correspond to the analysis and issues outlined in the preceding paragraphs. Increasingly,
however, it is possible to discern strategies that would help alleviate these problems and diminish
their impact over the medium to long term. Land degradation could be addressed by better
resource management using the "gestion de terroir" or community-based natural resource
management approach, which is one of the goals of the proposed project as far as the rainfed
zone is concerned. Similarly, techniques exist to improve pasture management even under
conditions of intense grazing pressure. Such techniques have been successfully tried in other
parts of the Sahel and would be introduced into Mauritania under the proposed project. Finally,
participatory approaches to forest exploitation, also to be introduced under the project, would
create incentives for better preservation of existing wood resources, permitting their exploitation
at sustainable levels.
E. INSTITUTIONS
Territorial Organization
1.18        Administratively, Mauritania is divided into: (i) 13 regions (wilaya), each of
which is under the authority of a governor (wali) assisted by two or three assistant governors
(wali moucaid); (ii) 53 districts (moughataa) directed by a prefect (hakem); (iii) 205
municipalities (communes), of which 163 are rural. The mandate and attributions of the
territorial administration are defined by order No. 90.002 of January 31, 1990. This whole set-up
is under the purview of the Ministry of the Interior, Post and Telecommunications (MIPT) and in
particular of its directorates: Regional Planning and Interventions (DATAR), Local
Communities, and Political Affairs and Public Liberties. Civil society, on the other hand, is
organized at the municipal level, where each commune (including village communities within
their boundaries) has the status of a decentralized territorial collectivity with its administration
and local management under the responsibility of an elected mayor. Municipal management
involves local fiscal revenues and budgeting under the control of the Ministry of Finance, but
human and material resources are extremely scarce in rural communes.
Government Services in the Rural Sector
1.19        The Ministry of Rural Development and Environment (MDRE) is the agency
responsible for the development of livestock and agriculture, as well as for environmental
protection. The MDRE was reorganized in March 1993 by decree No. 22-93 so as to better use
its resources at field level. It now has three technical directorates: DRAP (agriculture and
livestock), DRFV (research education and extension) and DEAR (forestry and environment),



-7 -
together with a Planning Unit (Cellule de Planification) at cabinet level. In the field, Regional
Delegations of the MDRE have been established in each wilaya, under the authority of the wali.
Taken together, the public structures dealing with rural development, excluding SONADER,
employed nearly 1,200 agents by late 1993, of which 176 were senior staff and technicians, and
700 lower-level staff divided amongst the regional delegations. Aside from the Banc D'Arguin
National Park, a public entity under the Govermment's General Secretariat, the MDRE
supervises public entities (in particular SONADER, CNERV and the Diawling National Park) as
well as two semi-public enterprises: UNCACEM and CAIE.
1.20        MDRE's operations are hampered by: (i) the inadequate number of qualified field
staff; (ii) an operating budget that has been stagnant since 1988, with only 60% of the Ministry's
resources funneled to the regions; and (iii) difficulties in personnel management when it comes
to responding to demands from the rural sector.
Producer's Groups. Associations and Coops
1.21        Rural entities wishing to organize themselves in Mauritania have two options: (i)
cooperative association under the Cooperative Law of January 1993, and under the authority of
the Agriculture and Livestock Directory (DRAP) of the Ministry of Rural Development
(MDRE); and (ii) community association under the Law of June 1964, and under the authority of
the Directorate of Political Affairs and Public Liberties of the Ministry of Interior.
1.22        Thirty-nine pastoral "cooperative associations" (APs) have been established under
the IDA-funded Livestock II project in the 8 wilayas south of the "Route de l'Espoir." These
APs formally represent 660,000 people living in 1,100 villages. Although the new Law has
boosted the number of rural coops, they have not been very effective so far and, according to a
survey performed during this project's preparation, village investments carried out by now-
completed projects have shown a poor level of sustainability. The reasons for such poor
performance include: (i) the weak skills of the organizations' leaders, which prevent them from
managing funds properly and from diversifying activities (input supply and marketing of
production); and (ii) the organizations' lack of access, even when they enjoy legal recognition, to
the financial resources required to start a new activity. Three major agriculture and herders'
associations are represented at the national level: the GNAP (representing pastoral cooperative
associations), the FNAEM, and the FNEM.
1.23        Because it is not of a sectoral nature and can cover different types of activities, the
"community association" option has been chosen by many programs dealing with agricultural
and non-agricultural activities, such as the management of solar pumps (UE), the construction of
classrooms (IDA), rural pharmacies, transportation, etc. In addition, when such associations are
awarded the "public interest" status (reconnaissance d'interet public), they may manage public
funds and can be granted some authority in managing and protecting Government-owned
resources (water points, forests). Since they are managed under the Ministry of Interior, such
types of organizations have better access to regional and local administrations, and are better
suited to dealing with community-based natural resource management.



-8 -
Land Tenure
1.24         The current land tenure legislation has emerged mainly in response to conditions
specific to the irrigated areas (Senegal River Valley), and needs further refinement and official
mechanisms (i.e., decrees) providing for its application to rainfed areas. It offers some scope for
ensuring secure tenure for the affected communities: the concept of harim. or vital space,
borrowed from Islamic law (sharia), was introduced under the law dealing with settlements. It
has already been broadened by the addition of the notion of land reserve, which is used in tenure
regularization efforts in the Senegal River Valley (Trarza). The notion of the indivisibilitv of
collective rights in a cooperative context opens up another possible avenue for the devolution of
state-held land rights, according to which these collective rights would be acknowledged as
belonging exclusively to a defined group, without there being a possibility (for ecological or
social reasons) of a drift towards the regime of concession rurale, or private property. The
State's option to grant leases of public lands and publicly created infrastructures offers another
possibility for the devolution of public lands to local communities, cooperatives or associations.
1.25         A study was carried out during project preparation to assess the relevance of the
legislative framework. Its conclusions, which were confirmed by the Government, were that the
project could be implemented under the existing legal framework, namely: (i) the Ordinance of
June 5, 1983, and its Decree of Application of January 31, 1990 concerning the private allocation
of agricultural lands; (ii) the Water Code of July 4, 1985 stating that under certain circumstances
private entities might be granted exclusive rights over water resources outside privately owned
land; (iii) the Forestry Code of December 15, 1982 acknowledging the rights of some private
users to manage gazetted forests; and (iv) the Ordinance of June 5, 1983 authorizing the State to
grant exclusive grazing rights to a given group of users.
F. SECTORAL ISSUES AND STRATEGY
Lessons Learned with IDA Lending
1.26         The World Bank Group has been involved in Mauritania's agricultural sector
since 1971, mainly in support of investments in irrigation, livestock development and anti-
desertification efforts.  Several projects, either completed, under implementation or under
preparation, are relevant to the sector (see Annex 1). A substantial store of experience is
therefore available to help identify and overcome strategic difficulties encountered in: (i) rural
development projects; (ii) the agricultural sector at large; and (iii) the policy environment for
agriculture.
1.27         Past projects in the rural sector have encountered such obstacles as: (i) generally
inappropriate top-down desIns that preclude sustainability and a sense of ownership; (ii) poor
financial manag'ement resulting in extensive implementation delays; (iii) len2tgrv procurement
processes ; (iv) ineffective field services, which have often been unresponsive to beneficiaries'
demands; and (v) lack of counterpart funding due to budgetary problems.



- 9-
1.28        In addition, Mauritanian agriculture is hobbled by four factors that can only be
overcome in the long run. First the poor level of natural resource endowment demands
familiarity with, and application of, relevant technologies in order to put production on secure
footing and attain acceptable levels of productivity. In certain fields such as water harvesting,
technologies are already well developed. In others, however, such as pasture management,
animal fodder production and storage, there is a great need for improvement and adaptation to
local ecological conditions. Second, rural communities lack the institutional capacity to reverse
the current trend toward impoverishment. They are insufficiently organized, they lack the
authority to steer Government technical services toward their needs and, until recently, the legal
and regulatory framework did not support their empowerment. Tbird, rural communities' low
level of market integration into the monetary economy causes a critical shortage of savings and
investment instruments (credits, grants, etc. ). Fourth, most resources (human and financial)
have been allocated to irrigation, while rainfed agriculture has been neglected.
Main Conclusions of Economic and Sector Work
1.29        Recently completed economic and sector work, subsequent discussion of its
conclusions with Government, and the results of ongoing adjustment programs have all pointed
the way to a comprehensive development strategy for the sector at large. These ESW products
are described below.
1.30        The Country Assistance Strategy. The 1994 CAS, as well as the 1997 draft CAS,
set forth a comprehensive development strategy for Mauritania, including: (i) human resource
development and poverty reduction to develop the skills of rural communities, create conditions
conducive to their empowerment, and improve the quality of life of rainfed farmers; (ii) private
sector development, including decentralization of civil works, services and input supply to
provide incentives to local contractors rather than to businesses based in Nouakchott; (iii)
development of the agricultural sector along participatory lines, in the interest of a stronger
economy; (iv) economic management and capacity building; and (v) environmental protection
and rehabilitation.
1.31        The Country Environmental Strategy Paper (1994) identified three major
challenges: the unsustainable, inequitable and inefficient management of natural resources; the
overexploitation of fisheries; and urban expansion. The CESP proposed three degrees of priority
for the problems at hand: (i) due to their great ecological and socio-economic value, a high level
of priority would go to the sustainable development of the Senegal River Valley, the sustainable
use of fishing grounds, the management of fuelwood supply and demand, and control of the
salinization of aquifers; (ii) medium priority would be accorded to the control of sand dune
encroachment, soil erosion and fertility loss, solid waste disposal, and the overuse of aquifers in
oases, given their ecological and socio-economic importance; and (iii) a lesser degree of priority
would go to urban wastewater disposal and pollution control, biodiversity, environmental impact
of mining, and coastal pollution.



-10-
1.32        The povertv alleviation strategy (1994) acknowledges that the incidence of
poverty in the rainfed (East and Center) rural areas of the country is between 62% and 75%, a
rate which is among the highest in the country (as against 40% in urban areas and 57% for
Mauritania as a whole). The strategy laid out in this document, which recommends assisting the
most vulnerable segments of the population, cites six major priorities to be included in any rural-
oriented development strategy: (i) promotion of producers' organizations; (ii) effective
management of land and water; (iii) protection against desertification; (iv) land tenure security;
(v) establishment of local micro-financing schemes; and (vi) skills development among rural
dwellers.
1.33        The agricultural development strategv agreed upon in 1995 with the Government
would be pursued through (i) active participation of villagers in the design and implementation
of agricultural policies for which incentives would be provided; (ii) improved technical support
to help villagers increase and diversify production; (iii) rehabilitation of existing irrigated
perimeters rather than the creation of new ones; (iv) establishment of a national NRM program
and of a legal and institutional framework giving local communities greater authority and
responsibility; and (v) adoption of reforms to help streamline services and intensify production
through appropriate policies on land use, extension and improved competitiveness of local
products.



II.   THE PROJECT
A. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES
Sector Development. Objectives and Strategv
2.01        The proposed operation would capitalize on steps that Government has already
taken to: (a) improve the policy environment with greater empowerment of local rural
communities and the decentralization of MDRE's services; (b) implement the CESP's
environmental recommendation concerning more efficient management of natural resources; and
(c) strengthen oneoin2' operations by coordinating with existing extension services, devising a
domestic energy strategy, and liaising with the PDIAIM project now under preparation.
Rationale and value-added of IDA involvement
2.02        IDA should be involved because the proposed project would: (i) help the country
to implement its development strategy; (ii) link macropolicy measures supported by IDA and
investment/capacity building; (iii) promote the emergence of coherent rural sector development
programs by coordinating operations currently under implementation (such as the PSA) or under
preparation (such as the PDIAIM); (iv) exploit lessons learned under earlier projects; (v) bring
IDA's NRM experience in other countries to bear in Mauritania; (vi) pursue the household
energy strategy agreed upon in 1990; and (vii) promote donor coordination.
Logical Framework
2.03        The project would be the first five-year time slice of a long-term (20-year) natural
resource management program that would cover the whole rainfed zone of Mauritania. As
shown in the logical framework (Annex 10), the project has been designed as follows:
(a)   The Proiect's overall objective would be to control and, hopefully, reduce, the
spiral of poverty so well illustrated in this part of the world by the confluence of
population growth, environmental degradation and reduced agricultural
production.
(b)   Project's expected impact. In order to break the poverty spiral, the project is
expected to improve the basic ecological functions (water and mineral cycles,
ecological succession) through resource management, thus bringing about
sustainable yield increases (in crops and livestock) and increased incomes for
participating communities.
(c)   Proiect's expected outcome. The project's impact (described in (b) above)
depends upon two conditions, which are the project's expected outcome: (i) the



- 12 -
empowerment of rural communities, i.e., the provision of skills to organize, to
manage common resources and obtain access to financing; and (ii) an improved
institutional environment in the rural sector, including secure access to natural
resources.
(d)   Proiect's output. The project is expected to produce three major outputs, which
would be required in order for the project's outcome above to take place: (i) an
improved basis for sustainable production, with well chosen and well managed
village investments; (ii) stronger technical services to the community; and (iii) the
generation and dissemination of appropriate technologies, and the development of
required skills.
(e)   Components. In order to produce the above output, the project would implement
three components: (i) village investments; (ii) strengthening of government
services; and (iii) skills development.
Project Scope
2.04        As a first five-year slice of a long-term program, the Project would intervene in
nine regions or wilayas, out of the 13 existing in Mauritania. As for the rest of the national
territory, it is recommended that consultations with other donors involved in similar activities
(Germany, European Union, IFAD) be pursued with a view to harmonizing approaches and
coordinating field interventions. Within the nine selected regions, the project would concentrate
on approximately 250 villages (roughly 10% of the 2,260 Mauritanian villages in the rainfed
area) that are home to about 75,000 inhabitants (10% of the population of the rainfed area).
While the Government identified the 62 communes in which the project would be implemented
during its first phase, guidelines for selecting villages which would benefit from the project, with
reasonable chances of success, were established (Annex 7). Since the participatory process upon
which the project is built takes time, the proposed project would be implemented over five years,
with this first tranche followed by others.
2.05        Village investments under the project would provide for the start-up of
community-level natural resource management plans. Investments for each participating village
(300 inhabitants in average) would amount to about US$30,000, to be financed under the Credit,
plus US$30,000 supplied by the beneficiaries themselves (mostly as labor) over the 3-4 years of
the project's intervention in the village.



- 13 -
Proiect's Phasing
2.06        In each village where the Project intervenes, there would be a first phase of
institutional/capacity building that would not exceed one year. This would be followed by the
design and approval of the NRM plan and its implementation. Phasing out of the Project at the
level of each village would occur after three to four years. Since not all the villages would be
affected in Year 1, it is expected that an increasing number of new villages would be "enrolled"
each year, and that, in each year starting in Year 3, project intervention with the first enrolled
villages would be phased out. It is also expected that much experience would be gained during
the five years of the proposed project, and that a rapidly growing number of communities would
be involved in the subsequent phases of the foreseen 20-year program. Therefore, project
implementation cannot be sequenced by starting with organization during the first phase, and
returning to the issue of investments during the project's second time slice, five years later. A
gradually increasing geographic coverage constitutes in itself the most appropriate phasing of
project implementation. The development process will not be linear, since the emergence of
greater numbers of skilled people (rurals and technicians), effective procedures, relevant policies,
adapted technologies and improved infrastructure will improve replicability. It is therefore
expected that an increasing number of villages would be involved annually at a lower extemal
cost, and that Mauritania's 2,260 villages in the rainfed area could be covered within the 20-year
program.
Proiect Imlementation: A Different Approach
2.07        The project's implementation principles are based on the key sector issues
identified in Chapter I, taking into account past experience in the development of the sector:
(a)  in a departure from previous strategies that treated the agricultural development
problem in a sub-sectoral manner (livestock, forestry, etc.), the project would
address rural development in an integrated manner. This means that all issues
facing a given community in managing its natural resources are addressed
simultaneously and holistically -- taking into account community goals and
priorities and the current state of the resource base -- with interventions chosen
on the basis of cost-effectiveness, sustainability, popular acceptance and sound
resource management principles (Annex 2; para. 13);
(b)  interventions under the project would be pro-active, and would address the
underlving causes of environmental degradation (i.e., mainly the overuse of
resources) instead of focusing on defensive actions. This would be done by
improving the management of all resources utilized in the targeted zones;
(c)   instead of the usual schema of action programs defined and implemented by
Government services, the project would be implemented in a bottom-up,
articiDatorv mode, meaning that, within the framework defined by the
government, organized communities would set goals and define scenarios and
activities for the zone under their control. During project identification and



- 14 -
preparation, this method was tested with the aid of participatory rural appraisal
tools (e.g., social assessment) that made it possible to establish a dialogue with
some future beneficiaries and to gather the needed information;
(d)  to avoid redundancies and/or the neglect of important issues, the proposed
project would be carried out in close coordination with ongoing programs and
projects that may be able and willing to implement some of its components.
Cooperation Agreements or formal linkages would be established in the
following areas: extension (research and agricultural services projects);
household energy (technical assistance, public enterprise and energy project),
the provision of experience and skills (German-financed GIRNEM project);
and the European Union's 7th FED investment program, which provides
financing for the national program in the Tagant and Brakna regions and part of
the Trarza region.
(e)   instead of being designed in isolation from ongoing institutional developments,
the project would support the communal development policy currently pursued
by the government. Community-based NRM plans would be established with
the participation of elected community leaders and negotiated on their behalf.
These plans would later be integrated or harmonized into broader communal
development plans covering clusters of about 20 villages. In so doing, the
proposed project aims to reconcile Government-designed land-use plans
(amenagement du territoire) with the natural resource management plans of
communities.
B. SUMMARY DESCRIPTION
2.08        The project would include the following three components: (i) financial support
for investments in 250 villages chosen from representative agro-ecological zones of the country's
rainfed area; (ii) strengthenin-p of Government services in order to support community
organization, improve the legal framework for local empowerment, and finance Government's
technical support to beneficiaries; and (iii) enhancement of skills. including the development of
required technologies (research, short- and medium-term technical assistance), and the
dissemination of those technologies through extension and training.
C. DETAILED FEATURES
Village investments (US$16.9 Million)
2.09        Under the NRM approach, the final choice of technologies to be implemented in
each community is made by the community concerned, based on its own goals and ecological
constraints. Therefore, the village investments included in the project's cost tables should be
viewed as indicative, rather than quantitative project objectives, and not as indicators of project
achievement. The long-term project key perfonnance indicators would reflect the ecological and



- 15 -
socio-economic impact of the community-based NRM  approach (Annex 11).  Short-term
implementation would be monitored according to the specific investment objectives included in
the project's annual work plan, and on the basis of community NRM plans that will have been
negotiated and agreed upon with technical support teams and regional authorities.
2.10        Village investments represent a large percentage of both the Credit and the total
project cost, since the equivalent of US$10 million (56% of the US$18 million Credit, including
price contingencies) would be invested at village level, while the total cost of village
investments, including beneficiaries' contributions, would amount to the equivalent of US$16.9
million, or 65% of the total project cost of US$25.9 million. By any standard, this is a high
proportion of credit proceeds allocated to end beneficiaries, in addition to the cost of their
technical support and training.
2.11        Land and water conservation. The land and water conservation techniques
envisaged require the project to supply the following inputs: (i) transportation of stones, soil,
water, building materials; (ii) plant material (seedlings and seeds); (iii) mechanized works (earth
moving, boring, firebreaks, harrowing, pitting); (iv) construction material (concrete, roofing,
beams and wire netting); (v) fencing material (posts, barbed wire); and (vi) sand dune fixation
devices (mesh, plastic, etc.). Project beneficiaries would supply the required labor, representing
up to 70% of costs. The technologies to be used for investments in land and water are outlined in
Annex 3:
(a)   water harvesting techniques, including stone and vegetation contour bunds,
surface water management dikes, and the deepening of natural and artificial
ponds;
(b)   preservation of soil fertility, erosion prevention and control of sand dune
encroachment, also including stone and vegetation contour bunds, gully
correction and sand dune fixation;
(c)   forage production on rangelands, and fuelwood production, including
protection and plantation, although most of these objectives require improved
management rather than additional investments;
(d)   rehabilitation and construction of rural roads;
2.12        Some technologies included in this component are already well developed in
Mauritania. This is especially true of dune fixation and water harvesting (cultures derriere
barrage), which are familiar to Mauritanian farmers. Others, such as plantations, have been
tested in Mauritania in the past, while certain other technologies, such as different types of bunds
(diguettes), have been developed in neighboring countries (e.g., Sahel, North Africa) from which
expertise will be sought under the project.
2.13        Infrastructure and eguipment.  These investments are needed by rural
communities, and particularly by women, who spend much time on water collection and food



-16-
processing. Nevertheless, in order to avoid disincentives to private initiative and to encourage
the use of credit (when available), the financing of these investments would be contingent upon a
level of cash contributions from beneficiaries not lower than 20% of the total cost. In order to
ensure proper operation and maintenance of the equipment, such investments would only be
funded under the community NRM package when (a) a community expresses strong demand and
shows serious commitment to its further operation and maintenance; (b) no other source of
financing (credit or other program) exists; and (c) a specialized entity (e.g., NGO or other
project) can provide backstopping for the sustainability of the investment. Detailed procedures
on how these investments would be financed, operated and maintained have been included in the
project's implementation manual. The following investments would be financed under the
component:
(a)   civil works related essentially to water supply (water wheels, drilling, cisterns)
and, to a lesser extent, rural roads and community buildings (e.g., storage
facilities, cooperative shops, market and livestock handling facilities, etc.);
(b)   mechanical equipment, including different types of pumps (wind mills,
motorized pumps), forest management equipment (chain saws) where
applicable, food processing devices (grain mills, oil extractors);
(c)   small agricultural equipment, also for community use (carts, wheelbarrows,
etc.), all types of agricultural tools (plows, etc.) and fencing material (where
applicable), as part of the execution of an agreed village investment.
(d)   water supply installations as part of the West African Pilot Pastoral Program,
which is aimed at assessing the relevance of a new approach to rangeland
management, and is currently implemented in six Sahelian countries under the
coordination of the Bank (Annex 2, para. 13).
2.14        Other investments (micro-enterprises). The project would provide financing for
these investments to a maximum of 60% of their costs, with the remainder financed (in cash) by
the beneficiaries, according to detailed guidelines included in the project's implementation
manual. The shortage of capital at village level, the poor or non-existent access to credit, and the
limited savings potential, make this component particularly crucial to the success of the project.
When properly managed, such operations have proven an effective means of transitioning to
effective community-based credit schemes, provided they: (i) ensure training for community staff
in financial management and accounting; (ii) foster activities targeted to external markets; and
(iii) effect a change in mentalities, after which the fund is no longer perceived as a Government
subsidy, but instead as a common good requiring community-wide commitment. The proposed
project would provide funds for income generating activities in line with project's objectives,
including, but not limited to:
(a)   cooperative and/or individual livestock fattening, for which funds are required
to purchase animals and store feed until the time of marketing;



-17-
(b)   grain storage, for which cash is needed to free farmers of the obligation to
market their production at harvest time, when prices are lowest.  Such
operations could be of a cooperative or individual nature;
(c)   human and animal medicine supply (a successful undertaking under Livestock
II), with possible expansion to other inputs. Although they have initially been
managed on a cooperative basis, associations tend ultimately to have these
pharmacies managed by village-trained auxiliaries, thus guaranteeing that the
medicines are made available and are used efficiently;
Strengthening of Public Support ( US$4.1 million)
2.15        Institutional support provided under the project would cover three different areas:
(i) communitv organization and linkages with elected communal entities, which is being included
in the design and review of the community natural resource planning package; (ii) application of
the legal framework in order to ensure reasonably secure access to common resources; and (iii)
technical support to participating communities and to the Government in order to establish,
implement and monitor the community-based NRM plans.
(a)   At the village level, the project would be implemented by field extension
agents (AVBs) operating under the existing Agricultural Services Project
(PSA). Since this would substantially increase their current workload,
additional new agents would be recruited on a contractual basis. To ensure
adequate extension services to women, the project would encourage the
recruitment of female agents. Overall, the average ratio would be one
extension agent (agent de vulgarisation de base, A VB) for every four to six
villages, or 1/200-300 households;
(b)   Five technical support teams (EMATs), also to be recruited on a contractual
basis, would operate in the wilayas targeted under the project (para. 3.11). Each
EMAT would consist of three specialists responsible for providing
participating communities with skills not available within the existing
agricultural services, i.e.: (i) community organization, negotiation and conflict
resolution; (ii) management of communal property (especially rangeland and
forest); and (iii) financial management, access to credit and administration.
Unemployed young professionals with these profiles (not necessarily with an
agricultural background) are available in the labor market.
(c)   At the wilaya level, the Government has agreed that the project would be
implemented by existing agricultural services technical staff from regional
MDRE delegations whose salaries would be paid by the Government. This
staff would participate in project implementation and would receive daily
subsistence and required transportation from the project when working in the
field. In addition, and to complement existing staff, one regional project



- 18-
program assistant, as well as one financial manager and an accountant, would
be recruited on a contractual basis.
(d)   A Central Project Team (ECPG), consisting of five professionals, would be
established in Nouakchott under the cabinet of the MDRE. This Team would
include: (i) the coordinator responsible for overall project implementation,
dialogue with stakeholders, and reporting; (ii) the procurement officer; (iii) the
financial manager responsible for disbursements (Special Accounts and
Advance Accounts), village investments, accounting and auditing; (iv) a
community-based NRM specialist who would supervise the community NRM
planning process, and would be responsible for studies, WID issues and
monitoring and evaluation of project implementation and impact; and (v) the
adult training specialist who, in coordination with the national agency for
literacy, would be in charge of identifying skills gaps and recruiting
consultants. The Central Project Team will consist in principle of existing
civil servants who will be assigned to these tasks. However, because the
project is causing incremental activities and because civil service staff is
limited, contractuals could be hired if required skills are not available;
(e)   Given the pilot nature of the pastoral program (para. 2.1 1(e)), support to this
program would be geared toward providing external expertise in the areas of
rangeland management, and monitoring/evaluation of the results of the pilot.
2.16        In addition to incremental salaries for contractual staff, the proposed project
would also cover: the rehabilitation of existing offices; office equipment (photocopiers, personal
computers when required); five vehicles for the ECPG, the EMATs, and the coordinators; and
small motorcycles (125-175 cc) for the additional extension agents and field supervisors. As in
the case of the PSA, these motorcycles would be sold to agents on credit, with monthly payments
withheld from their salaries. Funding for the operation and maintenance of the vehicles and
equipment, and field allowances for the technical staff and drivers, will be borne by the project.
Skills Development (US$ 1.6 million)
2.17        Technical Assistance and Research. Adaptive research for NRM would include
diagnostic activities performed at the request of beneficiaries with support from EMATs and
researchers, followed by on-site testing. The project would finance the tests and the researchers'
services through contracts with research agencies, especially the Kaedi Research Center, but
without excluding the possibility of collaboration with other partners (public, private, NGO, etc.)
that make competitive proposals. The proposed research activities would be presented in annual
action plans to be approved by the Bank. The activities could include, for example, the
determination of the most cost-effective type of earthen dam (length, spacing, material);
measurements of the project's environmental impact (soil, vegetation, water table); the
sustainable replanting of watersheds (species, implementation, management); the choice of
species for agroforestry as a function of specific agroecological conditions, etc. The project



-19-
would finance these activities, including 65 weeks of international specialists and 93 weeks of
national consultants.
2.18        Training and Public Awareness. The training component is crucial. Project
objectives can only be attained if support staff develops a true ability to listen, understand and
reach out to rural clients, while at the same time mastering the technical aspects of the various
rural interventions. Training, information and public awareness efforts would be directed at any
party involved in the project whenever it appears that their qualifications are not up to the
responsibilities entrusted to them. Training would be of a practical nature and generally on-site,
while the identification of skills gaps and the assessment of the program's impact would be the
responsibility of project staff. The design and implementation of training modules would mostly
be subcontracted to consultants (firms and individuals). For more details on the implementation
of this component, which will also rely on the network of rural radios (see Annex 2, paras. 3-5).
In addition to consultants' fees, the project would mainly finance beneficiaries' travel and
trainers' mission expenses. Technical support would require a total of 69 man-weeks of
expatriate consultancies, 114 man-weeks of sub-regional consultants, and 272 man-weeks of
local consultancies (Annex 12).
2.19        Improving Rural Statistical Data.   This component would also finance the
strengthening of statistical data surveys and processing in the rural sector, in order to improve the
scope and reliability of statistical data on the rural sector (crops and livestock). It will be carried
out by the National Statistical Institute (INS) under the Ministry of Planning. It will consist of
(a) a sample survey to check the relevance of data currently available on livestock (flocks, herds,
yields, production, marketing, export) and crops (areas, yields, production, marketing); and (b)
the establishment of an action plan aimed at improving the coverage and accuracy of national
statistics, to be implemented later under discrete support. The action plan would be finalized
before the mid-term review of the project.
D. PROJECT COSTS
2.20        Total base costs, net of taxes and duties, are estimated at US$25.9 million (UM
3.7 billion), based on January 1997 prices. Given the nature of investments (high dependence on
village labor, numerous small works, volumes of specific works not known before approval of
Community land management plans), physical contingencies have not been included. Price
contingencies amounting to US$2.7 million, or 12 percent of base costs, have been included and
are based on average forecasts of international inflation for foreign-supplied goods (2.5% per
annum), estimated inflation in Mauritania for local costs (3.0 percent per annum), and on an
implementation period of five years. The foreign exchange rate used was US$1.00 = UM 142
(since January 1997), and the foreign exchange portion of the total cost was estimated at 49%.
Total project costs of US$25.9 million break down as follows:

E. FINANCING PLAN
2.21         Project costs would be financed by an IDA credit of US$18 million equivalent.
The Mauritanian contribution amounts to US$7.9 million equivalent. The financing plan is
detailed below:
Table 3: Project Financing Plan
Contributors              US$ million            UM million                  *ie
IDA                          18.0                 2,556                     69
Beneficiaries                 7.5                 1,065                     29
Government                    0.4                   57                       2
Total                        25.9                 3,678                     100
2.22         The IDA  credit would represent 69%  of project costs.  The beneficiary
contribution, (cash and labor) for village investments, is valued at US$7.5 million equivalent,
which represents 29 % of total project cost. The Government's contribution is equivalent to the
salaries of Government civil servants that would be seconded to the project. This would amount
to UM 57 million during the five project years, or 2 % of project costs. The full financing of
incremental operating costs under the project is required, since (i) the Government is funding a
portion of recurrent operating costs through the transfer of about half the project staff from other
services; and (ii) the operation is a first time slice of a long-term program, so incremental
operating costs cannot be financed on a declining basis during implementation.

F. PROCUREMENT
2.23          The following table summarizes the project categories and their estimated costs
(including contingencies), as well as proposed methods of procurement. Mauritania's
procurement laws and regulations conform to IDA procurement guidelines. No special
exemptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in Credit documents for international
competitive bidding (ICB), as Mauritania's procurement regulations allow IDA procedures to
take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations. All procurement for goods
and civil works would be carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines for procurement under
IBRD Loans and Credits (January 1995). All procurement for consulting services would be
carried out in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Selection and Employment of
Consultants (January 1997).

2.24          International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would, in accordance with Bank
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995), be carried out
for the purchase of goods estimated to exceed US$100,000. Procurement using ICB is expected
to total US$1.2 million, mostly for the procurement of vehicles. Standard bidding documents
developed by the Bank will be used. Satellite imagery would be procured through Limited
International Bidding by inviting the existing providers, whose number is limited to two or three.
To the extent possible, contracts for goods shall be grouped in lots estimated to cost $100,000
equivalent or more each.



- 22 -
2.25        National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would be carried out for goods, such as
equipment, small implements and supplies estimated to cost less than US$ 100,000 and more than
US$30,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$2.0 million equivalent; and
works estimated to cost less than US$150,000 and more than US$30,000 equivalent per contract,
up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$0.7 million.
2.26        Small civil works contracts. Contracts for standard small works estimated to cost
less than US$30,000 per contract, up to an aggregate amount of US$8.4 million, would be
procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from
three (3) qualified domestic contractors. The invitation shall include reference unit prices
established by the ECPG, a detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the
required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Association, and relevant
drawings where applicable. The award would be made to the contractor who offers the lowest
price quotation for the required work, provided he demonstrates he has the experience and
resources to complete the contract successfully. These are mostly works relating to bunding, tree
planting and protection of vegetation, gully correction, watershed management and village
community projects, where most of the input (up to 70% of total costs) would come from
villagers themselves in the form of labor, and contracts would be limited to furnishing technical
assistance and the necessary materials, equipment and supplies. These works would be
supervised by five technical support teams (EMATs) based on criteria and standards applied
equally to all villages. Contributions from beneficiaries (US$7.5 million equivalent of which
US$6.9 million in labor and US$0.6 in cash) have been valued at UM 250, or about US$1.8 per
day of work. According to investment scenarios set out in Annex 8, this contribution would
amount to 21 days, 30 days and 40 days of work per active beneficiary per year in pastoral, agro-
pastoral and sylvo-agro-pastoral systems, over the three years of project implementation in the
village. In the case of water supply and productive investments, a cash contribution would be
required from the villagers (ranging from 20% to 40% of the investment cost). The project's
implementation manual describes the mechanism by which labor contributions (contracted
between the project and the ADC) would be verified and cash payments made and managed.
2.27        Local Shopping. Goods estimated to cost less than US$30,000 per contract, up to
an aggregate amount of US$ 1.1 million, would be acquired on the basis of a comparison of price
quotes from at least three reliable suppliers. These are mostly materials relating to the small civil
works mentioned above, equipment, small implements and supplies.
2.28        Consultant's Services. These services would be used for (i) studies -- land tenure,
environmental data, accounting systems, and impact analysis (estimated at 85 man weeks); (ii)
technical matters and training -- skills gap analysis, skills development (155 man weeks); and
(iii) training of project field staff and beneficiaries, estimated at 215 man weeks. Consultant
services financed by IDA, are expected to total US$1.9 million. Selection of consultants would
be done through competition among qualified short-listed firms in which the selection would be
based both on the quality of the proposal and on the cost of the services to be provided, except
for those contracts that are extimated to cost less than US$100,000. The latter would be awarded
on the basis of lowest cost. Short-lists for technical assistance contracts provided to support
ADCs, and whose value is estimated under US$100,000, may be comprised entirely of national



-23 -
consultants provided a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are available at
competitive costs. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they would not be
excluded from consideration. Services for training sessions and small studies which can be
delivered by individual consultants would be selected through comparison of qualifications
among those approached directly or expressing interest in the assignment. The standard Letter of
Invitation and Form of Contract as developed by the Bank will be used for appointment of
consultants. Simplified forms of contract would be used for short-term assignments, i.e. those
not exceeding six months and carried out by individual consultants. The Government would be
briefed during negotiations about the special features of the new guidelines, in particular with
regard to advertisement and public bid opening. A table detailing the nature and source of
consultant services is given in Annex 12.
2.29        Adeguacy of National Bidding Procedures (NBP). National Bidding Procedures
for public sector procurement in Mauritania have proven slow and cumbersome in several past
and ongoing IDA-financed projects. It has been agreed at negotiations that, before the scheduled
mid-term review, a review of the effectiveness of national bidding procedures would be carried
out as they relate to the project's procurement experience and, if necessary, that modifications to
the current procedures would be proposed in order to accelerate project procurement while still
maintaining adequate control over contract awards and payments (para. 5.01(a)).
2.30        Procurement Reviews. IDA-financed contracts above the threshold value of
US$100,000 equivalent for goods and US$150,000 for works would be subject to IDA's prior
review procedures. The review process would cover 80 percent of the total value of the amount
contracted for goods. Selective post-review of contracts awarded below the threshold levels
would apply to about one in three contracts. Draft standard bidding documents for NCB would
be reviewed by and agreed upon with IDA. The Bank would review the selection process for
consultants proposed by the Borrower. The Borrower would be reminded that opening of the
financial envelopes cannot take place before receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical
evaluation. Prior IDA review would not apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting
firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent,
respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA review would not apply to Terms of
Reference of such contracts, regardless of value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a
critical nature as determined by IDA, or to amendments of contracts raising the contract value
above the prior review threshold.
2.31        Procurement Status of Onuoiny Projects and Proposed Arrangements. During
negotiations, the Government has submitted to IDA for review: (a) a draft procurement plan; (b)
a draft Implementation Manual and (c) draft bidding documents for equipment to be procured
during the first year of project's implementation, as well as draft letters of invitation for
consultant services to be financed by IDA. The Government would submit to IDA the final
versions of these documents prior to project effectiveness. It has given assurance at negotiations
that it would apply the procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in the above
documents.  During negotiations, agreement was reached on the proper monitoring of
procurement as well as the use of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for ICB and that
standard procurement documents for NCB would be developed by the Borrower, reviewed by,



-24 -
and agreed upon with IDA. Agreement was reached at negotiations that procurement of goods,
works and consultant services required for the project, and to be financed out of Credit proceeds,
would take place in accordance with procedures satisfactory to IDA (para.5.01(b)). During
project implementation, procurement information would be collected and recorded as follows:
(a)   prompt recording of contract award information by the Borrower; and
(b)   semi-annual reports to the Bank by the Borrower indicating (i) revised cost
estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates
of allowances for contingencies; (ii) revised timing of estimated procurement
actions, including experience with completion time and completion cost for
individual contracts; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified
methods of procurement.
G. DISBURSEMENT
2.32         The project constitutes a five-year time slice of a longer program, and the credit
would be disbursed over a period of six years (instead of the standard seven-year profile for
Mauritania). The estimated semi-annual disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 5. The IDA
credit would be disbursed on the basis of the categories shown below.
Table 5: Categories of IDA Credit Expenditures

of Expenditure                  (US$ million)       to be financed
1. Works, goods and services (villages investments)  8.0               100
2. Civil works (others)                             1.0                 100
3. Goods and vehicles                               1.0                 100
4. Consultant services and training                 1.5                 100
5. Satellite imagery                                0.1                 100
6. Incremental Operating Costs                      2.5                 100
7. Refunding of PPF                                 1.0
8. Unallocated                                      2.9
Total                                              18.0
2.33         Disbursements of the IDA  credit would be fully documented, except for
expenditures valued under US$50,000 equivalent for individual consultant contracts, and under
US$100,000 for all other contracts, which would be against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs)
certified by the ECPG's Chief Financial Officer and by the Project Director. The ECPG would
be responsible for preparing withdrawal applications, and would indicate on SOEs the nature and
origin of any goods and the payment date. Documentation of withdrawals under SOEs would be
retained at the ECPG for review by IDA staff during supervision missions and for regular annual
audits.
2.34         In order to get their PICs implemented, ADCs would contract with individual
suppliers and private enterprises to get the work done. They would be supported in the process
by individual consultants when required. In order to ensure the financing, mutual conventions



- 25 -
would be agreed between ADCs, providers and the project. The signature of these conventions
is a pre-requisite to the procurement and the implementation of the planned investments. With
the assistance of consultants, the ADC and the PGRNP would sign a contract with providers
selected according to the procurement procedures and the PGRNP. The investment would then
be implemented according to the convention. The signature of the Project Director or his
representative would commit the project to paying the provider according to the terms of the
contract.
2.35        To expedite disbursements, the Government would open and maintain a special
account at a commercial Bank, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The authorized
allocation would be US$800,000. IDA would make an initial deposit of US$400,000 upon
credit effectiveness, with the balance payable once cumulative disbursements under the credit
reach the equivalent of SDR 1,000,000.
2.36        In order to ensure that funds are available at the regional level, the borrower
would be allowed to withdraw from the special account, and deposit into four Advance
Accounts, an amount not exceeding the equivalent of US$50,000 each for Kiffa, Ayoun el
Atrous Nema, and Atar, and thereafter replenish said advance accounts from the special account
according to established Bank procedures. These procedures will be outlined in detail to the
borrower and the executing agencies by the Loan Department in a Disbursement Letter that will
be dispatched to the borrower and executing agencies, following Board approval. The special
account and the four Advance Accounts will be audited annually, and auditors will be required to
give a separate opinion on the operation and maintenance of these accounts as well as provide
certification of withdrawal applications that have been submitted on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs).
2.37        The regional program assistants would obtain the necessary information justifying
incurred expenditures, which will be the basis for monthly replenishment of the Advance
Accounts from the Special Account. IDA would replenish the Special Account upon receipt of
satisfactory proof of incurred expenditures and evidence that such expenditures are eligible for
financing. Up-to-date bank statements as well as a reconciliation of the Special Account would
need to accompany each replenishment request.

III. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION
General Framework
3.01        The project is based upon existing structures, be they administrative services,
coordinating committees or political institutions, all acting in accordance with their usual
mandates. No new temporary ad-hoc structure is being created. All three levels of the
Mauritanian institutional set-up are affected by the project, each of them with discrete objectives:
(i) the local level, including the recently-created municipal level, with elected leaders, and the
community level, where village land-based communities make decisions regarding the
management of natural resources; (ii) the regional level, including the regions proper (wilayas)
and their district or departmental subdivisions (moughataas), where government services have a
role of review and approval; and (iii) the national level, seat of central, administrative and
political power; from which project implementation would be planned and monitored.
Detailed Set-un of the Project
3.02        Village/community level. At the local level, the project would be implemented by
the community development association (ADC) according to the guidelines stated in the
project's implementation manual. Although the choice of the Committee members is left to the
community, project staff would ensure that its members are dynamic, influential and
representative of the main socio-professional groups in the community, particularly those groups
often neglected (e.g., women and younger people), and including traditional leaders (village
chiefs) and local elected officials.  Usually, ADCs have a President (representing the
Committee), a treasurer (to collect and manage funds) and a Secretary (to keep simple books) in
addition to representatives of each of the community technical groups (GTC) dealing with the
social components of the village and the activities they carry out (agriculture, gardening, herding,
fuelwood, hunting, women's activities, etc.). For larger infrastructure works involving several
villages (large water harvesting dams, for instance), local technical committees (GTIVs) would
be established under the oversight of technical services from the MDRE Delegation.
3.03        The ADC's role is to: (i) carry out, with the project's support, the whole process
of NRM planning leading to technically feasible action plans; (ii) ensure the implementation of
planned programs and activities by mobilizing human, material and financial resources from
beneficiaries; (iii) ensure that these new facilities are being used and maintained in a sustainable
manner, and that operation and maintenance fees are being raised as agreed; (iv) help settle
litigation involving access to common resources belonging to the community; and (v) represent
the community vis-a-vis other stakeholders (project, technical services, NGOs, other
communities). From a legal standpoint, the community and its ADC need a legal status, such as
that of an association, in order to be able to enter into contractual arrangements. According to
studies carried out during project preparation, the legal framework for such recognition already



-27 -
exists. As stated in para. 1.25, the appraisal mission has agreed (and the Government has
confirmed before negotiations) that the existing legal framework accommodates project's
implementation as far as community organization and security of access to natural resources are
concerned.
3.04        Municipal level. At the municipal or communal level, the Municipal Council is
the legitimate institutional intermediary between the communities and the district and regional
administrations. Mauritanian law on territorial administration has evolved in such a way that the
municipality is involved in the design and implementation of plans for equipping the various
village lands (terroirs) that constitute it. Once community natural resource management plans
(see Para. 3.13) have been reviewed by the municipal council and approved by the regional
development committee (CRD), they will be acknowledged as compatible with national master
plans issued by DATAR, MHE, DEAR and other technical departments and become the building
blocks of any further communal and regional development planning.
3.05        District (Moughataa) Level. This level lies between the regional Government
authority (the wali in the wilaya) and the communal elected leaders (municipal council). The
Project's implementation manual describes how community's natural resource management
planning package (see Para. 3.13) is transmitted for information to the moughataa for further
communication to the wilaya. This consultation is carried out by the district development
committee (CLD) presided over by the hakem of the moughataa.  Its members include
representatives of the civil services (MDRE, health and social welfare, hydraulics, education,
energy and other decentralized government services), projects and NGOs, as well as local elected
leaders.
3.06        Regional (Wilaya) level In five capital cities of the nine wilayas where the
project intervenes, the MDRE Delegate is the Regional Project Coordinator, (CRP). He is
assisted by a regional program assistant (CPR) selected for his expertise, and recruited by the
project. Under the authority of the Director of the PGRNP and the MDRE Regional Delegate,
this contractual staff would be responsible for the project's activities in the Region: (i) with the
assistance of a financial manager, he would manage the Advance Account (where established),
expedite local procurement and payments, and maintain a general and analytical accounting; (ii)
in connection with the wilaya CRP, he would ensure that the community natural resource
management planning package submitted for approval is reviewed and processed in a timely
manner; (iii) within the MDRE Delegation, he would facilitate and monitor the participation of
civil servants from technical departments (including Ag. Services) in project activities according
to a commonly agreed work plan; and (iv) he would plan and supervise project activities at
regional level, including field visits, training, reporting and monitoring and evaluation activities.
3.07        The reg'ional dele-oation of the MDRE is the Project's operational headquarters in
the region. Three-member project support teams (EMATs) reinforce the Delegation's Rural
Organization Bureau (BOP), while civil servants from technical departments (forestry,
agriculture, livestock, genie rural) participate in project activities (SAC preparation and
implementation of project investment plans) according to an agreed-upon work program to be
monitored by the Regional Coordinator.



-28 -
3.08        The regional development committee (CRD) is presided over by the wali It
includes representatives of the administration (hakems), civil service (Ministries of Agriculture,
Interior, Health, Education, Women's Affairs, Hydraulics, Energy, etc.), private stakeholders
(NGOs and private firms), and the civil society (elected communal representatives and
professional associations). On a quarterly basis, (i) the CRD approves new community natural
resources management packages possibly in presence of community representatives, assisted by
communal elected leaders and project staff; and (ii) examines the status of project
implementation plans and apportions resources from technical services accordingly. Everv year
the CRD examines the annual NRM implementation report for the previous period and approves
the work plan and budget for the next one.
3.09        National Level.  Project financial management control is ensured, on behalf of
the Government, by the recently created Conseil de surveillance (CS) (Decree 96-026 PM of
April 1, 1996). Project technical coordination will be ensured by a Steering Committee (CP)
including representatives from relevant ministries (MDRE, Plan, Interior, Equipment, Hydraulics
and Energy) and, on a consultative basis, others such as the Association of Mauritanian Mayors
(AMM) and donors involved in the same type of activities. The CP will be presided over by the
Economic Counselor of the Prime Minister; its secretariat will be provided by the project's
central planning and implementation team (ECPG). The role of the CP will be to: (i) ensure the
coordination of project activities with those carried out by other programs and departments; (ii)
to establish broad goals to be achieved during the following year; and (iii) to review project
achievements on the same annual basis. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that
the "Arr&te" establishing composition, mandate and schedule of meetings of the Project Steering
Committee will be issued to the Bank's satisfaction by the Ministry of Planning (para. 5.01 (d)).
3.10        Project planning and implementation would be carried out by the ECPG
established within the Cabinet of the MDRE (Arrete 37 of February 11, 1996). Since the
decentralization in 1994 of MDRE's technical departments to the regional (wilaya) level, the
chain of command of technical departments (DRAP, DEAR, DREV) having staff in the regional
delegations is being channeled through the Cabinet of the MDRE. Nevertheless, since the
reorganization, the operational capacity of the Cabinet has not increased. Thus, the placement of
the project's ECPG at the Cabinet level is expected to contribute effectively to the development
of the rural sector's institutional capacity. The ECPG team (see para 2.15 (d)) is kept minimal in
order to allocate most of the project's human resources in the field, but it is granted the external
support required to make it effective. Its staff is recruited on fixed-term contracts.

B. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Project area coverage
3.11        The rainfed area of Mauritania covers some 2,260 villages and 750,000
inhabitants (roughly 300 per village on average). There are 1,600 villages with populations in
the target range of 100-1,000 inhabitants. The objective of the four five-year time-slices of the
NRM program is to involve 85% of these villages: 250 villages during the first five-year project,
300 during the second, 350 during the third and 450 during the fourth. The 250 villages to be
covered under the proposed project would be located in nine regions or wilayas (out of 13).
Twenty-four districts or moughataas (out of 53) and 62 rural municipalities or communes (out of
163) would be involved. The project would therefore benefit roughly 75,000 inhabitants of the
750,000 in the rainfed area (10%). According to information provided by the EU, the
implementation of the national natural resource management program in the regions of Tagant,
Brakna and a part of the Trarza would be envisaged as part of its next national investment
program (PIN).

3.12        Selection. The choice of rural communities to benefit from the Project is sensitive
in terms of equity (with the poorest wilayas requiring more interventions) and operationality
(since interventions are more likely to be successful in areas with higher potential). The choice of
the 62 communes targeted for an intervention has been made by the Government for negotiations,
whereas the choice of village clusters within these communes would be made by the project,
using a comprehensive selection mechanism early in the process of implementation (details are
in Annex 7 and the Implementation Manual). Although the project would focus on villages
ranging from 100 to 1,000 inhabitants, smaller settlements might be eligible, provided that they
associate with other neighboring communities to reach a minimal critical mass of investment.
Larger communities might also be eligible, provided that they accept relatively lower allocations.
3.13        Community Natural Resource Planning. The community-based natural resources
management planning consists of three different stages, each producing its own discrete
document: (a) the communftv land use master plan (SAC) is established during the initial
intervention of the project, mostly using participatory rural appraisal techniques. It describes the
resource base, land use and land tenure features of the different parts of the area managed by a



-30 -
given community; (b) the establishment of the communitv management plan (PAC) implies that
the community is already aware of the ecological, social and economic principles of sound rural
development. The document includes all improvements which could be envisaged in the
medium and long term, in terms of agriculture, social and infrastructure investments; (c) finally,
the communitv investment plan (PIC) selects from the PAC the activities to be co-financed by the
project. This document is detailed enough to allow the establishment of contracts needed for its
implementation, once approved. The content of the PIC would be examined by the ECPG and/or
the Regional Coordinator to ensure its conformity with the investment selection criteria
contained in the project implementation manual (economic and financial viability, and
environmental and socio-economic impact; see also para. 3.29). Depending on local conditions,
the whole process might take 3 months to one year.
3.14        Proiect activities, recruitment and coordination.  During project preparation,
guidelines were established for project implementation (Annex 2). These include (i)
implementation of community-based NRM plans; (ii) the skills development and public
awareness component; (iii) the gender issue and how to ensure participation in the process; (iv)
the test approach to the land tenure issue; (v) implementation of participatory fuelwood
management; and (vi) rangeland management. A draft of the project implementation manual has
been transmitted to the Bank for negotiation; it will be finalized and translated into Arabic as a
condition of effectiveness (para. 5.02 (a)). In addition, the project preparation team has been
asked to draw up a manual of technologies to be implemented by the project, which is the aim of
an ongoing consultancy.
C. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
3.15        Careful monitoring is needed to help decision-makers obtain quick and regular
feedback on project implementation, and to make rapid adjustments when required. Because of
the grassroots nature of the proposed project and its bottom-up approach, details on the exact
location, type and number of investments at field level cannot be known before community NRM
plans are agreed upon. The Project is inherently flexible, which makes the role of process
monitoring far more important, as well as more difficult, than a simple assessment of the
implementation of prescribed plans. A project monitoring system, including 20 indicators, has
been developed as part of the project's logical framework (Annex 10), out of which a set of six
key performance indicators has been established (Annex 11) against which the achievement of
project's development objectives will be assessed.
3.16        Collection and processing procedures of indicators selected to monitor the
project's implementation, outcome and impact are included in the project implementation
manual; they would be carried out under the coordination of the NRM specialist of the ECPG.
D. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING
3.17        Project Management and Accounting. The project's computerized management
and accounting system has been designed. The software has been purchased and will be installed



-31 -
as a condition of effectiveness. Assurances have been obtained that, for all expenditures for
which withdrawals from the Credit are made on the basis of SOEs, the Borrower shall (i)
maintain records and accounts reflecting such expenditures; (ii) retain for at least one year after
credit closing all records evidencing such expenditures; (iii) enable IDA's representatives to
examine such records; and (iv) ensure that such records and accounts are included in the annual
audit, and that the report of such audit contains a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs can be
relied upon to support the related withdrawals (para. 5.01(c)).  In order to facilitate
implementation of the component, accounting procedures satisfactory to IDA will be included in
the project's implementation manual.
3.18        The project would provide funds to establish revolving funds managed at the
community level in order to build up their financial management capacity (para. 2.14). Such
provision would be awarded according to detailed guidelines included in the project's
implementation manual: (i) each community would only be granted a single operation of this
kind, dealing either with productive or commercial activities; (ii) preconditions to be met would
cover organization (i.e., a management committee), regulation (clear rules of operation,
maintenance and accounting), finances (advance payment of beneficiary contributions) and skills
(training where required); and (iii) EMAT's financial manager would monitor these operations
specifically.
3.19        Audits. The financial manager of the ECPG would maintain all project-related
records and accounts, and would have these audited annually by independent external auditors
acceptable to IDA. All disbursements against SOEs, the Special Account and the four Advance
Accounts would be audited separately. The accounts would be maintained in accordance with
sound and internationally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to IDA.
The accounting management would provide interim and annual financial statements reflecting
the financial performance and position of the Project.  An auditor's opinion and reports
satisfactory to IDA on such statements would be provided within six months of the close of the
fiscal year. The auditor's report would include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting
system and internal controls, the reliability of SOEs as a basis for Credit disbursements, and
compliance with financial covenants.
3.20        Assurances have been obtained that (i) the records and accounts for the Special
Account and Advance Accounts would be audited for each fiscal year, in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent auditors acceptable to IDA;
(ii) the Borrower would furnish to IDA as soon as available, but in any case not later than six
months after the end of each such year, a certified copy of the report of such audit by said
auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Association shall have reasonably requested; and
(iii) the Borrower would furnish to the Association such other information concerning such
records, accounts and the audit thereof as the Association shall from time to time reasonably
request. During negotiations, the Mauritanian delegation has submitted a short list of auditing
firms to IDA for approval. The appointment of an auditing firm acceptable to IDA to audit
project accounts under a one-year automatically renewable contract, except in the case of poor
performance, will be a condition of effectiveness (para. 5.02 (c)).



-32 -
E. REPORTING, SUPERVISION AND MID-TERM REVIEW
3.21        Project reporting. The project's ECPG would issue semi-annual reports on the
status of project implementation. Reports, to be issued at the end of the calendar year, would
consolidate the whole year's results according to the standard format included in the project's
implementation manual and would provide a detailed technical and financial action plan (PETF)
for the following year.
3.22        Proiect Supervision. Supervision missions would be carried out jointly or in
liaison with other operations for which coordination is considered particularly important, such as
the PSA and the PDIAIM. Supervision of the Project's financial management, accounting and
auditing follow-up would be undertaken as a separate exercise. Supervision missions would
include, in addition to the task managers, experts with the various skills and experience required
to assess project progress in financial management, popular participation, gender issues, training,
and environmental impact. In view of the high supervision input that will be required for
effective implementation of this "process-oriented" project, such input will be clearly indicated
in the Bank's task contract.
3.23        Joint Annual Review. The Borrower and the Association shall undertake, during
the first quarter of each calendar year, a joint review of the Project in which representatives of
ADCs may be invited to participate. Such review meetings would be particularly important in the
case of the proposed project, since, as noted elsewhere, village-level investments would be
chosen during project implementation. This review shall cover, inter alia (a) the progress made
in the execution of the Project, the review of the progress report of the preceding year; (b) the
ADCs adherence to the provisions of the MP, and proposed changes to said MP; (c) the
implementation of Sub-project Agreements; (d) evaluation of (i) the adequacy of the ADC's
contribution to Sub-projects; and (ii) the performance of the pilot pastoral program in accordance
to the agreed indicators; (e) a review of the recommendations of the Conseil de Surveillance and
the Comite de Pilotage ; and (f) the approval of the implementation program of the Project,
including technical, financial and procurement aspects, for the current year. Not later than one
month prior to each such review, the progress report for the preceding year shall be submitted for
review and comments. Following each joint annual review, action plans will be agreed and
aimed at addressing major problems identified during the review.
3.24        Mid-Term Review. Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that:
(a)   the borrower and IDA would conduct, not later than two and a half years after
the date of Credit effectiveness, a mid-term Project Implementation Review
which would focus on project development objectives and, in particular: (i)
implementation progress, on the basis of which preliminary decisions would be
made on the Program's continuation; (ii) the experience gained under land
tenure arrangements, with a view to setting up a time-bound Action Plan,
including steps to replace, modify or implement the existing land tenure
framework; (iii) following up the conclusions of the assessment of public
procurement procedures and making adequate recommendations; (iv)



-33 -
evaluation of the training component by an external entity, with a view to a
possible merger of similar programs at the subregional level; and (v) reviewing
the Action Plan aimed at strengthening the statistical data of the rural sector
previously prepared by the ONS (para. 2.17 (g)).
(b)   not later than four weeks prior to such review, the Borrower shall furnish to
IDA for its review and comment a report in such detail as IDA shall reasonably
request, including: (i) an evaluation of progress achieved in project
implementation by the Borrower in general, and by its central, regional and
local agencies in particular, in accordance with the provisions of respective
implementation agreements; (ii) a draft action program to be carried out until
the completion of the Project, focused on the components stressed above; and
(c)   promptly after completing the mid-term review, recommendations arising from
said review would be carried out as agreed by the Borrower and IDA (para.
5.01(e)).
F. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
3.25        The objective of the Project is to halt and reverse the process of natural resource
degradation in order to secure sustainable agricultural growth, enhance biodiversity and
ecological stability, and achieve sustainable livestock and wildlife management. Nevertheless,
any program aiming simultaneously to enhance production and protect natural resources can
have potential negative impacts. These must be foreseen, and the implementation plan makes
provisions for their mitigation. Recent experience in neighboring countries has shown that,
provided they are designed in accordance with sound environmental practices, natural resource
management projects can very well precede rather than follow the finalization of the NEAP. In
Mali, the NRM project, which was implemented four years before the NEAP was issued,
provided a forum for testing some important options (e.g., local management of NRM and
institutional organization) which were later extended at the national level and subsequently
included in the NEAP.
3.26        The Environmental Assessment, carried out as part of project preparation, has
concluded that, in terms of potential negative environmental impact, actions envisaged under the
project vary greatly. Land conservation techniques (bunds, planting) have a mostly positive
impact on erosion, while agricultural tillage and livestock grazing entail greater risks and, if
mismanaged, the possibility of worsening degradation. Water supply activities (wheels, pumps)
present the risk of exhaustion of the water table.
3.27        The mitigation plan recommended by the environmental assessment recommends
(i) including, in the planning of village investments, an assessment of existing water resources;
(ii) coordination with Government services (i.e., departement de l'hydraulique), which is a
prerequisite for the approval of communities' management plans by the CRD; (iii) the inclusion,



-34 -
in the training program, of an awareness of environmental risk; and (iv) implementation of an
effective monitoring system.
3.28        The Social Impact Study performed during project preparation identified areas of
potential conflict, such as village delineation, access to water, access to rangelands, and
competition over natural resources within the community itself and between the community and
outsiders. The study also identified areas in which the project is expected to have a positive
impact, such as community empowerment, protection of the most vulnerable groups (the poor,
women), development of human resources, and environmental protection. Finally, the study
recommends (i) a concerted effort to identify vulnerable groups; (ii) an effective institutional set-
up at the community level; and (iii) a well-designed training program (including conflict
resolution).
3.29        In order to ensure that investment packages (PIC) to be implemented at village
level are both socially and environmentally sound, in addition to providing optimal economic
benefits, the project's implementation manual states that, in order to be executed, the PIC will
have to be assessed by the regional coordinators supported by regional technical services
(DEAR, DRAP). This assessment will ensure that the PIC is sound (a) economically, using
standard rates of return on major microprojects included in the package; (b) environmentallv, by
assessing possible risks associated with the implementation of the PIC in terms of exhaustion of
the water table, erosion and loss of soil fertility, and overexploitation of vegetation (forest and
pastures); and (c) socially, by assessing the social equity of the proposed investments, and the
compatibility of the subsidy levels of the package with existing programs. Guidelines for the
implementation of these assessments are included in the project implementation manual.

IV.    PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS AND SUSTAINABILITY
A. PROJECT BENEFITS
4.01        The proposed project contains several novel features that, if successful, would
increase crop and livestock production in a difficult environment, as well as point the way
towards a solution to some of the more persistent social and enviromnental problems in the rural
sector. Project benefits can be grouped as follows: those directly increasing production at the
village level; those that are felt nationwide (i.e. that have an impact beyond the project area);
and those improving institutional and administrative capabilities.
4.02        Direct benefits can be categorized in three ways: preservation of the village
habitat (e.g. through dune fixation; protection of woodlands; well construction and repair);
improvement of subsistence production (e.g. through construction of small dams and water
retention dikes; contour bunds; anti-erosion dikes; vegetable gardening);  and increased
monetarv revenue (e.g. through establishment of orchards; woodlands exploitation for charcoal
making; promotion of cottage industries).
4.03        Since the project is the first phase of a long-termn program, and the type and
frequency of investment actions chosen by the villagers is not yet known, it would not be
meaningful to calculate an economic rate of return for the project as a whole. Nevertheless, in
order to get a realistic idea of the projects' economic viability, three model village resource
management plans have been drawn up in Annex 8: a pastoral model for the drier parts of the
project area in which livestock raising is virtually the only activity; an aWro-nastoral model for
intermediate areas where cropping is becoming more important; and an agro-svlvo-xastoral
model for the wetter parts of the project area, in which, in addition to livestock and cropping,
wood resources are significant. Taken together, these models conform to, and are representative
of, the existing production systems in the project area. The investment choices for each model
have been made, and the choices have been tested as to their conformity with eligibility and
selection criteria. An internal rate of return has been calculated for most of the investments as
well as for each model as a whole.
4.04        The calculations show that the project would yield substantial direct benefits. In
the pastoral model, execution of the pasture improvement program (improved water supply and
introduction of rotational grazing) would double livestock production in seven years due to
increased stocking rates, higher yield and better quality output. In the agro-pastoral model, the
various investments in water harvesting would place place the production of sorghum, the basic
staple, on secure footing and increase output by about 45%. In the agro-sylvo-pastoral model,
crop production and wood production would both be increased without risking resource
depletion, and economic activities by women would be diversified. The return on individual



-36 -
investments ranges from 10% to 19%; the return on each model package reaches 12%, 13% and
14% respectively (see Annex 8)
4.05        At the national level, the project entails four major benefits:
(a)  since most project investments are expected to improve water availability and
make pasture and crop production more drought resistant, the project would help
to keep people on the land, thus reducing rural outmigration.   This is an
important national policy goal: Mauritania is the only West African country with
urbanization rates so high that its rural population has declined in absolute terms
over the past 15 years (at rates between 0.5% and 1.5% per year) despite an
overall population increase of 2.5% per year, and Government bears a heavy
burden of providing adequate infrastructure and urban facilities.
(b)  disappearance of the forest and bush cover, and a decline in the regenerative
capacity of pasture land, are two of the most important environmental problems
the country faces in the rural sector. The pilot programs for improved pasture
management and woodlands protection included in the project as part of the
village resource management plans would, if successful, help to solve these
problems and arrest and reverse environmental degradation over the medium to
long term.
(c)  the establishment of village land resource management plans through the direct
involvement of stakeholders would lead to consensus solutions concerning land
and water use. Land and water use conflicts over pasture lands, wells and wood
resources are frequent, especially in times of insufficient rainfall. The project
would thus directly contribute to a reduction of social conflict.
(d)  since beneficiaries themselves will decide on, and participate in, the investments
to be made, maintenance of infrastructure would be better ensured and its useful
life longer due to a greater sense of ownership.
4.06        The institutional set-up of the project also contains features that would further the
country's ongoing process of decentralization of decision-making, to which the Government is
committed. In order to firmly anchor decision-making powers at the beneficiary level, the
project would enter into contracts with Community Associations for the implementation of
adopted and approved plans. Moreover, the plans would only have to be approved by the local
and regional authorities: by the Municipal Council of the municipality to which the village
belongs, and subsequently by the Regional Development Committee under the Regional
Governor. Thus, the Central Govermnent authorities would not intervene in the process. This
"bottom up" approach would be new to the country and, if successful, would open the way to
increased power sharing with local authorities and villagers. Finally, the project would not have
a free-standing implementation capability. It would instead rely on private contractors and
suppliers in addition to village labor for the execution of investments, on existing agricultural
services for preparation of village resource management plans, and on the regional technical



-37 -
services of the Ministry of Rural Development for supervision of execution of works. The
technical services would be strengthened where necessary for this task. Replicability would thus
be ensured.
B. PROJECT RISKS
4.07          Project risks are largely non-quantifiable. They have been identified in the project
logical framework (Annex 10) and can be grouped together with their likely impact and associated
mitigating measures, as shown below in Table 7.

C. FISCAL IMPACT OF THE PROJECT
4.08        The fiscal burden of the project on the Borrower is designed to be minimal, given
the difficult financial situation of the country and the need to reduce the budget deficit. The
Government's contribution is limited to US$0.4 million over five years, representing the salaries
(net of taxes) of existing government employees working in MDRE's field services who would
be seconded to the project. Other recurrent costs, as well as the wages of project personnel,
would be met by the donor. After credit closing/project completion, costs related to the field
level investments would be supported by the beneficiaries. Government's incremental
contribution would be nil. The continuation of extension support would be needed, but this is
presently already included under the Agricultural Services Project. The long-term incremental
cost of extension support would be limited to the salaries and field allowances of AVBs and their
supervision, approximately US$0.4 million per annum.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
4.09        The project has been designed so as to optimize its chances of long-term
sustainability. At the village level, investments would be implemented only after beneficiaries
are effectively organized, rules of access to resources have been accepted, operation and
maintenance funds are being raised, and a system for their proper management exists. Once
villages are organized, positive results are observed and additional production is generated,
communities will be able to pursue on their own the process initiated with the project's help. At
the municipal level, village resource management plans would be consolidated into "action plans
for municipal development", preparation of which was requested by the recent Congress of
Mauritanian Mayors. At the regional and central levels, the project would be programmed and
supervised by the permanent technical services of the Ministry of Rural Development and
Environment. At the international level. Mauritania would be part of the Sahelian/West African
natural resource network currently being developed to foster an ongoing exchange of experience
between neighboring countries.

LIST OF PROJECTS RELATED TO
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. AND LESSONS LEARNED
Projects Funded by IDA:
* Project Technical Assistance to Rural Sector: (Cr-14140-MAU). This (now completed)
IDA/UNSO project to strengthen MDRE's Environmental Protection Department has
shown that institutional development efforts whose sole aim is to strengthen public services
cannot make an effective contribution to environmental protection;
* Livestock II Proiect (Cr-16580-MAU), effective June 1987; closed June 1995, co-financed
with OPEC, AfDB and Norwegian financing, covered the entire rainfed zone. Despite some
serious difficulties, it yielded valuable insights into the promotion of socio-professional and
sylvopastoral resource management organizations that will prove useful under the PGRNP.
Livestock II demonstrated that: (i) sub-sectoral projects cannot give producers' groups the
dynamism they need; (ii) the creation of associations is not enough to ensure efficient
resource management; and (iii) the success of any rural development program will depend
on the assumption, by communities, of responsibility for its implementation;
* Aericultural Sector Adjustment and Investment Project (CR. 2093-MAU) has dealt rather
successfully with policy adjustments (land reform in the Senegal River Valley) and
investments (irrigated perimeters in the Valley);
* Technical Assistance, Energv and Public Sector SupPort Proiect (Cr. 2167-MAU) included
a household energy strategy component aimed at reducing charcoal consumption,
promoting substitute fuels, and developing the use of improved stoves. It did not address
the supply side (forest management, fuelwood marketing) to be covered by the proposed
project;
* Agriculture Service Proiect, (Cr-2575-MAU), effective since 1994, aimed at providing the
whole rural sector with extension services, including agriculturists and herders. The
proposed project would be set up, together the PSA, within one single comprehensive
Agricultural Sector development program;
* Urban Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project (Cr.2835-MAU), although it deals
with a different sector, is likely to play an important role in future activities dealing with
communal organization;
* Integrated Development Program of Irrigated Agriculture (PDIAIAO, under preparation,
would aim at (i) creating an enabling institutional environment in the sub-sector; (ii)
restructuring irrigation management; (iii) upgrading farmers' skills and managerial abilities;
(iv) consolidating existing irrigation schemes; (v) improving marketing and (vi) mitigating

the ecological impacts of irrigation. It would be implemented in close coordination with the
proposed project;
2.    Projects Funded by Other Donors
* Tagant and Lac d'Aleg Proiects. currently financed by the European Community, have
objectives and strategies similar to those of the proposed project, and are being implemented
under a single management staff, over three Regions where the proposed project would not
intervene;
* Gestion des RessourcesNaturelles de I'Est Mauritanian GIRNEM (1991-1997). This German-
financed project has accumulated experience that has proved useful in the preparation of the
institutional component of the proposed project;
* Pro et de Lutte contre l'Ensablement et Mise en Valeur A rosvlvo astorale (PLEMVASP)
(1993-1995). Co-financed by UNSO and UNDP. Implemented by FAO, aimed at dune
stabilization, vegetation rehabilitation, control of desertification;
- Achram-DioukProiect (1992-1995). This project, financed by Germany, carried out valuable
experiments in exploiting flood recession techniques and in organizing communities for
agrosylvopastoral land management;
- Proiet Rcpgional d'Apvui au Divelovpement Rural ( PRADER) (German financing). This area
development project in the wilaya of Hodh el Gharbi, which is part of the implementation
zone of the proposed project will, therefore, have a close relationshipwith it;
* Projet opderations villageoises POV (1992-1994), financed by the EU, involves small village
operations in Gorgol, including water management works (mainly dams);
* In addition, the following projects have dealt, or still deal, with some aspects of natural
resource management:
* Barriere Verte du Trarza (BVT), French financing; 1994-1996;
* Projet de Reboisement d'Agglomerations Situees sur la Route de l'Espoir (PRASRE),
financed by AfDB; 1994, ongoing;

IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT'S ACTIVITIES
Community-based NRM Planning
I     In accordance with the community-based NRM approach, the project's technical support
teams (EMATs) and extension agents (AVBs)would operate as follows:
(a)   under the leadership of the EMAT's communications/organization specialist, and
using participatory rural appraisal (PRA) techniques in which project staff would
have been previously trained, the first phase of intervention aims at building trust,
establishing Community development associations (ADC) and community technical
committees (GTC), This specialist would be responsible for the establishment of the
community land use master plan (SAC) defining the current land use and tenure
status. No further activity would be started until this step is completed. The key
element here is time.
(b)   during the second phase, the common resource manag'ement specialist from the
EMAT would extend the NRM planning methodology to the villagers, with a view to
setting up the community management plan (PAC), and to select, among the actions
included in the PAC, those which would be includes into the community investment
plan (PIC) to be co-financed by the project after being reviewed at communal and
district level, and approved by the Regional Governor. The focus of the community
investment plan could vary, depending on the situation, from a single limited action
to comprehensive programs involving entire production systems and populations.
The key element here is flexibility.
(c)   the financial and administrative specialist from the EMAT would subsequently help
the villagers to carry out the community investment plan (PIC) once it has been
approved, providing support for access to and management of funds and procurement
of inputs and services. Finally, this specialist would monitor, on behalf of the Project,
the effective delivery of goods and works (including labor provided by villagers)
contracted for as part of the implementation of community investment plans. Past
experience gained by similar projects inside and outside Mauritania, would be taken
into account.
2     The process described above is complex and time-consuming. Nevertheless, past experience
has shown that community NRM can achieve its objectives provided that (i) the community NRM
planning process is demand-driven and takes into account the community's essential requirements;
(ii) initial efforts are made to address the villagers' land tenure security; (iii) a comprehensive and
culturally aware skills development program is carried out; (iv) the role of women is acknowledged



- 43 -
ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 7
and encouraged; and (v) arrangements for the operation and maintenance of investments are clearly
stated in the implementation manual and agreed upon by the community.
Skills Development and Public Awareness
3     The implementation of the proposed project requires new technical knowledge and skills
very different from those presently available. Thus, the success of such a project depends on
intensive human resource development. An interim training program will be in place at the time
of project start-up. The strategy for this component will aim at adapting the training program to
the Project's changing needs. The skills gap analysis and module design would be subcontracted
to private training firms. The project would establish a database of training resources available
in Mauritania and neighboring countries (facilitators, resource persons, training facilities), which
could be called upon for implementation of the modules.
4     Four different steps will be carried out by different entities working in close coordination:
(a)   the first step consists of identifying target groups to be involved in the training
program. This step will be handled by the ECPG's staff, with an eye to problems
identified in the course of project implementation. Target groups include, in addition
to project staff, the different community and village technical groups, technical and
administrative staff at the local, regional and national government levels, and the
public at large.
(b)   each group identified as requiring training is subjected to a "skills gap analysis"
which pinpoints the missing skills -- e.g., pure technical knowledge, operational
procedures, communications ability, etc. -- to be developed under the program. A
particular procedure would be followed to develop targeted public awareness
campaigns;
(c)   "modules" or training processes of various durations are then designed for each
specific target group and set of skills to be developed. These modules are based on
participatory adult training techniques, including case studies, small group exercises,
simulations and, in the case of village communities, techniques of PRA.
(d)   once tested and adjusted, the training "modules' are delivered to their intended target
groups by specialized facilitators assisted by qualified resource persons. In addition
to the training of trainers, to be provided fortnightly to extension agents and monthly
to TSTs, these modules include, for instance, full-day village sensitization sessions,
team-building workshops, short information seminars, and national public awareness
campaigns.
5     In order to have some of the target groups ready to operate at effectiveness, an interim
training and workshops program has already started This interim program would be a precursor of
the several project-launch workshops to be held at the time of effectiveness, the cost of which would
be financed under the PPF. The experience acquired under similar components of the Burkina Faso



- 44 -
ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 7
PNGT and Mali PGRN projects would be fully exploited through the use of tested training packages
and trainers with good performance records.
Gender and Participation
6     Due to the migration of men to cities and other countries, women are increasingly
responsible for natural resource management. They supply household water and firewood and
participate actively in agricultural work, especially in the rainfed areas. Any NRM program must
therefore take women into account to the same degree as men. Although women have a lesser role
of decision-makers in many traditional communities, a dynamic women's movement is afoot in
Mauritania, and many women's associations exist for agricultural work and environmental
protection. Female extension agents are still rare, and the project will pay particular attention to
extension programs geared to women, to improving female producers' access to extension services,
and to developing tools and technologies adapted to their needs and abilities.
7     The proposed project would develop and implement a strategy that would enhance the role of
women in NRM. According to this strategy, the gender issue would not be tackled through separate
components targeting women (although this might be relevant in some circumstances). Instead, the
issue would be dealt with by the entire project staff in its day-to-day operations. Guidelines for
project staff would be established as part of the skills development program, and decisions on the
following topics would be made under community NRM plans only after being discussed and
accepted by the village women's technical committees: (i) location and operation of water points; (ii)
land-use planning (agro-forestry); (iii) movement and management of livestock; and (iv) choice,
location and operation of collective food-processing equipment (mills, oil extraction plants).
8     In addition, the Project would include measures to: (i) encourage the establishment of village
women's sub-sectoral groups; (ii) have these groups consulted on all important decisions concerning
village NRM activities; (iii) promote the participation of women in training sessions and meetings
organized under the proposed project; (iv) recruit women as technical extension staff wherever
possible, especially at village level. Issues of a broader nature, such as land tenure and gender, would
be first addressed in the Valley. The project's achievements in dealing with the gender issue would
be monitored under the proposed monitoring and evaluation system, using appropriate indicators.
Land Tenure under the Project
9     The project would not establish a land cadaster whether of privately or collectively owned
lands, since such an endeavor is not considered necessary at the present stage, in the rainfed zone.
Instead, the following approach would be applied
(a)   during project preparation, a legal consultancy has been carried out, which has
establish that the current regulatory framework of laws and regulations would allow
for the allocation of land, water and vegetation (rangeland, fuelwood) to well-
identified users' groups under certain conditions and the Government has
acknowledged the existence of this legislation, and committed itself to its
implementation under the project;



45 -ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 7
(b)   during project implementation, according to the project's approach of "land tenure
tests", villagers willing to improve land tenure security in their area would be
assisted by knowledgeable, locally-recruited resource persons who would help them
review current local land tenure practices, paying special attention to gender. The
review would produce practical recommendations, addressed to technical and
administrative authorities, for improving the community's security of access to
natural resources. In areas of overlapping grazing rights between sedentary villagers
and seasonal transhumant herders, special attention would be paid to the
acknowledgment by villagers of all well-established seasonal grazing rights;
(c)   at mid-term review, subject to prior consultation with technical and administrative
authorities at regional and district levels, the recommendations made during the
previous phase would be reviewed and then tested for a fixed period of time; and
(d)   prior to project completion, and after close monitoring of the land tenure tests by the
ECPG and local authorities, the results of those tests would be fully assessed and a
decision would then be made either to discontinue the operation, to adjust it, or to
formalize it. In the latter case, the test could be used for the further amendment of
land tenure regulations. This is when the potential usefulness of a formal delimitation
(cadastral survey) of common and private land would be assessed, and when such a
component would possibly be included in a follow-up project.
Fuelwood Management under the Project
10    The household energy strategy (SED) designed by ESMAP in 1990, focused mainly on
demand issues (substitution, improved stoves and pricing policies) with very little emphasis on the
supply side, such as the management of the sustainable fuelwood production and distribution (para
1 .10). As a result of project preparation, the Mauritanian Government requested and was granted the
resources to participate in the Review of Policies of the Traditional Energy Sector (RPTES) carried
out under trust fund financing to establish a comprehensive sector strategy dealing with the "supply"
as well as with the "demand" side of renewable energy. A comprehensive household energy strategy
(SED) will be designed according to the recommendations of the NEAP and in agreement with the
Government. In the meanwhile, pilot participative fuelwood management operations would be
carried out as part of the village investments component of the project. The labor costs in the
following table would be borne by the beneficiaries.

11    The project's strategy would be to deal with four dimensions of the household energy sector:
(i) it would establish a close linkage between supplv and demand for household energy through
coordination with the Public Sector, Technical Assistance and Energy Project (Cr. 2167-MAU) and
the permanent structure to be established within the Ministry of Energy, which would deal with the
differential taxation of fuelwood and charcoal marketed in major cities; (ii) it would pursue
proactive coordination with related proiects and programs, and especially with the PDIAIM project
in the Valley, under which participatory management of pilot gazetted and private forests would be
implemented according to the ESMAP-RPTES approach; (iii) it would contain an enabling policy
framework including legal right of access, taxation and tax collection; and (iv) it would participate in
the implementation of the whole stratev (enforcement of regulation, monitoring, organization and
skills development of stakeholders) under a discrete institutional framework.
Rangeland Management under the Project
12    Past attempts to check the continuous degradation of collectively managed rangeland in
Mauritania have been mostly unsuccessful. Under the completed Livestock II project, the following
reasons for this failure were cited: (i) the pastoral communities has been insufficiently involved in
decision-making; (ii) the technical principles applied had often been ineffective, with an
overemphasis on "stocking rates" that had little relevance under conditions of unpredictable rainfall
and mobile production systems; (iii) an "agronomic" approach stressing the planting of exotic
species rather than improvement of the ecological succession of native species; and (iv) certain
features of plant vs animals'interraction, while well acknowledged by pastoral communities, were
ignored. Given the encouraging results of the holistic resource management approach in Chad, this
approach would be implemented in two pilot perimeters (Hodh El Gharbi and Hodh El Chargui)
under the West African Pastoral Pilot Program involving five other Sahelian countries with IDA
coordination. The amount of US$500,000 has been allocated in the project budget to implement this
pilot operation.
13    The holistic resource management model, used in rangeland management as well as in the
establishment of the community management plan, is a thought process by means of which, after
identifying the resources to be involved in management (family, village, tribe), the following steps
are taken: (i) agreeing upon goals acceptable to the whole community; (ii) assessing the health of the
environment in systemic terms of water, mineral and energy cycle, and succession; (iii) selecting the
tools and technologies most likely to achieve these goals; and (iv) carrying out the permanent
monitoring of results and the iterative adjustment of the management plan. Features of special
interest in the model are its "testing guidelines" which any investment must pass in order to be
implemented. In order to be acceptable, the proposed action must: (i) reinforce the ecological
succession; (ii) address the weakest link; (iii) deal with the causes of ecological degradation, rather
than with its symptoms; (iv) ensure the highest result for a given cost; (v) be sustainable (renewable
energy and self-generated capital); and (vi) be acceptable to the society and the culture. Project staff
has already begun to be trained in HRM.

Staff Recruitment
14    Staff recruitment would be phased according to a staffing defined by the project's Costab.
The Project Director, the financial management staff, the ECPG technical manager, six members of
the technical support teams, and 19 field extension agents have already been recruited under the
project's PPF. None of these being civil servants Additional financial management staff would be
recruited for effectiveness while Project regional coordinators, remaining EMAT staff and additional
field extension agents would start work immediately after credit effectiveness.  The further
recruitment of additional extension agents would follow the phasing of village incorporation by the
Agricultural Services project.
15    Recruitment for positions under the credit would be publicized and open to private, NGO
and government staff willing to separate from administrative service. Terms of reference have been
included in the Project Implementation Manual to be ready by negotiation. Minimal requirements
and selection criteria would be agreed upon by IDA and the Administrative and Financial
Department (DAF) of the MDRE. For purposes of implementing the Project (particularly regarding
the delkgations' civil servants involved in project implementation), the Borrower would employ and
maintain staff with qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to
IDA. In order to ensure effective staffing at the highest level, selection mechanisms, such as
"assessment centers" would be put in place with the participation of IDA staff. Remuneration of
contractual staff would be commensurate with the temporary scope of the contract, but should not
result in a disincentive to Government officers with similar qualifications and responsibilities.
Coordination with Other Projects and Programs
16    The proposed project would be closely coordinated with other similar or complementary
projects and programs. This coordination would not be limited to projects indicated below, but
would instead aim to establish effective linkages with all projects and NGOs operating within the
project area. Such coordination would strive to: (i) take advantage of the experience gained by IDA
and other donors' projects; (ii) build on the facilities and services (staff, equipment) available at field
level; and (iii) ensure that the village communities covered by the proposed project would have
access to services and inputs provided by other national programs, when available.
(a)   Aklg Lake and Tazant EU Project: This project is of particular importance to the
RNRMP since the European Union has agreed to carry out parallel financing in the
wilayas of Tagant, Brakna and part of the Trarza, under the single national level
management of the proposed IDA project, and using a similar methodology.
(b)   Apricultural Services Proiect. The objectives of both projects are complementary.
While the Agricultural Services Project extends productive technologies to individual
herders and farmers, NRM planning deals with the allocation of individual plots as
well as with the management of common land.  Both projects intervene
simultaneously at field level as the two elements of a single rural support program:
(i) RNRM's field staff would be housed in the Rural organization bureau (BOP) of
the Delegation, which is the operational base of the PSA; (ii) field activities of both



- 48 -
ANNEX 2
Page 7 of 7
projects would be planned at regional (Delegation) level, involving similar
personnel, (iii) their training programs, including monthly and fortnight training
sessions, would be established jointly and (iv) both projects would be implemented
in the field by the same single extension agent (AVB).
(c)   Household Energy Component (Cr. 2167-MAU) This project has made considerable
progress in implementing the demand, or urban, aspects of the strategy. Close
linkages will be established when designing the comprehensive domestic energy
strategy (SED) for Mauritania.
(d)    Urban Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Proiect: Although this project deals
with medium and large municipalities, and not with rural ones, it might lend support
in designing the process by which village land-use master plans are consolidated
within larger communal development plans (plans communaux indicatifs), a task for
which MDRE staff is not well prepared.
(e)   Inteeorated Development Program for Irrigated Agriculture, to be implemented in the
Senegal river valley, is under preparation. It will be closely coordinated with the
proposed project. Several important issues are common to both projects (herd
movements, fuelwood energy, intensive livestock production) and will be addressed
in a coordinated manner.
(f)    GIRNEM and PRADER both financed by Germany, have objectives and strategies
similar in many ways to those of the proposed project. The close relationships
established at the outset of project preparation will be pursued to the benefit of both.

INVESTMENT CHOICES AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A.    Introduction
1.    The project is based on a participatory approach which allows beneficiaries to select the
priority actions to be retained under the Community Investment Program (PIC), provided certain
selection criteria are adhered to. It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to quantify beforehand
the type, size and frequency of investments of choice which makes it impractical to estimate a
rate of return for the project as a whole.
2.    However, it is possible to design rural community models of the communities that are likely
to be found under the project; to make assumptions on their priority needs; to identify certain
investments that would respond to these priorities; to ascertain that these investments would fall
within the limits of the selection criteria; and to calculate a return on these investments. Using this
approach, it is possible to estimate a rate of return on the overall investment "package" for each
model.
3.    Three models have been developed: (a) a pastoral model, in which resources are almost
exclusively limited to livestock, and which is likely to be found in the driest parts of the project
area; (b) an agro-pastoral model, in which livestock activities are still preponderant but in which
cropping activities are already more important; and (c) an agro-sylvo -pastoral model, in which
in addition to livestock and cropping, forest and bush exploitation is an important activity. This
model is likely to be found in the wettest parts of the project area where forest and bush
Savannah are present.
4.    The models are summarized below. A description of the village is given; its main
problems are noted; a hypothetical choice of actions has been made; the investment are tested
against the eligibility criteria, and a cost/benefit analysis of the investment package has been
worked out.
1.    The Pastoral Model
Description of the Area
5.    The land area, which belongs to one or more villages, is predominantly used for
livestock grazing. Recession cultivation may occur on occasion, but occupies less than 5% of the
land.



-64-                                ANNEX8
Page 2 of 20
6.    The village(s) has (have) one or more wells, which serve only as water points for
livestock and for human consumption; no irrigation is practiced.
7.    The land area is located in the most arid part of the rainfed zone. Permanently residing
inhabitants number fewer than 300 families. Nomadic herders frequently use the grazing area as
well as existing wells. The area is generally overgrazed; fodder resources are scarce and wood
resources limited or non-existent.
Main Problems emerging from the analvsis
8.    Overgrazing of the land, and the resulting decline of fodder production capacity, raises
the problem of survival of the village. Free access to the land by nomadic herders without
limitations on grazing or use of well water has so far precluded any action.
9.    The village only produces a fraction of its food needs. Contour bunding would make it
possible to increase cropland production, but due to hilly terrain, bunds need to be stone
protected.
Moving sand dunes threaten to destroy village buildings and infrastructure.
Priority Actions Decided
10.   To initiate a pasture management program, in order to reduce overgrazing, improve
fodder production and eliminate conflicts between village inhabitants and nomadic herders. An
existing well will be repaired and deepened, and equipped with a windmill and water reservoir to
reduce watering (and grazing) time for nomadic herders. Herders, in turn agree to submit to
grazing rules and water charges.
11.   A tree and bush perimeter will be established to protect village infrastructure and
cropland from moving sand dunes, and to fix the dunes (anti-erosion works).
12.   Contour bunds will be built  and partly stone protected, to increase village food
production.
Elig'ibility Criteria Test
The limits that apply to this model are the following:
(a)   project financing limit: $ 100 per inhabitant, or $30,000 for the community.
(b)   investments in water supply (wells, boreholes, etc.) cannot exceed 60% of total
investment.



-65-                           ANNEX8
Page 3 of 20
(c)   water supply investments are to be shared between project and villagers in a
*800/o/20% ratio; land improvement, and erosion protection works in a 200/o/80%
ratio.
The investment tables (below) show that:
(a)   the overall investment would be about UM 6.1 million ($ 44,000), of which the
project would finance UM 3.3 million (24,000) or about 55%, which is below
the $30,000 limit for the community;
(b)   the water supply investment is estimated at UM 3.3 million, or 54% of the total
investment which is below the 60% limit;
(c)   project investment in water supply is UM 2.7 million ($19,000) or 81% of the
total water supply investment, which is at the 800/o/20% sharing limit; and
(d)   project investment in anti-erosion and land improvement works is UM  0.6
million, or 21 % of the total land works investment which is slightly above the
20%/80% sharing limit.
Economic Justification
13.   The cost/benefit tables below show that the internal rates of return for the three
investments are: 13% for water supply combined with pasture improvement; 20% for anti-
erosion works, and 11% for contour bunds. Labour costs in all these calculations have been
included. The overall return on the investment package is 12%.

PASTURE IMPROVEMENT: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
EXPLANATORY NOTES
It is assumed that the Rural Community is in the arid zone of the project area, and has about
5,000 hectares of grazing lands, with a grazing population of 1,500 cattle (of which 350 milk cows)
and a goat and sheep population of 4,500.
The main initial investment is to increase the water supply and accelerate water flow, in
order to enable the establishment of rotational grazing. To achieve this, the existing well will be
repaired and deepened; and a windmill with a water reservoir will be built. Furthernore, water
charges for well use will be introduced sufficient to pay for the operation and maintenance of the
water supply system.
In the without project situation, overgrazing would continue as a result of which, pasture
production capacity is assumed to decline from the present situation (outlined below) to about 60%
of its present level, with a proportionate decrease in animal off-take and milk production.
In the with project situation, output is expected to increase in five years to levels outlined
below. It is also assumed that all infrastructure works will be completed in one year and that
rotational grazing management will begin in year 2.

COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS: ANTI-EROSION WORKS OVER 4 HECTARE
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Size of the Perimeter
It is assumed, based on actual experience, that a bush and tree perimeter of about 30 meters
bandwidth would protect an area slightly less than 100 meters behind it. Based on this, a perimeter
of 4 hectare would protect an area of 120 hectare.
Infrastructure Protected
It is assumed that within the protected area, one well (present value 100,000 UM) and 15
buildings exist (present value 40,000 UM each). If protected, they would all be amortized in 10
years. Without protection, they would have to be abandoned after three years.
Cropland protected
It is assumed that, of the 120 hectare protected, 12 hectare is cropland with a present value of
10,000 UM per hectare. Without the project, the cropland would be lost after three years. No value
has been assigned to pasture land.

2.    The Agro -Pastoral model
Description ofArea
The land area is still predominantly used for grazing, but the scope for cropping (either
rainfed or as recession cultivation) is greater (between 5% and 10% of the area).
The land is in an area with more rainfall than in Model A, and the village(s) contain(s) more
permanent residents than under Model A (assumption: 500 inhabitants).
The village(s) has several wells that have however insufficient flow to cover the livestock
and human needs;
Main Problems emerging from the analysis
Nomadic herders use the grazing area, and conflicts among residents as well as between
residents and nomadic herders occur over the use of well water, which often is insufficient to cover
the needs of both cattle and the human population. Also, because of overgrazing, the rangeland is
degrading.
There is insufficient crop land for the subsistance needs of the community.  A potential
exists to expand the land under crops, but it would need a more secure retention of water flows
during the wet season
Priority Actions Decided
To alleviate the water and food production problems, three interventions have been decided
upon:
(a)   repair an deepening of an existing well, together with installation of a windmill and
water reservoir, in order to start a range management program and serve the water
needs of villagers and transhumants;
(b)   construction of three retention dikes with a system of contour bunds downstream, in
order to increase the area under recession cultivation;
(c)    deepening of one of the existing village wells, in order to establish a small irrigated
perimeter to cultivate fresh vegetables and fruits.
Eli-eibilitv Criteria Test
(a)    The overall investment for the community would amount to about 6.35 million UM
(S 45,600) of which the project would finance 4.6 million UM ($ 33,000) which is
well below the project financing limit for the community ($50,000);

Page 11 of 20
(b)   The water supply investments are estimated at 4.2 million UM ($30,000) or 62% of
the total investment, which is slightly above the 60% limit;
(c)   In order not to exceed the 80% project financing limit on water supply investments,
the community inhabitants would have to contribute 20% or 840,000 UM ($6,000)
to cover their part of the investment financing;
(d)    The land improvement works are estimated at 2.15 million UM ($15,000) of which
the project would finance 360,000 UM ($2,600) or 16% which is well below the
sharing limit of 20%.
Economic Justification
The investment tables below show that investments in the pasture well and improvement
program, in the retention dikes and contour bunds, and in the horticulture well and perimeter, would
have intemal rates of return of 13%, 10%, and 15% respectively. The overall internal rate of return
on the package (all labour costs included) is 13 %.

CONSTRUCTION OF RETENTION DIKE AND CONTOUR BUNDS OVER 15 HA.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Introduction
1.    A good deal of experience exists in Mauritania with the construction of retention dikes.
They serve to retain rainwater that would otherwise run off, thus permitting the sowing of a summer
crop (if the ground is only damp or of an autumn/winter crop (on residual moisture, once the water
retained has evaporated) where cropping would otherwise be impossible. Invariably, a grain crop is
sown (sorghum or millet), typically without the use of fertilizer. Yields are low, averaging about 0.6
tons per hectare.
2.    A great variety of retention dikes exists. The simplest are earthen contour bunds erected by
the farmers themselves with hand tools, which generally need to be repaired or rebuilt frequently.
The most sophisticated are dams with stone sidings and equipped with concrete spillways and
control gates, covering an area of up to 200 hectare and built by the Government or donor-financed
projects. Construction costs vary from 14,000 UM ($100) per hectare to up to 525,000 UM
($3,700) per hectare depending on design, topography and area covered.
3.    A sizable number of the more sophisticated type of dams have been built during or after the
drought years, or are under construction. Many have revealed themselves to be uneconomic, given
the high cost of construction in relation to the value of production obtained (gross value of grain
production: about 18,000 UM to 20,000 UM per hectare), and because they are beyond the capacity
of the local population to maintain, requiring continuous Government or donor intervention for
repair or rehabilitation.
Data on the example retained
4.    The dike for which the cost/benefit analysis has been made, is at the lower end of the
investment cost range (about $280 per hectare). It has been chosen because it is at the limit of
what the local population can build and maintain with manual labour (with some project help in the
form of tools and transport of stones). The assumptions are as follows:

ESTABLISHMENT OF HORTICULTURE PERIMETER OF ONE HECTARE
EXPLANATORY NOTES
I     The establishment of a horticulture perimeter of one hectare would necessitate the
following investments:
(a)   repair and deepening of an existing well valued at UM 1.5 million (see table)
(b)   construction, by manual means, of a reservoir to store well water for
irrigation: valued at UM 20,000;
(c)   purchase and installation of a metallic fence to protect the perimeter against
animal intrusion: 400 meters of fence at UM 300 per linear meter. Total cost:
UM 140,000;
(d)   purchase of tools and supplies (hoses, spraying cans, shovels, etc.): estimated
total cost: UM 40,000.
2.           Operating costs would consist of:
(a)   the purchase of vegetable seeds, estimated at 20% of the value of the finished
product (this was found to be the average on a sample of the most frequently
grown vegetables); and
(b)   maintenance of the perimeter, i.e., fence repair and replacement, purchase of
new tools, etc.: estimated at 15% of initial purchase cost annually, or UM
30,000 per annum at full development.
3.          The following assumptions have been made:
(a)   the well would provide sufficient water to irrigate one hectare. In reality,
horticultural perimeters are smaller (about one third of a hectare), but the
well -- usually located within the village-- also serves the villagers' potable
water needs and only one third of its production is used for perimeter
irrigation;
(b)   the most commonly grown vegetables are: mint, tomatoes, carrots, onions,
cabbage and eggplant. Overall production has been conservatively valued at
10 tons per hectare, with a production value of UM 80 per kilo;
(c)   vegetable gardening would almost exclusively be carried out by village
women, who would not be otherwise employed; labor costs have therefore
been excluded..
(d)   the useful life of the investment has been estimated at ten years.

3.    The Svlvo -Agro -Pastoral Model
Description of Area
The village land area is typically located in the more humid part of the rainfed zone. It is
still mostly used for livestock grazing, but existing or potential cropland covers more than 10% of
the area. Also, bush and woodlands are important, and a classified forest of 1,500 hectare is located
near the village.
The village(s) is (are) larger than under model B (model assumption: 800 inhabitants) and
inhabitants are generally permanent residents; few nomadic herders cross the area, but the village is
close to cattle routes.
Water is usually available in sufficient quantity for human and livestock needs. However,
the extension of cropland is limited (and even existing cropland is losing topsoil) due to rapid runoff
of rainwater,
Main Problems emergin2 from the Analysis
The impossibility of expanding crop cultivation and declining crop yields are hampering
village growth and causing emigration to the cities.
Increasingly, charcoalers are coming into the area to harvest trees for charcoal making, and a
depletion of wood resources is beginning-to be felt, leading to increased social tensions;
The village has women's associations engaged in handicrafts, which would require training
(to improve product quality) and funding (to permit better marketing).
Priority Actions Decided
In order to expand the cultivated area: construction of a dam with spillway, and a system of
contour bunds and terraces would be needed
In order to arrest and reverse the yield decline on existing cropland, anti-erosion contour
bund (digues filtrantes) would have to be constructed;
In order to halt unregulated exploitation of the woodlands: a woodland protection and
management program would be initiated for the classified forest, and a rural market for charcoal
would be established
Women's associations would be assisted in contacting and financing training facilities, and a
rollover fund of 700,000 UM for association marketing activities would be established
A women's association would be formed to operate a cooperative grain mill, which the
project would finance (cost: 1.4 million UM, or $10,000)



-80 -
Page 18 of 20
Eligibilitv Criteria Test
(a)   the total investment for the community would amount to  15.6 million UM
($111,400) of which the project would finance 4.8 million UM ($33,000) which is
well below the project financing limit of $80,000. The investment cost breaks down
as follows: (1) woodland protection and management: 7.2 million UM; (2) retention
dikes with contour bunds over 135 ha.: 5.13 million UM; (3) anti-erosion bunds over
120 ha.: 1.2 million UM; (4) grain mill: 1.4 million UM; and (5) rollover fund: 0.7
million UM.
(b)   observing the sharing limits, the project would contribute 20% of the cost of the land
improvement works, equivalent to 2.7 million UM; and 100% of the cost of the
grain mill and of the rollover fund, equivalent to 2.1 million UM.
Economic Justification
The cost/benefit calculations show that the intemal rates of return of the woodlands
protection, the retention dikes worth contour bunds, and the anti-erosion bunds would be 15%, 13%
and 13% respectively. The overall return on the package would be 14%. A return on the grain mill
has not been calculated but its main benefit would be savings in women's' working time; these
investments have been shown to be popular in similar projects throughout the Sahel.

ANTI-EROSION BUNDS ON EXISTING CROPLAND
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Introduction
Anti-erosion bunds of the filtrating type (digues filtrantes) serve to slow rainwater runoff during
the wet season impeding runoff of topsoil and increasing the deposit of sediments on the cropland. Usually
constructed of earth with e vegetative cover, their main beneficial effect is to increase soil fertility, thereby
increasing yields. Experience in other Sahel countries points to an average yield increase of 20% if the
bunds are well maintained. Even though the vegetative cover is done with drought resistant plants, such
bunds would only survive in the wetter parts of Mauritania (rainfall over 450 mm/year).
Investment cost
It is estimated that the establishment of bunds costs 20 UM per linear meter (virtually all in the
form of labour), and that a 20 meter spacing is required to maintain efficiency (500 linear meters per
hectare). In the model, it is assumed that they would be established over 120 hectares, over 3 years (30
hectares in year 1, 40 hectares in year 2 and the remaining 50 hectares in year 3). The resulting
investment cost totals 1.2 million um over three years.
Maintenance
It is estimated that maintenance would be 20% of investment cost each year (especially in
reestablishing vegetative cover). This would amount to 2,000 UM per hectare of finished bunds per year.
Benefits
Present average yields of sorghum are 600 kglha/year, valued at 30 UM/kg. A 20% increase would
amount to 120 kg./ha, or a total gross value of incremental production of 3,600 UM/ha. Incremental labour
costs (mostly harvesting) are valued at 20% of incremental production, or 720 UM/ha. The average life of
bunds, assuming continued maintenance, is estimated at 15 years.
Under these conditions, the internal rate of return on the investment would be 13%.

WOODLANDS PROTECTION AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Introduction
The total area to be protected and manged would cover 1,200 hectare eventually.
Actions would consist of (a) delimiting the woodlands borders; (b) fencing and gating of
main entry points and access roads; (c) improvement of forest paths and establishing fire alleys;
(d) guarding the perimeter; and (e) managed grazing and cutting within the perimeter.
The prerequisite to this program would be that a contract will be signed and approved
between the administration, the charcoalers and the village authorities that the forest would be
for the exclusive use by the villagers, with forest management guidance by the administrative
authorities and strict cutting limits for the charcoalers.
Investment Cost
Investment costs are roughly estimated at 6,000 UM per hectare, of which 4,000 UM per
hectare would be for putting up fencing and gates. The remaining costs would be virtually all in
the form of labour; only an expense of 45,000 UM would be for the purchase of hand tools.
Benefits
A direct benefit of the operation would be the exclusive use of the perimeter by the
villagers for managed grazing and wood cutting. The gross value of production is estimated, on
an annual basis, at 1000 kg/ha of fodder (sales price: 2 UM/kg.) and 0.6 cubic meters of
wood/hectare (sales price: 3 UMlkg).
The main direct benefit, however, would be in the preservation of the woodlands;
without the protection and management program, and a continuation of unlimited cutting, it is
estimated that within 10 years, the production value would decline to 20% of its present value.
The environmental benefits would also be substantial, in the form of lower losses of
topsoil and maintenance of plant diversity in the forest as well as on forest grazing lands. In the
absence of reliable data, however, these benefits have not been quantified.
On the basis of the direct benefits alone. the internal rate of return of the protection and
management program is estimated at 15%.
