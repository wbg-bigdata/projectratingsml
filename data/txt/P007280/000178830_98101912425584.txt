Indigenous Sources of Enerpy
1.01      Haiti's exploitable indigenous energy resources are very limited and
are restricted to hydro power and some coal (lignite). The only sites suitable
for development of hydroelectric plant of reasonable size are located down-
stream from the existing 47 MW Peligre plant, Electricite d'Haiti's (EdH's)
only large hydro station. However, a recently completed study of the country's
hydro resources, financed by the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA), concludes that the total installed capacity would not exceed 80 MW
and it should also be noted that competing demand for water from the Peligre
reservoir for irrigation purposes could further limit the capacity of down-
stream hydro developments.  A survey of the most promising site is underway,
financed by CIDA. The CIDA-financed study also indicates that several small
hydro plants, ranging from 100 kW to some 3,000 kW, could be constructed on
various rivers. Including these, the total hydro potential that would be
technically feasible for addition to Haiti's power system would not exceed
some 100 MW in capacity and 250 GWh in energy, and economic factors might
bring this potential down to lower levels.
1.02      One lignite field of reasonable size at Maissade and a small field
at Camp Perrin were identified, under a recently completed UNDP-financed
sector study. The preliminary survey of Maissade indicates the possibility
of recoverable reserves of some 15 Mt, sufficient to operate a 120-MW thermal
power station for about 25 years but the lignite would probably not be suitable
for briquetting and use as domestic fuel because its sulphur content is
excessive. At Camp Perrin the lignite is of better quality but, in view of
the small size of the reserves (some 0.1 Mt), development in limited quantities
would be only of local interest and restricted to labor intensive mining and
briquetting methods. A request for financing by the Federal Republic of
Germany is under consideration (4.03) for the final survey of both fields.
This would include a study of the measures for, and the costs of, mining the
lignite in quantities suitable for fueling a thermal power station at Maissade
and investigate further the feasibility of using the lignite for domestic
purposes. An additional study would be required, once a prefeasibility study
is available on the hydro developments downstream from Peligre, to define the
least cost program for generation, taking into account both the potential
hydro plants and the lignite-fired plant and to prepare project final feasi-
bility reports.
1.03      Charcoal is used extensively for domestic and small industrial
purposes; highly valued trees, e.g., mahogany, are felled for its production.
The quantity of charcoal consumed in the country was estimated at some 55,000 t
in 1975, equivalent to ab ut 440,000 m3 of wood, and the quantity of wood used
domestically at some 2 Mm . L/  It is clear that the widespread use of wood as
an energy source has had disastrous consequences: a large part of the country
1/   Based on information of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations the World Bank Caribbean Energy Survey draft report
estimates Iaiti's 1977 gross energy use at some 55 x 101 Btu.  Assuming
a 25% efficiency for both petroleum products and hydro generation and 10%
for wood and sugarcane waste (bagasse), end-use would be in the order
of 7.5 x 1012 Btu. Wood would account for the largest proportion (46%)
of this total, followed by petroleum products (28%), bagasse (21%) and
hydro (5%).

has already been denuded of trees; land erosion is progressing rapidly; consid-
erable areas of once fertile land have been stripped of soil; and siltation of
the Peligre reservoir has considerably exceeded the original estimates.
1.04      The siltation 3of the multipurpose Peligre reservoir has increased
3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
markediy to some f.5 Mmn la compared with the original estimate of about
3.5 Mm /a 3and, consequently, the useful volume has declined from about 450 Mm
to 350 Mm , as indicated in the CIDA-financed hydro resource study (1977). It
is estimated that both irrigation and power production would be curtailed severely
within the next five years unless corrective measures are taken and the Govern-
ment has assigned the highest priority to the completion of a final siltation
study.  UNDP (Port-au-Prince) has agreed to finance this study (estimated to a
cost US$350,000 and to be completed in about 9 months), for which the Bank will
be executing agency.
1.05      Haiti is wholly dependent on oil imports, in the form of derivates
since the country has no refinery. The estimated 1977 consumption was 1.55
Mbbl, of which 24% was consumed by the bauxite and cement factories, 22-25% by
other industries, 5% by EdH, 20-25% by transport, 8% by aviation, and the
remaining 13-21% by others including some 2% in gas and 3% in kerosene for
household purposes. Although surveys have indicated the possibility of some
off-shore oil, exploratory efforts have, so far, been unsuccessful, and there
is little likelihood that significant oil fields will be found in the foresee-
able future.
Sector Organization and Regulation
1.06      EdH, an autonomous Government agency, is the sole entity responsible
for power supply in Haiti. It was established in 1971 to take over the Govern-
ment-owned Peligre hydro plant and the privately owned Compagnie d'Eclairage
Electrique of Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien whose concession expired that
year. In 1974, it was also entrusted with the operation of various isolated
power facilities in the provinces, mostly Government-owned.
1.07      The authority to regulate the power sector is vested in the President
of the Republic of Haiti and exercised through key officials who also form
EdH's Board of Directors (2.03). There is no separate regulatory body as such,
and EdH's 1971 decree, as amended in 1977, states that tariffs, as well as
investment programs and borrowings, are to be approved by the President of the
Republic (with the advice of the Board).
IDA Participation in the Sector
1.08      In 1976, the Association made its first Credit (645-HA, MUS$16.0)
for power development in Haiti, covering the first part (1976-1978) of a
two-stage power development program for 1976-1981; the beneficiary was EdH.
The decision to carry out this program in two stages resulted from constraints
in the availability of both IDA funds and counterpart funds and the desire to
strengthen EdH before undertaking larger investments.



1.09      The main objectives of the first project were technical and institu-
tional in order to provide a sound basis for a long term development program.
Haiti has a history of power shortages (which were alleviated during 1971-76
after the completion of the 47-MW hydro station at Peligre) and poor supply
conditions due to obsolete facilities. EdH lacked managerial, technical and
administrative skills, as well as the financial independence necessary to assure
a rational development of the power sector. Technically, the first project
addressed the need to promptly instaLl 20 MW additional diesel generating
capacity in a new power station, as well as new facilities to transmit this
power to consumers, particularly industry. Institutionally, EdH was to be
reorganized and freed from unnecessary Government interference while technical
assistance was to be provided for engineering and for supervision and training
of EdH personnel.
1.10      The execution period for the first power project was not long
enough to allow for the realization of all the associated institutional
objectives. The physical project items and institutional objectives were
executed as follows:
(a)  EdH implemented the agreed organizational changes, and, although
experienced staff is still lacking, the various departments operate
reasonably well. With the help of consultants, particularly in
technical matters, EdH is expected to continue to improve gradually.
(b)  A number of engineers, accountants and, technicians were trained
substantially as envisioned under the first project. A training
center was constructed for lower level technicians, and training
started in August 1978 although the necessary training equipment
only arrived recently with a delay of some 9 months.
(c)  A new tariff structure and rates were instituted as planned
in Port-au-Prince and in the provinces. This, coupled with
improvements in operating efficiencies, has resulted in
strengthening EdH's financial position.
(d)  The new 20-MW diesel power station was completed in June 1978,
about 15 months late (5 MW were scheduled for completion in
March 1977); the delay had serious repercussions upon the eco-
nomy, which were compounded by the fact that the 1976-77 dry
season (November through April) was exceptionally dry and too
much water was released from the Peligre reservoir early in
the season. Although restrictions could not have been avoided
completely, up to half of them could have been avoided if the
consortium in charge of contract execution had performed in
accordance with the schedule. Serious problems have affected
the output of the Varreux powerstation, mainly due to poor
performance on the part of the consortium and it appears that
the station availability may be substantially below the con-
tractual value at the time of final commissioning. EdH is
making efforts to cause the consortium to remedy the existing
problems.
(e) The transmission facilities have been completed substantially
on schedule.

1.11      The Bank acted as executing agency for a UNDP-financed sector
study, completed in 1978, which provided the necessary background informa-
tion for the formulation of the development program upon which the second
project is based.
The Need for Standardization of Specifications
1.12      The existing supply system in Haiti is based on American standards
and practices.  The frequency is 60 Hz and the supply voltages are:
-    High voltage;  115 kV (Peligre - Port-au-Prince)
-    Medium tension voltage:  12.47/7.2 kV and 4.16/2.4 kV
-    Low tension voltage:  120/240 V - 3 wire, single phase, and some
120/208 V 4-wire, three phase - small transformers are used and
lines are short in principle, although not always in practice
(4.08).
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) has introduced, with the agreement of
EdH, the European type of network at Cap Haitien and in the Gonaives area.
The subtransmission voltage is 23 kV, substations have 3-phase, large trans-
formers and distribution lines are long and operate at 120/208 V 4-wire
and design principles are different, particularly with respect to the use
of a neutral conductor for both high and low tension, and grounding. Although
the frequency of 60 Hz has been maintained, IDA has expressed concern about
the differences with the above specifications which this system introduces.
The principles of standardization are not adhered to which also causes dupli-
cations with respect to procurement and stocking. This underscores the need
to coordinate investment programs in the sector (4.18).
Power Market
1.13      Statistical data with respect to the various consumer categories
were not available until 1972 for Port-au-Prince and mid-1977 for the
provinces. Generation, consumption and losses (Attachment 3/1) are as
follows:

The notable features of this development are that: (a) industry's share
of the market increased from about 30% to about half of total consumption;
(b) losses for Port-au-Prince declined rapidly to about 24% in 1977 (3.03);
and (c) the provinces account for only about 7% of total generation.
1.14      Compared to other countries in the region and elsewhere, the propor-
tion of Haiti's population with access to electric power service is extremely
low. By the end of 1977, EdH had about 50,000 customers, of whom about 10,000
were in the provinces. Assuming that there are five persons per family among
the 680,000 inhabitants of Port-au-Prince, connection density in this area
would be only about 29%. Access to electricity in the country as a whole (some
4.7 million inhabitants) is a mere 5%. The percentage of the urban population
(some 1.1 million) with access to electricity is about 23%. Even among those
connected to the electric supply system, the distribution of energy consumption
is very uneven; for instance in Port-au-Prince, nearly half of EdH's residen-
tial consumers (about 40% of the total consumers) account for only about 2%
of total consumption (3.04) whereas the industrial and commercial consumers
account for nearly 60%. The average per capita consumption in 1977 probably
did not exceed 50 kWh, of which about 40 kWh corresponds to public services
and 10 kWh to captive plant (respectively, 28 kWh/capita and 8 kWh/capita
in 1974). The low level of connection density and of consumption may be
attributed to the extreme poverty of the population: with a per capita GNP
of US$232 in 1977, Haiti is the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere
and one of the 30 poorest in the world.
Captive Plant
1.15      Little information is available on captive plant capacities and
generation. There are three known large, privately owned, captive power
plants. Ciment d'Haiti has an installed capacity of 11,000 kW (50 Hz), which



- 6 -
is being retired and replaced by 6,500 kW in diesel plant and a steam turbine
of 6,500 kW. The HASCO sugar factory has an installed capacity of 2,250
kW, and the Minoterie d'Haiti, a flour mill, owns about 1,000 kW in diesel
plant. During the drought of 1977 (3.01), about 6,000 kW in small plants
were imported, including units for domestic use, but their present location is
only partially known. In addition to the above plants, a number of small
captive plants have been installed all over the country, but no information is
available on their location, or capacities. A rough estimate may set captive
plant capacity at some 20-25 MW.
Electrification of Provincial Towns and Rural Areas
1.16      Because of financial constraints, EdH has a rather limited program
of village electrification and does not yet have a program to accelerate
connections to low-income households; only recently has EdH started to
generate internal funds toward its expansion program.  These financial
constraints, coupled with the fact that priority should be given to the
replacement of EdH's obsolete facilities in order to allow for expansion
beyond the fringes of the networks, indicate that a comprehensive rural/low
income electrification policy probably cannot be implemented within the next
three to five years.  A modest program of rehabilitation in the provinces is
being financed by KfW in Cap Haitien and the area of Gonaives, while the
proposed project also includes a modest program for three small towns. In
the short term, i.e., up to 5 years, a rural/low-income electrification
program would have to depend largely upon concessionary external financing
and even then would be limited by EdH's ability to generate internal cash to
meet local cost.
Sector Investment Program
1.17      The Government has not developed a formal electrification policy,
largely because of a lack of staff with expertise in the sector (2.05).
1.18      EdH's 1978-1983 development program is described in Chapter 4.
The CIDA grant and KfW loan would finance part of this program in parallel
with IDA and with funds from the Special Action Account of the Member States
of the European Economic Community (EEC) for which IDA would act as Administ-
rator. Together these funds would be sufficient to finance about 3 years of
the power development program. Consequently, expansion in the provinces,
where access to electricity is low, can be accelerated and the renewal of
distribution networks in Port-au-Prince can be stepped up. After completion
of the second project, EdH's investment priorities through 1985 would be (a) a
further increase of its generating capacity in Port-au-Prince; (b) renewal of
the remaining distribution networks in Port-au-Prince; (c) expansion in the
provinces; and (d) preparation of the construction of an additional hydro
plant and of a lignite fired thermal plant.



-.7-
Tariffs and Rates
1.19      In 1976, EdH implemented a simplified tariff structure in Port-au-
Prince, calculated in accordance with the principle of marginal costing, but
modified to allow social pricing below a certain level of consumption for low
income families and small industrial and commercial consumers. A fuel cost
adjustment clause was implemented at the same time to allow for fuel price
changes as well as an adjustment clause to take into account variations in the
cost of salaries and materials. These tariffs were extended to the provinces
in 1977 so that tariffs and rates are now uniform throughout the country.
The existing tariffs would be adjusted as necessary to meet the financial
rate of return objectives covenanted in the agreements of the First Power
Credit.
1.20      The social part of the rate is reflected in the residential charge
of USd5.5/kWh for consumption below 30 kWh/m. The next 30 kWh/m are charged
at USt6.6 and any excess at USJ7.3/kWh. The minimum monthy bill is US$1.65.
Because 40% of all consumers have a monthly consumption below 40 kWh (Attach-
ment 3/2; statistics for 30 kWh/m or less are not available), a strong social
cross-subsidization is apparent in the existing tariffs. An even stronger
cross-subsidization exists for the supply in the provinces since revenues of
USd5.5/kWh for residential consumption below 30 kWh/m do not even cover the
cost of fuel (estimated at USJ5.8/kWh generated). Because the supply in the
provinces at present accounts for onLy 7% of the total, the subsidy does not
yet pose an undue financial burden oni EdH. However, as a result of the
uniform rate setting, growth in the provinces has accelerated rapidly (30%
growth in provincial sales is expected for 1978) and EdH will have to monitor
carefully the revenue-versus-cost situation in the provinces as compared
with that in Port-au-Prince so that a reasonable balance of relative cross-
subsidization can be maintained.
2. THE BENEFICIARY
Institutional Framework
2.01      The beneficiary of the proposed IDA Credit of MUS$16.5 and the EEC
special credit of MUS$6, would be Edli, an autonomous government-owned
agency, established by presidential ,lecree in 1971 (1.06) as a corporate
entity whose president is the Presideant of the Republic. The decree speci-
fies that, for ordinary transactions ("travaux ordinaires"), the president
delegates his authority to the Minis ter of Public Works, Communications and
Transport who is the chairman of EdH's Board of Directors.
2.02      The 1971 decree establishing EdH and subsequent amendments thereto
state that the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
constitute a State monopoly to be exercised through EdH. Notwi.hstanding
these broad powers, EdH's activities until 1974 were confined to the opera-
tion of the Peligre hydro electric complex and the diesel facilities in



- 8 -
Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien because any additional activity would have
overtaxed the company's administrative and technical capacity. Facilities
in the provinces continued to be constructed and operated by private enti-
ties, municipalities and other Government agencies (primarily the Institute
for Agricultural and Industrial Development and the Ministry of Public
Works, Communications and Transport). In 1974, EdH began systematically to
assume control of all the public service facilities in the country; it now
operates isolated diesel systems in about 10 provincial towns.
2.03      Policy directives at EdH are set by its (ex-officio) President
and exercised through key officials -- the Minister of Public Works, Com-
munications and Transport; the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs; the
Minister of Commerce and Industry and the President/Director General of the
Central Bank. Together with EdH's General Manager, these four officials
constitute the company's Board of Directors, with the Minister of Public
Works, Communications and Transport serving as Chairman. No sector regu-
latory agency exists as such; therefore, as is the case for policy formula-
tion, authority for regulating EdH is vested in the Presidency and exercised
through the key officials on its Board of Directors. The strong governmental
representation in the regulation and direction of EdH has, on the whole,
worked satisfactorily. The Board has confined itself to approval of EdH's
major investment plans, tariffs, borrowings and broad policies, and the
General Manager has had, in practice, a reasonable degree of autonomy in
directing the company's daily operations.
Organization and Management
2.04      EdH is organized along functional lines (Attachment 2/1).  The
company's Chief Operating Officer is the General Manager who is appointed
by the President. The General Manager is assisted in his duties by three
directors for technical operations, planning and administration, all of
whom are appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Board of
Directors.  Prior to the Association's involvement with EdH, the company's
management at the top was very thin. It had only a Director for Administra-
tion, responsible for administrative and financial operations. There were
no directors for technical operations and planning and, by default, these
functions were exercised by the General Manager. This arrangement was
unusual even for a utility of EdH's size. The General Manager had to devote
a great deal of effort to day-to-day operational problems which left him
insufficient time to attend to broader and longer range needs of the company.
As part of the agreements for the First Power Project, EdH appointed Direc-
tors for Planning and for Technical Operations. While it is too early to
evaluate the impact of these two appointments on EdH's operations, it is
expected that they will lead to noticeable improvements.
2.05      EdH continues to be a relatively small organization with about 750
employees (about 1 employee per 67 consumers) of which about 200 are in the
provinces). Notwithstanding the recent appointments of Technical and Planning
Directors and a Budgeting Officer, it still lacks sufficient depth in manager-
ial, technical and administrative skills. This lack typifies the country's
scarcity of personnel with sufficient knowledge of, and experience in, the



- 9 -
power sector. EdH's salaries are modest, some US$500-1,000/month for an
engineer or well qualified accountant. Since the country lacks the facili-
ties to provide the higher qualified people, EdH itself has to train lower
echelon staff on the job and through training courses outside the country,
for which IDA provides assistance (4.24). Turnover appears reasonably small,
which may in part be due to the requirement that higher level trainees are
contractually obliged to remain in EdH for up to 5 years after completing
their training. In view of this situation, the usual requirement that a pub-
lic utility should have an enlightened and stable leadership becomes even
more compelling in EdH's case.  To ensure such leadership, agreements relating
to the First Power Project required that EdH would maintain a General Manager,
an Administrative Director and a Technical Director whose qualifications were
satisfactory to the Association. This covenant has been repeated in the pro-
posed agreements, extended to include the Director for Planning and Dispatch
(appointed under the first credit agreement), who would be largely responsible
for the execution of the project.
2.06      EdH's provincial operations function essentially as local branches
of the Port-au-Prince system. All billing as well as accounting for the
provincial customers is done at Port-au-Prince. Except for Cap Haitien,
all collections in the provinces are made on EdH's behalf by the National
Bank. Furthermore, there are no regional warehouses, and, therefore, all
requisitions for materials are referred to Port-au-Prince for processing.
While this mode of operation in the provinces does not yet present undue
difficulties -- the provinces account for only about 7% of EdH's operations
and to decentralize them would probably not be cost effective -- it is most
likely that the current organization of the provincial offices and their
working relationships with headquarters will be inadequate to cope with the
expected growth in their level of operations. For this reason, EdH has
agreed to study the organization of its regional operations and to submit
recommendations for modifying them, if found necessary, for the Association's
review not later than December 31, 1979 and implementation thereafter.
Accounting, Information Systems and Audit
2.07      Before the Association's involvement with the first power project,
EdH's accounting systems, financial p-Lanning, budgeting and management
reporting had been deficient. In the course of preparation of the First
Power Project, consultants - Howell and Co. (USA) - were engaged to prepare
a new accounting system and budgeting and control procedures and to train
EdH staff to use them. A new chart of accounts, based on the FPC Class A
system, has been successfully implemented at EdH.  Furthermore, a competent
budgeting officer was appointed, resulting in a definite improvement in
financial organization; timely budgets are now being prepared. The company
continues to lack, however, adequate financial planning, management report-
ing and internal control systems. Although it has recently appointed an
internal auditor, no internal audit is presently performed of its accounts,
cash and inventory management. To strengthen its capabilities in these fields
EdH has agreed to engage the services of suitable consultants not later than
September 30, 1979 to study the existing procedures and to make recommenda-
tions for improving them and submit the results for review to the Associa-
tion. The recommendations would be implemented by March 31, 1980.



- 10 -
2.08      Since 1976, EdH's financial accounts have been audited by Price
Waterhouse and Co., and their reports have been transmitted to the Association.
The agreements for the second project should repeat provisions requiring EdH
to engage the services of qualified external auditors to review its accounts
yearly and to submit audited financial statements to the Association within
four months of the close of its fiscal year.
2.09      EdH has no comprehensive retirement plan for its employees at pre-
sent. According to current legislation, public autonomous agencies without
a private pension plan must contribute to the Office Nationale d'Assurance
(ONA), a state-owned insurance company. EdH employees contribute 3% of their
salaries to ONA, and this amount is matched by an equivalent contribution from
EdH. The benefits paid by ONA under present arrangements cannot exceed the
accumulated face value of the combined EdH/employee contributions.  ONA's
pension plan is thus less favorable than those offered by most of the private
insurance companies in which EdH can legally participate. Not only is an
adequate pension plan necessary to attract qualified personnel, but also its
absence is a disincentive to retirement when due. With IDA encouragement,
EdH is executing a feasibility study for establishing an appropriate pension
fund.

3. THE POWER MARKET
Historical Data and Existing Power Facilities
3.01      Since the commissioning of the Peligre hydro station in 1971 sales
grew from 56.5 GWh in that year to 126.8 GWh in 1976 (Attachment 3/1), or an
average of about 18% per year. A sharp slowdown occurred in 1977, when sales
grew by only 3.8% (to 136 GWh) because of inadequate generating capacity
during the dry season (November-April), the installation of captive plant by
consumers (1.15) and the higher average rates (5.04). Compared with the fore-
cast of 153.1 GWh for that year, the shortfall was about 17 GWh. Assuming
that the forecast had been somewhat optimistic by about 5 GWh, the direct
effects of the curtailments can be estimated at 12.5 GWh, i.e., some 9-10%
of requirement during the year could not be met, on average, by then existing
generating facilities.
3.02      The growth figures for each of the consumer classes (1.13) have been
highly erratic as shown below:
Growth in Sales
(%)
1973    1974    1975    1976    1977
Residential               21.9    17.6       6.0    32.0    -4.0
Industrial                46.0    43.8    21.7    23.2        9.6
Commercial                -2.8   -35.3    15.1    17.2        5.2
Public Lighting           25.0    48.6    17.3    16.4    -5.6
Others                      9.3     6.8      4.8    -1.5      9.2
Total                      23.0    18.4    14.3    23.3       3.8
In part, the information is unreliable because, up to 1976 when the new tariff
structure and rates were instituted, no clear distinction had been made between
residential and the smaller industrial and commercial consumers. Even the 1977
figures show errors in this respect. Any combination of these groups, however,
still shows the same erratic pattern, which makes forecasting extremely diffi-
cult. No reasonably reliable data, except for 1977, are available for the
provinces.
3.03      Losses, including thefts, have also been erratic and consistently
high, peaking at 42% of generation in 1973. Since then, EdH took adequate
measures to reduce losses, particularly through policing of unregistered
connections and checking the operation of meters. As a result, losses declined
to about 24% in 1976 and 1977, which is lower than the 28% target established
under the first project. Because losses are presently increasing again, EdH
is now preparing a program for at least doubling the policing crew. All



- 13 -
house connections will be checked systematically, meter installations will
be improved and standardized (defective meters replaced and calibrated);
consumption patterns for individual cornections will be monitored and the
existing practice of making random checks on illegal connections will be
stepped up; data will be gathered for statistical monitoring of the results.
This effort should result in further improvements in EdH's finances since a
reduction in thefts equivalent to 4% of: generation, represents revenue of
MUS$0.6-0.7/a, or some 6% of its present revenue. Because of improper con-
ductor size, overly long lines and poor maintenance practices, the network
is in bad condition. Line losses in the distribution network itself are
therefore very high, although difficult: to estimate. EdH has set a target
of reducing losses to about 20% by 1980/81.
3.04      A special feature of the EdH supply to consumers is the fact that
of the 36,624 consumers in Port-au-Prince in 1976, about 40% were responsible
for only about 2% of total sales (132 GWh, Attachment 3.2). This reflects
the poorness of the average residentia-L consumer and indicates the high level
of cross-subsidization. Their monthly average bill probably barely covers
amortization of the the capital cost of the house connection and the meter,
let alone similar cost of the network, generating plant and operational cost.
3.05      EdH's power supply problems in 1977 were attributable to the
obsolescence of its "Old Power Station"' in which 12 units, aggregating about
14 MW, are, on the average, 29 years old (some were constructed in 1942, and
the average operating hours per unit exceed 100,000). Effective capacity
for short-term purposes is about 5.5 M14, of which 2.5 MW is supplied by the
only dependable diesel unit, installed in 1970. Before 1970 the last installa-
tion was made in 1956. At the height of the 1977 drought (3.01) the Govern-
ment, in an emergency action, procured 20 MW in diesel capacity, cf which 10 MW
were reliable medium-speed diesels and 10 MW were high speed diesels suitable
only for peaking and emergency purposes. Of these emergency sets 10 MW were
installed in the old power station and the other 10 MW in the Delmas substa-
tion. Under the first IDA project, a new power station was constructed at
Varreux in the industrial area of Port-au-Prince. EdH's installed capacities
in Peligre, Port-au-Prince and in the provinces are shown in detail in Attach-
ment 3/3 and summarized below:
Capacity (MW)
Installed     Effective

- 14 -
3.06      The situation in the provinces is as unreliable as it was in Port-
au-Prince until recently. Most of the units are old; the few new diesel
installations are for high speed operation and, therefore, are not suitable
for continuous operation for public supply; furthermore, they are badly main-
tained. Replacement by appropriate new units is required which, however, would
have little effect without an adequate training program for the diesel operators.
Such a program was started in September 1978 at the recently completed training
school (1.10) and will be accelerated. All plants in the provinces use diesel
oil for fuel. Jacmel is the only town presently supplied by a hydro plant of
200 kW, assisted by a diesel plant of 870 kW.
Forecasts
3.07      During the first project, EdH consultants prepared an elaborate sales
forecast for each consumer class in Port-au-Prince. Actual figures can be
compared with this forecast as follows in GWh:
Public
Year  Residential   Industrial   Commercial         Li&hting       Others         Total

Using the sum of forecast and of actual sales as an indication of the compounded
errors, the preceding table shows that the forecast for commercial and "other"
supplies has been reasonably correct. Residential requirements appear to have
been considerably underestimated and industry and public lighting similarly
overestimated, even taking into account that, in 1977, curtailment may have
averaged about 10%.  However, it should be noted that some small industrial and
commercial connections were still included in the 1977 residential category (of
which consumption may have been as high as 7-8 GWh). Shifting 7 GWh from resi-
dential to industrial consumption, the difference, therefore, in total forecast
and actual supply (71.9 GWh) can be explained largely by the difference in
forecast and actual supply for industry (82.6-7 = 75.6 GWh).
3.08      The 1975 forecast assumed that 11.3 MW of industrial installed capa-
city would be connected in addition to 1.8 MW in pumping and 0.9 MW for hotels
and a satellite station. However, only 6.7 MW were connected as detailed below:

3.09      A field investigation showed that the industrial loads expected to
be connected in the next two years may be about 2,500 kW, comprising some
25 factories varying in capacity requirements from 10 kW to 200 kW. However,
uncertainties in plant completion are large; as indicated in the preceding
paragraph, actual connections of smaller industries exceeded the forecast by a
wide margin. During appraisal, an effort was made to reclassify those small
commercial and industrial customers still included in residential consumption.
It was concluded from this effort that only the forecasts for industrial and
public lighting needed adjustment. Also, small (up to 40 kW) and larger
industries (over 45 kW) were separated with respect to GWh supply, as was done
for the 1975 forecast. The major difference between the 1975 forecast and the
revised forecasts prepared by the consultants are summarized below:

Balances). It was assumed that all obsolete diesels in the old power station
would be retired in 1979 in view of their unreliability and their high mainte-
nance and operational costs. The diesels now installed temporarily in the
Delmas substation could be moved to the old power station but no plans have
been made yet because network connection would require substantial investments.
The main conclusions following from the attachments are:
(a) Growth of sales would average 13.5%/a, compared with 16.4%/a
during 1972-77; maximum demand would grow commensurately (11.6%/a)
with generation (11.2%/a) due to expected gradual reduction both in
losses and in the load factor. By 1983 industrial plant would
account for almost 70% of total sales;
(b) Energy capabilities would be ample throughout the period,
even in dry years except for the time peak demand cannot be
met due to lack of capacity as explained in (c) below;
(c) During an average hydrological year and with reserves of 9.4 MW
required in the Varreux power station, from 1981 onward there
would be some capacity in excess of requirements. A managable
(by reducing voltage) deficit not exceeding 5 MW could occur
in 1981/82 if these years would be exceptionally dry. A
maximum deficit of 15 MW could occur in 1980, the year before
the expansion at Varreux can be completed. The main cause
of the deficits is that each of the three units at Peligre are
scheduled for routine maintenance during the dry season.
Consultants will study the maintenance problems at Peligre
(4.22) and it appears that improved procedures may reduce
maintenance time considerably. The same applies to the new
diesels; should diesel maintenance improve, curtailments could
be avoided. By 1980, however, requirements for operating
thermal plant would increase to five to seven months of the
year, thus gradually reducing time for larger overhauls.
(d) Although sales in the provinces would increase by 16.5%/a
by 1983 (Attachment 3/4), they would remain modest compared
with sales in the Port-au-Prince area.

4. THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Development Program
4.01      EdH's 1978-1983 development program, which is expected to cost
MUS$94.6 in current prices (Attachment 4/1) excluding interest during construc-
tion and consultants (MUS$10.4), is summarized as follows:
Local   Foreign      Total      % of Total
----------MUS$-----------
Generation              11.6    35.9          47.5           50
Transmission             3.9    16.8          20.7           22
Distribution              5.5    17.0         22.5           24

22.8    72.0         94.6          100
The generation component is largely diesel plant required in Port-au-Prince
through 1983. Apart from ongoing works, in Port-au-Prince and Gonaives, the
balance comprises diesel expansion in Cap Haitien and two small towns, as well
as four small hydro stations, aggregaLting some 5.6 MW and identified in the
CIDA-financed study of hydro potentiial in the country. The transmission compo-
nent is largely the additional work required in Port-au-Prince to further
extend existing 115-kV and 69-kV substations and 69-kV lines to complete the
subtransmission system for Port-au-Prince and to rationalize the feeder system
for the city. Development in distribution would largely comprise rehabilita-
tion and expansion in Port-au-Prince and the provinces. The balance consists
of consumer connections and small extensions.
4.02      The Project (4.05), would be financed in parallel by IDA/EEC and
CIDA. It would substantially comprise the development program for 1979-82
except for the on-going works and other projects not financed by KfW, the
Government, and EdH (e.g., consumer connections, equipment for offices and
similar) and excluding future works on which a decision has to be taken in
about two years. The following table summarizes EdH's investment program for
1979-82:

The ongoing works comprise the First Power Project (Credit 645-HA), the KfW
financed works in the Gonaives area and in Cap Haitien;(including a new power
station building); the installation of 4 Government financed diesels in Cap
Haitien; and the surveys of a new dam site downstream of Peligre, financed by
CIDA.
4.03      The future consultant services comprise the feasibility studies
for the use of lignite (MUS$0.6), least cost development study (MUS$0.6) and
the studies for and supervision of execution of several small hydro stations
(MUS$1.9). During appraisal, EdH indicated that a request for UNDP financing
was under consideration for the survey of the Maissada lignite field. Since
then the Federal Republic of Germany has expressed willingness to consider
financing the surveys, not only of the Maissade field, but also of the Camp
Perrin field (1.02), the study of the respective infrastructures required,
the mining operation, and the feasibility study of constructing a thermal
plant at Maissade. A German Government expert has pre-appraised those projects
and the financing of the lignite study now appears reasonably assured. UNDP
has agreed to finance (US$350,000) the study of the Peligre reservoir silta-
tion (1.04) and the Bank has agreed to act as executing agency. Actions are
underway to formalize these agreements and to engage consultants. The survey
of a promising dam site downstream from Peligre is under way, financed by CIDA
and CIDA may consider financing the final feasibility study of a multi-purpose
scheme, in case the study shows that construction of a dam is feasible and the
Peligre siltation study gives satisfactory results. It appears possible that
either CIDA or KfW would consider financing the study of several small hydro
stations identified in the CIDA-financed hydro survey (1.01). KfW has already
expressed interest in financing the feasibility study of one small hydrostation
at Saint Mathurine and prefeasibility studies for two further hydro stations
at Samana and Caracol.
The Project
4.04      Objectives.  During execution of the proposed project, IDA will
continue to emphasize the sector and project objectives initiated under the
first project. These were to:
(a) rationalize sector development and promote the use of indigenous
resources;
(b) provide access to electricity to a greater number of households;
(c) accelerate connection of labor-intensive industries and
irrigation;
(d) meet electricity demand in Port-au-Prince with adequate and
reliable facilities;
(e) establish a training program for EdH personnel;
(f) achieve EdH's financial independence through emphasizing
adequate pricing and reduction in thefts; and



- 25 -
(g) increase institutional and managerial efficiency at EdH.
In addition to the above, the proposed project would also:
(h) emphasize the extension of services in the provinces.
4.05      Description.  The proposed second power project consists of:
(a) 22-23 MW additional diesel capacity at the Varreux power
station in Port-au-Prince, 3.5 MW in Cap Haitien, 1 MW in
a new power station at Port-de-Paix and 250 kW in a new
power station at Miragoane.
(b) Expansion of two 115/69-kV and five 69-kV substations (con-
structed under the first project) and three new 69-kV sub-
stations (Petionville Carrefour and Croix des Bouquets);
construction of about 27 km 69-kV lines, and telecommuni-
cation equipment.
(c) Rehabilitation of about 30% of the distribution network in
Port-au-Prince; renovation and expansion of the distribution
networks at Port-de-Paix (16 km 12.46-kV lines, 300 kVA in
transformers), Les Cayes (10 km 12.46 kV-lines, 600 kVA in
transformer capacity) and Miragoane (18 km of lines at various
voltages, 275 kVA in transformer capacity).
(d) Consultant services for the project and for the preliminary
design of a new head office building, and for studies related
to the management and operations of EdH.
(e) Consultant services for the completion of the Peligre dam study.
(f) Training of EdH staff.
4.06      The first project forecast that 15.4 MW additional capacity would
have to be installed at Port-au-Prince in the Varreux power station by 1980.
This is not possible; lead time for construction and erection of this capacity,
assuming award of contract immediately after approval of the IDA credit, is
about 2 years. It is hoped that the diesels (3 x 7 to 8 MW) to be financed by
the IDA/EEC credits would be operational before the start of the dry season in
1981 (September/October). However, the Government financed emergency diesels
purchased during the 1977 drought (3.05) are expected to meet most of the 1980
and early 1981 requirements.
4.07      The extension of the 115-kV and 69-kV transmission system started
under the first project. The First Power Project was part of a program to
renovate and extend the basic supply system for Port-au-Prince. This system
now almost encircles Port-au-Prince except along the coast but, because of a
lack of funds, only single circuit 69-kV lines could be executed, and three
new 69-kV substations of the program had to be deferred. Communication equip-
ment had to be limited to essentials. Under the proposed project, the trans-
mission system would be completed to meet demand until about 1985.



- 2E -
4.08      Renovation of the Port-au-Prince distribution network is urgently
required. Many lines have been extended indiscriminately, conductors are
undersized and much of the equipment is obsolete. This causes low voltages,
extremely high losses and innumerable forced outages. A prudent estimate,
in view of lack of funds and physical constraints dictated by the require-
ment that supply should not be interrupted unnecessarily, assumes that
a 10-year work program is required to renovate the network. About 30% of
this work would be executed under the project; some 280 km of networks at
various voltage levels would be reconditioned (change from single-phase to
three-phase, conversion to higher voltage, replacement of equipment including
many poles, etc.). One of the technical problems is the fact that the
telephone and cable television companies use EdH poles for stringing their
lines, which are also in an extremely bad condition, and that consequently
rehabilitation of these lines would have to be made concurrently with the
execution of EdH's works. For this reason the Government has confirmed that
it will cause EdH and the telephone and television companies to appoint a
joint commission to plan, schedule and coordinate the concurrent renewal of
their respective networks, and regulate conditions and standards for the
joint use of poles. By September 30, 1979, this commission would reach an
agreement acceptable to the Association covering these subjects. Additionally,
the Government has provided assurances on the financing of the cost of the
rehabilitation of the relevant part of the telephone and television networks.
4.09      Under the KfW loan for renewals in Cap Haitien, a new power station
is being constructed. Two mobile units of 825 kW have been procured and would
be retroactively financed by the proposed credit (4.15). They have been
installed for temporary operation in the old power station until the new
station is completed. CIDA, under its part of the project would finance two
additional (permanantly installed) units of similar size and the Government
has ordered through EdH, and is financing, 4 similar units (4.14). The old
power station and the older diesels would eventually be retired. In Port-de-
Paix (installed capacity 500 kW) a new power station will be constructed
including four additional units of 250 kW each to replace an older unit and
to meet future demand. Miragoane is presently supplied by a mine; supply
conditions are bad, and construction of a new power station with 2 x 125 kW
diesels has been included in the project. The Government is financing a
13.8 kV line for direct supply from Peligre to Mirebalais, from where a small
diesel station will be transfered to Thomonde.
4.10      In the area of Port-de-Paix, a 12.46-kV supply line, 8 km long, is
required for pumping facilities in an ongoing irrigation project, and a
similar length of 12.46-kV lines is required to increase the primary voltage
level in the town. In Miragoane, the networks are obsolete and have to be
replaced. In Les Cayes, expansion of the distribution network is envisioned
to extend service to adjacent small villages.

4.12      The cost estimate was prepared by SOFRELEC but modified somewhat
during appraisal to reflect early 1978 prices and expected inflation. It
excludes interest during construction and import duties and taxes from which
EdH is exempted. The physical contingencies assumed range from 8% to 15%
for local works (with a weighted average of about 10%) and from 6% to 10% for
foreign expenditures (weighted average 8%), depending on the nature and
location (e.g., 6% in foreign currency for large diesel plant and 15% for
civil works in the provinces). A price contingency has been added using the
tollowing assumed inflation rates; local cost 8% - 1978, 7.5% - 1979, 7.0% -
1980 onward; foreign cost 7% - 1978, 6.5% -1979, 6% - 1980 onward.
4.13      Financing.  The total f oreign exchange requirement for the project
is MUS$35.5, which represents 83% of the total cost of MUS$43.0. The proposed
IDA credit would amount to MUS$16. 5, the EEC special action credit to MUS$6
equivalent and the CIDA contribution is expected to be about MUS$14.5
equivalent. The financing plan would be as follows:

About 10% of the CIDA financing of MUS$14.5 would be applied to financing of
local cost.  The combined IDA/EEC and CIDA financing would total MUS$37, or 86%
of nroject cost.
b.14       IDA would retroactively finance two mobile diesel units eaclh of about
825 kW already installed in Cap Haitien (4.09) to meet demand that'was being
curtailed. The Government is financing 4 permanently installed 825 kW diesel
units for Cap Haitien to meet intermediate requirements (in view of deLays due
to CIDA procurement, see para. 4.17). CIDA intends to finance another two
units of about 825 kW for installation in the new power station before the end
of 1980 subject to satisfactory justification of their required timing in view
of expected demand. This would largely depend on the timing of completion of
a resort, two factories and some irrigation pumping connections which together
represent an additional demand of about 2,500 kW over the present demand of
1,500 - 1,700 kW. One of the IDA-financed mobile units would be transferred
to Les Cayes in 1980 to meet growing demand because a small hydro plant for
the area, which KfW is considering financing, is not expected to be in opera-
tion before 1981/82. The second mobile unit will be available, once the new
power station has sufficient capacity, for emergency purposes anywhere in the
provinces.



- 29 -
4.15      Retroactive Financing.  In view of the continuous daily power
supply curtailments in Cap Haitien, the Association has indicated to the
Government that it would be willing to propose retroactive financing for
1,650 kW in diesel capacity for Cap Haitien, at a cost not exceeding MUS$0.6.
The capacity was tendered and awarded tnder international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank Group guidelines for procurement and has been in
satisfactory operation since December :L978. Retroactive financing of these
units is therefore proposed. In view of the importance of continuing to
engage the services of SOFRELEC for preliminary design of the IDA part of the
project and for preparation and issue of bid documents (with the objective
of award of the main components soon after credit approval), retroactive
financing of these services is proposed for expenditures made after June 1,
1978, not exceeding MUS$0.5.
4.16      Engineering and Construction.  SOFRELEC is continuing its services
as the consultants for the IDA/EEC part of the project (4.15) and for EdH's
management and operational matters. Because under CIDA regulations Canadian
consultants for CIDA's part of the project have to be engaged by CIDA, but
only after approval of the grant (expected for April/May 1979), such consult-
ants are not expected to be in the field before October 1979. Additionally
CIDA disbursements during its fiscal year 1979 (April through March) are
expected to be restricted mainly to consultant services. As a consequence,
procurement and construction of the CIDA part of the project would start about
one year later than the IDA/EEC part. The only substantial difficulty resulting
from this has been solved. IDA/EEC rather than CIDA would finance the Varreux
substation to which the additional generating capacity at Port-au-Prince would
be connected. Because CIDA would mainly finance transmission in Port-au-Prince,
which has a relatively shorter delivery time, lines and substations are expected
to be completed not more than 3-6 months after the commissioning of the first
diesel unit at Varreux.
4.17      Since EdH lacks expertise in its planning department to implement
detailed engineering and expeditious procurement, SOFRELEC would continue
to provide relevant services. However, in order to initiate proper planning,
at least in distribution, EdH has agreed to establish by October 1, 1979, a
planning section within its Department of Planning and Dispatch and to
engage an expert to act as chief for this section. The services of distri-
bution technicians/draftsmen for this section will be obtained from the
consultants to serve as a nucleus for this section. The objective is that
design work for distribution networks would gradually be taken over by this
section from the consultants. It is expected that the services of the expert
and the two technicians would be required for two years. Depending on the
extent to which EdH's staff, which woluld be trained on the job, would be able
to take over the design and supervision work, the foreign technicians could be
retired earlier. The services of the expert, who would also act as special
coordinator between consultants (4.18), would be financed with the CIDA grant
and the IDA credit in equal proportion if CIDA management authorizes this
expenditure; otherwise the cost would be financed under the IDA/EEC part of
the project. The total cost of consultant services for the IDA/EEC part of
the project would be about MUS$2.7 (including price contingency), including



services of the project coordinator and design of a new head office building
(4.20), with a foreign exghange cost of MUS$2.3. About 250 staff-months of
services would be provided at a mid 1978 cost of MUS$6,500 per staff-month.
4.18      In order to coordinate the services of the various consultants
(SOFRELEC for the IDA/EEC part of the project, Canadian consultants for the
CIDA part, and DECON of Germany for KfW financed works), EdH has agreed to
create a coordinating committee with its Director of Planning as chairman.
The committee, which would comprise the chiefs of missions of the consultants
and the Directors of the Planning and Technical Departments, would meet
regularly to coordinate design (including standardization), schedule work
methods, assign EdH personnel for training and coordination in design and
supervision and resolve other questions as they might arise. EdH agreed to
appoint the chief of the planning section as coordinator for the day-to-day
business for the project. The agencies involved in the power sector (IDA,
CIDA as representative of the Canadian Government, and KfW representing the
Federal Government of Germany) hold periodic sector meetings, chaired by the
Minister of Public Works, to coordinate their activities in the power sector.
A first meeting took place in Port-au-Prince in February 1979.
4.19      In view of the above arrangements, no particular difficulties are
expected in the execution of the project. Local contractors' capabilities
have increased markedly during construction of the first project and these
contractors will continue to be engaged, mainly for civil works and for
construction of the substations. In view of the limited number of artisans
available to EdH, contractors may also have to be engaged for the renovation
works in Port-au-Prince. Employment and training of artisans for distribution
works are expected to increase gradually in view of EdH's long-term renovation
program.
4.20      EdH's present office building is old and already far too small to
accommodate the head office staff of about 150 people and to serve the public.
The technical services are located in a small building on the site of the old
power station, which will be expanded to accommodate the expected expansion
of consultant personnel and the increase in the planning section. A new head
office is required, and the proposed credit would finance a study of EdH's
future requirements for personnel, the appropriate location of its various
services (particularly for distribution in several parts of the city), and the
preliminary design for a new head office building sufficiently large to house
about 400 people, as anticipated by 1985. SOFRELEC would execute this study
and design, which EdH undertook to have completed before June 30, 1980 under
terms of reference acceptable to IDA.
4.21      Under the first credit, the Varreux power station was expected to
use a well for make-up cooling water, as well as some potable water from the
city supply. It now appears probable that the quantity of potable water to be
used will be larger than originally estimated siîce neither the quality nor
the quantity of well water is adequate (some 1 m /MW.day is required in the
evaporation type cooling tower system). For the three additional diesel
units radiator type of cooling will be installed. The consultants are



- 31 -
presently studying the feasibility of replacing the wet cooling towers; for the
existing units by similar dry cooling systems in order not to overtax the city's
potable water system since the latter would cause advancement of the expansion
program for potable water.
4.22      The Government, through EdH, financed the first phase of a q;tudy,
completed recently, concerning the soundness of the Peligre dam. Because the
second phase of this study, which would recommend actions to be taken for
improved maintenance and monitoring is of vital importance, its financing
has been included in the proposed IDA credit. In view of Peligre's multi-
purpose function, the Government would not relend to EdH the funds required
for this study, but provide EdH with the funds necessary to complete the
study.
4.23      Implementation.  The key dates for implementing the project are shown
in Attachment 4/3. These dates would be used to monitor progress during the
project's construction period.  The IDA part of the project is expectEd to
be completed by December 1981 and the CIDS part by June 1982.
4.24      Training.  Under the first proj2ct, 10 engineers were trainEd in
France in generation, transmission, distribution and planning in accoidance
with the program. Twenty rather than 13 technicians were trained in mainte-
nance of distribution systems at the trairning center built by UNDP, Irterna-
tional Labor Organization (ILO) and Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC, French
technical assistance). Accounting personiel were trained on the job by Howell
and Co. (USA). Future station personnel issisted in the erection of the Varreux
power station and were trained on the job. The training school on EdE premises
has been constructed, but, because of a delay in the receipt of training equip-
ment, full training started only recently (1.10).  Limited training had already
started in temporary quarters.
4.25      Training should be continued and a plan for further training has
been prepared as follows:
(a)  operations and maintenance:  5 engineers and 2 technicians
(1 electrical, 1 mechanical) (45 staff-months; France);
(b) planning: 1 engineer (3 months; France);
(c) power operations and load management: 1 engineer (6 staff-
months; France);
(d)  training methodology:  2 instructors (6 staff-months; France);
(e)  personnel management:  Personnel Manager (3 months; Italy);
(f) stock accounting and procurement: Senior Store Keeper (3
months; England); and
(g) addition to some equipment for the training school.



- 32 -
4.26      A Bank group training expert visited Haiti in December 1978 and
February 1979. Possibilities of assistance from other international agencies
such as UNDP, FAC and ILO are being investigated. The details of the training
program and its scheduling are being worked out by EdH, which agreed to carry
out the above program which is satisfactory to the Association. The proposed
credit includes an allocation of MUS$0.3 to finance training.
4.27      Procurement and Disbursements.  Procurement of goods and services
to be financed by the proposed IDA/EEC credits (other than those of the
consultants) would be in accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines for Procure-
ment, except for MUS$0.5 of telecommunication equipment, MIJS$0.2 of protection
equipment, MUS$0.75 of power and control panels for the 3 additional units in
the Varreux power station (which will not be extended further), which bas to
match equipment already installed and which would have to be procurel from the
original suppliers. In order to avoid -ntroduction of a third type of equip-
ment in the transmission system (CIDA t:.ed finanicing would add Canadian
equipment to the French equipment alreacty installed), procurement for the
Varreux substation (4.16), estimated to cost MUS$0.8 would be arrangad similarly.
Bids for the 2 IDA financed diesel unit-. at the Varreux power station have
been evaluated, but the contract will bC signed prior to Board presentation of
the proposed credit. Although presently none of the project equipment is
being manufactured in Eaiti, as requeste.d by the Government, local mantufac-
tures, if any were to emerge, would receive a preference of 15% or a?plicable
duties, whichever is the lower, for purpose of bid evaluation. SimiLarly a
preference of 7.5% would be given to local civil work contractors. )isburse-
ments would be made for 100% of the foreign expenditures for contrac-s awarded
for equipment and materials and associated services (e.g., erection services
for diesel plant) and of consulting services and for 50% cf civil work contracts.
Procurement under the Special Action Credit would be limited to member states
of the EEC. Estimated credits disbursements are shown in Attachment 4/4. The
closing date would be June 30, 1983 to allow for payment of retention moneys
and unforeseen delays. Any savings would be applied to works of similar
nature as financed by IDA/EEC, principally for distribution.
4.28      All CIDA financed equipment and materials would be procured in
Canada under CIDA procurement regulations.
4.29      Environment.  As for the first project, specifications concerning
maximum sulfur dioxide emission, maximum noise level and thermal pollution,
as suggested by the Association, are being required for generating facilities.
Lines will be routed to minimize visual impact.
4.30      Project Risks.  Although its number of capable engineers has
increased, EdH is still too small and inexperienced to ensure minimal risks in
executing the project. For this reason, to a large extent EdH will depend on
SOFRELEC and the Canadian consultants who will continously supervise project
execution. However, participation of EdH's staff in the proposed project is
expected to be much more extensive than in the first project. By the time the
project is completed, it is hoped that EdH will be self sufficient, at least
for distribution planning and construction.

5. FINANCES
Summary
5.01      The financial condition of EdH had been weak from its inception in
1971 up to the time of its involvement with the Association in 1975, princi-
pally because of inadequate rate levels, excessively high energy losses,
non-payment of electricity bills by the public sector and excessive reliance
on short-term debts. The situation began to improve in 1976 with improve-
ments in operating efficiency and settlement of the public sector debts.
Even further improvements would have resulted in 1977 with the implementa-
tion of new tariffs in January. The improved situation, however, was short-
lived as the Government rolled back tariff increases in March until July, when
the new tariffs were reinstituted (5.04). A severe drought (3.01) reduced the
availability of hydro power, increased the consumption of fuel and forced power
rationing. Meanwhile, payment for electricity by the public sector began to
lag again, a problem that was overcome only recently (5.11). Expected improve-
ments in EdH's operating efficiencies, prompt settlement of electricity bills
and adequate earnings, all of which would result from implementation of the
proposed agreements, are expected to provide EdH with a solid financial base
to undertake the investment program and to reduce its dependence upon alloca-
tions from the Government.
Earning History and Financial Position
5.02      The EdH organization was characterized by very poor financial per-
formance until 1975. Inadequately kept financial and operating statistics as
well as improperly valued plant prevented a definite quantitative assessment
of the extent of the company's financial difficulties at the time. Neverthe-
less, an appreciation of its situation can be gleaned from the following: its
rates, which had not changed in over 40 years, did not permit an adequate level
of earnings to cover its operating expenses and debt service; extremely high
energy losses reaching up to 42% of gross generation, and non-payment for elec-
tricity by public sector agencies compounded the company's cash difficulties.
Over 1971-1975 EdH's internal cash generation was negative. The modest capital
investments made during that period were financed from government transfers
and from overdrafts at the National Bank which had reached about MUS$3.4 by
September 1975. As a first step toward putting EdH on a sound financial basis,
the agreements under the First Power Project included provisions aimed at
improving its operating efficiencies and reinforcing its earning capability
and its revenue collections. The agreements included target levels of energy
losses which EdH was to achieve and a provision that EdH's tariffs would be
set at levels adequate to enable the achievement of rates of return on revalued
assets of 5% in 1976, 7% in 1977 through 1979, 7.5% in 1980 and 8% in 1981
and thereafter. Furthermore, the Government agreed that between January 1976
and May 1977, it would settle all public sector electricity debts outstanding
as of December 1975, amounting to about US$1.5 million.



- 39 -
5.03      During the 1976 fiscal year, EdH's financial performance began to
improve.  Although no rate adjustments were made during the year, EdH's net
operating income (Attachment 5/1) more than covered its interest payments,
and it achieved a 4.6% return. For the first time in its history, it began
to contribute to its construction program from internal resources (generating
about MUS$1.6, equivalent to 54% of its financing requirements for the year).
Its net cash position did not worsen as in the past; the Government paid about
MUS$0.9 of the outstanding debt, and, at the end of the year, the balance of
EdH's overdraft at the National Bank did not increase.
Tariff Change in 1977
5.04      In January 1977, EdH implemented new tariffs, as agreed under the
First Power Project; the implementation coincided with a severe drought which
rendered Peligre practically inoperative and caused severe power shortages in
Port-au-Prince. In response to strong consumer dissatisfaction with the
electricity supply situation and the new tariffs, the Government reduced the
rates in March, and they were not restored to their original level until July;
meanwhile, because of the drought, EdlH's fuel use had more than tripled. EdH
was able to meet the 7.0% 1/ earnings required that year only because of delays
in completion of the first power project, which resulted in a rate base much
lower than estimated. As part of the arrangements relating to the tariff roll-
back, the Government assumed the servicing of EdH's payments on suppliers
credits for Peligre (about US$538,000) and indicated its intention to relieve
EdH of the servicing of a debt to ONA incurred for the financing of Peligre.
This understanding by the Government lnas been confirmed in the Credit Agreements.
Tariffs and Earnings
5.05      EdHI's rates in effect during fiscal 1978 were sufficient to permit
earnings of 7.4% for the year, which exceeds the 7% covenanted. To enable EdH
to generate sufficient resources to self finance a reasonable portion of the
investment program, it must be able to obtain adequate tariff adjustments of
the desired magnitude when necessary. The Government has agreed that the
provisions in the first credit agreements relating to specified rate of earn-
ings (5.02) on revalued assets would be maintained under the proposed credit.
To enable EdH to achieve the agreed 7% rate of return for 1979, the Goverament
has authorized EdH to institute, as of February 1979, surcharges which are
expected to increase revenue by an average 9%. With an increase of this
magnitude, EdH's rate of return would be about 7.5% for 1979.
1/   The rate of return for the Port-au-Prince system was 7.1%; earnings for
the entire EdH system including the provincial operations were 6.6%
reflecting the fact that revenues from the provinces do not cover expenses.
A written undertaking, however, specified that for 1976 and 1977 the rate
of return was to be applied to P'ort-au-Prince only.



Financing Plan
5.06      As a result of adequate rates EdH's financial situation is ex-
pected to improve, and its financing plan for the construction program would
be acceptable. Net internal cash generation, after payment of debt service,
would cover 36% of EdH's financing requirements during the fiscal years
1978/79 to 1982/83 construction period of the proposed project. On-lent
proceeds of ioans and credits from IDA/EEC and the German Government, the
proposed CIDA grant and unidentified future sources would cover about 62%
of requirements while the remaining 2% would be financed from consumer con-
tributions. EdH's requirements and sources of funds during the construction
period of the project are summarized on page 41 and are shown in more detail
in Attachment 5/2 and its estimated debt service in Attachment 5/4.
5.07      The proposed IDA and EEC credits would be made to the Government
of Haiti on standard IDA terms and on-lent to EdH, with the exception of the
funds (MUS$0.5) required for the execution of the Peligre dam study (4.22), at
an annual interest rate of 8% for a period of 20 years, including a grace
period of 4 years. 1/ A subsidiary loan agreement, acceptable to IDA, would
have to be signed as a condition of effectiveness for the proposed IDA/EEC
credits. A Special Action Credit Agreement - which would be cross effective
with the IDA credit - would be signed between the Governnent and IDA as the
Administrator of the Special Action Account established by the EEC member
states.
5.08      It is assumed that CIDA would make a grant of M.Can$17.1 (about
MUS$14.5) to the Haitian Government, as proposed by the CIDA staff to its
management. The amount would be on-lent to EdH on the same terms as agreed
for the IDA/EEC credits. The proposed IDA/EEC credits aggregate MUS$22.5 and,
therefore, should CIDA management approve the MUS$14.5 grant, the combined
IDA/EEC/CIDA financing should be sufficient to cover the foreign cost of the
proposed project. Confirmation by CIDA to finance its portion of the project
should be a condition of effectiveness for the proposed IDA/EEC credits.
5.09      The KfW loan was made in two stages.  The first stage, signed in
1976, consisted of a MDM 12.9 contribution to the construction of the hydro-
electric plant at Drouet in Haiti's Artibonite region and MDM 6.8 toward
rehabilitation and expansion of the Gonaives-St. Marc distribution network.
These projects were completed in February 1979. The second stage of the
loan, for MDM 6, was signed in 1977 to rehabilitate Cap Haitien's distri-
bution system. Both loans were made to the Government for a term of 50 years,
including 10 years of grace at an annual interest rate of 3/4%. The agree-
ments relating to these loans provide for the Government to on-lend to EdH
for a term of 30 years, including seven years of grace, at an annual interest
rate of 5%. In addition, the Government would deposit the difference
between the interest it receives on the KfW loan from EdH and that which it
1/ Local inflation was 18.6% in 1975, 9.3% in 1976, 6.7% in 1977 and is
expected to average 6.2%/a during 1978-80. The Haitian National Bank
charges EdH an annual interest rate of 8% on its revolving account.

pays to service it in a special account with the National Bank to be used by
EdH for projects in the provinces. This should further strengthen EdH's
ability to participate in the financing of its future investment programs.
Because EdH's repayment of this loan does not occur during the forecast
period, the financial estimates do not include this additional source of
internal financing. As for the first credit the Government intends that funds
received from EdH in repayment of proceeds of the proposed IDA/EEC credits,
and not needed for servicing of the related debt to the Association and EEC,
will be placed in a special fund to be used as Government counterpart for
development projects assisted by official lending agencies.
5.10      In the past there have been investments in the power sector facili-
ties which were not part of EdH's investment program and whose technical,
economic and financial viability were questionable. To ensure that only sound
projects are undertaken,EdH and the Governnent have provided assurances that
EdH would not undertake any project costing in excess of 1% of the value of its
net fixed assets in operation, unless satisfactory evidence has been presented
to IDA that such project is economically justified and that adequate financing
is available to carry it out. This undertaking replaces the existing covenant
limiting investment to MUS$1.5/a without the prior consent of IDA.
5.11      The implementation of a program to reduce energy losses (3.03),
the application of the earnings covenant to permit adequate revenues (5.05),
and the continuation of institutional improvements are all expected to lead
to further strengthening of EdH's ability to mobilize resources for its
development program. To further enhance its capability in this respect, it
is essential that EdH's revenue collections be kept up to date and its accounts
receivable kept at a reasonable level. The Government has liquidated the
public sector electricity debts and, furthermore has made specific arrange-
ments satisfactory to the Association to ensure the prompt payment of future
public sector electricity accounts.
5.12      For EdH to be able to self-finance a satisfactory percentage of its
investment program, it is essential that it follow a sound cash management
program and devote its financial resources to the development of the sector.
The Government and EdH have therefore agreed that EdH's resources will not
be put to any use other than the execution of its construction program and
the payment of its debt service and for operations.
Future Financial Situation
5.13      EdH's financial situation is expected to continue to improve
during the forecast period. Its debt service coverage is expected to range
from 3.1 in 1978/79 to 2.6 in 1982/83 when actual interest payment of the
second IDA credit begins. While its debt/equity ratio is projected to
increase from 25/75 at the end of fiscal 1976/77 to 47/53 by the end of
fiscal 1982/83 (Attachment 5/3), there would still be an adequate margin for



- 43 -
future borrowings. To provide the Association with the opportunity to
review the terms of any future borrowings, the agreement under the first
credit that EdH would not incur any long term debt without the Associa-
tion's concurrence unless its internal cash generation covers the maximum
debt service at least 1.5 times has been repeated, in the agreements for the
second project.
Performance Indicators
5.14      The expected strengthening of EdH's finances, the reduction
in losses, greater accessibility to electric service and other improvements
are among the targets reflected in Attachment 5/5, which will be used to
monitor EdH's performance during execution of the project.

a/  For details on sales forecasts see Attachment 3/4.    The annual percentage increase shown in this Table is for the
Port-au-Prince system only.
b/  For FY 1977/78 operating expenses, include actual data for the first semester and estimates for the remainder of
the year.
c/ Fuel expenses vere estimated on the basis of expected thermal generation for an average hydrological year (see Attach-
-imt .314).       Fuel prices used in the forecasts are those currently in effect (i.e. US$ 14-16/bbl. for bunker C
and US$ 22.47/bbl. for gasoil). The forecasts assume that the fuel clause surcharge feature in EdH's tariffs would
be maintained so that any excess fuel costs resulting from price and/or volume increases would be recovered in full.
d/  Operating  expenses  other  than fuel consists mostly of payroll and other labor related costs.  They have been assumed
to increase at an annual rate of about 4% over local inflation (which were taken to be the local price contingency
figures referred to in paragraph 4.13).
e/  Maintenance expenses were forecast at about 2.5% of (historically valued) average gross fixed assets in service.
f/ This expense item is also labor related. An annual real growth rate of 2% vas assumed in the forecasts.
/   EdH calculates depreciation on a straight line basis using rates for major asset categories corresponding to their
estimated useful life. Some typical rates used are: hydro plant 2%; diesel generator 4%; distribution plant 4%;
transmission plant 3.3%; office equipment 20Z. These rates are reasonable. For forecasting purposes a composite
rate of 3% was used.
h/  For the forecast period, it was assumed that  rates  would be set so as to enable EdH to achieve the rates of return
specified in the agreements of the first power credit (i.e. 7% in FY 1979, 7.5Z in FY 1980 and 8% in 1981 and there-
after. The net operating income shown in the forecasts therefore correspond to these levels of earnings.
_/ In accordance with customary practice, interest on construction loans are assumed to be charged to the cost of the
related asset while it is under construction.

a/ See Attacement 5/4 for details on projected debt service.
b/ The loan amounts shown in this table include capitalized interest.
c/  As of 9/30/77 the undisbursed balance on Credit 645-HA was spproximatelyMlUS$5.8    which is assumed to be completely
drawn down in FY 77/78.
d/  This loan was made in two parts. The first loan signed in 1976 was for 112.9 towards the cost of a hydro plant
at Drouet andfMCM6.8 to rehabilitate the Conaives-St. Marc distribution network.  The second loan signed in 1977
was forMDM6.0 to rehabilitate the distribution network in Cap Haitien. The terms of the loan to the Haitien govern-
ment are 50 years including 10 years of grace, 3/4% annual interest.  On-lending terms to EdH are 30 years repayment
including 7 years grace, asnual interest 5% with portion falling due during the construction period capitalized. As
part of the agreements relating to this loan, the governmeat would put the difference between the interest it
receives from EdH and that it pays to service the loan in an account at the National Bank to be used by EdH for rural
electrification projects.
e/  The US$16.5 million credit is assumed to be made to the Government on standard IDA terms.  The Government would on-lend
US$16 million of the credit to EdH for a term of 20 years i.ncluding 4 years of grace at 8% annual interest (para 5.07).
f/  The forecasts assume borrowing to finance the foreign cost uf those items listed as future construction projects
(primatily 22 MW generating capacity to be commissioned in Port-au-Prince in 1983--see Attachment 4 /1).
Sf Working capital changes consist of changes in accounts receivables and in materials and supplies. To simplify the
projections, other current asset and liability accounts have been assumed not to change during the forecast period.
/ It has been assumed that the Governaent will on-lend the EEC Special Action Credit to EdH on terms similar to
those for the IDA Credit.
1/ On-lending terms of the CIDA Credit to EdH are alao assumed to be the seme as for the IDA Credit.

8/  It is expected that Edt will revalue its fixed assets and accumulated depreciation annually in keeping vith
existing agreements.  In the forecaste, local and international inflation were used to revalue the accounts.
Both the gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation were revalued by the same indices aud the net result
was applied to the surplus from revaluation account.
b/  From fiscal 1978 ornwards, accounts receivables fram  sales have baen estimated as the equivalent of 45 days
sales. It is expected that implementation of the proposed covenant relating to the saettlement of public
sector electricity bills would maake the attainment of this target level of receivables reasonable.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Network Evaluation
6.01      Because the project is a mixture of renovations, replacements
and extensions, economic comparison of alternatives to many items included
in the project is not possible. The design of the system, however, is tech-
nically simple. The system is of the radial type. Most of the lines at
voltage levels of 12.47 kV and above are relay-protected. Below this level,
protection generally consists of fuses (some reclosers are used on principal
lines and for medium-sized industries). All systems are executed in over-
head lines and open-air substations, and, except for the KfW-financed works
in Gonaives and Cap Haitien, are generally of the American type, with small
transformers supplying a limited number of consumers. Thus, the transmis-
sion and distribution lines included in the project are the least cost solu-
tion to the planned rehabilitation and extensions of the network. The project
is expected to lead to a more acceptable level of security for the power
system.
Comparison of Alternatives
6.02      For the first project, a comparison was made of various type of
generating plants for Port-au-Prince - i.e., medium-speed diesels using
heavy fuel oil, gas turbines (diesel o:il), and gas turbines in combination
with conventional steam plant - showing that, up to a discount rate of at
least 20%, medium-speed diesels were the least-cost solution. The consul-
tants repeated the calculation for the second project using early 1978
prices and fuel costs in order to assess whether the conclusions were still
valid at present prices. The combination gas turbines/steam was ruled out
because a steam plant cannot be construicted in time and, at the small unit
size required (not exceeding 33 MW), wauld cost up to 2 times the cost of
diesel plant per kW. The only alternatives, therefore, were high-speed
diesels (US$280/kW) using diesel oil (lJS$22.47 bbl), gas-turbines (US$210-
250/kW) operating on diesel oil, and medium-speed diesels (US$510/kW) operat-
ing on heavy fuel oil ($14.16/bbl). This comparison shows that the medium
speed diesels are still the least-cost solution up to a discount rate of 17%.
The addition of air cooling and waste heat boilers (4.21), estimated to cost
about US$75/kW for either type of diesel, would decrease this discount rate
to 16%. The secondary benefits, i.e., not using potable water for make-up
cooling water purposes, are to be quantified in the feasibility study.
Internal Economic Rate of Return on the 1978-83 Investment Program
6.03      As the proposed project consists of several components of EdH's
1978-83 investment program, components to which it is not possible to
allocate benefits separately, the internal rate of return has been cal-
culated for the investment program as a whole.



- 50 -
6.04      The cost streams (Attachment 6/1) consist of EdH's investment
program expenditures (Attachment 4/1) and the related fuel, operating,
maintenance and administrative costs, expressed in end-1977 constant prices.
It is not possible to make direct estimates of the benefits resulting from
the increased availability of electricity supply, such as its effects on the
expansion of industrial and commercial activity, the increased employment
opportunities generated and the social benefits of public lighting and
domestic supply. Consequently, the incremental revenues attributable to the
investment program are used here as a minimum estimate of benefits, since it
is known that the public will pay at least this much to purchase electricity.
The benefit stream (Attachment 6/1) in the years 1978-83 is the increase in
EdH's sales above their 1977 level, valued at the end-of-fiscal 1977 average
rate of USi6.5/kWh. Beyond 1983 the benefit stream is constant at the 1983
level since further increases in sales are not attributable to the 1978-83
investment program.
6.05      Using the above estimates of costs and benefits, the rate of
return to the investment program is about 7.5%. A sensitivity analysis
shows the following:
(a)  The rate of return is very sensitive to change in electricity
rates: each 1% change in average revenue causes a variation
of about 0.27% in the rate of return, i.e., a rate increase
of 10% would increase the rate of return to about 10.5%.
(b)  The rate of return is moderately sensitive to changes in
capital costs: a price rise of about 10% in capital costs
would decrease the return to 6%, while a reduction of
about 10% would increase the rate of return to about 9%.
(c)  The rate of return is only slightly sensitive to changes
in the price of fuel: a 10% increase in fuel price would
decrease the rate of return to 7.3%; conversely, a fuel price
decrease of about 10% would increase the rate of return to 8.5%.
6.06      Because EdH has recently increased its rates by 9% (5.05), the
rate of return on investments--at early 1979 prices (commensurate with the
time of the rate increase)--is expected to be not less than 9%, which is
above the opportunity cost of capital in Haiti, estimated to be 8%.

Rate of Return on Investment
Notes
1.   Capital Cost.  See Attachment 4/1, local and foreign cost of each type
of investment (Generation, Transmission, Operations, Various) deflated
in accordance with assumed rate of price increases (i.e., annual
expenditures divided by the relevant contingency factor for the year).
Local Cost                    1978   1979   1980   1981   1982   1983
% of Price increase        8.0    7.5    7.0    7.0    7.0    7.0
Contingency factor          1.040  1.121  1.202  1.286  1.376  1.472
Foreign Cost
Z of Price increase        7.0    6.5    6.0    6.0    6.0    6.0
Contingency'factor         1.035  1.103  1.170  1.241  1.315  1.395
2.   Economic Life, Residual Values.  The discount period has been taken as
15 years (which is the assumed lifetime of the diesels that were commis-
sioned in 1978), taking into account residual values on the basis of an
economic life of:
Diesel plant   -   15 years
Transmission   -   30 years
Distribution   -   25 years
Read office    -   40 years
lor residual values, it was assumed that sinking fund amortization would
reasonably reflect the decrease in economic life of the facilities.  The
present value (PV)k  of an expenditure Ck in year k deducting residual
value, is then calculated as:



-53
(PV)    .        (l + i)ne                                                         Ck1 __ 1_____
(1 + i) 'e -               (l+i) k l              (l +  )nd-J
In which i is the discount rate, tLd the discount period and n the
economic life of the facility. The equation reflects the beginning of
year method of discounting.
3.   Fuel Costs.  Incremental fuel costs above the 1977 expenditures of
MUS$2,120 are calculated in accordance with the forecast included in
the income statements (Port-au-Pr;ince plus provinces). Because the new
diesels operate on heavy fuel oil,, considerable savings result. The
increase in efficiency has been t;aken into account in the estimates for
fuel cost. EdH does not pay taxes on fuel.
4.   Operating Costs.  The accounts do not allow a breakdown of these costs
between generation, transmission and distribution. The total was
MUS$1.210 in 1977 and an annual real increase of 5% has been assumed.
5.   Maintenance Costs.  These costs were MUS$0.840 in 1977, which appears
relatively low. Because thermal generation, by 1983, will increase
five-fold over 1977, it was assumed that total maintenance costs would
rise as follows:
% of                  Increase
Increase     MUS$         MUS$
1977                               0.840
1978                       5       0.880         0.040
1979                      10       0.970         0.130
1980                      15        1.110        0.270
1981                      20        1.340        0.500
1982                      25        1.670        0.830
1983                      30       2.170         1.330
6.   Administrative Costs.  Starting i-rom a 1977 level of MUS$0.860, a real
increase of 5% has been assumed J'or 1978 through 1981 and 7% for 1982/83
(a new head office would be comp:Leted).
7.   Benefits.  Increments are in accordance with the forecast included in the
income statement, i.e., the incremental sales above the 1977 level
(Port-au-Prince plus provinces) inultiplied by the estimated average
revenue of 6.5 USe/kWh at the end of fiscal 1977. The annual average,
in accordance with the accounts, was 6.1 USJ/kWh, but not all rates had
been increased during the fiscal year. As a proxy, the results of the
first three months of fiscal 1978 have been used.

8.   Border Pricing  Because economic and social factors for adjustment to
border prices are not known for Haiti, the relevant calculation could
not be made. EdH is exempt from import duties, and, because no taxes are
included in the cost of fuel or in revenues, it is unlikely that the use
of economic efficiency prices would significantly alter the result of
the analysis.
