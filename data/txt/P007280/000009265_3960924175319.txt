PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 895-HA)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Power Project, which was partially financed by IDA Credit 895-HA
(US$16.5 million). The Borrower was the Government of Haiti which relent
all but a small part (US$0.5 million for the Peligre dam study) of the
proceeds of the credit to the beneficiary, Electricite d' Haiti (EdH), the
state-owned electrical utility. Also helping to finance the Project were
the European Economic Community (EEC) Speeial Action Credit 4-HA (US$6.0
million), administered by IDA and a parallel CIDA grant (Can$17.1 million).
IDA approved the Credit on April 17, 1979; effectiveness of the
credit agreement occurred on April 21, 1980. EdH completed the Project in
June 1984, about one year and -a half late.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy Division of the Latin America
and the Caribbean Regional Office based on information in IDA files, on
discussions with IDA staff and on a final project report prepared by EdH.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however,
no comments were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 895-HA)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Credit 895-HA (US$16.5 million) helped to finance diesel
generation expansion, distribution network renovation in Port-au-Prince,
consultant services and a training program. The Project received additional
financing from the European Economic Community (EEC) Special Action Account
credit 4-HA (US$ 6 million), administered by IDA, to help finance a diesel
unit in Port-au-Prince and a parallel financing from the Canadian
International Development Agency (CIDA - Can$ 17.1 million) to finance
transmission system expansion in Port-au-Prince and generation expansion
and distribution network renovation in provinces.
2.        The Project was successful in meeting its objectives of expanding
generating facilities to meet electricity demand in several areas of the
country, improving EdH's finances through adequate tariff policies and
developing EdH's extremely weak institutional and managerial capabilities.
&      The reduction of energy losses was not achieved in time due to delay in the
renovation of the distribution network in Port-au-Prince.
3.        EdH completed the Project in mid-1984, about one year and a half
later than the appraisal estimate. This delay was due to controversies
within EdH concerning observance of IDA Guidelines of Procurement for the
contract for Varreux diesel expansion resulting in the dismissal by the
Government of the General Manager, the Technical Director snd the technical
consultants in 1980. The dismissal of the technical consultants and hiring
of new ones caused delays of about two years and a half in the renovation
of the distribution network in Port-au-Prince, and consequently, losses
could not be rednted to the level expected at appraisal. The initial delay
of the Varreux diesel expansion was partially overcome as the contractor
was able to decrease the completion time; this component was in operation
four mDnths after the appraisal estimated date although with some technical
problems, which were corrected later. The CIDA financed transmission and
distribution components also suffered delays as a result of lags in the
preparation of project designs, bid evaluation and contract award.
4.     The total cost of the project was slightly lower than  the original
estimate. However, the figures are not strictly comparable due to changes
and reductions in project scope, mainly for the distribution component.
The increased cost of consultant services was offset by the lower cost of



- vi -
diesel expansion for the Varreux power station due to a favorable exchange
rate. The unit costs of the IDA-financed distribution component were
underestimated at appraisal and consequently only 50% of the facilities
originally foreseen was constructed.
5.     The institutional performance of EdH was reasonably satisfactory,
and its financial performance during period execution improved as a
result of the application of quarterly fuel adjustments in the tariff.
EdH's rate of return was below the 7% covenanted, because electricity
sales were lower than expected.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SECOND POWER PROJECT (CREDIT 895-HA)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1       IDA Lending to the Sector
1.1.1     Since 1976, IDA has made four credits (amounting to about US$80
million) benefitting Electricite d'Haiti (Annex 1). in 1976, IDA made its
first credit (645-HA, for US$16 million) to help finance the first stage of
a two-stage development program for 1976-1981 1/. The second credit
(895-HA, for US$16.5 million) helped to finance the Second Power Project,
which is the subject of this report. The last two credits (1281-HA for SDR
23.1 million and 1527-0-HA for SDR 26.0 million) are helping to finance the
expansion of thermal generation, the completion of the renovation of the
Port-au-Prince distribution network, the construction of Edh's headquarters
and other miscellaneous works. These projects are proceeding:
satisfactorily.
1.1.2     In addition to helping EdH to meet electricity demand and to
reduce losses, IDA sought to help EdH to improve its institutional and
managerial efficiency and to secure adequate electricity rate adjustments
to ensure its financial soundness.
1,2       Sector Organization
1.2.1     EdH is an autonomous public utility created in 1971, entirely
owned by the Government.  EdH is the only entity responsible for public
power supply in Haiti. Power sector policies are set by the President of
the Board, as there is no regulatory body for the sector, and tariffs are
approved by EdH's Board.  As of the end of 1985, EdH had an installed
capacity of 173 MW; there are 40 MW of captive power plants installed in
the country which are mainly for the service of some isolated industries.
1.2.2     The President of EdH is the President of the Republic, who
delegates authority on a permanent basis to the Minister of Public Works,
Communications and Transport. The Minister acts as the Chairman of the
Board of Directors. Other members of the Board are the Minister of Finance
and Economy, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, the Minister of
Planning, the Governor of the Central Bank and EdH's General Manager, who
is appointed by the President of the Republic and is assisted by the
1/   Project Performance Audit Report, No. 3265, Haiti: First Power Project
(Credit 645-HA), December 30, 1980.

U1. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1       ProJect Preparation and Appraisal
2.1.1    Preparation for the Second Power Project began in February 1978,
based on a two-stage power development program for 1976-1981, recommended
by consultants. This program comprised the installation of diesel
facilities arn the initiation of the renovation of the distribution network
in the country.  Due to constraints in the availability of both IDA and
local counterpart funds, this program was carried out in two stages, and
the first stage covered the minimum facilities needed by EdiH in
Port-au-Prince through 1978.
2.1.2     The First Power Project had included the initial stage
(1976-1978) of the power development program, and the Second Power Project
covered the second stage of the program, for the period 1978-1983.
Consultants carried out a long-term pre-investment study ane confirmed the
need for the p-ojects included in the second stage of the program. The
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) funded this pre-investment study,
for which the Bank acted as executing agency. IDA had no difficulty with
the project design during project preparation because the technical aspects
of the second project were a continuation of the First Power Project and
the basic requirements and technical criteria had already been agreed
during execution of the First Power Project.
2.1.3     In June 1978, IDA staff appraised the Project and discussed with
a CIDA mission the financing plan, defined the responsibilities of
consultants to be financed by each institution and prepared a schedule of
actions to be taken by EdH, IDA and CIDA for expeditious processing of both
credits. The Government and EdH agreed with the financing plan, schedule,
and the resulting list of goods. Post-appraisal missions visited Haiti in
September 1978 and January 1979 to focus on issues that arose from
Government arrears (para. 2.5.1), joint use of poles by EdH and, TELECO,
the telephone cmpany of Haiti (Annex 2, para. 3c), additional diesel units
for Cap Haitien (para. 3.10.2), and project implementation schedule and
possible financing for a third diesel unit in Varreux (para. 2.3.1). IDA
staff, the Government and EdH reached agreements on these issues.
2.2       Project Description
2.2.1     The appraisal report defined the Project as consisting of:
(a)  Project components financed by IDA:
(i) 15 MW additional diesel generating capacity at the Varreux
power station in Port-au-Prince and 1.5 MW in Cap Haitien;



(ii) Rehabilitation of about 30% of the distribution network in
Port-au-Prince;
(iii) Consultant services for the project, for the preliminary
design of a new head office building, and for studies related
to the management and operations of EdH;
(iv) Consultant services for the completion of the Peligre dam
study; and
(v) Training of EdH staff;
(b) Project components financed by EEC:
(i) 7.8 MW additional diesel capacity at Varreux power station in
Port-au-Prince; and
(ii) Expansion of one 115/69 kV substation and communications in
Varreux;
(c) Project components financed by CIDA:
(i) generation capacity of 2.0 MW in Cap Haitien, 1 MW in a new
power station at Port-de-Paix and 250 kW in a new power
station at Miragoane;
(ii) Expansion of one 115/69 kV and five 69 kV substations
(Petionville, Carrefour and Croix des Bouquets); construction
of about 27 km of 60 kV lines;
(iii) Renovation and expansion of the distribution networks at
Port-de-Paix (16 km of 12.46 kV lines, 600 kVA in transformer
capacity) and Miragoane (18 km of lines at various voltages,
275 kVA in transformer capacity); and
(iv) Consultant services and training for the project components,
2.3       Participation of other Financing Agencies
2.3.1     The European Economic Community (EEC) Special Action Account
financed an additional diesel unit for Port-au-Prince, for commissioning in
December 1981. The appraisal report indicated that even after two diesel
units financed by IDA had been commissioned in 1981, in 1982 a power
deficit of 1.4 MW could be expected in Port-au-Prince under dry weather
conditions. In January 1979, IDA proposed and the Government agreed that
the full EEC Special Action Account allocation for Haiti (US$6 million) be
used to finance the foreign costs of a third diesel unit, substation and
communications at the Varreux power station. The availability of these EEC
funds allowed Haiti to bring the reliability of power supply for 1982 to
better standards.



-4-
2.3.2     The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), which
appraised the Project jointly with IDA, financed the transmission and
substation expansion in Port-au-Prince, and the thermal generation
expansion and distribution network renovation in provinces, including the
corresponding consultant services and training, (para. 2.2.1.c. and Annex
4). The Government of Haiti relent the proceeds of the CIDA grant to EdH at
an interest rate of 8%, a grace period of four years and a maturity of
twenty years.
2.3.3     The Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (KfW) financed, under other
projects, distribution network renovation program in nine provinces during
1978-1983.
2.4       Retroactive Financin
2.4.1     Retroactive financing of about US$1.1 million was included in the
Project to finance the purchase of 2x850 kW diesel units for Cap Haitien
and the corresponding consultant services. The precarious power situation
of the generating equipment in Cap Haitien, which was old and operating
poorly with daily power supply curtailments, justified the immediate
installation of these units. The new diesel units were satisfactorily
commissioned in December 1978, as'scheduled, although technical problems
developed in the next years due to poor maintenance.
2.5       Negotiations, Board Presentation, Credit Signing and
Effectiveness
2.5.1     No major problems delayed negotiations or Board presentation.
Board presentation was conditioned to: (i) make satisfactory arrangements
for future settlements of public sector electLicity bills; (ii) a 9 percent
increase in average tariffs for fiscal year 1979; and (iii) establishment
of _ joint commission between EdH and TELECO to regulate the joint use of
poles and the renewal of their networks wherever power and telephone lines
met. The two first conditions were met. As regard the third condition, the
Government agreed to appoint the commission by September 30, 1979.(Annex 2,
para. 3c)
2.5.2    On April 17, 1979, IDA approved a credit of US$16.5 million. IDA
also acted as administrator for an EEC Special Action Account credit of
US$6.0 million for the Project, in accordance with an agreement between IDA
and the EEC. The IDA credit and the EEC Special Action Account credit were
made to the Government of Haiti on standard IDA terms. The Government
relent the proceeds of the credits to EdH - with the exception of funds
(US$0.5 million) required for the Peligre dam study (para. 2.2.1.a) - at
the Bank rate prevailing at that time ( 8.0% ) and a maturity of 20 years
including a 4-year grace period. On May 31, 1979 representatives of the
Government of Haiti signed a Development Credit Agreement with IDA, and a
Special Action Credit Agreement with IDA as administrator of the Special
Action Account established by the EEC member states. Representatives of
EdH, IDA and EEC Special Action Account - IDA acting as administrator -
signed a Joint Project Agreement. The Special Action Credit Agreement was
cross effective with the Development Credit Agreement.



-5-
2.5.3    IDA conditioned effectiveness of its Agreements to: (i) the
signature of a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to IDA for the
relending of the proceeds of the credit, and (ii) the confirmation by CIDA
that it would finance the remainder of the foreign cost of the project
(Can$17.1 million). The same conditions applied to the Special Action
Agreement. Effectiveness was postponed four times to allow EdH to reach
agreement with CIDA (an agreement was finally signed in November 28, 1979)
and to allow the Government to prepare the legal opinion on the
agreements. Due to these factors, IDA did not declare the credit agreement
effective until April 21, 1980, about eight months late. As discussed in
the next chapter, this delay was not a major factor in the late start of
the Project.
2.6       Major Covenants
2.6.1     Annex 2 sets forth major covenants of the toint Project and
Development Credit Agreements. The Government complied with the covenants
of the Development Credit Agreement, except for Section 4.03 concerning
electricity bill payments; this problem was later solved when, as a
condition for negotiation of the Fourth Power Project, the Government
settled its overdue accounts receivable with lump sum payments (para.
5.2.3.). EdH complied with the covenants of the Joint Project Agreement,
except for Section 3.02 concerning the reduction of losses (para. 4.1) and
Section 4.03 concerning the rate of return covenant, which IDA agreed to
waive (para. 5.2.2).
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.1       Timetable of Project Implementation
3.1.1     Annex 3 set forth actual and foreca.st completion dates for the
various Project components. For the purpose of this report, June 1984 is
considered to be the date of project completion, except as otherwise
noted. EdH completed the Project about one year and a half after the date
expected at appraisal (December 1982). Annex 4 shows the major changes to
the physical components of the project. Annexes 5, 6 and 7 compare actual
and forecast data for project cost, allocation of the proceeds of the
credit and cumulative disbursements, respectively. The following
paragraphs discuss the information contained in these annexes.
3.2       Diesel Expansion Component
3.2.1     EdH completed the diesel expansion of the Varreux power plant
(3x7.8 MW), including the corresponding 115/69 kV substation and
communications in January 1982, four months late although this project
component was postponed in its start for twelve months, due to
controversies within EdH concerning the selection of the lowest evaluated
bidder (para. 3.9.1). The diesel units financed by IDA (2x7.8 MW) and by
EEC Action Account (1x7.8 MW) were provisionally commissioned in September
1981, December 1981 and January 1982, respectively.



- 6 -
3.2.2    Final reception of the diesel units took place only in mid-1985,
after the manufacturer solved, at his cost, major difficulties related
both to the design of the machines and to their operation. In order to
solve the problems and to help EdH in finding an acceptable solution, IDA
arranged several meetings between EdH and representatives of the
manufacturers of the diesel units.
3.2.3    The most important conclusions reached during these meetings were:
(a)  during two weeks of operation EdH had supplied untreated water to
the engines, which require highly purified water, resulting in
scaling in the cooling lines and consequently, burned valves.
Since the problem occurred while the manufacturer's resident
engineer was supervising the plant, the manufacturer agreed to
cover the costs of replacing the valves;
(b)  at the beginning of operation, the diesel units worked at a
maximum load of only 5.5 MW because after a few hours of
operation a "hunting effect" or frequency variation appeared,
which did not allow them to reach the nominal load of 7.8 MW.
This problem was caused by accumulation of dirt in the
turbo-charger nozzles and blades and by high temperature in the
cooling system. Subsequently, the manufacturer either replaced
the turbo chargers by new ones manufactured by another company or
refitted them on site. Additionally, air cooled radiators were
added to increase the cooling capacity for each group by 25%.
As a result of these repairs, the 'hunting effect" was corrected
and the units operate at rated capacity; and
(c)  engine case fissures developed near the base plate of the three
units at the same location where four similar engines in Honduras
presented problems. In October 1984, the manufacturer agreed to
replace the eaitire engine block in unit No. 7, the one with the
worst fissure problems.
3.2.4     To solve all these problems, EdH requested an extension to the
credit closing date to December 31, 1985, which IDA approved. Final
reception tests, completed by mid-1985, were satisfactory to EdH.
3.3       Distribution Network Renovation Component
3.3.1     EdH carried out the renovation of the distribution network
assigned to this Project (para. 2.2.1.a.), but due to cost increases
(para. 3.3.2), the scope of this component was reduced and was completed in
April 1984, with a delay of about two and a half years. According to
the appraisal estimates, most of the Port-au-Prince distribution network
was in poor condition, which caused high distribution losses (para. 4.1).
About 30% (12 km2) of the network needed to be restored under the Project.
Delays resulted from the President of EdH's decision to change consultants
in July 1980 (para. 3.9.1). The new consultants lacked experience with
Haitian conditions. The planning task for this project component was



- 7 -
considerably larger than envisioned; existing city mapping was incomplete
and only inaccurate network drawings were available. Customer connection
information had to be obtained in site. In order to reduce the delay and
maintain the project cost within the availability of funds, IDA
recommended, and EdH agreed, to construct a pilot project of one kiM to
help EdH obtain basic network design parameters. This pilot project was
executed at Carrefour in Port-au-Prince, ard in addition, Distribzttion
Standards were prepared and issued in May 1983.
3.3.2    The cost of the distribution network renovation was underestimated
at appraisal because no engineering studies were available at the time.
EdH and IDA resources were only sufficient to cover the cost of the pilot
project expanded to 2 km2 and the equipment and materials for an additional
area of 10 km2. The financing for construction of this area was provided
under the Third Power Project, which together with the Fourth Power
Project, completed the renovation of the network.
3.4       Other Project Components Financed by IDA
3.4.1     Preliminary design of headquarters.  A preliminary design of
EdH's s adquarters was prepared by consultants based on a manpower study
covering the period 1982-1987. This design led to a high cost estimate
due to the costly foundation required and to the high construction
standards recommended by the consultants. IDA suggested changes to the
design to lower the cost, which were considered in the final design
prepared by new consultants, who designed a building of a light structure
and more in line with Haitian standards and yet very functional to EdH's
needs. The building is being constructed with funds from the Third Power
Project.
3.4.2  Training.   Despite initial delays, EdH implemented the training
program satisfactorily. A center for training diesel station operators,
financed by IDA, was opened in the second-half of 1982. Through the First
and Second Power Project, IDA helped to provide training to about ftfty
percent (50%) of EdH professionals, through fellowships abroad, and to
about fifty per cent (50%) of EdH personnel through in-house training.
Results were satisfactory in the financial and administrative areas. In the
technical area some improvements have been achieved in system planning and
technical studies, but a great deal has still to be achieved in engineering
and design, construction supervision and operation and maintenance. The
program was revised in July 1981, with the assistance of an IDA training
expert, and a program was defined to be carried out under the Third Power
Project to assure continuity.   IDA should carry out an ex-post assessment
of the results of EdH's training program.  EdH still has insufficient
qualified personnel at the managerial level and for engineering and
procurement.
3.4.3    Peligre Dam Studies.  In view of Peligre's multipurpose function,
the Government granted to EdH the funds required for these studies.   EdH
contracted with the origirnal designers of the dam a study to assess its



- 8 -
overall safety. The study concluded that urgent repair works were needed
to fix the stilling basin and sluice gate; the repairs were carried out
with IDA funds under the Third Power Project.
3.4.4    In-House ComEuter.  A computer financed under Credit 895-HA (para.
3.6.2) was installed in June 1982 and computing programs were successfully
implemented in the following areas: customer billing, general ledger,
payroll, and stock management. EdH with the assistance of the
administrative consultants (para. 3.9.2) supervised the installation of the
computer and implemented the programs, and now EdH counts with modern
pethods of customer billing and accounting.
3.5       Project Components Financed by CIDA
3.5.1     Transmission lines and substations works.  EdH completed this
portion of the Project in May 1984, with a delay of about two and a
half years. The delay can be attributed, on the one hand, to lags in the
preparation of project designs, bid evaluation and contract award on the
part of CIDA and, on the other hand, to some changes introduced by EdH's
consultants to the substation design, which required new studies by CIDA's
consultants. The new installations have improved service reliability and
voltage regulation.
3.5.2     Generation and Distribution in Provinces. The generating diesel
units were commissioned in August 1981, two years late and the distribution
renovation was completed in December 1982, six months late, because of
initial delays in the engagement of consultants, bid evaluation and
contract award on the part of CIDA. The foreign cost of this Project
component is about the same as the appraisal estimate.
3.6       Changes to the Project
3.6.1     Annex 4 shows the major changes to the physical components of the
Project which were mainly related to the generation, transmission and
distribution component financed by CIDA (para.3.5). Additionally, the CIDA
consultants recommended, and EdH approved, to supply power to Miragoane
with a 23 kV line from Petit Goave, instead of installing 250 kW diesel
units as originally expected. The IDA-financed distribution component
suffered changes as a result the low estimate of its cost at appraisal and
of the delay caused by the consultants (para. 3.3).
3.6.2     As a result of the increasing volume of accounting work,
including payroll and stock control functions, EDH proposed in January
1982, and IDA agreed, to amend the description of part (d) of the Project
to include an in-house computer (para. 3.4.4).
3.7       Project Cost
3.7.1     Because of the changes in scope discussed earlier, the final
costs are not strictly comparable to the appraisal estimates. The final
project cost estimate based on EdH data is US$40.94 million (Annex 5), 5X
lower than the appraisal estimates, mainly because local coats were lower



(27x) than the appraisal estimates. The foreign cost of ehe project was
about the same as the 'ppraisal estimate, despite favorable exchange rate
developments during project execution. The foreign cost of the Varreux
extension was lower than the original estimate due to devaluation of the
foreign currency in which most of the contracts were placed. The cost
overrun on consultant services was due to the replacement of technical
consultants in the middle of the project execution. This replacement caused
work duplication (para.3.9.1) and extra costs for personnel mobilization
and initial familiarization with the project. The savings from the cheaper
diesel Varreux extension went into financing the higher consultants costs.
3.8       Allocation of Credit Proceeds and Timing of Disbursements
3.8.1     The increase of costs for consulting services (para. 3.7.1),
additional costs for the preparation of the Third Power Project and changes
in the materials requirements for the distribution network component (para.
3.3.2), together with the exchange rate changes of foreign currencies with
respect to the dollar, led EdH to seek, and IDA to agree, to a
reallocation of Credit proceeds (Annex 6). Initial poor performance of the
consultants for distribution network renovation contributed to the
corresponding delays of disbursements (Annex 7).
3.9       Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.9.1     The initial  performance of the technical consultants was
poor. The first technical consultants in charge of the Varreux expansion
and distribution network renovation, which were engaged under the FPrst
Power Project, were replaced unilaterally by the President of EdH in June
1980; IDA subsequently agreed to this decision (para. 6.1.2). These
consultants had already prepared the largest part of the standard network
design aid mapped part of the city when they were replaced.
3.9.2     The new technical consultant differed in opinion from the
previous consultants on how to reach the objectives set and needed time to
adjust to the particular situation in Haiti. In the design of the
distribution network renovation of Port-au-Prince, the initial performance
of these consultants was unsatisfactory, because of the lack of: (i)
qualified personnel assigned to the Project in the field; (ii) coordination
of activities performed by consultant personnel in its headquarters; and
(1ii) understanding of Haiti's local conditions. IDA held several meetings
with representatives of the consultants to discuss EdH's complaints. After
constant pressure by IDA and EdM, the consultants proposed a new
organization and personnel assignment. They improved their work in the
areas of construction activities, diesel installation, electric studies and
investment program. The final result was a relative improvement in their
performance. However, the consultants really never provided the quality of
assistance needed by EdR.
3.9.3     The second consultants were given the opportunity to comment on
the assessment given in para. 3.9.1 above, The following is a
transcript of the consultants comments:



- 10 -
"The Consultants replaced the first consultant, upon request from
EdM, to execute engineering services according to a program   p
approved by IDA. At first, the new consultant followed the
procedures and methods established by the first technical
consultant for the design of the distribution network renovation.
However, after evaluation of the approach adopted by the previous
consultant and discussions with EdU, the Consultants recommended
a new approach for the execucion of the services. This new
approach, accepted by EdH, put the emphasis on the use and
training of EdH's personnel on site to permit a transfer of
technology.
Such major changes in working methods were not accomplished
without many discussions. They entailed delays of execution in
certain occasions. However, standards for all aspects of the
distribution networks (materials, design and construction) were
established with the full support of EdH and are still in use at
EdH more than four years after completion of the Second Power
Project.
As a conclusion, the Consultants cannot agree with this Report's
statement concerning the quality of their assistance. They
strongly believe that the quality of their services was of a high
standard and reiterate that they always had the full support of
Edi."
3.9.4    The performance of the administrative consultants was
satisfactory, The main results obtained from their work were: (a) the
implementation of the present organization, including selection of
personnel, traIning, and the organizational manual; (b) organization of
inventory control, document filing and electricity fraud control; and (c)
the installation of a computer and programs for customer billing,
accounting and payroll.
3.9.5    The performance of contractors and suppliers was generally
satisfactory, with the exception of the supplier for the Varreux expansion,
which first failed to delifer a proven design (para. 3.10.1). This
was later solved to EdH's satisfaction. This contractor was able to offset
the initial delay (para. 3.2) reducing the execution period of this project
component by seven months. The electrical equipment was delivered as
scheduled.
3.10      Procurement
3.10.1    A procurement dispute was one of the causes for the initial delay
in the execution of the Project. IDA had agreed with EdH's request to
initiate the procurement process for two 7.8 MW diesel units for Varreux
power station before Board presentation and bids were opened in February
1979. After the evaluation was made and approved by IDA, EdH requested to
award the contract to the second lowest evaluated bidder because of its
unsatisfactory experience with the machine's cooling and fuel distribution



- 11 -
systems in a similar equipment purchased from a different supplier imder
the First Power Project 2/ which caused Edf to be extremely conservative
in seeking performance assurances for this type of equipment. A report
prepared by EdH recommending disqualifying the lowest bid was considered
unsatisfactory by IDA on the grounds that supporcing technical information
was incomplete and thus IDA objected to the disqualification of the lowest
bidder. IDA's comments on the procurement process led to a protracted
discussion with EdH, and this dispute introduced substantial delays in
project execution. As a consequence of the delay, the Government dismissed
the top managers and EdH's technical consultants (para. 6.1.2). Finally,
EdH signed the contract with the lowest evaluated bidder on April 18,
1980. The purchasing of a third diesel unit for Varreux expansion was
subsequently included in the contract, as the availability of EEC financing
was ascertained only after bid evaluation (para. 2.3.1,).
3.10.2    CIDA was not able to parti~ipate in the financing of two 850 kW
diesel units for Cap Haitien, since CIDA's procurement regulations were not
taken into account in the bidding documents prepared by EdH and its
consultants. In order to avoid delays, these units were financed by the
Government and commissioned during 1979, as scheduled.
3.10.3    Procurement for the other Project components financed by both IDA
and CIDA, was carried out by IdH and the new technical consultants with
minor problems. All IDA financed equipment and materials and consultant
services were procured in accordance with the respective Bank grout.
Guidelines. All CIDA financed equipment and materials were procured in
Canada under CIDA's procurement regulations.
IV. PROJECT'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND JUSTIFICATION
4.1       Losses
4.1.1     During the period  1978-1984 energy losses in Port-au-Prince
remained higher (about 30%) than those forecast at appraisal (Annex 9),
thereby producing a slower than forecasted increase of revenue (para.
5.2.2). IDA continuously requested EdH to address the loss problem through
a strong campafgn of theft suppression, and through the renovation of the
distribution network and system operation improvement to reduce technical
losses (para. 4.1.2). EdH established a "Theft Suppression Committee"
chaired by the General Director and advised by EdH's administrative
consultants. As a result, losses began to decrease, from 32% in 1983 to 26%
in 1984.
4.1.2    One of the reasons for high technical losses was the low power
factor in the grid, i.e. Peligre hydro plant operated at a power factor 3/
lower than 80%, which resulted in higher than normal value of current ind
the transmission system and consequently higher losses. To correct the
problem, EdH, with the advise of IDA, prepared a study on reactive power
compensation at the distribution level and subsequently purchased 22 MVAr

(Credit 645-HA), December 30, 1980.
3/   The power factor is an electrical term which measures the efficiency
of use of electrical equipment.



- 12 -
of switched and unewitched capacitors for installation in the distribution
substations, which resulted in a substantial decrease in losses.
4.1.3    The renovation of the distribution network in several provinces
have helped to reduce drastically losses from 27% in 1979 to 15% in 1984.
All tihese renovation works have been completed. EdH and IDA expect similar
success will occur in Port-au-Prince with the Third and Fourth Power
Projects.
4.2       Project Justification
4.2.1     The main objectives of the project were: (a) to provide EdH with
generation, transmission and distribution facilities needed to meet the
increased demand in Port-au-Prince and provinces; (b) to improve EdH's
finances through adequate pricing and through a reduction in system
losses; and (c) to increase institutional and managerial efficiency at EdH
and establish a training program for its personnel. The first set of
objectives was attained, though with delays. The financial objective was
only partially achieved, as losses were not reduced as scheduled. The
institutional objectives were suastantially attained and the training
program was carried out satisfactorily.
4.3       Rate of Return on Investment
4.3.1     The staff appraisal report estimated a rate of return of 7.5%,
based on the investment program as a whole. This is the method customarily
followed in power projects, because it is not possible to allocate benefits
to specific investments. The actual rate is estimated at 6.5%; lower sales
volume than initially projected were compensated by electricity rates
increases.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1       Actual and Forecast Financial Data
5.1.1     Annexes 9 to 12 compare actual and appraisal forecast financial
data for the years 1979-1985 in the areas of key financial ratios, income
statements, sources and application of funds and balance sheets. The
following paragraphs discuss the information set forth in these Annexes.
5.2       Actual and Forecast Financial Performance
5.2.1     EdH's finances improved gradually in the period 1979-1985.  Sales
increased at an average 8.3% per year, lower than the 12% forecasted. This
was due to slow economic growth which mainly affected the industrial
sector. Rates of return on revalued assets in operation averaged 5.4%
during the period. Although revenue levels were lower than those required
to earn the covenanted rates of 7% in 1979, 7-1/2% in 1980 and 8% in 1981
and thereafter, they were adequate to meet EdH's cash requirements because
the Government provided additional financial assistance and because EdH's



- 13 -
investments were lower than originally planned (as a result of the slow
economic growth). In 1983 EdH's finances deteriorated because of an
extremely dry season, which required them to increase the utilization of
their thermal plants, thereby increasing expenditures on fuel by nearly
100% over the level of the previous year.  Moreover, because of the
failure of thermal generating units at Varreux (para. 3*2.2), idE had to
hire portable emergency thermal units from outside Haiti to help supply
the power needs of Port-au-Prince. Due to the rationing that became
necessary, electricity sales fell 41 and the rate of return was close to
zero.
5.2.2.    IDA monitored EdT's financial performance closely and waived
the rate of return covenant because EdH gross internal cash generation was
sufficient to cover its debt service and to finance a reasonable increase
in working capital and the portion of its investment program not financed
by foreign loans. EdH also applied the policy of automatic quarterly fuel
clause adjustments to compensate for increases in fuel prices since 1979,
following IDA recommendations.
5.2.3     EdH had liquidity problems, due to the increase in the average
collection period from 45 days in 1978 to 130 days in 1983. This increase
reflected the Government's difficulties in making timely payments to EdH
for electricity bills. During project execution, IDA expressed to the
Government and EdH its concern about the evolution of Government arrears
which reached up to 619 days in 1983. The Government made efforts to reduce
the arrears, but did not succeed in fulfilling its commidtment. IDA raised
this issue in the Fourth Power Project (Credit 1527-0-HA) and the
Government signed an agreement with EdHI, satisfactory to IDA, to settle the
arrears accumulated up to September 1984, over a period of three years. As
agreed, the first payment was made in fiscal year 1984/1985 by compensating
it with interest payments due by EdH to the Government for IDA's Credits.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1       The Borrower and the Beneficiary
6.1.1     Edi is reasonably well managed and well organized and has made
efforts to improve its financial position.  EdH's management improved
considerably as a result of the direct assistance of the administrative
consultants. A new organization was satisfactorily implemented during
project execution, mainly affecting the regional orgauization, to
decentralize activities (except centralized billing and main accounting)
maintaining close head office supervision in the application of the common
rules and regulations.
6.1.2     When a new cabinet was formed in late  1979, the new Minister of
Public Works dismissed, without prior consultation with IDA, the General
Manager, the Technical Manager and the technical consultants in charge of
the Varreux expansion and the renovation of the distribution network, whom



- 14 -
he deemed responsible for the initial delays of the Project. IDA
subsequently did not object to these dismissals.
6.1.3     The Government established in October 1983 a verification program
of imports to reduce import-duty evasion. This produced long delays in the
import of components for all EdH's projects because of extra time
required to verify current prices and to obtain approvals. IDA suggested to
the Government, and the Government agreed, to provide written instructions
to custom offices to expedite EdH's orders in view of the importance of the
power projects to the economy of the country.
6.1.4     Much of the experience gained with the construction of the diesel
units for the Varreux power station under the First Power Project was
incorporated by EdH in the contract for the diesel expansion under the
Second Power Project. The supplier provided a full time resident engineer
to train EdH personnel and supervise the operation and maintenance of the
units for two years. Additionally, the supplier replaced all the required
parts (para 3.2) for the diesel units without cost to EdH.
6.1.5     The preparation of standards for distribution at medium and low
voltage has allowed EdH to standarize the medium voltage in provinces at 23
kV and 12.5 kV in Port-au-Prince. These standards now comprise conceptual
design and engineering, customer connection and metering, general
conditions of supply and joint use of poles by EdH, Teleco and Tele Haiti.
EdH has gained experience in distribution work and has prepared specialized
crews to continue the renovation of the distribution network under the
Third and Fourth Power Projects.
6.1.6     Planning of external aid coordination for the Power Sector in
Haiti is being satisfactorily managed. As requested by IDA, a Technical
Cocordinating Committee was established in 1982 to coordinate the actions of
the various financial agencies and consultants involved in EdH's projects.
The scope of the annual meetings covers technical matters, and the review
of the progress achieved by EdH, and of its future plans and of the
financial needs of the sector.
6.2       IDA
6.2.1     IDA devoted an exceptionally large amount of staff time to the
supervision of this project (about 25 staff weeks in 16 missions), mainly
due to the series of problems (technical and consultant services) which
adversely affected its implementation. This was justified given EdH's lack
of skilled staff.
6.2.2     IDA staff worked very closely with the consultants during project
execution and contributed successfully to its implementation, by
stimulating action to improve consultants performance, and by participating
in the review of the distribution network renovation design. IDA also
helped EdH to arrive at a solution to the problems presented with the
expansion of Varreux power plant.



- 15 -
6.2.3     The Power Sector of Haiti requires IDA's assistance to further
strengthen EdH's management, help define power sector policies and provide
technical support. IDA is currently assisting EdH to overcome the
personnel problems (para. 3.4.2) due to insufficient qualified personnel at
the managerial level and for engineering and procurement, through training
programs included in the Third and Fourth Power Projects. IDA plays a
leading role in helping EdH to secure cofinancing, and other agencies rely
on IDA's assessments and recommendations to provide financial support to
projects in the sector.
VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1       A Successful Project
7.1.1     The proceeds of the credits were usefully invested even though
the reduction of losses in the quantities and time expected were not
attained. The delay in initial project execution did not affect the
provision of electricity, except in 1983 due to the failure of diesel unit
at Varreux (paras. 3.2.2 and 5.2.1). Most of the delays can be attributed
to the poor performance of the consultants and also to EdH's proclxrement
dispute (para. 3.10).
7.2       Supervision of Equipment
7.2.1    The problems discussed in para. 3.2.2 suggest that when dealing
with equipment of a new design, special attention should be paid by the
Borrower and IDA to (a) the contractual obligation of the manufacturer
regarding equipment guarantee, and supply of spare parts during the
guarantee period, and to (b) supervision of commissioning tests by
experienced personnel representing the Borrower.
7.2.2     In its review, IDA should ensure that technical specifications
are very specific both to protect the owner and to avoid conflicts with the
bidders. Some areas that deserve special attention are: (a) acceptance or
not of new designs or engines tried only at test benches; (b) minimum
rating (or overrating) of auxiliary equipment such as heat exchangers, fuel
pumps, turbo-changers, valves, diameter of stack (or back-up pressure
requirements); and (c) manufacturers obligation to have qualified personnel
in the field for up to three years after plant operation, to be responsible
for maintenance and to train Borrower's personnel.

1/  Cost overrun on consulting services was due to the replacement of consultants-
in the middle of project execution, this replacement caused work duplication
and extra costs for personnel mobilization and initial familiarization with
the project.
2/ Price and physical contingencies are included in each item.
3/ Due to rate of exchange fluctuations, EEC Special Credit 4-HA only reached the
equivalent of US$5,771,697.95 when fully disbursed, rather than MUS$6.0
estimated at appraisal.
4/ Overall project cost is shown here, as no inforaation is available from CIDA
- or EdR on detailed cost of the components financed by CIDA.
5/ Local cost for IDA financing project components are estimated as EdH did not
maintain accurate records. Only total local cost was available.
