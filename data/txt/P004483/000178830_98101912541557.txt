INTRODlUCT IO
1.01       Development strategy and related requirements for human resource
development in the Philippines have undergone a shift in emphasis since the
nid-1970s. Throughout the l960s and early 1970s, development policy stressed
growth in output in agriculture, traditional exports and large-scale industry.
More recently, facing limits to further agricultural expansion, public
resourze constraints and problems of unemployment, development strategy has
changed. Emphasis is given to greater self-sufficiency in food production and
energy, agricultural diversification and development of small and medium scale
manufactures (including nontraditional exports) to generate productive
employment and alleviate poverty. Particular priority is given to providing
opportunities to the rural population to adopt improved agricultural methods
and to acquire new, off-farmn skills to maintain or generate productive
employment and to raise incomes.
1.02       The development strategy supports the widespread provision of basic
infrastructure and services, including education, as requirements for achiev-
ing productivity and employment objectives. Both the economic development
process and the task of subsequent learning (through work or future education)
are enhanced by general education. The knowledge, attitudes and skills devel-
oped through effective basic education are essential for attaining development
objectives. Recent research demonstrates a positive relationship among basic
education, farm productivity, health and ability to adapt to socio-economic
change./I
1.03       Despite relatively high participation rates, basic education in
the Philippines requires strengthening to achieve the desired development of
skills. In the first (elementary) cycle of educat.in, disparities, reflected
in regional variations in student participation and achievement, remain; the
average quality of education, reflected in student performance on standard
achievement tests, is low; and inefficiencies, reflected mainly in dropout
rates, persist. To support the development strategy, improvements in the
quality of basic education, with emphasis on reaching Large numbers of disad-
vantaged youths, are required.
1.04       During the mid- and late-1970s, the Government began to address
the problems of its basic education system. It initiated a program for text-
book development and production (assisted by the Bank through Loan 1224T-PH),
developed and experimented with a revised curriculum and educational radio
for elementary education (the latter assisted by the Bank through Loan
S-8-PH), and launched a regular program for the expansion and replacement of
school facilities. A 1977 Bank sector memorandum recommended that further
attention be directed towards improving the quality and efficiency of basic

education./l  During 1979 th-e Government prepared a ten-year development pro-
gram designed to reduce disparities and improve overall quality and efficiency
in elementary education./2  Thnis program was submitted to the Bank to support
a request for a loan -in October 1979 and forned the hasis for Bank pre--
appraisal during Novenher-December 1979.  Appraisal was carried out during
Septemiber-October 1980 /3 with foLlow-up in February 1981.
1.05       The Oovernment-s development program (1981-90) addresses the main
policy, management and quality issues in elementary education. Revised
policies for finance and management would be introduced to reduce disparities
in educational opportunity and to support general improvements in quality and
efficiency.  Further modifications would be made in the organization and
functions of the main agencies involved in the sector to improve management
and planning.  Development funds would be allocated for curriculam develop-
ment; provision of textbooks and related materials; facilities and equipment;
monitoring of teacher supply; staff development; and sector evaluation. The
proposed loan of USSI0O0 million would help to finance development comnponents
scheduled during the four year period 1982-85.
1.06       The Bank thas previously supported six education projects in the
Philippines.  (Related loans and credits have amounted to US$108.7 million)./4

No. 1704-PH)
/2  Entitled Program for Decentralized Educational Development - Elementary
Education, EPPITAF, September 1979.
/3  Consisting of Mrs. E.L. Schreiber (economist, mission leader) and
Messrs. H.r. Chai (educator), S.Z. Sung (educator) and P. Neumann
(textbook publisher and consultant).  Mlessrs. S. Sigurdsson (architect),
D. Jamison (evaluation specialist) and J. Rose (management specialist,
consultant) and Ms. N. Birdsall (evaluation specialist) also visited the
Philippines in connection with preappraisal of the project.
/4  The first project (Loan 393-PUH, 1964), completed in 1973, assisted in
developing the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture at
Los Banos; the second (Credit 349-PI4, 1973), completed in 1973, centered
on the development of two regional agricultural colleges, 13 agri-
cultural high schools, and 10i technical and three technician training
institutes; the third (Loan 1224T-PH, 1976), for which the recommended
closing is scheduled for June 1982, was designed to reduce a severe
textbook shortage in elementary and secondary education; the fourth
Loan 1374-PIU, 1977) is designed to furth,er strengthen selected facilities
at the University in Los Banos, develop a college of agriculture in the
Visayas and introduce nonformal training to farmers; the fifth
(Loan S-8-PUi, 1973) supports experimentation with development of
educational radio for classroom use and inservice teacher training; and
the sixth (Loan 1786, 1979) is designed to strengthen technical and
managerial manpower and research for fisheries development.



Four of these have centered on developing technical and managerial manpower
for agriculture and fisheries.  Two projects have focussed on improving basic
education through experimentation with educational radio and through the pro-
vision of about 30 million textbooks to students in public elementary and
secondary schools (para. 1.04). The Educational Projects Implementing Task
Force (EDPITAF), created in 1972 on an ad hoc basis to provide expertise in
educational developmnent, has had overall responsibility for the execution of
these and other externally-assisted education projects. Generally, implemeni-
tation of the projects has been satisfactory and objectives have been largely
achieved. However, earlier projects have also met with some implementation
constraints. The completion and audit reports have been prepared for the
first project (IBRD Report 820) and the completion report for the second
project is being prepared. General lessons relata to. (a) the importance of
providing local financing in a timely manner; and (b) the need for improved
procedures to expedite procurement.  Experience gained from more recent
projects confirms the importance of sufficiently advanced preparation prior to
project appraisal and implementation. These concerns have been addressed in
preparing the elementary education program.
1.07       Bank financing is recommended to support the development program for
elementary education.  The program is central to the Government's overall
development objectives to achieve widespread provision of basic services, to
support rural development and to increase productivity. The program addresses
the major issues in elementary education and arrangements for management and
financing have been organized to achieve objectives.
2. ISSUES IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION
Overview
2.01       Enrollments in elementary education in the Philippines expanded
rapidly during the 1960s and early 1970s and nearly doubled between 1965
and 1979. By 1979, about 7.7 million children, including more than 80% of
those in the relevant age group (7-12), were enrolled in elementary schools.
Despite this relatively high participation rate, substantial changes are
needed in the elementary sector to improve the quality and coverage of basic
education.
(a)  Policy Problems.  Financial and administrative policies have
contributed to an uneven development of elementary education.
Policies for financing and the utilization of teachers perpetuate
disparities in educational opportunity and an inappropriate balance
among educational inputs (e.g., teachers and mnaterials) provided.
Policies for student admissions and progression further reduce the



- 4 -
productivity of elementary education.  Revised policies are needed
to support improvements in the quality, coverage and efficiency of
elementary education.
(b)  Management Problems.  The management structure for elementary
education is inadequately organized to guide sector development in
accordance with the national development strategy. Rigidities and
inefficiencies in the schooling process derive largely from the
absence of effective support from the center and from incomplete
planning efforts. A fragmentation of management responsibilities
contributes to additional problems of functional overlap and poor
coordination. The structure, functions and staffing of agencies
involved in elementary education na d to be oriented towards
effective management and planning.
(c)  Performance Problems.  The impact of policy and institutional prob-
lems is evident in variations in student participation an-a achieve-
ment. In the regions, the availability of facilities and teachers
differs as does the relevance of the curriculum, teaching methods
and instructional materials. Moreover, average student achievement
in basic skill areas (i.e., the language arts, mathematics) is low.
Both disparities in educational opportunity and more general quality
shortcomings need to be corrected to improve sector performance.
Main Issues
Policy Problems
2.02      Policies for financing and administration have detracted from the
effectiveness of elementary education. Emphasis has been given to enrollment
expansion (primarily by expanding the teaching force) with inadequate atten-
tion to quality, efficiency and regional variations in student performance.
Policy weaknesses are reflected in the main outcomes of elementary education:
on average, student achievement scores are a third lower than the designated
norm; and 35% students entering grade 1 never complete the six-year edu-
cational cycle.
2.03      Sector Finance.  The Central Government carries the main responsi-
bility for financing elementary education./l In 1980 capital expenditure
on elementary education amounted to about US$4.00 equivalent per student and

recurrent expenditure to US$42.00 per student.  W4hile the level of recurrent
expenditure Falls within the lower range for Asia,/l the main constraints to
Improvements in t'he quality and coverage of elementary education are found in
policies for allocating funds. Development and recurrent appropriations are
allocated in equal portions to the regions on the basis of standard appropria-
tions per student enrolled. The policy discriminates against regions with
large numbers of children not in school and provides no compensatory financing
for regions where student achievement is low. Further, allocations by cate-
gory of recurrent expenditure are poorly balanced. Of the total recurrent
appropriation for elementary education, 98% is allocated for salaries and
administration and 2% (about US$0.80 per student) is available for other
inputs. The resulting gap in resources available for instructional materials,
classroom supervision, teacher upgrading, and mnaintenance of facilities is
substantial.
2.04       The share of public expenditure on education appears to have stabi-
lized after a recent period of decline (20% of public expenditure was
allocated for education in 1973 by comparison with 14% in 1979). However,
significant increases in real recurrent expenditure per student in elementary
education will not likely be made in the near future. In order to expand the
coverage and raise the quality of elementary education, improvements in
cost-effectiveness are required. Revised policies and guidelines for the
allocation and use of resources, by region and by type of expenditure, are
needed.
2.05       Teacher Utilization.  Adequate financing for nonsalary expenditures
from recurrent appropriations would be available if the policy for teacher
utilization were more effective. One classroom teacher is responsible for
classes of students in grades 1-4 while subject matter teachers are used in
grades 5 and 6. In 1979, the average student-teacher ratio in elementary
education was about 31:1. However, the ratio was 40:1 for grades 1-4 and 20:1
for grades 5 and 6 (for which 42% of teachers were serving 27% of the stu-
dents). The lower student-teacher ratio in grades 5 arnd 6 is attributable
largely to the underutilization of the subject teachers: the teacher-class
ratio is 2:1 on average (e.g., the subject teachers work on average 50% of the
time). Present requirements for teachers would be reduced by about 14%
(35,000 teachers in 1979) if the teacher class-ratio at grades 5 and 6 were
reduced to 1.2:1. Such a policy change is needed to improve efficiency and
free resources for nonsalary expenditures.
2.06       Student Admissions and Progression.  Present practices for student
admissions and the policy for advancing students from grade to grade contri-
bute to problems of poor student admissions, which requires that children

enter grade 1 at age seven, is appropriate but ineffectively enforced. In
1979, some 15% of students in elementary schools were over- or under-aged
while 26% of seven year olds were not enrolled at all. The policy for
advancement bases promotion on the results of a single year-end examination.
The elementary curriculum includes a relatively large number of subjects to be
covered in detail. Inadequate time is available for diagnostic testing and
remedial instruction prior to final examinations, and 8% of students enrolled
repeated grades during the mid-1970s. Research findings suggest that both
teaching and learning are most effective when children are grouped with age
peers./l Results of recent studies further suggest that grade repetition does
not necessarily improve the performance of low achievers and can create morale
problems that lead to the dropout of such students./2 MIore effective enforce-
ment of the admissions policy and revised procedures for student evaluation
and progression are needed to raise achievement and survival rates. Due to
the high dropout rate at present, eight years (rather than the prescribed six)
are required to produce a graduate and the efficiency of the system is 76%./3
IManagement Problems
2.07      The principal agencies involved in elementary education are the
Bureau of Elementary Education and the Office of Planning Services in the
national offices of the 'Ministry of Education and Culture (MIEC), the Regional
Offices of the MEC, and the Government's Textbook Agency. The tIEC's 13
Regional Offices were created in conjunction with a 1974 reorganization of
Government agencies: at that time routine responsibilities for educational
planning and administration were transferred from the center to the regions.
Control over policy, budget, curriculum and the mass development and produc-
tion of textbooks was retained at the national level. The decentralization
effort was intended to improve the responsiveness of education to local needs
through effective planning and management at the regional level. However,
appropriate modifications in the organization, functions and staffing patterns
of agencies involved were not undertaken. As a result, management weaknesses
persist at both the central and regional levels. The problems are manifest in
a lack of systematic support for the regions, poor coordination of sector
activities and incomplete planning.

/3 In 1978/79 graduates numbered about 930,000 and represented a useful
outcome (including repetition) of 5.58 million student-years (930,000 x
6). The total number of student years required to produce this result
was 7.34 million (the sum of student cohorts from grade 1 in 1973/74
through grade 6 in 1978/79). The efficiency of the system was thus
5.58/7.34 = 76%.

2.08       Bureau of Elementary Education and the Regional Offices.  The
Bureau of Elementary Education (BEE) is charged with recommending policies
for elementary education and guiding sector management.  However, the BEE½s
authority and functions are poorly suited to the implementation of these
responsibilities. The BEE lacks a direct line of coamunications to the
Regional Offices of the MEC (both report 7irectly to the MIinister, MEC, as
shown in Chart 2.1). It also lacks a clear mandate for coordinating sector
management and development.  As a result, the BEE serves essentially as a
staff agency. Its three main divisions have concentrated on developing
experimental curricula and materials, related inservice training and
facilities standards. Minimal attention has been given to the review and
revision of sector policies and systematic guidance and support services for
the regions have not been provided. Important services (i.e., inservice
training for teachers) are provided on an ad hoc basis by several agencies.
These agencies (e.g., the BEE, the Textbook Agency) often work directly with
the regions (through the Minister) but independently of each other.
2.09       Each Regional Office of the NEC has a division for elementary
education which is directly responsible for managing the local school
system. These divisions consist of 12-15 subject matter specialists offi-
cially assigned to positions as school supervisors. In practice, they
conduct minimal school supervision and are organizationally too far removed
to do so effectively. Classroom supervision of teachers is carried out by
an additional 12-15 subject supervisors located below the regional level in
eachn provincial or city office of the MEC. Below the provincial level, a
district superintendent is directly responsible for a group of about 8-15
schools.  While staff of the elementary divisions are informally grouped to
carry out general administrative responsibilities, they have not been fully
prepared (through regular guidance from the nationa'l level or on-the-job
training) for managing the regional school systems.  A shortage of basic
office equipment (i.e., typewriters, photocopiers, calculators), both in the
BEE and in the regional divisions for elementary education and the absence
of suitable facilities for the in-service training of regional staff also
detract from management effectiveness.
2.10       The main consequences of institutional constraints in the management
of elementary education include: the lack of systematic guidance for the
regions, the concentration of administrative authority in the Office of the
Minister, and a resulting inability of the Regional Offices to effectively
implement their decentralized responsibilities. In addition, inadequate
coordination of sector activities results in inefficiencies in the provision
of supporting services. Functional and organizational changes are required
in the BEE and the regional divisions for elementary education to enable
them to carry out their respective responsibilities; and revised staffing
patterns and staff upgrading are required to improve administrative
efficacy.  Supporting equipment for the BEE and the Regional Offices, and
regional training centers should also be provided.

2.11       Office of Planning Services and Regional Planning Staff.  Broad
parameters for education policy at all levels are set by NEDA, the National
Economic Development Authority. Within the MEC, the Office of Planning
Services (OPS) is charged with responsibility for coordinating planning
carried out by the Regional Offices and for preparing national plans and
budget requests for education. However, organizationial and staffing weak-
nesses in the Regional Offices and within the OPS have impeded development of
a reliable data base and the systematic analysis of issues needed for
educational planning.
2.12       Since its creation in 1975, the OPS has worked to establish a
management information system (MIS) to support educational planning. During
the late 1970s, it initiated a scheme for collecting regional statistics on
elementary education. Initial weaknesses (e.g., overly complicated forms,
nonreporting) have been partially overcome but incomplete and inconsistent
data remain problematic and limited access to computer time slows processing.
In addition, the data focus on student participation. Information on the
availability of educational inputs, efficiency, quality and costs is lacking.
Further, the Regional Offices of the MEC are inadequately organized and
staffed to provide comprehensive data and to carry out related planning. Each
Regional Office has a position for one planning officer but lacks a
permanently staffed planning unit. Data collection and planning are carried
out on an ad hoc basis by borrowed personnel (teachers, principals,
supervisors) often unfamiliar with statistical and planning techniques.
2.13       Further problems arise from a fragmentation of the planning process
within the OPS and from related staffing constraints.  The OPS has three
divisions for research and statistics, projects and evaluation, and pro-
gramming and planning.  These divisions concentrate on data compilation, pro-
gramming and budgeting, and special projects, respectively. However, analysis
of data in elementary education and monitoring of performance are not carried
out systematically.  The statistics division has insufficient staff with
expertise in quantitative methods and computer use to carry out the required
data analysis and projections. The projects and evaluation division focusses
on experimental projects and research rather than on continuous monitoring and
evaluation of performance. The elementary education unit within the
programming and planning division lacks experience in preparing analytical
plans and medium-term programs and is underserviced by the other OPS
divisions.
2.14       Without systematic analysis of sector data and issues, information
for policy formulation by the BEE as well as for sector planning has been
inadequate. To improve planning and policy formulation, functions and
staffing patterns within the OPS should be modified to support systematic
evaluation of sector performance; permanent planning units should be estab-
lished and staffed in the regions; and the MIS should be expanded to include
information on the quality, efficiency and costs of elementary education.



- 10 -
Related staff development programs at both the central and regional levels
and improvements in data collection and processing techniques are also
required.  The OPS is in the process of purchasing two mini-computers to
resolve problems of computer access.  However, office equipment (mainly
calculators and typewriters) is in short supply and required both for the
OPS and for planning in the regions.
2.15      Textbook Agency.  The Government's Textbook Agency (para. 1.06) was
created in 1976 to reduce a severe textbook shortage in public elementary and
secondary schools (in 1975 one textbook was available on average for each 10
students in elementary schools).  The Agency has made considerable progress in
building a capacity for developing, producing and distributing textbooks.
However, it was created on a temporary basis and lacks permanent arrangements
for financing and staffing. The Agency has suffered the loss of trained staff
owing in part to the absence of employment security. In addition, the
temporary responsibilities of the Textbook Agency have overlapped with the
regular responsibilties of government agencies (i.e., the Agency has provided
inservice training for teachers on the use of new textbooks without the close
involvement of other agencies, para. 2.08). Further, the division of
responsibility for educational publishing, between the Government and
publishers in the private sector, has not been clarified. In the past few
years the Textbook Agency has largely pre-empted the market for elementary and
a substantial portion of secondary textbooks. A Textbook Board in the MEC is
responsible both for managing the Textbook Agency and for approving textbooks
published by the private sector for use in public schools. However, this
Board has had inadequate resources and representation (with three members) to
develop a suitable policy for private sector participation; and, in practice,
the Textbook Board-s participation in management of the Textbook Agency has
focussed on day to day decisions rather than important policy questions.
2.16      In order to ensure continuing availability of textbooks and to
consolidate institutional gains made to date, permanent status is required
for the Textbook Agency. Emphasis would need to be given to ensure the
cost-effectiveness of procedures for regular publishing operations in the
public sector. In particular, inefficiencies encountered by the Textbook
Agency in paper procurement (para. 1.06) and in the distribution of textbooks
need to be resolved. A clarification of responsibilities, based on the
Government-s long-term policy for providing textbooks, is also required to
resolve problems related to the ad hoc status of the Textbook Agency and to
support the development of a healthy publishing industry in the private
sector.
Performance Problems
2.17      The most striking performance problem in elementary education is the
low productivity evident in average student achievement and survival rates



- 11 -
(para. 2.02). However, these averages conceal significant interregional
variations in participation and achievement. The degree of variation for
selected indicators, as represented by the Gini coefficient /1, is greatest
for cohort survival as shown on Table 2.1. Actual variations in enrollment,
survival and achievement are shown in Table 2.2. The differences are

Average Achievement Scores                              0.10
explained by both home /2 and school factors. School-related determinants
of variations in regional performance derive largely from shortcomings in
the curriculum, instructional materials and teaching methods and from
variations in access to classrooms and teachers.
2.18      Curriculum and Teaching Methods.  The elementary curriculum includes
an average eight subjects per grade (beginning in grade 1). /3 The average
weekly schedule of 30 hours is allocated approximately as follows:  22% of
time for Pilipino; 16% for English; 10% for mathematics; 10% for health and
science; 6% for social studies; and 36% for physical education, music and art,
citizenship and practical arts. The time allocated for mathematics is low
/1 The Gini coefficient is used as a measure of dispersion. The coefficient
ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 representing a perfectly equitable
distribution. For the purpose of analysis of inequities in first level
education, extreme disparities would be indicated by Gini coefficients of
0.20 or higher and moderate disparities by coefficients of 0.10-0.20.
/2 No regular fees are levied by the Government for elementary education
and 95% of children enrolled attend government schools. It is noted,
however, that regions with substantially lower than average enrollment,
survival or achievement rates (Table 2.2) are mainly characterized
by higher than average proportions of rural population (average 70%)
and higher than average poverty incidence (average 45%). (The parti-
cularly low enrollment rate in Central Mindanao in 1978/79 is, however,
mainly explained by political disturbances.)
/3 This compares with an average of six subjects per grade in Singapore and
Hong Kong.

by international standards while that for the practical arts (17% of weekly
hours beginning in grade 3) is high for elementary education. The allocation
for language arts compares favorably with time devoted for first and second
language teaching in Singapore and Hong Kong. However, a particularly heavy
burden is placed on more than half of children in the early grades.  For about
60% of the population, the national language (Pilipino) is not the mother
tongue. Students from the relevant population groups (largely in the Visayas
and Mindanao) must learn and work in three languages during grades 1 and 2.
2.19       Teachers are held accountable lor covering the details of eight
subject syllabi but are often unable to do so by the end of a school year.
Gaps in the students' conceptual and practical knowledge result because
follow-up is not provided in the next grade. This weakness, which is related
to the absence of regular diagnostic testing and remedial teaching during the
school year, (para. 2.06), contributes to problems of poor student achieve-
ment.
2.20       Problems with teaching and evaluation techniques are reinforced by
supervisory practices.  The subject supervisors in each provincial (or city)
office of the MEC carry out classroom supervision (para. 2.09). While super-
visors, like teachers, generally possess the necessary formal qualifica-
tions, they lack experience with techniques for remedial instruction.
Further, budget allocations for regular school supervision are inadequate
(para. 2.03) and supervisors are rarely able to visit schools as often as
planned (e.g., about 18-20 days per month). These constraints are linked with
weaknesses in preservice and inservice teacher training: inadequate control is
exercised over the content of preservice training; and regular inservice
upgrading for teachers is not provided (para. 2.08).
2.21       Shortcomings in the curriculum and teaching methods largely explain
the low productivity in elementary education and account in part for regional
variations in student achievement and survival. Results of standardized
achievement tests indicate that despite the relatively high number of class-
room hours (30 hours compared with 25 hours in Hong Kong and Singapore),
insufficient emphasis is given to the development of basic skills. The
MEC's Survey on the Outcomes of Elementary Education (SOUTELE) reveals the
following: on average graduates of elementary schools can answer less than
50% of test items correctly (average score 48% compared to a designated
learning norm of 75%, shown on Table 2.2 for 1979) and score lowest in reading
and mathematics. In accordance with SOUTELE recommendations, a simplified
curriculum focussing on basic subjects is required to raise overall levels of
achievement and to reduce disparities. Use of a second language approach for
teaching English and (as relevant) Pilipino would also improve comprehension
and reading abilities in the early grades. Accompanying modifications in
teaching and evaluation techniques need to include provisions for remedial
teaching.  The content of preservice teacher training programs should also be
reviewed with a view to making necessary adjustments and upgrading for
supervisors and school staff would be required.

2.22       Instructional Materials.  A general shortage of instructional
materials has contribluted to the performance problems in elementary
education. The textbook shortage is presently being eased through the
textbook project assisted by Loan 1224T-PH (para. 2.15). About 25 million
textbooks have been produced and distributed to elementary sc'hool students
and a ratio of one textbook in each subject for every two students is
targeted for 1985/86. The importance of textbooks as a determinant of
student achievement in the Philippines is confirmed through initial
evaluation of project results: in three jbre subjects (Pilipino, science
and mathematics) a random sample of students using project textbooks
received significantly higher scores on achievement tests (by an average of
12%) than a control group.  However, shortcomings in the quality and
relevance of the present generation of textbooks and related teacher rmanuals
parallel more general weaknesses in the curriculum and teaching methods.
Initial results reveal that textbooks in some subjects are too long or
complex and less relevant for rural than urban students. Related problems
derive from the absence of special materials for low or high achievers and
from the absence of special series to cater for different language back-
grounds (para. 2.18). At present, authors, drawn mainly fromn four curri-
culum centers,/l and content editors in the Textbook Agency lack experience
in preparing special materials. While emphasis is placed on the need for
suitable textbooks and teachers editions, at least 40% of elementary schools
lack other basic instructional materials (i.e., maps, charts). Efforts are
underway to develop and produce such materials at the local level using
local resources. Decentralized Learning Resource Centers, operated by
teachers, have been designated for this purpose.
2.23       Despite the considerable progress made since 1976 in reducing
the textbook shortage, further developmental work is required to ensure the
effectiveness of basic textbooks over the iext 10-15 years. The revision
of existing textbooks and the planned development of new titles should be
carried out with a view to supporting a simplified curriculum and improving
the relevance of materials for special client groups. An expanded pool of
authors and training to improve editorial expertise would be required to
carry out these tasks effectively. A complementary effort, to provide basic
teaching aids throughout the elementary system, is required.
2.24       Facilities.  In 1978/79, some 187,000 classrooms (of which over
8,000, or 4%, were designated as dilapidated and overdue for replacement) were
available in 27,400 elementary schools. Table 2.3 shows an overall shortage
/1 Four curriculum centers conduct research in particular subject areas
for elementary and secondary education.  Those for science and mathe-
matics, languages and the practical arts are located in universities.
A center for social science is located in the MEC.

of 16,300 classrooms and regional variations in average class size during
the 1978/79 school year.  In practice, the number of students per classroom
varies from less than 20 students to more than 70 and reflects both under-
and overutilization of facilities.  However, overcrowding is the more common
result. Further, access to the complete six year cycle is reduced by the
absence of facilities for grades 5 and 6 in a third of all elementary
schools and basic equipment (e.g., blackboards as well as school projectors
and duplicators) and furniture items are lacking in about 40% of schools.
2.95       In 1978/79 only 74% of seven year olds entered grade 1 and over
1.2 million children aged 7-12 were not attending school. The imbalance in
the allocation of classrooms contributes to problems of nonparticipation
and poor quality through overcrowding. The Government's program for the
construction of classrooms (para. 1.04) has begun to reduce overall
shortages. However, to reduce disparities in the provision of facilities
and in access to the six year educational cycle, the MEC needs to adopt
systematic criteria for school location and facilities planning.
2.26       Teachers.  The availability of teachers also varies from region to
region. Table 2.4 shows that average student-teacher ratios range from a
high of 39:1 (Southern Mindanao) to a low of 25:1 (Ilocos). More signi-
ficant variation is found intraregionally: in rural areas, a student-teacher
ratio on the order of 50-70:1 is common (often combined with multigrade
teaching) and highs of 110:1 are reported. )The differences in student-teacher
ratios are attributable in part to the policy for teacher deployment (para.
2.05). Schools offering less than the six year cycle of education have higher
student-teacher ratios than those using subject teachers in grades 5 and 6.
The absence of systematic procedures for matching admissions in teacher
training institutions with local requirements for teachers also result in
disparities in student-teacher ratios. Extreme teacher shortages contribute
to repetition and dropout (the incidence of which is greatest in the early
grades) through excessive class size and related weaknesses in the quality of
teaching.  The MEC needs to address this problem and proposes to do so by
monitoring teacher demand and supply at the regional level.
3. SECTOR PROGRAM FOR ELEMENTARY EDUCATION
Strategy
3.01       The Government's ten-year development program (1981-90) directly
addresses the main policy, management and performance issues in elementary
education. The main objective of the program is to improve student partici-
pation and achievement, with particular emphasis on regions with low
performance standings. To achieve this objective the Government would:
(a) introduce revised policies for sector financing and management to raise
quality and reduce disparities; (b) effect institutional changes to strengthen

3.02       Policies.  Under the developnent prograrm the following policies for
finance and manageazent mould be intro(duced to strengthen elementary educAtion:
(a)  a new formula would 'he use(i in allocating development expenTi tIIr-s
to give priority to regions vJith below average performance;
(b)  allocations for recurrent expenditures vould be apportioned to

(c)  the teachier-class ratio would be reduced to iLmprova the
effec-.iveness of teacher utilization; and
(d)  policies for student adnissions and progression would be ,iodified to
improve p-ct i ity and increase participation rates.
3.03       Managenent.  To improve the responsiveness of elementary education
to both national development strategy and regional needs the following
institutional modifications Would be carried out:
(a)  the functions and authority of th-ie BEE and the functions of tlhs
re-ional divisions for elementary education  ould be miodified to
improve sector managenent;
(b)  the functions and or,-anlzation of the OPS would be expanded
and regiornal planning units established to strengthen planning; and
(c)  the Textboo)kr Xgency uould be converted to a pertianent governTiment
c3rporation responsible for supplying texthooks to students in
public schlools.
3.04       Performance.  Together with the pol'cy and institutional changes,
i,rrove.ients in student performance would he achieve' through:
(a)  the introduction of a revised curriculum and improved teaching
methods and instructionaicl ciaterials;
(b)  an equitable distribution of facilities and teachers among thie
regions;
(c)  the provision of staff development programs for the central
and regional agencies involved with elementary educationi and for
school principals and teachers; and
(d)  the introduction of systematic moaitorinig and evaluation of sector
performance.

The development program would provide financing for curriculim development,
development and production of instructional materials, facilities and
equipment, the monitoring of teacher supply, staff development, and sector
evaluation.
The Sector Development Program
Policy Changes
3.05       The policy changes to be introduced under the development program
are designed to improve the effectiveness of elementary education.
The new financing policies give emphasis to reducing interregional dispar-
ities and raising quality.  The modified policies for teacher utilization,
student admissions and student progression would raise overall efficiency
and student achievement.  These policy changes are embodied in a program and
policy statement for elementary education submitted to the Bank by the
Government at negotiations. During negotiations the Government agreed that
it would consult with the Bank in the event that major changes in these
policies or in other components of the development program are required.
3.06       Regional Expenditure Allocations.  The new formula for the regional
allocation of development funds would give priority to regions with below
average performance.  The formula is based on a weighted indicator of defi-
ciencies in student enrollment, survival and achievement, and on the distri-
bution of the school-aged population. It would replace a formula for standard
allocations per student enrolled (para. 2.03).  In 1980, the average perfor-
mance rating for thie country in terms of the weighted indicator was 0.36,
ranging from a high (poorest performance) of 0.47 in Central Mindanao to a low
(best performance) of 0.27 in Ilocos and Manila. In accordance with these
ratings and the distribution of the school-aged population among the regions,
initial guidelines for investment under the sector program would be as
follows: 32% of development funds would be allocated for four regions with
below average performance (accounting for 27% of the age group 7-12); 35% for
five regions with roughly average performance (34% of the relevant popu-
lation); and 33% for four regions with above average ratings (39% of the
population). Details of the revised financing policy and the allocation
formula are provided in Chapter 4, (Management and Implementation of the
Sector Program, para. 4.17 and Annex 4.). A similar formula would be used to
allocate increments to recurrent appropriations for elementary education.  The
revised allocation policy is designed to reduce disparities in educational
opportunity. In particular, shortfalls in the availability of facilities,
equipment and teachers (through recurrent allocations) would be reduced. In
addition the largest share of investment for staff development and
supplementary instructional materials would be directed towards the regions
with the poorest performance.



- 20 -
3.07       Apportionment of Recurrent Expenditures.  Allocations for recurrent
expenditures would be reapportioned to achieve an appropriate balance between
salary and nonsalary items (para. 2.03). To improve quality and efficiency,
allocations for items other than salaries and administration would be
increased fromn 2% to a targeted 7% of recurrent expenditures between 1981 and
1990. The share of salaries and administrative costs would decline from 98%
at present to about 93%. Real expenditure for other items would be increased
from less than US$1.00 per student at present to nearly US$3.00 by 1990. This
amount would be adequate to finance planned improvements in quality and the
regular maintenance of school facilities. Some 2%-3% of total recurrent
appropriations would be allocated for instructional materials and supplies;
2%-3%o for school supervision and in-service training; and 1% for maintenance
of facilities.
3.08       Teacher Utilization.  Under the development program a revised policy
would be effected to improve the efficiency of teacher utilization
(para. 2.05).  The average number of teachers per class in grades 5 and 6
would be reduced from 2.0 to a targeted 1.2. The targeted ratio would allow
for appropriate flexibility in the scheduling of teaching hours while signi-
ficantly improving efficiency. The improvements in teacher utilization would
be accomplished chiefly by assigning teachers to classes at more than one
grade level keeping them in (or close to) their subjects of specialization.
The revised pattern for teacher deployment would lead to an increase in the
student-teacher ratio from 31:1 at present to 36:1 by 1986/87. This increased
ratio would reduce total requirements for teachers by about 46,000 (16%) by
1990/91 (Table 3.1). The resulting savings in recurrent expenditure,
amounting to about US$50 million in 1985/86 and to US$60 million by 1990/91,
would free resources required for planned nonsalary expenditures without
raising the real recurrent cost per student.

3.09      Student Admissions and Progression.  Enforcement of policy for
student intake would be strengthened and the policy for student evaluation and
progression would be revised to raise participation and achievement rates
(para. 2.06). Age at intake would be gradually normalized to raise the
proportion of 7-year olds entering grade 1 from 74% to 90%. This will be
accomplished by introducing a national scheme, reinforced by community and
school officials, to encourage parents to enroll children at age seven. In
addition, a scheme to improve progression rates would be introduced to support
an increase in cohort survival from 65% to 86% (Table 3.2). This improvement
would be achieved mainly through the introduction of revised techniques for
evaluation and teaching. Students' performance would be assessed through
regular diagnostic testing. Results would be used to match programs of study
with students' learning abilities. Emphasis would be given to raising the
achievement of below average performers to acceptable levels while students
(or groups of students) with average or above average achievement levels would
be encouraged to progress further. On average, 65% of class hours would be
used for regular instruction while 35% would be used for remedial or
enrichment teaching as appropriate. This revision in the use of class hours
would be achieved through the introduction of a revised curriculum (discussed
in paras. 3.25-3.26, below). The more formal assessment of students'
progress (i.e., through end-of-year examinations) would also focus on the
testing of skill levels achieved in core subjects. Students unable to reach



- 22 -
appropriate skill levels by the end of the school year (estimated at up to
4%) would be retained in grade. More effective enforcement of the intake
policy and the revised progression policy would improve the access of the
school-aged population to the complete cycle of elementary education and
raise achievement and efficiency. A decline in the average number of years
required to produce a graduate (from 8 at present to 6.7 by 1990/91) would
increase the system's productivity from 76% to 90% (Table 3.3). A savings
of 16% in real recurrent expenditure per graduate (i.e., per student
completing grade six) would result from this gain (i.e., a decline from
US$55 equivalent per graduate to US$45).
Management Changes
3.10      Under the sector development program institutional modifications
are being introduced to strengthen sector management. Included are changes
in structure, functions and staffing patterns within the principal agencies
involved in elementary education. Related staff development programs would
be provided among expenditure components.

3.11      Bureau of Elementary Education and the Regional Offices.  The BEE's
present functions and authority have been modified to enable it to guide the
development and management of elementary education effectively (para. 2.08).
The Bureau would perform the following functions:
(a) provide (or arrange for provision of) regular advisory, supervisory
and support services in the regions;



- 24 -
(b) coordinate sector activities at the national and regional levels;
and
(c)  formulate and update recommendations for sector policies and
procedures.
In accordance with the objectives of the 1974 reorganization of government
agencies, the regions would continue to be directly responsible for managing
elementary education. However, the BEE would provide regular assistance
to the regions to guide the use of sector policies and procedures and to
upgrade regional administrators and teachers. For this purpose a ministerial
order has been introduced which assigns the BEE a line authority for technical
supervision over the regions. The BEE's three main divisions would be res-
ponsible for introducing guidelines and standards for the development and
utilization of curriculum and materials, staff and physical facilities and
for coordinating related activities at the central and regional levels. The
curriculum and materials division created a permanent coordinating committee
in October 1980 and began work on a revised curriculum (para. 2.21).
Included as members of this committee are representatives of the Textbook
Agency, the curriculum development agencies, the OPS and regional educators.
Each of the BEE divisions would participate in continuous review of sector
policies and procedures, with particular emphasis on sector financing. This
task would be carried out in liaison with the OPS and the Financial Manage-
ment Service of the MEC (responsible for administering MEC expenditures,
Chart 2.1). Results would be used to advise the Minister on matters of
policy. To assist the BEE in carrying out these functions, several staff
would be appointed to fill gaps in technical expertise, notably in systems
management, educational financing and planning, teaching and evaluation
techniques and evaluation and facilities design. These staff were designated
by the BEE prior to negotiations. During negotiations an understanding was
reached that these staff would be formally appointed during the 1982 budget
year, in accordance with regular procedures for creating new positions. In
addition, the BEE prepared an overall staffing plan for the period 1982-85
which was reviewed by the Bank prior to negotiations and found to be
satisfactory.
3.12      In the Regional Offices of the MEC, staff of the divisions for
elementary education are being reorganized to strengthen their managerial role
(para. 2.09). They would be responsible for monitoring the implementation of
sector policies and programs in accordance with BEE criteria and standards and
would provide related assistance to the provincial and district authorities.
The revised functions would parallel those of the BEE and staff are being
organized in three main units for curriculum and materials, staff development
and facilities development.
3.13      In implementing its revised responsibilities, the BEE would con-
tribute to improved quality and relevance in regional administration and to
improved coordination among the agencies working in elementary education.



- 25 -
The reorganization of the elementary education divisions in the Regional
Offices would strengthen regional management arrangemaents and eliminate
supervisory responsibilities which cannot easiLy be fulfilled (para. 2.09).
(Regular school supervision would continue to be conducted below the
regional level by the provincial level supervisors and district
superintendents.)
3.14      Office of Planning Services and Regional Planning Units.  The OPS
would retain its responsibilities for coordinating regional planning and
preparing national :)lans and budgets for education.  To strengthen its
contributions, the       would:
(a) maintain a comprehensive information system (based
on regional statistics) for educational planning;
(b)  undertake systematic monitoring of sector performance; and
(c)  provide assistance to the regions in sector planning.
3.15      To provide these services, organizational and staffing changes are
being carried out within the three OPS divisions (paras. 2.12-2.13). The
research and statistics division would be strengthened through appointment
of an experienced data systems analyst and two computer programmers to carry
out improved data processing, analysis and forecasting. Data on school
quality, efficiency and costs would be added to existing MIIS data for elemen-
tary education. The projects and evaluation division would be mainly
responsible for systematic monitoring of sector performance. A new unit for
school location planning, to be headed by a facilities planner, is being
added to that division to monitor the availability of facilities and to
support improved planning and budgeting for school construction at the
elementary and secondary levels (para. 2.25). The planning and programming
division would also be strengthened through the appointment of two
experienced planners and a budgeting analyst. A new unit, responsible for
financial analysis, is also being created within that division to assist the
sector-specific (e.g. elementary, secondary and higher education) units in
assessing the cost-effectiveness of operations and in establishing priori-
ties among sector needs to accommodate budgetary constraints. A facilities
planner has been designated by the OPS and staff for the other key positions
have been recommended. During negotiations an understanding was reached
that qualified staff for these key positions in the OPS would be appointed
in 1982.  Overall staffing plans for the OPS during 1982-85 were reviewed by
the Bank prior to negotiations and found to be appropriate.
3.16      Permanent planning units have been created by ministerial order to
replace the ad hoc units in each of the regional offices. The maain
responsibilities of these units would be to prepare medium-term plans for
educational development, annual programs and related budget requests on a
priority basis. Regular activities would include the collection,
compilation and analysis of educational data; the preparation of related
projections; and the provision of advisory services to subregional



- 26 -
(provincial, district and school) authorities responsible for providing the
raw data. Prior to negotiations at least six staff were designated for
each of the 13 regional planning units.  Included are staff for the positions
of economist, statistician, educational planner (one of whom would head
the unit at a level equivalent to a regional division chief of the MlEC),
demographer and program analyst. During negotiations an understanding was
reached that these staff would be formally appointed in 1982.
3.17      The organizational changes and expanded functions for the OPS and
regional planning units would support improved analysis of issues in
elementary education as required for sector policy reviews and planning
(para. 2.14). In carrying out its expanded functions, the OPS would provide
advisory services to the central and regional agencies involved with
educational planning and would help arrange for related in-service training.
In the elementary sector, liaison with these agencies would be provided
through the BEE.
3.18      The Instructional Materials Corporation.  The Textbook Agency
would be converted into a permanent government corporation, the Instructional
Materials Corporation. Such status, which includes exemptions from a number
of government regulations (i.e., schedules for staff remunerations, procure-
ment regulations), would be sufficient to consolidate the achievements of the
Textbook Agency (paras. 2.15-2.16). In creating the Corporation, several
modifications would be introduced in the organization and functions of the
present Textbook Agency and MEC's Textbook Board. Chief among these are the
replacement of the existing Textbook Board by an Instructional Materials
Council, independent of the Corporation; the introduction of revised
publishing responsibilities for the Corporation; and changes in the
organization and financing arrangements for textbook publishing by the
Government.
3.19      The Instructional Materials Council would be responsible for
approving textbooks and supplementary and reference materials appropriate for
the curricula in elementary and secondary schools (both public and private);
and for supporting educational publishers in the private sector by securing
and introducing measures to encourage participation. The present Textbook
Board has been unable to effectively implement its responsibilities largely
due to inadequate representation and support (para. 2.15). The new Council
would therefore have an expanded Board of Directors chaired by the Minister of
Education and including representatives from publishers in the private sector.
In addition, it would be serviced by a permanent secretariat. During
negotiations, understandings were reached that by October 1981 the MEC would:
complete plans for purchasing instructional materials from private publishers,
including statements on related incentives and the limits of the Government's
publishing responsibilities; and designate the Board of Directors and staff
for the Council's secretariat, with formal appointments scheduled for 1982.
3.20      The Government's long-term policy on instructional materials
supports the provision of basic textbooks for all students in public
elementary and secondary schools. Over the medium-term, the Government plans



- 27 -
to provide one textbook per subject for ev_ry two students./l The
Instructional Materials Corporation would be charged with formulating and
implementing plans and programs for the development, production or procurement
and distribution of instructional materials in accordance with this policy./2
The Corporation would give priority to providing textbooks, teacher editions
and supplementary materials for the elementary level. Publishing activities
would be carried out in accordance with standards and criteria set by the
Instructional Materials Council. Regular consultation with the relevant MEC
bureaus would also be carried out to ensure adequate coordination between
curriculum and materials development (paras. 2.08 and 3.11).  During 1981-83
the Corporation would complete the production, manufacture and distribution of
secondary textbooks developed under the textbook project assisted through Loan
1224T-PI. Thereafter, it is expected that the Corporation would provide some
or all of these materials as prototypes to be adapted, published and sold by
the private sector publishers. The Corporation would act in behalf of the MEC
to procure and distribute such materials for use in public schools.
Responsibilities previously carried by the Textbook Agency for training
teachers in the use of books would be integrated into inservice training
programs to be provided through the MEC bureaus.
3.21      Both equity capital and regular financing for the Corporation
would be provided by the Government (though sales to the private sector would
also be permitted under the Corporation's charter). Equity and operating
appropriations would he provided by the Bureau of the Treasury. Initial
capitalization would consist of working capital and the transfer of accu-
mulated assets of the Textbook Agency to the Corporation. Among fixed assets
to be transferred are included an administrative complex and a central ware-
house in Manila which have not been completed as a result of delays attri-
butable to change orders and price escalation. During negotiations arrange-
ments were finalized to ensure adequate financing for completing these works.
An understanding was also reached that a revised or new contract for these
facilities would be signed by October 31, 1981. Regular appropriations for
development and publishing activities would derive from annual orders placed
by the 2IEC. Order amounts would be based on requirements for new or revised
editions and replacements to reach and maintain the Government-s targeted
student-textbook ratio. The MEC would be charged for textbook orders on a
cost-plus basis at prices required to sustain operations. Any surplus from
sales would be used for financing the development of supplementary materials
or returned to the Government in the form of dividends. During negotiations
/1 In recent years the Government has provided textbooks free of charge to
students in public schools. A nominal charge is being considered by
the MEC for financially able students.
/2 Initially, the IMC would concentrate on providing basic textbooks and
supporting materials. Eventually, the Corporation would also be
responsible for other (nonprint) instructional materials and possibly
equipment.



- 28 --
an understanding was reached that detailed financing requirements for the
Corporation during 1982-85, and projections for the period 1986-90, would be
prepared with the assistance of short-term consultants by October 31, 1981.
3.22      Organizational and procedural changes would be undertaken to improve
the effectiveness of textbook operations in the public sector. Major changes
include the separation of responsibilities for policy formulation and manage-
ment for the Corporation and for publishing and administration within the
Corporation. A Board of Directors, chaired by the Minister of Education,
would be created for the Corporation. Members would be drawn from the
Ministry of the Budget, the President's Office, and the Educational
Publishers' Association and would include the President of the Corporation.
The Board of Directors would be responsible for overall plans and policies for
the Corporation and for approving major expenditures (para. 2.15). Regular
management responsibilities would be carried by the President and staff of the
Corporation. By comparison with the present Textbook Agency, the Corporation
would have expanded administrative functions. Two vice-presidencies and new
divisions for sales, accounting and administrative services would be created
to carry out the additional responsibilities. Divisions for editing, produc-
tion, manufacturing, evaluation and marketing would be grouped under the
Vice-President/Publishing; and divisions for accounting, administrative ser-
vices, and warehousing and distribution would be grouped under the
Vice-President/Finance (Organization charts for the existing Textbook Agency
and the proposed Corporation are included among working papers in the program
file, as listed in Annex 2.) Operations would be based on central cost
accounting. Revised procedures for the production, procurement and distri-
bution of materials would be introduced to ensure cost-effective operations
(para. 2.16). The Government plans to prepare a medium-term staffing plan for
the Corporation and to appoint the President, Vice-Presidents, a controller
and a business manager by October 31, 1981.
3.23      The proposed charter for the creation of the Corporation and the
Council are appropriate to sustain effective textbook publishing in the public
sector and to support development of the publishing capability in the private
sector (para. 2.16). During negotiations the Government agreed to establish
the Instructional Materials Corporation and the Instructional Materials
Council with authority, responsibilities, staff and resources satisfactory to
the Bank by October 31, 1981.
Performance Improvements (Expenditure Components)
3.24      The revised sector policies and institutional changes to be intro-
duced under the development program would support both general and region-
specific improvements in the effectiveness of elementary education. In
addition to improved participation and survival rates (para. 3.09), an average
increase of 15% in student scores on standard achievement tests (from 48% in
1979 to about 55% in 1985 and 63% by 1990) is targeted between 1981 and 1990.



- 29 -
Planned improvements in the quality and relevance of instructional programs
and in access to facilities and teachers would support progress towards pro-
gram targets.  A new curriculu-m, supported by revised teaching techniques
and instructional materials, would be introduced; classrooms and teachers
would be provided to reduce shortages; staff development programs would be
provided for staff of the MEC and Instructional Materials Corporation to
enable them to carry out revised and expanded tasks effectively; and
systematic evaluation would be introduced to ensure the continued relevance
of policies and programs for elementary education. These inputs would
comprise the expo-"iture components included under the development program
as discussed below kcosts and financing are discussed in Chapter 5).
3.25      Curricullum and Teaching Methods.  Since October 1980, the
curriculum working group (para. 3.11) has developed a revised curriculum.
In accordance with SOUTELE recommendations (para. 2.21), the proposed
curriculum emphasizes basic skills in literacy and numeracy (Table 3.4).
The number of subjects in grades 1-2 would be reduced from eight to three,
i.e., Pilipino, English and mathematics. Elements of the arts and social
sciences would be incorporated into the teaching of these subjects. In
grades 3-6, environmental education would be added as a fourth and separate
subject. It would include units for the sciences, arts, social sciences,
practical arts and physical education. Time allocated for each of these
units would vary depending upon the grade level. However, emphasis would be
given to the arts and social sciences in grades 3-4 and to the sciences,
social sciences and practical arts in grades 5 and 6. The reduced number of
subjects would permit a planned doubling in the share of class hours
allocated for mathematics to correct the shortfall in the present curriculum
(para. 2.18) as well as an increase in the share for English.
3.26       Teaching objectives and methods would be reoriented to support the
revised curriculum. Teaching goals would be set on the basis of students'
progress towards absorbing basic skills and concepts (paras. 2.19 and 3.09).
In addition, techniques for second language teaching in English and Pilipino
(for nonnative speakers) would be introduced in the early grades to improve
comprehension and reading abilities (para. 2.21). The revised financing
policies would enable provincial supervisors to provide regular support for
teachers (para. 3.07). The efficiency of school supervision would also be
improved by orienting supervisors to review at least two (related) subject
areas during school visits.
3.27      The revised curriculum would be completed during December 1981 and
introduced grade by grade during 1983-88. The new core curriculum, together
with revised techniques for teaching and measuring achievement, would assist
students in the early grades to achieve improved skill levels in the language
arts and mathematics. These results would lead to improved performance in the

higher grades (para. 1.02). The quality gains would support improvements in
progression rates and achievement of related targets for cohort survival.
Financing for curriculum development has been provided through the use of 1981
allocations for the investment program. Further support would be provided to
finalize details and make adjustments required on the basis of initial
experience.
3.28      Instructional Materials.  Under the development program, the
Government's targeted ratio of one textbook for every two elementary students
in each subject and grade would be reached by 1985/86 and maintained there-
after (para. 2.22). This would be accomplished through the implementation of
a second phase of textbook development, production and distribution to be
carried out by the Instructional Materials Corporation. The Corporation would
focus on improving the quality and relevance of basic textbooks to support the
new curriculum. Improved effectiveness in publishing activities would be
achieved through use of new author groups, strengthened editorial services and
revised procedures for production, distribution and procurement (paras. 2.16
and 2.22).
3.29      A ten-year publishing program (1981-90) has been prepared for the
elementary sector by the Textbook Agency. Approximately 110 million basic
textbooks would be produced and distributed between 1981 and 1990./I
Included in the basic series are three textbooks for grades 1-2 (for Pilipino,
English, mathematics) and five textbooks for grades 3-6 (for Pilipino,
English, mathematics, science and social studies). In addition, some 6 mil-
lion teachers' editions as well as special series (i.e., materials for
children in non-Pilipino speaking areas) and supplementary materials (work-
books, pamphlets, readers and other materials for remedial teaching and
enrichment), would be provided to support the basic textbooks and to meet
specific regional needs. The publishing program is appropriately designed to
improve the relevance of materials and meet quantitative targets. It is
expected, however, that adjustments would be required from time to time to
maintain appropriate coverage and to service particular needs. Detailed
working papers on the publishing schedule, by year and title, are available in
the project file (Annex 2).
3.30      The second generation of basic textbooks would be developed and
introduced between 1983 and 1990 as shown in Table 3.5.
/1 This number of copies is based on 50% of projected enrollments by grade.
Annual replacement at 15% of copies in circulation and the introduction
of a revised or new edition for each textbook in the basic series every
four years are also assumed.

The revised and new editions in this series would be geared to the abilities
of the average student and teacher in both rural and urban environments.
They would focus on basic skills and concepts, moving from the simple to the
complex. Particular inprovements would be achieved through a simplification
of the language used in mathematics and science textbooks, for which English
is the medium of instruction; the use of second language techniques for
English and Pilipino for nonnative speakers (para. 3.26); and revisions in
the social studies series to improve its relevance to Philippine history and
culture. The series would be supplemented with the region-specific, reme-
dial and enrichmlent materials.  Under the development program, remedial
and region-specific materials would be financed in accordance with the
revised formula and guidelines for the allocation of development funds
(para. 3.06).
3.31       A broadened range of author and editorial expertise would be
developed by the Instructional Mlaterials Corporation. While the curriculum
agencies (para. 2.22) would continue to provide manuscript writers, new
author groups would also be created to encourage a variety of approaches.
Some new authors would be recruited from existing agencies (i.e., the
Creative Writing Center at the University of the Philippines, the Children's
Communications Center) and others would be developed. Both the author
groups and content editors within the Corporation would be strengthened
through training to be provided under t'he development program.
3.32      M1Ieasures would also be taken to improve the effectiveness of text-
book development and format. Emphasis would be placed on obtaining reliable
feedback from pilot programs and new series would be tested for a full year.
The replacement of teachers' manuals with teachers' editions (facsimiles of
textbook pages plus instructions for teaching) would support an improved use
of textbooks by teachers. The average nurmber of pages per textbook would be



- 33 -
reduced from 255 at present to 175 in the new series.  This change would
correct weaknesses in the earlier series (para. 2.22) and result in
reductions in book costs.
3.33      Gains in efficiency would be achieved through revised distribution
and procurement practices. Distribution costs would be reduced from about
18% of the average textbook cost to 15% (from P 1.20 per textbook to
P 1.00 at present) by improving the efficiency of delivery. Under the first
textbook project, 54 warehouses were constructed throughout the regions. An
additional 26 warebioises would be constructed under the sector development
program to reduce L,ie distance between stocks and end-users. In addition, the
regional warehouses would be authorized to deliver directly to schools rather
than through the provincial and district offices of the MEC as at present.
Budget provisions would be made to the regions to carry out distribution
responsibilities and a local ordering system would be instituted to reduce the
incidence of delivery shortfalls and surpluses. Delays encountered in the
procurement of paper and printing services under the first project (delays in
arrival of paper stock and in delivery of paper to local printers were common)
would also be reduced. Paper stocks amounting to estimated annual require-
ments would be procured in advance and replenished periodically; and
arrangements would be finalized with an international bank to expedite the
forwarding of documents required for off-loading at the Port of Manila. With
implementation of these measures, printers would be expected to fulfill
contracts within four months and the entire procurement process would be
reduced from a year to six months.
3.34      The new and revised instructional materials would support gains in
student achievement in elementary education with particular attention to
region-specific needs. Tinder the development program support would be
provided for publishing activities scheduled during 1981-90 (e.g., develop-
ment, manufacture and distribution of textbooks and related materials).
Twenty-six regional warehouses, phototypesetting equipment (for preparing
pilot editions) and a resource center (a library of prototype publications)
for the Instructional Materials Corporation would also be provided.
3.35      Facilities.  Facilities and equipment would be provided to meet the
needs of the school system and the agencies managing elementary education.
Office equipment would be provided for the central and regional agencies and
regional training centers would be constructed (paras. 2.09 and 2.14). How-
ever, the major development input would be the provision of classrooms. On
average, 11,000 new classrooms would be provided annually between 1981 and
1990. Included would be about 7,000 classrooms required to meet enrollment
growth and 4,000 (representing less than 2% of stock per year on average) to
replace dilapidated facilities. Funds would also be provided for the
rehabilitation classrooms.



- 34 -
3.36      In order to rationalize the provision of classrooms (para. 2.24),
complete elementary schools (i.e., those offering six grades) and related
equipment and furniture among the regions, revised criteria would be intro-
duced (para.  2.25).  Requirements for classrooms would be determined on the
basis of systematic planning information including school maps, population and
enrollment data, the number of available places per grade and the status of
existing facilities. Priority would be given to expanding existing shools
(rather than to establishing new schools). Additional criteria have been
developed to improve the cost-effectiveness of provision and utilization of
classrooms. Preference would be given to classroom rehabilitation (rather
than replacement) where economically viable (e.g., where rehabilitation would
cost less than replacement and major structural weaknesses are not involved).
Further, where geographically feasible, complete schools would be expanded to
absorb children from nearby schools with enrollments too low to warrant
additional classrooms for grade 5 and 6 students. Otherwise, multigrade
teaching would be used in small schools to provide the full cycle economic-
ally. (Details on the revised facilities planning criteria, which would be
used in preparing and approving regional requests under the development
program, are provided in Annex 4). The Government's standard designs for
elementary classrooms and lists for basic furniture and equipment (i.e.,
photocopiers, science kits, basic tools, etc.) are appropriate. Regular
government policy on the provision of equipment and furniture for elementary
schools delegates financing responsibilities to the regions. Under the
development program, furniture and equipment would be provided only to reduce
acute shortfalls in school districts with poor performance (para. 3.06).
3.37      The information required to introduce the criteria for systematic
facilities planning (e.g., continuous school mapping, facilities inventories
and enrollment and population information) would be included in the manage-
ment information system of the OPS. The OPS would assist the regional
planning units in preparing the information needed (para. 3.17) and compile
the requests in order of priority as the basis for annual programming and
budgeting. Three agencies are chiefly involved in school construction in the
Philippines.  These are the NEC and the Ministries of Local Governments and
Public Works. The Ministry of Public Works, MPW, is responsible for the
construction and rehabilitation of classrooms while the HEC sets standards and
criteria for the provision of school facilities. The Ministry of Local
Governments is mainly responsible for the acquisition of sites. The revised
criteria and instructions for school location and facilities planning have
been incorporated into a memorandum of agreement among the ministries
involved.
3.38      The use of the systematic criteria for the provision of classrooms
would serve to reduce regional disparities in opportunity. The development
program would provide approximately 110,000 classrooms over the period
1981-90. Basic school furniture and equipment for districts most in need,
administrative equipment for the central and regional offices, and 13
regional training centers would also be provided.



- 35 -
3.39      Teachers.  In order to reduce disparities in the availability of
teachers and to ensure progress towards the targeted teacher-class ratio of
1.2:1 in grades 5 and 6 and the targeted student-teacher ratio of 36:1, a
national scheme for monitoring teacher demand and supply would be established
(para. 2.26). The Regional Offices of the MEC would implement the scheme in
cooperation with teacher training institutions in the regions. Information
prepared in the regions on the availability of teachers and student-teacher
ratios for the OPS would be passed to the preservice training institutions and
used to establish enrollment and output targets. The monitoring of the
provision of teachers at the regional level would be more effective in
reducing disparities than a centrally managed scheme. Most students in
teacher training institutions live in nearby areas and prefer to stay in those
areas. The detailed proposal for monitoring teacher supply and demand was
completed prior to negotiations. Implementation is scheduled to begin after
testing during 1982.
3.40      Staff Development.  Training would be included under the develop-
ment program for staff of the MEC and the Instructional Materials Corporation
(paras. 2.10, 2.14 and 2.23)./1 Upgrading would be provided through workshops
(Table 3.6) and fellowships. Expert services in selected fields would also be
provided.
/1 Staff of the Financial Management Service of the MEC (para. 3.11) would be
included in training programs to ensure common understanding of the
revised sector financing policies and to improve skills for effective
financial management in the MEC.

lb Including professional staff of the OPS (50); key staff in the regional
offices of the MEC (275); provincial superintendents and supervisors
(225); and district superintendents (1,800).
3.41      Prototype syllabi for workshops for MEC staff during the first half
of the development program, ending in December 1985, have been prepared by the
BEE with assistance from the OPS and other agencies. Trainers for workshops
for staff of the central MEC and the Regional Offices would be drawn mainly
from local firms specializing in training and from the universities. Trainers
for other workshops would be drawn from the Regional Offices.  The content of
each workshop would be designed to support the sector development strategy
generally and to develop particular skills. Course specializations for
administrators would include: organizational management and administrative
procedures; project and program financing; personnel management and staff
development; and communications management. Courses for planners would center
on: project and program planning; educational financing and budgeting; data
systems and management; and school location planning. As far as possible,
staff from various levels would be grouped together in workshops. The work-
shops for supervisory staff, principals and teachers would support the intro-
duction of the revised curriculum, instructional materials and procedures for
evaluation of student performance (paras. 3.09 and 3.26). Particular emphasis
would be given to methods for subject and lesson planning including the
selection of behavioral objectives, teaching strategies, use of instructional
materials and techniques for testing and evaluation. Attention would also be



- 37 -
given to the development of local materials (para. 2.22). School supervisors
from the provincial offices and district superintendents would
receive similar training and an orientation to multi-subject supervision
(para. 3.26) in conjunction with management and planning workshops.
3.42      During 1982-85, staff of the Instructional Materials Corporation
would participate in workshops for the development of materials in the
core subjects and practical arts included in the revised curriculum.  These
workshops would bring together curriculum specialists, writers and editors.
Workshops would 21 - be provided in book design and layout, management of
publishing activities, marketing and distribution.
3.43      Fellowships and expert services planned over the first half of the
development program would provide specialized upgrading and assistance for
MEC and Corporation staff.  About 250 staff of the central and regional
offices of the MEC would participate in fellowship training.  Some 600 man-
months of fellowships (400 man-months local, 200 foreign) would be provided
for degree programs and 1,250 man-months for shorter, non-degree training
(1,000 man-months local, 250 foreign). Expert services (180 man-months of
which about half would be local and half foreign) would be provided to the
MEC for educational testing and evaluation; school location planning; data
systems and processing; curriculum and teaching methods; financial management
and budgeting; and for introducing the monitoring scheme for teacher supply
and demand (para. 3.39). An additional 200 man-months of local expert
services would be provided to assist directly with implementation of the
development program. About 109 man-months of fellowship training (non-degree,
foreign) would be provided for 30 staff of the Corporation in management and
accounting, writing and editing, design, manufacturing and distribution. In
addition, 36 man-months of expert services would be provided to develop the
workshops for Corporation staff. Longer term expert services (90 man-months,
foreign) would be provided for six experts in textbook development; management
and production; printing; accounting; data processing; and controllership.
3.44      The training and assistance to be provided to staff of the MEC and
Instructional Materials Corporation staff through 1985 would be financed under
the development program. It would reach all professional staff in the
Corporation; 100% of those involved with elementary education in the central
and regional agencies of the MEC; and about 50% of school principals and
teachers. Further staff upgrading, including training for teachers and
principals not reached during the period 1982-85, would be scheduled during
the second half of the development program.
3.45      Sector Evaluation.  To support the regular review and updating of
policies and guidelines, systematic performance evaluation would be introduced
under the development program as follows:
(a) monitoring of regional data on elementary education an annual
basis;



- 38 -
(b) in-depth evaluation on determinants of student participation and
achievement over the ten-year development period; and
(c) research on selected topics related to sector performance.
3.46       The monitoring system would be established through improvements in
the OPS- management information system (para. 3.15). The expanded data
would be adequate for purposes of inter- and intraregional comparisons on
student participation, performance and expenditure and for projecting related
requirements. To reduce difficulties encountered in the initial
implementation of the MIS (para. 2.12) school forms would be simplified;
procedures for the distribution and retrieval of forms would be streamlined;
and data compilation and processing would be improved through the use of the
minicomputers purchased by OPS (para. 2.14). The projects and evaluation
division of the OPS would compile and analyze the information and report on
the status of sector performance each year.
3.47       An in-depth evaluation of sector performance would be conducted
during the period 1981-90.  The research design calls for a baseline survey
(to be undertaken during 1981/82) on school and home determinants of
educational participation and achievement. The survey would employ sampling
techniques to cover about 100 school districts (of over 1,800). Use would
be made of existing educational and household data in designing the surveys.
The household survey would be used to assess the relations between socio-
economic status and participation.  The household data would be matched with
school and community-based data to assess thne relationships between
schooling inputs and student performance. In conjunction with the survey,
standardized achievement tests, including indicators of school quality and
internationally comparable items, would be administered regularly during
1981-90.  The BEE would manage the development and administration of the
tests with inputs provided by other agencies with expertise in educational
measurement. 'During negotiations an understanding was reached that
short-term consultants would be retained to finalize plans for the baseline
survey by October 31, 1981.
3.48       Reporting requirements for the evaluation would include a review
of baseline survey results (1982); an interim synthesis of baseline data and
performance monitoring outcomes (to be carried out during 1983); and a
mid-term evaluation (1985) with followup planned for the end of the develop-
ment period (1990). The evaluation would be managed by tEC authorities
responsible for administering thne development program.
3.49       Research relevant to elementary education would also be carried out
under the development program.  Criteria for the approval of research requests
have been established to ensure that the proposals address the main issues in
elementary education and have practical applications (Annex 4). Research on
experimental delivery systems as well as on particular issues would be
included.  It is expected that between 1981 and 1985 about 30 studies would be



- 39 -
undertaken by research proponents from GovernLment and the universities with
regional cooperation as appropriate. Included would be three studies on the
financing of education, a review of preservice teacher training programs for
elementary and secondary school teachers (para. 2.21), and a review of the
expected impact of the development program for elementary education on the
secondary school system.  Terms of reference for the financing study have been
completed. It is expected that terms of reference for the other two studies
would be completed by December 1981.
3.50      The results of evaluation work to be carried out under the sector
development program would be used to adjust sector policies and programs
vis-a-vis national development strategy and regional needs. The development
program would finance the annual monitoring exercise, the in-depth evaluation
and the research studies.  Results (data and related reports) would be made
available for use by the relevant agencies.
4. MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SECTOR PROGRAM
4.01      Arrangements for management of the Government½s ten-year development
program (1981-90) for elementary education have been organized to facilitate
program execution and include:
(a) a sector approach to management;
(b) appropriate organization and staffing arrangements;
(c) well-defined implementation procedures;
(d) guidelines and criteria for allocating funds and approving
subprojects; and
(e) a feasible implementation schedule.
The Sector Approach
4.02      The development program for elementary education is designed for
Bank assistance through a sector operation and is well-suited to this
approach.  The program covers ten years (1981-90), includes a large number of
subprojects and involves several agencies under the authority of the MEC. The
Bank loan would be used to assist the first half of the development program,
which ends in December 1985.
4.03      The development program is based on the introduction of revised
policies and institutional changes designed to support broad improvements in
the management and performance of elementary education (paras. 3.01-3.04).
These objectives and related targets would be achieved largely through the
development and implementation of subprojects. The Bank loan would assist
with the financing of about 60 subprojects scheduled during 1982-85. These
include 52 regional subprojects for the provision of facilities, furniture a
equipment (one per year per region); four staff development subprojects (one



- 40 -
per year); and one subproject each for curriculum development, the provision
of instructional materials, monitoring teacher supply, and sector evaluation.
Bank appraisal and supervision of these subprojects, particularly the numerous
facilities subprojects, planned training sessions and sector-related studies,
would be impractical.  These tasks could be more effectively carried out by
the GovernmLent through a sector lending approach.
4.04      A deliberate effort has been made to rely as much as possible on
regular Government procedures for implementing the development program. The
MEC would have responsibility for the preparation, appraisal, approval and
implementation of subprojects. No further appraisal would be required for the
instructional materials subproject, the sector performance monitoring scheme
or the in-depth evaluation (all of which have been reviewed in detail by the
Bank). All subproject processing and financing would be carried out in
accordance with procedures and criteria agreed with the Bank. Program
management would be directly accountable to the Minister of Education and,
through periodic review, to the Bank.
Organization and Staffing
4.05      The Government has devised an effective organizational structure
and prepared suitable staffing arrangements for implementing the program.
Management functions are assigned to staff of the relevant agencies and
offices of the MEC.
4.06      Organization.  Management responsibilities under the sector program
would be assigned as summarized in Chart 4.1. The Minister of Education would
have final authority for the approval of subprojects. A Program Executive
Authority, Technical Staff, and Regional Management Groups were created in
November 1979. The Program Executive Authority is chaired by the Deputy
Minister of Education and includes the heads of BEE, OPS, EDPITAF (para.
1.06), the Financial Management Service (para. 3.11) and the present Textbook
Agency (to be replaced by the President of the Instructional Materials
Corporation). It is supported by a Technical Staff, which is headed by the
Assistant Director of the BEE and which would be primarily responsible for
appraising subprojects (i.e., for facilities, curriculum, staff development,
monitoring of teacher supply and sector related studies) and for supervising
implementation. The Regional Management Groups are chaired by the Assistant
Directors of the Regional Offices of the MEC. They would be mainly
responsible for preparing and implementing facilities subprojects and for
preparing training requests involving regional staff. Civil works components
included in the regional facilities subprojects would be approved through the
management structure for the sector program and carried out by the MPW (para.
3.37).  Furniture for the regions would be procured by the Regional Manage-
ment Groups; and most equipment wcould be procured centrally by the Technical
Staff and distributed to thc relevant national agencies and the regions.
4.07      Staffinp.  :ne Gove; m  t has taken steps to ensure that the MEC has
sufficient, competent staff  i _.npiement the sector program.  The Program
Technical Staff has three divisions for (a) subproject development, appraisal

and implementation; (b) technical services and monitoring; and (c) financial
planning and control. (The terms of reference for each division are shown in
Annex 3.) It includes 32 full-time and 20 part-time staff drawn from the BEE,
the OPS, the Textbook Agency (to be replaced by staff of the Institutional
Corporation), the Financial Management Service of the MEC and EDPITAF. The
OPS and BEE staff assigned to the Technical Staff have been involved in the
detailed preparation of the sector program since mid-1979. They would be
assisted in their management tasks by EDPITAF staff (both senior program
officers and technical staff). EDPITAF has considerable expertise in the
preparation and implementation of education projects and programs. In the
recent past, the Government has placed emphasis on developing these skills
within the MEC bureaus and services. EDPITAF has continued to play an impor-
tant role through the provision of technical services and through contribu-
tions to project development and educational research.  It would continue to
provide support to the MEC during implementation of the development program
for elementary education. A pool of local consultants has also been organized
to provide specific managerial and technical expertise as may be required
(para. 3.43). For purposes of implementation of the sector program, the
Instructional Material Corporation would report to the Deputy Minister through
the Technical Staff. The Corporation would, however, be directly responsible
for implementing the instructional materials subproject and has sufficient
staff and experience for this purpose.
4.08      The Regional Management Groups each comprise up to 15 members
including staff the regional divisions for elementary education, the chiefs
of the regional planning units, and MEC staff from the provincial offices
and school districts. The regional planning unit would serve as the
technical secretariat for the Group and would recruit provincial and
district level staff to work on specific subprojects.  The regions would be
supported by the Technical Staff through provision of assistance as may be
required to carry out subproject preparation or implementation. The major
responsibility of the regions would be for preparing and implementing the
facilities subprojects.  Initial assistance in incorporating the facilities
planning criteria would be provided by the OPS through the technical staff
(para. 3.37).  The Regional Offices of the TPW, which have constructed over
10,000 classrooms per year for the past several years, have sufficient
experience and staff to supervise the facilities subprojects.
4.09      The staffing arrangements for managing the development program have
been reviewed by the Bank and are appropriate. All staff involved in manage-
ment have participated in seminars on the design and implementation of the
program and further training would be provided during implementation. As
experience is gained during program execution, it is expected that modifica-
tions would be made in the organization and staffing structure for the sector
program as necessary. During negotiations the Government agreed to (a) make
use of the expertise and staff of EDPITAF (or other agencies of the MEC) to
provide assistance in implementing the development program under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) appoint and retain suitably
qualified staff in adequate numbers in the TEC to implement the development
program.

Procedures for Subproject Processing
4.10      The Government has designed suitable procedures for implementing the
sector program. These procedures, shown in Chart 4.2, would be followed for
the implementation of all subprojects and for the preparation and approval of
all subprojects not appraised by the Bank. They have been designed to ensure
that subprojects conform with the Government s overall development strategy
for elementary education, adhere to the main objectives of the development
program and are feasible.  Procedures for preparing and appraising subprojects
have been tested for about half (six) of the facilities subprojects and all
other subprojects to be appraised and approved by the MEC and scheduled for
implementation during 1982 (e.g. staff development, special studies, curricu-
lum development and the scheme for monitoring teacher supply). The Government
plans to finalize appraisal documentation for all subprojects scheduled for
1982 by September 30, 1981.
4.11      Identification and Preparation.  All subprojects to be implemented
during the first half of the development program have been identified by MEC.
Subprojects for subsequent years have also been broadly identified, but would
be refined annually. The Program Technical Staff would prepare the training,
teacher monitoring and curriculum subprojects and the regions would prepare
the facilities subprojects and contribute to the preparation of training com-
ponents for regional staff.  Proponents from the public and private sectors
would be eligible to prepare requests for experimental or research components
under the evaluation subproject.  For regions lacking the technical competence
to prepare subprojects in accordance with agreed criteria, the Technical Staff
would arrange to provide assistance.  For the facilities and training sub-
projects, single preparation documents are being prepared for the first five
years of the program.  These would be updated annually as the basis for
appraisal.
4.12      Appraisal.  The Technical Staff would review subproject documents
to determine whether agreed criteria for subproject design have been met. On
the basis of satisfactory documentation, the Technical Staff would appoint a
team to carry out appraisal. Each team would include staff qualified to
review educational objectives and justification, management capabilities,
costs and implementation schedules and include at least one full-time member
of the Technical Staff.  Field visits would generally be required of appraisal
teams dealing with regional requests. If particular subprojects were
inadequately prepared, the preparation document would be modified and
reappraisal arranged. An appraisal report, based on a standard format, would
be prepared for each subproject or group of subprojects and submitted to the
Program Executive Authority and the Minister through the Technical Staff.
4.13      Approval.  The Program Executive Authority would review and approve
(or request modifications of) subprojects based on the appraisal reports.
Subprojects approved by the Executive Authority would be submitted through
the Deputy Minister to the Minister for final endorsement.

4.14      Supervision.  The Program Executive Authority would oversee the
implementation of subprojects. The Technical Staff would be directly
responsible for ensuring the effective execution of subprojects at both the
regional and national levels. The role of the Bank would be to participate
in annual discussions on policies affecting the sector and to review overall
progress on policy and institutional changes.  It is not expected that the
Bank would become involved in the details of assistance to particular
subprojects. During the annual discussions, however, the Bank would review
implementation of three to four regional facilities subprojects and two of
the nationally man.-ed subprojects. In this manner about 25% of subprojects
would be reviewed oy the Bank during 1982-85. The Bank would also undertake
prior review of subproject appraisal reports (initially all such reports) to
ensure that they conform with agreed guidelines and criteria. Prior to
negotiations agreement was reached on a proposed schedule for the annual
review of sector policies and program implementation with the Bank. During
negotiations the Governrment agreed to submit to the Bank for review and
comments, not less than three months before the scheduled start of
implementation, subproject proposals requested by the Bank.
4.15      Monitoring.  Implementation of the sector program would be moni-
tored by the Technical Staff. Information would be provided on progress with
implementing and financing subprojects and on progress towards achieving
related targets. Recommendations for improvements or modifications in
subproject content or criteria as well as in implementation procedures would
also be included. Quarterly progress reports, to be submitted to the
Minister and the Bank, would form the basis for program monitoring.
Guidelines and Criteria for Investment and Approval of Subprojects
4.16      Guidelines and criteria have been established to promote achieve-
ment of objectives of the development program -- guidelines for the allocation
of development expenditure, and criteria for approval of subprojects. The
guidelines and criteria are designed to support the revised sector policies
and achievement of targeted improvements in sector performance. They may be
amended by mutual agreement in light of experience gained during implementa-
tion. During negotiations the Government agreed that it would select and
implement subprojects in accordance with guidelines, criteria and procedures
satisfactory to the Bank.
4.17      Guidelines for the Allocation of Funds.  In terms of sector require-
ments for improved coverage, efficiency and quality, planned development
expenditures strike an appropriate balance between allocations for facilities
and other educational inputs. In addition, guideline- have been developed to
ensure that allocations are made in accordance with regional needs to redress
disparities in educational opportunity (para. 3.06). For 80% of development
expenditures, annual allocations to the regions would be based on a weighted
indicator of deficiencies in the enrollment rate of the relevant age group,
the cohort survival rate, and average achievement scores; and on the size of



- 46 -
the school-aged population in each region.  For 20% of development expendi-
tures, standard allocations, based on the share of the school-aged population,
would be made to the regions. Table 4.1 illustrates the resulting investment
guidelines based on 1980 standings (details are shown in Annex 4). The
guidelines would be revised annually in accordance with changes in regional
rankings and reviewed by the Bank during annual discussions. The guidelines
would need to be interpreted flexibly so as not to conflict with criteria
established for subproject approval. The formula for allocating funds to the
regions would be subject to review and revision after the first year of
project implementation and periodically thereafter.

4.18      Criteria for Subproject Approval.  The MEC would appraise and
approve subproject requests on the basis of four general criteria, viz:
(a) relevance to the objectives of the development program; (b) technical
feasibility; (c) efficiency; and (d) managerial feasibility. Adherence to the
relevance criterion would ensure that subprojects are designed to support
achievement of one or more sector objectives and related targets, i.e.,
equalizing opportunity, improving efficiency, improving quality, strengthening
management and planning. Technical feasibility refers to the degree to which
objectives and targets set could be achieved. This criterion would be applied
to assess the suitability of project design. Third, subprojects would be
evaluated to determine the extent to which investment would be efficiently



- 47 -
utilized. Fourth, the implementation capacity of the requesting agency would
be evaluated to ensure efficient subproject implementation. Assistance would
be provided to improve the capabilities to those agencies regularly involved
in elementary education as required. More specific criteria have been
developed for evaluating facilities subprojects, training components and
research proposals (Annex 4). Regional requests for facilities would be
evaluated and approved on the basis of systematic facilities planning and
location criteria (para. 3.36). The content of training (both workshops and
fellowships) for supervisors, principals and teachers would be justified and
approved with a view to resolving particular shortcomings in student
performance at the regional or subregional level. Experimental and research
components would be assessed on the basis of replicability and potential
contributions to sector policies, respectively.
Implementation Schedule
4.19      An implementation schedule for the development program is shown in
Annex 5.  The program has been underway since January 1981.  Implementation
of the portion of the program to be assisted by the Bank loan is expected to
be completed by December 31, 1985. The schedule for 1982-85 is considered
feasible in view of the advanced state of preparation of subprojects.
Implementation of the textbook subproject has begun and the Government has
also completed the following major activities:
(a) appraised half of the facilities subprojects scheduled for 1982;
(b) prepared and appraised prototype courses for the training sub-
projects scheduled during 1982-85 and prepared draft contracts for
the management of fellowship programs and the provision of expert
services;
(c) appraised about 10 proposals for special studies and research
related to elementary education about seven of which would be
implemented during 1982; and
(d) completed design of the performance monitoring scheme for
elementary education.
In addition, standard designs for the 13 regional training centers have been
prepared and tender and contract documents for equipment and furniture
procurement have been drafted. (Procurement of goods and services required
for all subprojects during 1982-85 would proceed as scheduled during 1981 to
the point of contract signing.) It is expected that the detailed appraisal
of all 13 facilities subprojects, and training and research activities
scheduled for 1982 would be completed by September 30, 1981 in accordance with
agreed guidelines and criteria. It is also expected that the final details
of the revised curriculum would be completed by December 1981 to permit a
year of testing prior to introduction in 1983; and that the data forms for
monitoring teacher supply (already prepared) would be tested before
introduction in 1982.

5. PROGRAM COSTS AND FINANCING
Development Expenditures
5.01      The Government's ten-year program for elementary education would be
supported by development expenditures estimated at US$767 million in (1981
prices) as shown in Table 5.1./I The expenditure planned for civil works
(amounting to 77% of the total) would cover basic requirements for new
classrooms during 1981-90. Estimated expenditures for other components (23%
of total) are sufficient to support planned improvements in quality,
management and efficiency. The costs of the program are both economical and
feasible.
5.02      Costs for the portion of the sector program to be assisted by the
Bank are defined as total development expenditures programmed for elementary
education during 1982-85. These costs amount to US$448 million including
contingencies (Tables 5.2 and 5.3).
5.03      Base costs for the program during 1982-85 refer to first quarter
1981 prices and are reasonable. Civil works costs are estimated on the basis
of MEC standards and FPW unit costs./2 Equipment and furniture costs are
based on the MEC's standard lists which are adequate and economical.  Paper
costs are based on recent contracts awarded by the Textbook Agency (US$800 per
metric ton). Equipment and paper purchased under the sector program would be
exempt from import duties. The technical assistance component would include
approximately 506 man-months of specialist services (about 216 foreign and 290
local) and 1,960 man-months of fellowships (about 560 foreign and 1,400
local). The unit costs per man-month are expected to average about US$6,400
for expert services (about US$8,300 for foreign experts and US$5,000 for local
experts including recruitment, travel, benefits, and salary) and US$900 for
fellowships (about US$1,250 for overseas fellowships and US$700 for local
fellowships). About 30 policy-related studies and experimental programs would
be undertaken under the evaluation component at an average cost of about
US$25,000 each. The cost of sector performance monitoring and the in-depth
evaluation is approximately US$1.2 million and an additional US$1.0 million
has been included for the preparation of future projects.
/1 The Government approved both the civil works budget and the budget for
the existing Textbook Agency for 1981. Initial staff development and
related activities are being financed through use of the preparation item
included under Loan 1786-PH.
/2 The unit cost for a regular classroom is about US$5,500 (1981 prices) with
a space allowance of 1.2 square meters per student place; and the unit
cost of a multipurpose workshop (100 square meters) is US$9,000 (1981
prices).

5.04      Contingencies are estimated at US$134 million.  They represent 42.6%
of the base cost. Physical contingencies for technical assistance, evaluation
and studies are estimated at 5% of the base cost and for all other items at
10%. Price contingencies as a percentage of base costs are estimated as
follows:
1981  1982  1983  1984
_________    (% )  -------
Local currency components        14.0  10.0   8.0   8.0
Foreign currency components       9.0   8.5   8.0   7.5
Foreign exchange costs are estimated at 20% for civil works; 90% for
equipment; 33% for furniture; 100% for paper; 10% for staff development
workshops; 45% for textbook development, pr-inting and distribution; 50%
for technical assistance; and 66% for evaluation. The total foreign
exchange cost of the sector project is US$129.4 million or 29% of the total
cost including contingencies.
5.05      The economical nature of the development program is reflected in the
unit development expenditure. During the period 1981-90, the annual develop-
ment cost per student would amount to about US$8.2 which compares favorably
with unit costs elsewhere in the region and reflects an economical utilization
rate (90%) for classrooms.
Recurrent Cost Implications
5.06      The development expenditures are not expected to generate increases
in recurrent financing for elementary education. Through the improvements to
be effected in efficiency, particularly in teacher utilization, the annual
recurrent cost per student in real terms would remain constant. The overall
effect of efficiency gains would be to reduce the relative share of operating
costs for elementary education in total public recurrent expenditure
(projected on the basis of nominal GNP growth) from about 9.5% in 1980 to 7.5%
by 1985 and thereafter (Table 5.4).

the estimated foreign exchange component.

/a  To accelerate implementation and disbursements, a Special Account
would be established to Finance the Bank's share of costs for selected
items under the development program as discussed in para. 5.14 below.



- 54 -
5.08      The development expenditures are feasible and within the financial
capability of the Government. The average yearly expenditure in the ten-year
period 1981-90, at about US$77 million (1981 constant prices), is equivalent
to about 15% of the annual recurrent budget for elementary education and
would exceed anticipated savings in teachers salaries by only 28% at the end
of the program period (para. 3.08).  In addition, annual allocations for the
largest item, civil works, are in line with recent allocations for classroom
construction. These allocations are expected to increase by about 5% p.a. in
real terms through 1985 and to remain constant thereafter.  The proposed Bank
loan would serve to reduce foreign exchange constraints anticipated by the
Government during the program period.
Procurement
5.09      Under the development program contracts for civil works would be
awarded on the basis of the Government-s regular local competitive bidding
procedures which are acceptable to the Bank.  Contracts for furniture would
be numerous, scattered and relatively small.  They would be awarded either on
the basis of local competitive bidding procedures or through negotiations
with nearby trade schools able to manufacture furniture of satisfactory
quality at reasonable prices.  Contracts for the printing and distribution
of instructional materials would also be awarded on the basis of local com-
petitive bidding procedures. Prior review by the Bank on bidding documents,
bid evaluation and contract awards for civil works, furniture and the
printing and distribution of instructional materials would not be required.
5.10      Contracts for equipment and paper would be grouped to the extent
possible to form attractive bid packages and awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group
guidelines for procurement. Contracts on bid packages for equipment and
paper which cannot reasonably be grouped to exceed US$100,000 equivalent in
estimated value, (estimated at 25% of total value) would be awarded on the
basis of local competitive bidding procedures. Miscellaneous items in
contracts not exceeding US$25,000 equivalent each and subject to an aggregate
total of US$1,000,000 equivalent could be purchased on the basis of a minimum
of three price quotations. Reference materials would be procured directly
from suppliers after negotiation for discount. Locally manufactured
equipment and paper at ex-factory prices offered in competition with
international bidders would be accorded a 15% margin of preference or the
existing rate of import duties, whichever is the lower, over the c.i.f.
price of competing foreign suppliers. Standard bidding documents have been
reviewed and are satisfactory. Bank review of bid evaluation before contract
awards would be required for the procurement of equipment exceeding
US$100,000 per contract. Such review is anticipated for an estimated 60
contracts expected to cover 70% of the total value and 20% of the number of
contracts awarded.  For the procurement of paper, Bank review of bid
evaluation before contract award would be limited to about 25 contracts
exceeding US$300,000 each. Such review is expected to cover over 40% of the
total value and 15% of the number of paper contracts.



- 55 -
5.11      Disbursements.  Disbursements under the proposed sector loan would
be made as follows:
(a) 100% of the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment, materials and paper;
(b) 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally manufactured equipment,
materials, furniture and paper;
(c) 65% of the invoiced cost of locally procured equipment, materials,
furniture, and paper;
(d) 100% of expenditures on experts and fellowships (including
contracts for research and studies); and
(e) 100% of expenditures on printing of instructional materials;
(f) 65% of expenditures on local training workshops; and
(g) 50% of expenditures on development and distribution of instruc-
tional materials.
5.12      Table 5.6 shows estimated loan disbursements by semester.  The
estimates are based on a review of historical experience with other education
projects in the Philippines and comparison with all education projects in the
region.  It is expected that disbursements would be completed by December 31,
1986.

Accounts, Documentation and Auditing
5.13      The development program for elemenitary education includes numerous,
small items to be procured locally and for which approximately 40% of the
loan has been allocated. These include furniture (locally manufactured),
miscellaneous items (to be procured off-the-shelf), development and distri-
bution of instructional materials, local training workshops and local fellow-
ships. Submission of the numerous and small contracts, invoices, receipts
and other supporting documents for these items would be unduly costly and
buruensome for both the Government and the Bank.  Statement of expenditure
(SOE) procedures would therefore be used for these items. Supporting docu-
ments would, however, be retained and made available for review by visiting
Bank missions. Disbursements against various other small local expenditures,
each less than US$1,000 and aggregating less than US$500,000, would also be
made against SOEs. Disbursements against SOEs would be made on the basis of a
consolidated summary of quarterly expenditures. To the extent possible, SOEs
would be aggregated to amounts not less than US$50,000 per withdrawal.
Disbursements against remaining program expenditures would be made against
full documentation.
5.14      Execution of many ongoing projects in the Philippines has been
delayed by late availability of funds (para. 1.06). Due to local currency
constraints, budget provisions to cover the Bank's share of local expenditures
have often been inadequate to meet project implementation schedules. To
facilitate implementation of the elementary education program, the Bank would
made advance payments into a Special Account to cover the estimated Bank share
of certain local expenditures. The Special Account would be in Philippine
Pesos in the Central Bank of the Philippines and controlled by the Bureau of
Treasury.  The Special Account would be used to finance items for which
disbursements would be made on the basis of certified statements of expen-
diture as well as small local currency payments for printing and consultant
services. Deposits would be based on the estimated quarterly requirements for
expenditure on these items, but at no time would the amount exceed $3.0 mil-
lion equivalent. The Bureau of Treasury would be responsible for ensuring the
proper use of funds deposited in the Special Account. Replenishment of the
account by the Bank would be subject to review and approval of withdrawal
applications justifying the amounts withdrawn from the Special Account.
5.15      Regular procedures employed by the Ministry of the Budget and the
Commision on Audit for accounting and auditing would provide adequate control
over financial transactions under the sector program. Government auditors are
located throughout the regions and the national government agencies to super-
vise transactions. Separate books of accounts would be used under the sector
program to record expenditures from loan proceeds and government funds in
accordance with sound accounting procedures. Such accounts, together with
disbursement documents, would be audited annually by the Commission on Audit
in accordance with standard government practices. The annual audit reports on
project accounts prepared by the Commission on Audit and related documentation



- 57 -
would be furnished to the Bank upon request. During negotiations, the Govern-
ment agreed that program accounts would be maintained in accordance with sound
accounting procedures; and auditing procedures acceptable to the Bank
(including separate opinions with regard to use of the Special Account and
disbursements made on the basis of statements of expenditures) would be
applied annually during program implementation.
6. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
6.01      The priority given to the development program for elementary
education derives from the Government's strategy to provide basic education of
adequate quality to the school-aged population.  The provision of sound
literacy and numeracy skills is included among requirements for raising
productivity and incomes, particularly among low income and rural segments of
the population. At present, the majority of Filipino children has access to
elementary schooling. However, a third of the children enrolled never
completes the six-year cycle and both coverage and quality vary among and
within the country's 13 regions. Moreover, scores on standard achievement
tests reveal poor average achievement, with lowest performance in the basic
skills, e.g., reading, reading comprehension and numeracy. The development
program is designed to correct these shortcomings through the introduction of
revised policies and management responsibilities and through improvements in
instructional programs and the distribution of facilities and teachers.
6.02       The revised policies for financing and teacher utilization would
reduce disparities and improve quality and efficiency. The largest share of
funds would be allocated to regions with the poorest performance; and the
improved utilization of teachers would support an increase in the share of
nonsalary items in recurrent expenditures. The Government has targeted sig-
nificant increases in the enrollment rate of the school-aged population
(from 74% to 90% between 1981 and 1990) and in cohort survival (from about 65%
at present to 78% by 1985 and 86% by 1990). Substantial progress towards
these targets and improvement in student achievement would be achieved through
the new policies for student intake and progression together with revised
instructional programs and techniques for teaching and evaluation. About 11
million textbooks would be manufactured and distributed annually to reach a
targeted student-textbook ratio of 2:1 by 1985. Supervisors, principal-s and
teachers would receive upgrading to support the introduction of the revised
curriculum, methods and materials between 1981 and lQ90. Mainly as a result
of improved survival rates and population growth, enrollments would increase
by about 2.2 million between 1980 and 1990 and would exceed 10 million by
1990. Some 11,000 new classrooms (net additions to stock plus replacement)
would be provided annually to meet this increase. Sector management would be
strengthened under the development program through the introduction of organi-
zational changes, provision of training for planners and administrators, and
support for systematic evaluation of sector performance.



- 58 -
6.03      The overall impact of sector development activities scheduled for
1981-90 would be as follows: some 6% more of the relevant age group (600,000
children in 1990) would be enrolled in elementary schools at the end of the
ten-year period; about 20% more of each entering cohort would complete the six
year cycle (amounting to 300,000 graduates in 1990); and levels of competence
in basic subject areas would be raised and evident in improved achievement
scores and, towards the late 1990s, in declining rates of adult illiteracy.
As a result of efficiency gains, particularly in teacher utilization, it is
expected that these results would be achieved without increases in the real
recurrent cost per student. In addition, institutional changes and related
training inputs would improve the long-term effectiveness of sector
management.
Risks
6.04      The proposed sector operation represents an innovative approach to
educational development projects in the Philippines (for both the Borrower and
the Bank) and is complex. The program focuses on the introduction of revised
policies and management practices. The precise outcomes of these changes,
which may require further modification on the basis of experience, cannot be
accurately predicted. In addition the program comprises numerous subprojects.
A risk exists that delays will arise in the course of implementation. Several
measures have been undertaken to reduce this risk. First, the main agencies
involved participated extensively in the identification of the development
program and took responsibility for preparation of the program, including the
revised policies, institutional changes and guidelines and criteria for
subproject approval. Second, the proposed management framework and
procedures, guidelines and criteria for subproject approval have been designed
to allow for adaptation and modification by mutual agreement on the basis of
early implementation experience. Third, procurement and financing procedures
conform with regular Government procedures and are designed to facilitate
program execution. Finally, the program management organization draws
together staff from the participating agencies and includes officials with
extensive experience in the implementation of development projects.
Additional support would be arranged as required through use of a pool of
local consultants. The Bank has been involved in the education sector in the
Philippines since 1964 and provided loan or credit assistance for six previous
projects. All of these have been (or are being) satisfactorily implemented,
and the development impact of the first several has equalled or exceeded
appraisal expectations. On balance, the Borrower's experience, familiarity
with the content of the proposed program and commitment to its objectives
limit the risk of implementation difficulties to an acceptable level. The
loan would help to finance investments planned during the first half of the
development program. This scheduling would permit relatively early Bank
review of overall progress and possible follow-up.

Guidelines for the Allocation of Development Funds and Criteria
for Subproject Approval
A. Guidelines for Allocating Developent Funds
1.       In order to effect the revised financing policy, designed to redress
disparities in educational opportunity, a new formula would be used to guide
annual development allocations among the regions (and the 1,834 school
districts). The formula, which allocates 80% of investment on the basis of
regional deficiencies in performance and 20% on a standard per capita basis,
is shown below:
(P.)
Di (t')
Ei =  _ ) x 0.8 + Pi x 0.2
>Di (Pt)
Ei = the regional share of development expenditures;
Pi = the regional share of the population aged 7-12; (where
Pt   Pi =  population in 7-12 age group in region i, and
Pt = total population in 7-12 age group); and
Di = the deficiency in regional performance
The indicator for deficiency in regional performance is weighted and
calculated as follows:
Di = I - (.3eni + .3suri + .4achi)
eni = the enrollment rate of children aged 7-12 in region i;
suri = the cohort survival rate in region i; and
achi = the average achievement score of grade 6 students in
region i.
The table below illustrates the methodology for calculating guidelines for
proportional investments by region.
2.        The formula for calculating guidelines for development expenditures
would be introduced during 1982. Guidelines would be revised annually in
accordance with changes in regional rankings. They would be applied mainly
in the allocation of funds for regional facilities subprojects, for the
training of principals and teachers in the regions and for the provision of
region-specific materials by the Instructional Materials Corporation.
(Textbooks would be provided to all regions on the basis of the 2:1 ratio
targeted by the Government; training for staff above the level of principal
would be provided to 100% of the various client groups; and experimental
programs and research studies would be approved through competitive

applications.)  Adjustments in allocations would be required, particularly
in the case of facilities subprojects, to ensure adherence to criteria for
subproject approval based on systematic school location and planning
criteria. The guidelines and the for-mula for allocating regional
development funds would be subject to review and revision after the first
year of implementation and periodically thereafter.
B. Criteria for Subproject Approval
3.        General Criteria.  The Technical Staff would appraise subproject
requests for school facilities, staff development, experimental and research
components (under the evaluation subproject) and requests for further
development or adjustments to the revised curriculum and the scheme for
monitoring teacher supply on the basis of: relevance, technical feasiblity,
efficiency and managerial feasibility. These criteria would also form the
basis for subproject preparation and approval. It is recognized that the
weight assigned to each criterion would vary among subprojects.
(a) Relevance. Subprojects would be evaluated to ensure that they
contribute to achievement of objectives and targets set under the
the development program. Each subproject would be expected to
address one or more of the following objectives: (i) reducing
disparities in opportunity, (ii) improving internal efficiency
and cost-effectiveness; (iii) improving quality; and
(iv) strengthening management and planning.
(b) Technical Feasibility. Each subproject would be assessed to ensure
that its design and targets for resolving particular sector
performance or management problems are appropriate and well-
defined. To the extent possible, targets would need to be
quantified.
(c) Efficiency. The efficiency criterion would be used to assess
whether a subproject could be implemented at reasonable cost.
This would include consideration of unit costs which should be
reasonable and in line with national standards.
(d) Management Feasibility. The ability of the proponent agency to
implement a subproject would also be reviewed. This would
include assessment of staff arrangements and qualifications and
capabilities for carrying out implementation efficiently.
Constraints to effective implementation of an acceptable sub-
project would need to be remedied prior to approval.
It is expected that the Technical Staff would convey the results of subproject
appraisals to the requesting agencies. Through subproject monitoring,
periodic reports on progress towards subproject goals and targets would be
provided. Further, it is expected that the Minister would terminate any
subproject which is not achieving its targets over a reasonable period of
time.

4.        Special Criteria.  Specific criteria would be applied in preparing
and approving subproject requests for facilities and staff development and for
experimental and research components under the evaluation subproject.
5.        Provision of Classrooms.  Regional subproject requests for addi-
tional classrooms or new schools, and for the rehabilitation, replacement
or completion of existing facilities, would be based on systematic school
location and facilities planning information for each district as follows:
school maps (showing topographical barriers) would be maintained to show the
distribution of schools in relation to communities, transportation and other
facilities; population and enrollment data, including data on growth and
migration and student participation and survival would be maintained to show
trends; and the number of student places per grade would be monitored together
with teacher availability. This information would be evaluated annually to
determine requirements for classrooms or new schools. An inventory of the
status of existing classrooms would also be maintained to determine require-
ments for rehabilitation, replacement or completion of existing facilities.
This inventory would be updated once in four years. All classrooms (or
schools) to be provided or improved through regional facilities subprojects
would conform with present Government standards for classrooms. These
standards allow 1.2 sq m of space per student and a design capacitv for
40 students per classroom at an average unit cost of US$5,500 equivalent (1981
prices). Requests for multipurpose workshops, with a standard area of
approximately 100 sq m and a unit cost of US$9,000 equivalent (1981 prices)
would also be considered.
6.        The following criteria would apply in preparing, appraising and
approving regional requests for facilities:
(a) Additional classrooms or schools would be requested as necessary
to reduce the present shortage. Initially, one classroom would be
requested for each 40-50 children enrolled and, once the backlog
is reduced, for each 40 children enrolled. Priority would be
given to the expansion of existing schools where the size and
location of the school site permit economical expansion and where
population density is sufficient to maintain a distance of about 3
km (on average) from students' homes to schools. Where these
criteria cannot be met, adjustments would be made as follows:
(i)  multiple shifting would be introduced in schools serviced
with electricity;
(ii)  multigrade teaching (i.e., three classes for grades 1-6) would
be adopted as necessary in areas with low population densities
and otherwise excessive travel distances for students; and
(iii)  new schools would be established in communities with a
threshold population of about 1,400 (i.e., 6 classes x 40
students each divided by the national share of children

aged 7-12 in the population, or 240 . .17 = 1,400), where
existing schools are housed in inappropriate rented facilities
and a Government site is made available, and, on a case to case
basis, in small, isolated communities which are distant (about
6 km or more) froin existing schools (using multigrade
teaching).
(b) requests for replacement of existing classrooms or schools (includ-
ing rentals) would be based on reports prepared by MPW district
engineers and including a description of the extent of dilapidation;
a certification that the facility is unsafe for occupancy according
to the provisions of the National Building Code; and an analysis
showing that the cost of rehabilitation (or rental) would exceed or
approximate the cost of an equivalent standard facility.
(c) requests for rehabilitation or completion of existing facilities
would be based on district engineers  reports describing the nature
and extent of proposed works and estimated costs.
7.         In accordance with financing guidelines, priority would be given
to subproject requests for facilities in districts with low performance
rankings. Priorities for approval would be in the following order:
(a) replacement of seriously damaged or unsafe classrooms;
(b) provision of additional classrooms to meet enrollment growth;
(c) rehabilitation of dilapidated facilities;
(d) replacement of dilapidated facilities;
(e) replacement of rented facilities.
In general, requests for multipurpose workshops would be considered only
where basic classroom requirements have been met. In addition, workshops
would be provided only for schools offering the full, six-year cycle of
elementary education and where satisfactory evidence of reasonable
utilization and the availability of suitable teachers can be demonstrated.
8 .       Provision of Equipment and Furniture.  Requests for school
equipment and furniture would be appraised and approved on the basis of need
as deternined by detailed inventories conducted on a district by district
basis and updated once in four years. Approval would be extended in
accordance with financing guidelines to school districts lacking furniture
and equipment with low performance ratings. For furniture and equipment for
administrative offices above the school level, approval would be based
mainly on a review of existing inventories in relation to standards set by
the Ministry of Education and Culture.

9.        Staff Development.  Draft terms of reference for expert services,
prototype courses outlines for workshops and fields for fellowship award for
staff of the Ministry of Education and Culture and the Instructional Materials
Corporation have been reviewed by the Bank. Due to the large number of work-
shops and client groups for the Ministry of Education and Culture, however,
prototype courses and fellowship fields would be adapted to meet the
particular requirements of trainees. For managers and planners from the
center and the regions, the specific content of workshops and fellowship
training would be prepared, justified and approved on the basis of the revised
roles and functions of the client(s). Emphasis would be given to upgrading
technical and manq9rial skills required for meeting the objectives of the
development progratii. More specific criteria would be applied in the adapta-
tion and approval of training for teachers, principals and supervisors in
each region. This training would support the introduction of the new
curriculum, instructional materials and related teaching techniques with the
aim of improving student participation and performance.  Priority in justifi-
cation and approval of training content would thus be given to resolving
particular shortcomings in student participation and performance (i.e., below
average scores in any of the basic subjects, particular language difficulties
and related repetition or dropout problems).
10.        Experimental and Research Components.  The general criteria for
approval would apply to requests for the support of special programs (i.e.,
experimental delivery systems) and for policy-related research. However,
relevance would be assessed on the basis of potential (rather than direct)
contributions to the achievement of program objectives through experimental
programs. Cost-effectiveness and efficiency would be carefully evaluated to
ensure that experimental programs, if successful, could be economically
replicated.  For research, relevance would be assessed on the basis of
potential contributions to the formulation of sector policies.  Individuals
and groups from Government and private agencies would be eligible for
conducting research and studies. It is expected that approximately seven
experimental programs or studies would be undertaken each year in accordance
with the following criteria: no more than three experiments or studies would
be undertaken directly by agencies at the national level in any one year; no
more than one experiment or study would be undertaken by, or in behalf of, a
particular region in any one year; and no more than two such activities
would be undertaken in the same region between 1981 and 1985. It is
expected that regional research components would be undertaken mainly by
universities or their staff in cooperation with the Regional Offices of the
MEC.
