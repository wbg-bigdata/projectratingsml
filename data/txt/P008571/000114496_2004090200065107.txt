outstanding special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to
Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect to expenditures
to be financed thereunder shall equal the equivalent of twice the
amount of the respective Authorized Allocation.
      Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the respective eligible
Category shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by
notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that
all such amounts remaining on deposit in the respective Special
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account A or the Special Account B: (i)

paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the
evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon
notice from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the

such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the respective Special Account will not be
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the
Bank such outstanding amount.
     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to the
Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
