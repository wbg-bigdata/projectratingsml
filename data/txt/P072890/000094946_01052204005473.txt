ECONOMIC REHABILITATION SUPPORT CREDIT
SUMMARY
Beneficiary:          THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
Project Task ID:      PE-P072890-LEN
Implementing Agency: Ministry of Finance
IDA Amount:           SDR 116.6 million (US$150 million equivalent)
Terms:                Standard IDA terms: 40 years maturity with a 10-year grace period
Disbursement:         The proposed Credit will be disbursed on effectiveness through the
National Bank of Ethiopia.
Description:          The proposed Credit provides initial support for the Government's
efforts in stabilizing the economy and moving back to a sustainable
path of growth. It helps restoring key economic and social services and
institutional capacity, while financing increased private sector imports
associated with the removal of restrictions in the foreign exchange
market. It supports the  Government's  program  to  improve
macroeconomic performance and reallocate public spending to poverty-
targeted sectors; and it addresses the Government's reform agenda in
three priority areas: (i) public sector management; (ii) public
expenditure policy and management; and (iii) private sector
development and export competitiveness.
Benefits:            Within a context of peace and macroeconomic stability, the proposed
Credit will help to bring about a sustained economic recovery and a
reduction in poverty. Public sector management and expenditure
strengthening will increase administrative efficiency and improve the
delivery of public services. Private sector reforms will spur growth and
create employment opportunities for the poor, particularly in
agriculture and in the export sectors.
Risks:                The proposed Credit faces four categories of risks: First is the
possibility of resumption of hostilities with Eritrea. This risk is reduced
by the deployment of UN peace-keeping troops which monitor the
implementation of the peace agreement; the creation of a border
Temporary Security Zone, from which Ethiopia and Eritrea have
withdrawn their troops; and the demobilization of the army, which is
proceeding at a faster rate than anticipated. In addition, for the current
year the Government anticipates a further reduction of defense
spending over the budgeted amount. Second, the economy is vulnerable
to external shocks such as a drought or unfavorable terms-of-trade
movements. However, the potential availability of finance from
development partners could provide an additional cushion against
external shocks if needed. Third, there is a significant risk of delays in
the implementation of the reform program because of weak institutional
capacity in both the public and private sectors. This risk could be
I



reduced by the financial and technical assistance provided by the donc,r
community. The Govemment has also asked for an increase in IDA
assistance specifically in the area of capacity building. Finally, there i s
a risk of weakening govemment commitment. So far, the Government
has shown its strong commitment to the reform  program  by
implementing a number of reform actions in anticipation of the ERSC
and by parallel efforts to strengthen public expenditure management to
improve monetary management and continue the financial sector
reform.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
ECONOMIC REHABILITATION SUPPORT CREDIT
OF SDR 116.6 MILLION (US$150 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE FEDERAL DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF ETHIOPIA
1.    I submit for your approval the Report and Recommendation on a proposed Economic
Rehabilitation Support Credit (ERSC) to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in the
amount of SDR1 16.6 million (US$150 million equivalent). The operation is part of an assistance
program to address the country's immediate post-war recovery needs. The IDA Board endorsed
the program, set out in the Interim Support Strategy (Report No. 21189 ET), on December 5,
2000. The ERSC provides essential financing to enable the recovery of the post-conflict
Ethiopian economy. It also supports the implementation of key actions of a reform program
formulated in the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). Specific measures aim at:
(i) improving governance through cross-cutting public sector reforms; (ii) strengthening public
expenditure policy and management; (iii) fostering private sector development and increasing
export competitiveness. The main elements of the reforms supported by the proposed Credit are
articulated in the attached Letter of Development Policy. The reform program is supported by the
IMF through a PRGF arrangement.
I.   POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXT
A.   POLITICAL CONTEXT
2.     Settling into Peace. On December 12, 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a peace
agreement, thereby ending an armed conflict that had begun in May 1998 and lasted for more
than two years. On February 6, 2001, they agreed to a 25 mile Temporary Security Zone from
which Ethiopia and Eritrea have withdrawn their troops. A U.N. force of about 4,200
peacekeeping troops, the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, is patrolling the buffer
zone, monitoring the implementation of the peace agreement, supporting efforts to demobilize the
army, and accommodating the return of displaced civilians in both countries.
3.    Recent Developments. The current Govemrnent - a coalition led by the Ethiopian
People's Revolutionary Democratic Front - came to power in 1991, after a struggle that ended
years of civil war. The ruling party was reconfirmed in the national elections held in May 2000.
Following the recent peace agreement, the Government has initiated the demobilization of the
army, and the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure and the rehabilitation of key public
services. The war has had a significant human and economic impact. Some 36,000 civilians and
members of the militia died and many of their families are now on the verge of destitution. About
364,000 people were displaced and half of them still cannot return to their homes, owing to the
presence of landmines, or because essential infrastructure was damaged or destroyed.
Additionally, there are 110,000 persons of Ethiopian origin who had been residing in Eritrea and
have returned from there as a result of the war, most of them depending on state support. Another
area of concern is the increased risk of WV/AIDS transmission in the army and in the
communities affected by the war.
3



4.      The impact of the war has been heavy on private sector development and investor
confidence, resulting in a sharp fall in new investment during 1999-2000. At the same time, the
Govermment has been dealing with the consequences of a severe drought which, combined witlI
inadequate transport and marketing infrastructure, has increased food vulnerability for many
Ethiopians. Additionally, a strong decline in the price and output of the country's main export
commodity - coffee - and a simultaneous surge in the price of oil (see paragraphs 17-18) have
worsened the country's extemal position.
5.      In the second half of 2000, following the cessation of hostilities with Eritrea, the
Government resumed its reform efforts. Following consultations within various levels of ttLe
administration, private sector organizations and donors, it prepared a comprehensive I-PRS]'1.
The strategy re-affirms the Government's commitment to poverty reduction, within a framewor k
of macroeconomic stability. It aims at achieving equitable growth through addressing the
immediate reconstruction and reintegration needs, raising the incomes of the rural poor, and
improving the delivery of public services, as well as social indicators. The macroeconomic
framework underlying the I-PRSP was discussed with Fund and IDA staffs and a Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was approved by the IMF Board on March 19, 2001.
6.      International Response. Since the cessation of hostilities in June 2000, the international
community has provided Ethiopia with political, humanitarian and post-war restructuring support.
The Organization of African Unity, the UN, the United States and the European Union haxie
helped to mediate in the peace negotiations. In support of the Government's request in January
2000 for assistance to the intemally displaced, the UN issued an appeal and relief action plan
under which the World Food Program has been providing assistance to over 200,000 people
displaced by the conflict. Response to the drought emergency was coordinated and managed by
USAID' s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in close cooperation with the Ethiopian
Govemment.
7.      IDA  Response and Strategy. IDA's support strategy for Ethiopia is described in thle
Interim Support Strategy (December 2000). Up to US$700 million would be provided in new
credits over the subsequent 12 to 24 months to address the impact of the conflict. The strategy
centers around three key objectives. They are: (i) addressing the immediate human, infrastructure
and economic emergency, and setting the economy back on the path of sustainable growth; (:i)
tackling weaknesses in the management of the IDA portfolio; and (iii) initiating long-term Bar.k
assistance in three areas of key structural importance, namely food security, HIV/AIDS, and
capacity building for the delivery of essential services'.
8.      The Economic Rehabilitation Support Credit. In the Interim Support Strategy, it was
anticipated that balance of payment support of US$250 million would be needed from IDA to
support the overall macroeconomic framework during 2000/01 and 2001/02. The proposed Credit
of US$150 million equivalent covers the immediate financing requirements for the present fiscal
year. The ERSC is structured as a single tranche rehabilitation credit for a number of reasons.
First, this instrument is better designed to meet the urgent financing needs of an economy that is
trying to recover from a war, as well as to deal with the impact of a drought and of a terms of
l The strategy includes four operations: a) The Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project (EDRP -- US$170.6 million),
which became effective on February 22, 2001. The project finances demobilization and return of the veterans to their communit ns;
economic reintegration assistance, medical rehabilitation for disabled veterans; and HIV/AIDS education; b) The Emergercy
Recovery Program (ERP- US$230 million) which became effective on February 15, 2001. The project includes: the de-mining of lhe
border areas; resettlement packages for internally displaced persons and deportees; and the reconstruction of private housing ;md
public/social infrastructure; c) The Fertilizer Supplemental Credit (IDA US$44 million) aimed at providing an adequate supply of
fertilizers; and d) The Emergency Support Credit, which is discussed in this Report and now re-named the Economic Rehabilitation
Support Credit (IDA USI 50 million equivalent).

trade decline. Subsequent operations would be designed to reflect changing circumstances and
the specific financing requirements at that point in time. Second, the Government is firmly
committed to the overall reform program, even though in several areas, notably civil service
reform and public expenditure management, some actions require elaboration in the context of
action plans that are in the process of being developed. Finally, the Government is preparing the
PRSP, and plans to consult extensively with stakeholders. In this context, detailed discussion of
the specific actions that a follow-on credit might support will take place during the formulation of
the PRSP.
9.    The ERSC is intended to serve as a bridge to a number of policy-based follow-on
operations that will support the Government's medium-term poverty reduction strategy. The main
elements of the medium-term reform program, which the Government is committed to specify in
more detail in the context of the PRSP, are described in the Policy Matrix (Annex A). The Matrix
also indicates key measures already implemented or agreed with the Government in the context of
the ERSC; a number of policy measures to be implemented in the next six months, before
detailed discussions of a follow-on operation would start; and actions that the Government
intends to take within the next two years.
10.   The outline of the Report is as follows. The remaining sections of Part I describe
Ethiopia's recent social and economic performance. Part II discusses the Govemment's medium-
term economic and social program. It presents not only the specific measures supported by the
ERSC but also suggests reform actions that the Government would take in the next six months,
before a possible follow on operation, and the broad agreements reached on measures that the
Govemment would implement during the remaining of the fiscal year 2001/02 and during
2002/03.  Part III discusses the specific details - credit rationale and amount, actions
implemented prior to Board presentation and implementation arrangements - of the ERSC. Part
IV presents the recommendation of the President.
B.   ECONoMIc AND SOCIAL PERFORMANCE
11.   Macroeconomic performance improved in the 1990s. At the beginning of the 1990s
Ethiopia had lower income levels than in the 1960s, high inflation rates and unsustainable fiscal
and external balances. In 1992, the new government began to implement a far-reaching program
of economic reforms with the support of an IDA structural adjustment credit (SAC) as well as
IMF programs. Reforms included: a 60 percent devaluation of the Ethiopian birr; the abolition of
price controls and the removal of many barriers to competition; the introduction of a retail foreign
exchange auction system; the streamlining and reduction of import tariffs; and initial steps to
privatize public sector enterprises and to liberalize the financial sector. A new Constitution -
approved in 1994 - established a democratic, federal and decentralized system of Government, a
significant change from the centralization model pursued under Emperor Haile Selassie I and the
Derg regime.
12.   Adherence to the program of stabilization resulted in a recovery of economic growth and
in a decline in the inflation rate. Both external and internal imbalances were also significantly
reduced. A further improvement in macroeconomic performance was achieved during the period
1995/96-1997/98 despite a terms of trade deterioration in 1996 and a drought in 1997. Overall
progress in macroeconomic stabilization, coupled with a sharp reduction in defense spending,
enabled the government to redirect spending towards infrastructure and social programs.

13.    Poverty was reduced. After three decades of declining living standards, rural incomes
increased during 1991/92-1996/97. Also, evidence from Household Budget Surveys suggests that
the number of poor people (living on less than half a dollar per day) declined by 16 percenit
between 1985 and 1995. This improvement was the result of structural reforms, and of new
Government programs to directly address rural poverty. Particularly noteworthy were the
liberalization of rural product and factor markets, the termination of the compulsory labc'r
requirement on collective farms, and the lifting of the ban on wage labor. The shift of pubi'tc
expenditures towards roads, health and education, and away from defense expenditures (until the
war with Eritrea) and the implementation of a strong agricultural extension program, that
promoted the use of a package of inputs (fertilizers, improved seeds and husbandry, pesticides,
backed by extension and credit) also contributed to the improvement in rural incomes. However,
while poverty may have decreased in the early 90s, Ethiopia remained one of the poorest
countries in the world, with a per capita GDP of about US$1002. In 1995/96, over 45 percent of
the population lived in poverty, and 24 percent in extreme poverty.
14.     Vulnerability increased during the late 1990s. The impact of repeated droughts, the
spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and, more recently, the dislocations, infrastructure destruction
and decline in funding to social services due to the war have temporarily reversed some of the
past gains and increased the vulnerability of the poorest, particularly in rural areas. Ethiopia ranks
171 (out of 174 countries) in terms of the UN Human Development Index. Life expectancy has
declined to 43 years. More than two thirds of children are showing signs of stunting, a rate higher
than elsewhere in the region. Literacy rates of 27 percent are very low, with large gender aid
urban-rural gaps prevailing. However, the refocus of Government programs on primary educati,.n
and health care in the early 1990s resulted in an increase of the gross primary enrollment rate
from 29 percent in 1994 to 43 percent in 1998, and in an increase in the use of health facilities by
the poor. In preparation of the forthcoming PRSP, the Government is undertaking a detailed

15.    Ethiopia hosts the third largest number of people with AIDS in the world(after
South Africa and India). Over 9 percent of the Ethiopian adult population (3.2 million) is now
living with HIV/AIDS. The 650,000 AIDS orphans in Ethiopia are estimated to be the largest
number worldwide. Unless the epidemic is slowed, much of Ethiopia's economic development
efforts will be undermined, and its social fabric compromised. To address this issue, the
Government has established a National AIDS Council, under the chairmanship of the President,
and has launched a large program to combat HIV/AIDS (supported by IDA and other donors).
16.    The econonmic situation deteriorated during 1998/99-1999/2000, because of the
combined effect of the border conflict with Eritrea, the severe drought, and a pronounced
deterioration in the terms of trade. The macro-economic impact of the war was initially limited,
as the Government managed to contain the fiscal impact of the conflict by financing defense
expenditures through an increase in non-tax revenues, cuts in non-priority spending and extra-
budgetary funds. Nevertheless, by 1998/99 the fiscal deficit climbed to 8.5 percent of GDP,
mostly on account of a surge in defense spending and, partially, the relief effort for drought
victims. Donor support was largely withheld because of the military conflict. This translated into
increased domestic borrowing and a further hike of the fiscal deficit to 11.6 percent of GDP in
1999/2000.
17.   In addition to the impact of the war and the drought, Ethiopia was hit by a severe terms of
trade decline during 1998/99 and 1999/2000 (see Table 1). Much of this was due to a fall in
export prices (see Figure 1). While volume of coffee was initially maintained, export values
declined by more than 30 percent in 1998/99 and a further 10 percent in 1999/2000. The trade
deficit increased from US$755 million in 1997/98 to US$1074 million in 1998/99, reaching
US$1246 million in 1999/2000. Ethiopia's currency came under pressure and in January 2000 the
Government imposed temporary restrictions to protect its exchange rate (a 10 percent import duty
surcharge, a 100 percent advance deposit requirement for import applications and ceilings on
import permits). Despite these measures, the current account deficit remained high, 7.5 percent
of GDP in 1999/2000, up from 1.6 percent in 1997/98. Foreign exchange reserves declined to
only 2 months of imports. With the signing of the peace agreement, the Government intensified
the implementation of its reform program. In January 2001, the Government lifted the import
restrictions in anticipation of external support from the donor community and debt relief with the
Enhanced HIPC Initiative.

II.    THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRAM
A. OVERVIEW AND KEY GOVERNMENT OBJECTIVES
18.   The Government's primary development goal is equitable growth and poverty reduction.
Central to the achievement of this objective is the implementation of a long-term strategy of
agricultural development-led industrialization (ADLI), aimed at stimulating a rise of income in
rural areas, where 85 percent of the Ethiopian population live, and at inducing industrialization in
urban areas. The ADLI strategy was recently reconfirmed through a wide process of consultations
and is the basis of the National Development Strategy, which guides the five-year National
Development Program (NDP), during 2000/01-2004/05.
19.   The NDP has provided the broad framework for the I-PRSP, which has been endorsed by
the IMF and IDA Boards on March 19 and 20, 2001, respectively. The Government is now
preparing, in consultation with donors and other stakeholders, the full PRSP which is expected to
be presented to the Boards of the IMF and IDA in early 2002. The PRSP is expected to formulate-
specific policies, aimed at reducing poverty and achieving the International Development Goals
by 2015. The medium-term Government strategy for growth and poverty reduction is based on
the following pillars:
i   Raising rural incomes through increased agricultural productivity and
improved conditions for the non-farming economy. Policy instruments would
include agricultural input programs, improved credit facilities and measures
to upgrade human and physical infrastructure;
-  Removing impediments to private sector activity, reducing the role of the
state in the economy and accelerating export growth;
i   Reforming the civil service to improve effectiveness, ensuring good
governance and strengthening public expenditure management;
*   Improving the quality of life of the poor through the decentralized provision
of primary health care, education, water and sanitation services.
B.   THE MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
20.   The Government's reform program is supported by a macroeconomic framework that
aims at maintaining macroeconomic stability and promoting the recovery of growth. The
2000/01-2002/03 program is supported by a three-year arrangement under PRGF with the IMF
(see Box 1). The PRGF has been formulated within the context of a difficult balance of payments
situation - the result of a sharp deterioration in the terms of trade, drought conditions, and the
impact of the recent conflict with Eritrea. This situation is compounded by the recent lifting of
restrictions on imports which are necessary for the recovery of private sector growth.
21.   The program's objectives are to: i) increase economic growth to around 7 percent per
annum; ii) reduce inflation to low single digits; and iii) raise the import reserve cover to about
four months.  Achieving these objectives will require the following: improving resource
mobilization through a comprehensive reform of tax policies and administration; increasing
expenditure to key social and infrastructure services through a substantial reduction in defense
spending, restraint in non-social spending and reallocation of expenditure to poverty targeted
sectors; and a monetary policy geared at containing inflation and increasing the level of foreign
exchange reserves, while insuring adequate growth in domestic credit to the private sector.
8



Box 1: Ethiopia's PRGF Program
The PRGF program is aimed at assisting Ethiopia in getting back to macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth by
furthering cross-border economic liberalization, sound fiscal and monetary managemeni, and improvements in financial sector
regulation.
Ethiopia's integration into the global economy will be fostered by measures to liberalize the foreign trade and exchange regines and
allow market determination of the exchange rate. Specific reform steps are:
*    reduction of the un-weighted average tariff rate from 19.5 percent to 17.5 percent by 2003;
*    abolition of the remaining restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions (on the availability of
foreign exchange for holiday travel, and on payments for education abroad by foreign residents).
*    replacing the weekly foreign exchange wholesale auction conducted by the NBE with an interbank foreign exchange market
where the NBE would be one of the participants.
The rmancial sector is a second area of reform. Specific measures include:
*    launching a study of the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) to set up and consequently revise the Banking Law with a view to
increase the autonomy of the NBE and to improving the rules guiding Government borrowing;
*    enhancing indirect monetary control by introducing new instruments of monetary management, such as a rediscount facility and,
in the long run, a standing repo facility;
* improving treasury bill auctions by eliminating the interest rate cut-off, and introducing long-term treasury bills and a book entry
system for treasury bills;
*    putting the management of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) under contract with a reputable foreign institution, followed
by rehabilitation ofthe CBE, possibly including streamnlining ofthe CBE's functions, or its institutional reorganization;
*    implementing the rehabilitation plans for the smaller commercial banks to reduce their non-performing loans, and strengthening
banking supervision.
The Government is embarking on a comprehensive tax policy and tax administration reform. Measures include:
*    setting up a tax reform implementation task force to take the lead in the tax reform agenda;
*    reforming the system of indirect taxation by (i) increasing the top sales tax rate from  12 percent to 15 percent, and (ii)
introducing a Value Added Tax;
*    designing a three-year plan for the reduction in the effective rate of protection;
*    streamlining income tax legislation and reviewing the tax incentive system;
*    strengthening tax administration through (i) passing legislation for the introduction of tax identification numbers and for
increased collection power of revenue agencies, and (ii) establishing a large taxpayer unit.
22.       Increasing  growth, lowering inflation. GDP growth is projected to average around  7
percent during the next three years. It will be highest in 2000/01, because of a cyclical rebound
from drought and the disruption of war. There is evidence that adequate rains are contributing to a
good harvest and both public and private investments are picking up. The Government intends to
channel donor support into infrastructure programs to rebuild roads, schools, clinics and to social
programs. Conditions for private sector investment will be improved through a further
liberalization of the financial sector and of the foreign exchange and trade regimes, which are
supported under the PRGF programn. Measures to increase agricultural productivity will include
input programs, access to credit and marketing facilities and an upgrade of human and physical
infrastructure.
23.       Monetary policy will be geared to keeping inflation to low  single digits. The reduction in
the fiscal deficit, coupled with the expected resumption of foreign aid, will help rebuild foreign
reserves and enable a substantial increase in domestic credit to the private sector to finance
private investment. Annual average inflation is forecast to increase initially to 5.2 percent in
2000/01, up from 4.2 percent in 1999/2000, because of high oil prices and domestic tax increases
and then to decline to just above 2 percent by 2002/03.
24.    Reducing  the  overall fiscal deficit: The medium-term  fiscal stance is expected to  be
consistent with a sustainable extemal account deficit and low inflation. The fiscal deficit will
9



decline to just above 5 percent of GDP by 2002/033 (see Table 2). The fiscal strategy is based, on
the revenue side, (see Box 1) on a medium-term reform of tax policy and administration aimed at
increasing tax revenues by 2'/2 percentage
points of GDP  over the next three fiscal

2001/02. By contrast, spending on poverty
targeted  expenditures (education, health, agriculture, natural resources and  roads) will be
gradually increased (see Table 2). Funds expected from the HIPC initiative (including the interim
support) will be allocated to these sectors. Expenditures would be executed through the re-defined
and improved sectoral development programs (see paragraphs 40-41).
25.   Reducing the current account deficit. Projections of balance of payments trends assume
an improvement in the terms of trade, starting in 2001/02, with coffee prices recovering and oil
prices declining. After a 2.8 percent decline in the current fiscal year, export earnings are-
expected to increase on average by about 12 percent a year. Imports will initially grow at a slower
rate than GDP, the combination of a sharp decline in military imports and a rise in other imports
owing to the reconstruction and demobilization requirements. Food imports are expected to return
to normal levels. In the medium-term, import levels are forecast to remain high, reflecting the
increase in public and private investment. Private savings will also increase, reflecting
improvements in the financial sector and increases in personal incomes. Over time, dependence
on foreign savings will gradually decline.

26.   Ethiopia is currently seeking assistance under the Enhanced Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). An HIPC Updated Preliminary Document, approved by the
IMF and IDA's Boards in March 2001, recommends that Ethiopia be considered for a Decision
Point in the second half of 2001. Ethiopia's extemal debt burden remains high and unsustainable
3 Excluding temporary emergency programs for reconstruction and demobilization financed by IDA. The overall deficit includinlg
emergency programs is expected to be 8.4 percent of GDP in 2000/01, 8.8 percent in 2001/02 and 6.2 percent in 2002/03.
4 However, total revenue (in terms of GDP) will increase only marginally (see Annex D), because of a decline in non-tax revenue.

and it represents an obstacle to economic development. Publicly guaranteed external debt will
amount, at the end of 2000/0 1, to about US$5.7 billion in nominal terms. More than half of this
debt is owed to multilateral institutions, with IDA and other multilateral institutions accounting
for 38.5 percent and 18 percent of the total debt respectively. Commercial debt is relatively small,
accounting for 2.5 percent of the public and publicly guaranteed debt.
27.     With the delivery of assistance under the enhanced HIPC initiative, Ethiopia's external
debt burden will be reduced significantly. It is estimated that the debt service-to-exports ratio
would decline from 22.4 percent in 2000/01 and 16.8 percent in 2002/03 (before debt relief) to
18.9 percent and 8 percent respectively (after debt relief) and average 5.5 percent thereafter5.
Debt-service savings from multilateral lenders would amount to US$1.039 billion, delivering
over US$64 million per year between 2001/02 and 2008/09 and about US$48 million per year
thereafter.
28.   Risks. Sustaining economic growth in Ethiopia is difficult. Output and exports remain
dependent on agriculture, which leaves Ethiopia vulnerable to droughts, plant diseases and
commodity price fluctuations. As discussed in Box 2, changes in the price of coffee- which
represents 60 percent of Ethiopia's export earnings- or in oil prices, are of particular concern.
However, these risks should be mitigated by the implementation of the reform program supported
by the ERSC, which is expected to foster private sector development and, in the medium-term,
export diversification. Furthermore, the availability of finance from development partners, as well
as debt relief, will ensure a level of international reserves that will provide sufficient cushion
against external shocks.
29.   Financing requirements. Near term  financing requirements for balance of payments are
shown in Table 3. The total financing need is expected to average US$1228.2 million per year
between 2000/01-2002/03, corresponding to 18 percent of GDP. Annual disbursement of official
long-term loans amounts to 3.9 percent of GDP a year. Foreign direct investment would represent
0.9 percent of GDP a year. The emergency strategy proposed by IDA until 2002/03 would total
US$783 million (equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP). Debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative, would close the remaining financing gap. The financing plan is associated with an
increase in reserves from a level of 2.6 months of imports of goods and non factor services in
2000/01 to 4.1 months by 2002/03.

Box 2: The Impact of High Oil and Low Coffee Prices on the Balance of Payments and Fiscal Accounts
This exercise examines the sensitivity of Ethiopia's balance of payments and fiscal accounts to price and quantity assumptions for coffee
exports and fuel imports for the 2000/01 to 2003/04 fiscal years. The comparison is with the base case and assumptions are incladed in
the macroeconomic framework, as outlined in Tables 2 and the Annex Tables. An updated base case is included to reflect the IDA/IMF's
current price projections for coffee and crude oil; and it includes the Government's expectation of a 30 percent fall in the volume of
exports during 2000/01. High and low case coffee and crude oil price assumptions were developed by DECPG to reflect the estimated
upper and lower bound of a 70 percent confidence interval on the price projections.

Scenarios. Three scenarios are analyzed: the updated case scenario shows the effect of updated price forecasts for coffee and crude oil,
and the effect of a 30 percent decline in coffee export volume due to the drought in 2000/01. The best case combines the assurmption of
high coffee and low crude oil price assumptions from Table 1.The low case combines the assumptions of low coffee prices and high
crude oil price. In all three scenarios, coffee export volumes are assumed to be 30 percent below the base case in 2000/01 and return to
normal thereafter.
Results
In the updated scenario, coffee exports will likely be reduced by US$72 million in 2000/01, relative to the base case, because of a
drought induced 30 percent fall in output and lower world coffee prices. This will be partially offset by a US$34 million fall in energy
import costs, due to lower energy prices, and a US$16 million fall in other imports. The trade deficit is expected to increase US$22
million relative to the base case. The shortfall in export revenues would progressively narrow and disappear by 2003/04. At the same
time, oil import costs would fall along with lower oil prices. The net impact would be negative in 2000/01, neutral in 2001/(02, and
positive in 2002/03-2003/04. Initial negative shocks to expenditure and the current account would tum positive by the end of the :forecast
period.
Significant medium-term commodity price risks exist and a range of up to US$100 million in export revenues and US$40 mi Ilion in
import costs could reasonably be anticipated between the best and worst case scenarios. In the best case scenario of high coffee price and
low oil price, there is a US$53.6 million reduction in export revenues (6.1 percent), because of the assumed 30 percent fall in coffee
export volumes. This reduces GDP (-US$19 million) and its major components (consumption and investment); but the fall in demand
and lower reserves (-US$3 million) also reduce imports, which are down by US$44.4 million. Both oil and non-oil imports are lower, oil
imports by US$38.1 million and non-oil imports by US$6.3 million. In the outer years of the forecast, the net impact of the scenarios is
positive.
In the worst case scenario of low coffee and high oil prices, nominal dollar GDP could be reduced by 3 percent from the base case. That
would be accompanied by a deterioration of the current account balance of over US$50 million in 2000/01 and around US$30 million
thereafter. Reserves would fall by US$18 million in 2000/01, and continue to fall through 2003/04 to USS53 million. Government
revenues and expenditures both fall, with a small, positive impact on the fiscal deficit of US$15 million - US$20 million. While the
impact might prove disruptive, it would not be large enough to pose a threat to the country's external viability since the current
account would deteriorate by about one-half percent of GDP and reserves would fall by less than 7 percent. It is also likely that additional
donor financial support would be mobilized to help Ethiopia maintain the momentum of its poverty reduction and growth program, in the
event of another shock.
C. THE GOVERNMENT'S MEDIUM-TERM REFORM PROGRAM
30.      The following sections describe the Government's medium-term  reform  program  and the
specific measures that are adopted under the ERSC. The ERSC supports the continuation of a
stable macroeconomic framework, which will be monitored in the context of the PRGF, and the
reallocation of public expenditure from defense to poverty-targeted sectors. The budget for
2000/01, approved in November 2000, is consistent with the objectives of the medium- term
12



macroeconomic framework. Latest indications are that budget execution is broadly on track,
albeit with much lower than projected defense spending. Projections on the basis of the early
months would indicate that these defense expenditures are likely to be significantly lower than
approved in the current budget. The ERSC supports policy improvements in the following areas:
(i) Public Sector Management; (ii) Public Expenditure Policy and Management; (iii) Private
Sector Development and Export Competitiveness.
D.   PUBLIC SECTOR MANAGEMENT
31.   Main Issues. Weaknesses in public administration have been acknowledged since the
early 1990s. Incentive problems, primarily caused by inadequate wages, have hindered the
development of a motivated, capable, and professional civil service. There is a clear need to
develop arrangements that place a premium on improved service delivery and client orientation.
Implementation of administrative reforms is particularly challenging because of the broad powers
and authority afforded to sub-regional governments in the 1994 Constitution. The process of
regionalization offers civil servants opportunities to be more responsive to local needs but
demands much more in terms of front-line service delivery performance, client-orientation, and
capacity. By contrast, the role of the federal Govemment, particularly in areas of national interest
such as policymaking, standards setting, and monitoring, requires greater clarification as regional
authorities take on the bulk of responsibility for the delivery of essential services.
32.   Ethiopia's Civil Service Reform Program. In 1996, the Civil Service Reform Program
(CSRP) was launched as part of an overall effort to build a transparent, efficient, effective, and
ethical civil service that would meet Government's standards for improved governance. The five
major sub-programs of the CSRP comprise: (i) Expenditure Control and Management; (ii) Human
Resource Management; (iii) Service Delivery and Quality of Service; (iv) Top Management
Systems; and (v) Ethics. While the Program is comprehensive in scope, implementation has
lagged in the last two years because of the effects of the war, poor coordination, and limited
managerial capacity. Strengthening the civil service is now a high priority for the Government as
it seeks to carry out the ambitious reconstruction and development strategy articulated in the 1-
PRSP.
33.   Elements of a renewed implementation strategy for the CSRP over the short- to medium-
run include: (i) establishing the legal framework for a modern civil service; (ii) improving service
delivery performance; (iii) creating an enabling environment for civil servants by improving pay
and remuneration; and (iv) enhancing the transparency of personnel management systems.
Progress has been made in these four areas, which build on the Human Resources Management
(HRM), Service Delivery and Quality of Service; and Ethics Sub-programs of the Government's
CSRP. Annual Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs), conducted jointly by the Govemnment, IDA
and other donors, have increasingly focused on the institutional constraints that hinder effective
policy and program implementation at the federal and regional levels.
34.   The status of key administrative reforms, which are priorities in the CSRP and would be
supported in the ERSC and in follow-on operations, are as follows:
Legal framework: The Federal Civil Service Commission (FCSC) has
prepared a draft Civil Service Law. Drawing on international 'good
practices', it provides a broad framework for management of a modern, and
competitive civil service. It includes provisions for a new code of conduct, a
system of job classification and grading, an open appraisal system, grievance
and appeals procedures, access to personal information, as well as sanctions
against various forms of misconduct.
13



*   A Civil Service-wide Code of Conduct, as well as a draft "National Charter
of Citizen's Rights and Responsibilities," are being developed in parallel and
provide for the strengthening of accountability relationships between
government institutions and the public at large. Specifically, the Charter
wraps together service and ethical conduct standards, access to information,
procedural fairness, and protection from wrongdoing. Taken together, these
documents constitute the state-of-the-art informal rules for ethical standards
in the civil service. A program for ethics education would ensure that civil
servants and citizens are aware of the new norms and standards that are
expected of them.
*   Improving service deliverv performance: The Government, in consultation
with federal and regional authorities, is developing a National Policy on
Service Delivery to improve the management and client-orientation of
institutions involved in the delivery of essential services. The policy, which
recommends modern management practices such as increasing accessibility
to clients, enhancing transparency, and achieving cost-effectiveness,
represents an initial step towards a greater performance-orientation across all
Government levels.
*   Civil service pay and restructurinz: Inadequate pay for civil servants has
resulted in an increasing incidence of moonlighting, poor work performance
across grade and skill levels and a steady migration of skilled staff to private
firms, NGOs, and donor agencies. Remuneration surveys indicate that private
sector wages are on average about 125 percent higher than those in the civil
service. Pay for civil servants at the lowest grades is not sufficient to meet
even a quarter of the requirements for household subsistence. A Job
Classification and Grading (JCG) exercise has been initiated to determine
appropriate pay levels based on an analysis of internal job comparisons and
the existing system of position classification. Over the next two years the
FCSC intends to integrate the findings of the market comparator surveys and
the JCG exercise; and to elaborate various scenarios for increasing wages and
restructuring the federal civil service within medium-term fiscal targets.
Current staffing levels may have to be revised in light of the proposed pay
increase, in order to avoid unwanted budget pressures.
*   Enhancing the transparency of personnel management systems: The federal
Government intends to decentralize various personnel management
functions, such as recruitment, to line agencies. In preparing for this role, the
FCSC is developing a Government-wide Human Resource Management
Information System (HRMIS), which would ensure access to real-time
information on personnel management within the federal civil service. A
computerized Records and File System, as a first step for a well-functioning
HRMIS, is being prepared. Once the planned development of a Wide Area
Network (WAN) across federal line agencies is also completed, it should
provide a platform for the roll-out of the HRMIS as well as the Financial
Management System in the future. The Government intends to adopt an
integrated policy on information and technology, to delineate standards for
hardware and software, as well as the recruitment of information technology
(IT) personnel.
35.    Expected results from CSRP. Ethiopia expects that implementation of the CSRP would
achieve several benefits. First, a more efficient civil service, the result of an increased awareness
14



among civil servants of rights and responsibilities (which will be monitored through public
officials' surveys); and of an improvement in managerial practices and incentives, including a
better pay for both federal and regional civil servants, leading to a greater retention of qualified
personnel.  Second, greater citizen participation in monitoring performance of ministries,
departments, and agencies. Finally, increased availability of personnel data and other information
across federal and regional institutions required for planning purposes.
Program Supported by the ERSC
36.    The ERSC supports the Government's ongoing CSRP, and specifically, the key areas of
administrative reform discussed above, in order to achieve expected results. Pursuant to this, the
following measures have been taken by the Govemment:
*   A draft Civil Service Law has been approved by the Council of Ministers.
*   A diagnostic survey of Job Classification and Grading has been launched.
*   The 1999 labor market survey on wage differentials between private-public
sector jobs has been completed.
*   Criteria for integrating findings from JCG and labor market survey in view of
formulating a medium-term pay and employment policy have been
developed.
*   The Council of Ministers has adopted a Draft National Policy on Service
Delivery.
v   The piloting of a software for records and filing system, a prerequisite for the
HRMIS, has been completed and the roll out of the system across federal line
agencies has been initiated.
Medium-term program
37.  Actions before end 2001/02. Subject to approval by Council of People's Representatives,
the Government intends to implement, during the next fiscal year, the Civil Service Law, as well
as the National Policy on Service Delivery. These laws are critical to a variety of other civil
service reform activities planned under the CSRP during 2001/02: a Civil Service-wide Code of
Conduct, in line with the National Charter on Citizen's Rights and Responsibilities; the adoption
by the Council of Ministers of medium-term pay and employment policy for federal civil service
consistent with the Macro-Economic and Fiscal Framework; the development of ethics training
curriculum for federal civil servants; and the introduction of report cards to monitor client
feedback in federal institutions piloting the national Policy on Service Delivery. The Government
also expects to complete the automation of all personnel data for federal civil servants in the
Federal Civil Service Commission and federal line agencies. Finally, an Inter-ministerial
Technical Committee to develop an IT policy for systems integration will be established by July
2001. The Committee will oversee the preparation of an IT policy, which will be reviewed and
approved by the Council of Ministers during next fiscal year.
38.    Actions before end 2002/03. During the fiscal year 2002/03, it is envisaged that the
Government will begin implementing the pay and employment strategy in conjunction with the
necessary restructuring of line agencies and departments. Institutional codes of conduct as well
as departmental citizens' charters (service standards, provisions for access to information,
procedural fairness, and protection from wrongdoing) will also be drafted in parallel, along with
implementation of good management practices recommended in the National Service Delivery
Policy. The required ethics and management training will be provided as well. Taken together,
15



these measures would provide the state-of-the-art in the formal rules for an ethical and
professional civil service. Results of client report cards will be published. As regards automation
of personnel data as part of the information required for a more decentralized approach to civil
service management, the Government will oversee the installation of a Wide Area Network and
the roll-out HRMIS across federal institutions.
E.   PUBLIC EXPENDrrURE POLICY AND MANAGEMENT
39.    The Government is undertaking a comprehensive reform  program  for strengthening
public expenditure policy and management. It includes two components: i) efforts to reallocate
resources away from military towards development related activities. These efforts are aimed at
attaining the social and poverty reduction targets identified in the I-PRSP; and, ii) an overall plan
for assuring sound public resource management. Donor agencies-bilateral and multilateral-are
supporting the Government's strategy to strengthen public expenditure through a number of
technical assistance programs. Moreover, annual PERs are being jointly undertaken with other
donor agencies to assess the strengths and weaknesses of this strategy, and help the Government
to move forward on the reform agenda.
Restructuring public expenditures
40.    The Government's resource allocation strategy suffered a setback during the receni.
conflict with Eritrea. Defense spending peaked at 13.3 percent of GDP (nearly half of the total
public expenditure budget) in 1999/2000, up from 8.7 percent of GDP in 1998/99. By contrast,
poverty targeted expenditures fell from 10.8 percent of GDP in 1998/99 to 8.6 percent of GDP ini
1999/2000 (see Table 1). However, part of the rise in military expenditure was achieved through
an increase in total spending levels, and actual recurrent spending on the social sectors declined
only slightly during 1999/2000. In the 2000/01 budget the Government has increased allocations
to the health and education sectors (see Table 4). A three-year plan to progressively reduce!
defense spending and to use the released resources for poverty-targeted sectors is identified under
the I-PRSP and is monitored under the PRGF agreement. The I-PRSP also identifies6 targets for a
number of social indicators. These targets will be fully developed in the PRSP.
41.    The Government intends to use debt relief under the enhanced HIPC Initiative to finance
growth-promoting and poverty-reducing activities. The share of spending allocated to the
poverty-targeted sectors in total government expenditures is expected to rise from 26 percent in
1999/2000 to 45 percent (excluding HIPC-financed expenditure), or 50 percent (including HIPC-
related outlays) by 2002/03 (or from 8.6 percent of GDP to 14 percent of GDP, including HIPC,
as shown in Table 4). Education and health expenditures would be executed within the
framework of the Sector Development Programs (SPDs), initially introduced in 1998. Pursuit of
the programs in the last two years has been hampered by lack of funding, due to the war and to
the withdrawal of donor grants. Implementation and service delivery bottlenecks also played a
role. The Govemment has completed a review of the SDPs in Education and Health. In addition,
it has recently convened a Task Force to analyze implementation issues. The Task Force has
submitted a report to the MoF on the implementation bottleneck of the SDPs and the MoF is
developing recommendations to address these. Each year the Govemment will make sure that
executed public expenditure for poverty targeted sectors are consistent with allocated expenses.
6 The Government's stated targets, to be achieved between 2000/01-03, as laid out in the I-PRSP, include: i) to increase access l o
basic health services from 51 percent of the population to 55 percent; ii) to increase child immunization rates from 60 percent to 70
percent; iii) to increase the gross primary enrollment rate from 46 percent to 50 percent; iv) to reduce repetition rates in Grades 4-8
from 12.1 percent to 6.4 percent; and v) to improve the ratio of girls to boys in primary school from 37.8 percent to 45 percent.

Strengthening public expenditure management
42.    Main issues. Ethiopia's public finance management system is disciplined, spending is in
compliance with budgeted allocations, and corruption and leakage are low relative to other
countries. Budget allocations are honored by the federal Ministry of Finance and the regional
finance bureaus, and are adhered to by the spending agencies as hard budget constraints. Re-
appropriation from one budget head to another requires legislative approval at the regional or
federal level. While there are bottlenecks in timely reporting of expenditures at the regional level
and below, generally the variations between the budget allocations and actual outcomes are
minimal. Nevertheless, there is considerable scope for improving Ethiopia's public expenditure
management system. For instance, linkages between planning, policy and budgetary allocations
are weak, and in most cases, expenditure allocations are based on immediate funding
requirements rather than policy choices. Second, capital and recurrent budgets follow separate
budget processes. And, finally, timely preparation of accounts and then audits requires faster
reporting from the lower levels of Govermnent.
43.    Reforming public expenditure management is inherently a long-term process that requires
broad ownership as well as a well-developed sequencing strategy. The reform task in Ethiopia is
both complex and difficult for two main reasons. First, there are four tiers of government -
federal, regional, zonal and woreda - and each of them has responsibilities for resource
management and service delivery. And second, at each level, but more pronouncedly at the lower
levels, there are severe technical capacity and resource constraints. Sub-national governments in
Ethiopia share public spending responsibilities in sectors such as agriculture, water development,
health and education. Within health and education, regional governments are responsible for all
service delivery at the primary and secondary levels.
44.    Ethiopia's Public Expenditure Management Reform Strategy. The main objective of
the reform strategy is to put together a modern public expenditure management system that
17



enhances accountability and effectiveness. The overarching framework is detailed in th,
Expenditure Management & Control Program (EMCP) of the CSRP. The resource management
strategy is also reflected in the Government's I-PRSP and is supported by the ERSC. The main
components of Ethiopia's public expenditure management strategy (and their current status) are
detailed below:
*  Public Investment Program (PIP). 1997 legislation introduced a three year
rolling PIP which, however, was not implemented. A Macro-economic and
Fiscal Framework (MEFF) was also prepared but not approved. As a result,
requests for the capital.budget by public bodies have not been based on any
medium-term planning and/or prioritization. The conflict with Eritrea
contributed to diverting the required attention of the authorities on the
implementation of the PIP. Lack of confidence in the fiscal forecasts also
played a role.
.  Financial Calendar.  Predictability and timely availability of funds are
necessary for spending units to be able to execute their budget properly.
Without the annual budget conforming to a pre-set calendar, regional
governments may find out very late in the fiscal year the amount of the annual
subsidy. In order to remedy this problem, the Government has put together a
financial calendar (Budget Reform Design Manual, Version 2.1, February 17,
2000), and adherence to it is expected to begin soon.
*  Preparation of Accounts and Reporting. A project team has been working to
improve the accounting system at all levels of Government with the aim of
reducing the backlog in reporting the audited accounting. Accounts are now
being prepared for 1997/98 and 1998/99 for which data are complete.
Training has been imparted to 2000 staff at the woreda level.
*  Audit and Financial Management System . The Govemment is committed to
undertake reforms on the internal and external audits and on the financial
management system.
> Internal Audit. A Project Group is putting together a reform
program  for the internal audit system.  With external
assistance, the Group has prepared a Manual on Principles of
Audit and a Procedural Guide.
> External Audit. The Office of the Federal Auditor General
(FAG) is responsible for providing the external oversight
function in Ethiopia. Appointed by and reporting to the
Council of People's Representatives, the FAG has a tenure
of five years. Each regional state has its own office of the
Auditor General. Besides auditing the accounts prepared by
the MoF, the FAG also inquires selectively about funds of
budgetary institutions and undertakes performance audits.
Accounts for all category of spending, including defense, are
reported to the FAG's office. The reform program in the area
of external audit includes financial and performance audits.
Training manuals and procedural guides are being
developed, as well as a design manual for financial audit.
> Financial Management System. The financial management
system is being improved, to facilitate on-time preparation
and reporting of Government accounts at all levels. All the
18



finance bureaus of regions have been computerized and a
standard PC-based software has been introduced. The future
plan is to create a financial data base that links all accounts
at the federal and regional levels. Training to build capacity
is being sequenced at the federal, regional and woreda levels.
* Public Expenditure Plan (PEP). The Government realizes that preparing a
comprehensive multi-year PEP requires capital and recurrent spending
decisions to be taken together. Currently, while the Ministry of Economic
Development and Cooperation (MEDaC) prepares the capital budget (and is
mainly responsible for the PIP), the MoF separately puts together the
recurrent budget. A similar setup exists at the regional level where bureaus of
planning and finance undertake the respective tasks. The Government has
now proposed a PEP, i.e. a medium-term, three-year rolling expenditure plan
for each public body at a program level that includes total - capital and
recurrent - expenditures. It has all the necessary elements to monitor and
adjust (as necessary) the links between budgetary inputs and development
outputs/outcomes. The PEP intends to develop unit costs and eventually
move towards performance budgeting.
Program Supported by the ERSC
45.   The ERSC supports the initial stages of the Government's medium-term program for
strengthening public expenditure in the following ways: (i) helping with the transition to post-
conflict re-establishment of the social sector programs, mostly through restoring funding levels;
(ii) supporting the strengthening of implementation capacity, to overcome absorptive bottlenecks
on the utilization of additional funding; (iii) laying out the basis for longer-term social sector and
poverty programs, through review and reformulation of sector strategies and targets; and (iv)
supporting the components of the expenditure management program discussed above. Specific
measures that the Government has undertaken before Board presentation of the ERSC include:
*   Completion of the review of SDPs in Education and in Health.
*   Submission by the Task Force to the MoF of a report on implementation
bottlenecks of SDPs (procurement, financial management, monitoring and
reporting).
*   Agreement on an action plan to develop an improved FMIS.
*   Provision of an action plan to indicate progress and future plans for improving
the accounting system, in particular for reducing the current backlog of
accounts preparation and reporting for audit.
*   The establishment of a committee with membership from the Ministry of
Economic Development and Cooperation (MEDaC) and Ministry of Finance
(MoF) to, inter alia, facilitate Government-donor dialogue on public
expenditure issues. The above committee will hold semi-annual meetings with
donors on public expenditure issues.
Medium-term program
46.   Before the end of 2001/02, the Government plans to undertake the following measures:
by October 2001, the Council of Ministers will adopt a MEFF and a Public Investment Program
(PIP), which will lead to the budget for 2002/03 and by December 2001 both will be submitted to
the Council of People's Representatives. It will also prepare any necessary legislation relating to
19



the PEP and present it to the Council of People's Representatives for approval. Furthermore, by
June 200 1 a technical coordination committee comprising staff from MEDaC and MoF will be
constituted, with the aim  of better integrating current and capital spending.  MEDaC, ill
coordination with the MoF, will also prepare a plan laying out the resource requirements and a
timetable to help the regional states in carrying forward their multi-year planning and budgeting
process. The Government will adhere to the financial calendar (as specified in the Budget Desigr.
Manual) for the annual planning and budgetary cycle leading to the budget of 2002/03, and notif,
Regions of estimated subsidies for that budget in conformity with the financial calendar (Januar.'
9 - January 16, 2002) as outlined in the Budget Reform Design Manual. As to the backlog of
accounts and audits, the Government intends to reduce it from the current 5 years to 3 years
Finally, the Government will implement the findings of the FMIS study; reformulate the SDPs in
Health and Education in line with PRSP priorities; and adopt the recommendations to resolve the
bottlenecks for improving the implementation of the SDPs.
47.    Actions before end 2002/03. To protect the funding for basic social services at the
grassroots level, the Government has signaled its intention to re-direct additional resources to the
regional Governments that have responsibility for delivery of core educational and healtl
services.7 Before the end of 2002/03, the review and reformulation of the education and health
sector strategies and targets will be completed as part of PRSP. After approval of the MEFF and
PIP by the Council of People's Representatives, they will be presented to the donor community.
This will enable donors to design their aid programs in conformity with budget priorities. To
begin the implementation of the PEP at the regional level, the Government will prepare an action
plan laying out resource requirements and timetable to help regions carry out their multi-year
planning and budgeting process. Finally, the reform of the internal and external audits, as well
that of the financial management system, will be further advanced.
48.  Expected benefits of the actions and reforms are many and include: adequate funding for
poverty targeted sectors, which would lead to more efficient public services, and to improved
health and education indicators, a functional multi-year planning and budgeting exercise at the
federal level; predictable and timely availability of funds leading to better procedures fi)r
planning and budgeting at the regional level; and improved budgeting and planning through better
balance between capital and recurrent expenditures. Finally, a reduction in the existing backlog of
accounts preparation, reporting and auditing and an improved financial management system.
49.    Expenditure tracking. Public expenditure reforms will result, in the medium term, in a
significant improvement in the process of targeting public expenditures. Expenditures are ncw
tracked through the preparation of joint annual PERs by the Government, the World Bank and
several donor agencies. Under the ongoing PER, the Bank and DflD are working with the regions
to analyze and strengthen expenditure tracking at the regional level. Annual reviews of the SD'P's
by the Government and donors, would suggest corrective action where necessary. In addition,
annual household surveys, as well as the poverty analysis undertaken by the welfare monitoring
system (WMS) would enable the monitoring of public expenditure from a quality viewpoint, and
the assessment of the impact of public spending on the poor.
F.   PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AND EXPORT COMPETITIVENESS
50.  Issues: Ethiopia has shifted from a socialist to a market economy and some elements for a
strong take-off of the private sector are already in place. These include macroeconomic stabilily,
Responsibility for delivery and funding of primary and secondary education lies with the Regions. The Federal Government has
responsibility for overall policy, some general administrative functions, and tertiary institutions. Similarly in health care, primary
health care, health posts and centers, and most hospitals are the responsibility of the Regions.

market liberalization and expansion of education. However, many constraints still hinder private
sector development:
*  Regulatory constraints impose high transaction costs on business operations
and discourage foreign investment.
*  The share of exports to GDP is one of the lowest in the world and there is
little diversification of exports. The Government has broadly accepted the
thrust of the analysis contained in a 1997 Bank Report on Exports8. The
Report proposed a comprehensive set of measures to boost export growth,
particularly in the manufacturing sector. Following the Report's
recommendations, a number of policy improvements have been made in
several key areas since 1997: the elimination of ex-ante price verification for
all exports, except coffee, the simplification of procedures for non-equity
collaboration with foreign firms, and the introduction of a duty draw-back
system and export finance guarantees. In the 2000/01 budget a temporary 10
percent surcharge on imports was eliminated, thus reducing average tariff
rates to 19.5 percent. However, partly because of the slow implementation of
the reform program, export growth rates have not yet reached a satisfactory
level. Actions implemented under the ERSC would complete the set of
measures recommended in the 1997 Report, while improving on the
formulation of some of the measures already taken.
-  Ethiopia's privatization program  began in March 1995, about a year after
Proclamation No. 87/94 had established the Ethiopian Privatization Agency
(EPA). Since then, 166 state owned enterprises (SOEs) were sold, mostly
retail outlets, restaurants and small scale firms. The privatization process is
well organized, and conducted in an open and competitive framework. The
current privatization phase involves enterprises that are large and in key
industrial sectors (e.g. leather industry, textiles, construction, mining,
agricultural industry). The Government is planning to bring to the point of
sale 111 SOEs by 2002/03, thus completing the program of privatization in
the agriculture and industrial sectors.
*  In agriculture, an efficient fertilizer market, which is a crucial condition for
increasing yields, has so far failed to materialize. In part, this is because the
government Extension Intervention Program,9 which provides fertilizer to
farmers, is being implemented at a larger scale and much beyond the initial
two years for which it was originally intended. It is estimated that the
Government share of the fertilizer market has by now risen to some 60 to 80
percent at different locations while much of the balance is with the
cooperatives.
*  Private participation in infrastructure (PPI) continues to face significant
obstacles. Much remains to be done to increase competition in service
provision. So far, PPI has been piecemeal (a decision was recently taken to
allow private participation in power and telecommunications) and there is a
need for an overall policy framework.
See World Bank (1997), 'Ethiopia: Export Development strategy', Report no. 17098-ET
9 The Govemment is undertaking a massive extension intervention program (EIP) which has by now covered some three million of the
7.5 million farmers in the country. Central to this extension effort, which is also described as Package Program, is the widespread and
efficient use of fertilizers by farmers to raise their crop productivity.
21



*  Entry barriers still represent an important obstacle to attracting foreign
investment. Furthermore, institutional weaknesses are hindering the
development of an efficient land lease market and the use of land as collateral.
Program supported by the ERSC
51.  The specific measures taken by the Government in the context of the ERSC represent a
significant progress in tackling the first four issues. They are an important step in an ongoing
process of improving the business environment and reducing the role of the State in the economy,
underpinned by regular dialogue with the Bank. The remaining issues (obstacles to FDI, land
markets and private participation in infrastructure) will be tackled in follow-on operations. The
Government has:
*  Signed a contract with consultants to initiate agreed study to identify
regulations which hinder private sector development (study expected to be
completed by March 2002).
*  The Export Promotion Council has reestablished its regular meetings aimed
at providing a forum of discussion to improve the environment for exports.
  The Council of Ministers has adopted a new Voucher-based Duty Exemption
scheme, open to all exporters with a genuine export order and to exporters
using Franco-valuta imports.
*  The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) has issued an Amended Directive on
Export Credit Guarantee Scheme allowing participating banks to charge
market interest rates, limiting the maximum  collateral requested to new
entrants and simplifying eligibility criteria.
*  The coverage of NBE export price monitoring has been restricted only to
products where international prices are available from recognized
international sources.
-  Export price information responsibility has been shifted out of NBE to the
Export Promotion Agency.
*  The requirement for the presentation of the Standards Authority's quality
certificate as a condition for export clearance where the buyer confirms
his/her acceptance of a different specification, or internationally accepted
standard, and his/her acceptance of certification of compliance by a party
other than the Authority has been waived.
*  Preparation for privatization of 21 enterprises (i.e. compile all documentation
necessary to send invitation to tender) has been completed.
*  Preparation for privatization of 13 enterprises (i.e. select winning bidders for
preparation) has been initiated.
*  A contract with the selected consulting firm to conduct an agreed study on
fertilizer marketing and credit has been signed.
*  Pending the results of the study, Government has recommended to all regional
governments to procure fertilizer for distribution under its extension programs
only on the basis of competitive bidding procedures, as is already the practice
in some regions.
22



Medium-term program
52.    Actions before end 2001/02. During the next fiscal year the Government is planning to
undertake a number of important policy measures in the area of private sector development. To
increase export competitiveness, the Suppliers Credit directive will be extended to cover suppliers
credit for inputs for the purpose of exports on a cash basis; the NBE will allow for automatic
registration, and drop the debt/equity ratio requirement for suppliers credit in relation to exports;
the export ban on raw hides and skins will be replaced by an export duty; the amended directive
on the Export Credit Guarantee scheme will become operational early in the financial year; and,
to facilitate the application of the Voucher Scheme, standard coefficients for imported inputs that
are needed for most common exports will be prepared. To improve the business environment and
attract foreign investment, the Government will eliminate case by case screening of foreign
investment not specified in the Negative Lists (the four lists which specify the areas of activity
where private investment is restricted), and eliminate the minimum investment requirement for
100 percent export investments. The Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation will be opened to
private sector participation. The privatization program will be accelerated by bringing to the point
of sale at least 40 additional enterprises (of which at least 10 enterprises before September 2001)
and by completing preparation for privatization of at least 20 enterprises. Furthermore, the
Govemment will implement the action plan derived from the study on regulatory constraints
undertaken in the previous year; it will initiate two additional studies, the first on the regulatory
framework of public utilities (gas, electricity, water), the second on the process of approving and
clearing of export shipment. As to land markets, the Government intends to take a number of
measures: first, the Urban Land Lease Proclamation (80/1993) will be reviewed to ensure that
banks taking leases as collateral are able to realize the full value of that collateral at any time;
second, it will recommend to each region to establish and maintain a Register of Land available
for investors (to include all charges and rights over each parcel of land fully investigated), and to
enter into negotiated arrangements with private investors to develop industrial parks. Finally, the
Government will prepare an action plan on the basis of the study on fertilizer marketing and
credit. Pending the result of this study, it will limit government's direct supply of inputs to the
Extension Intervention Program farmers to no more than two years (three years in woredas where
alternative channels are not available).
53.    Actions before end 2002/03. Steps to continue the medium-term agenda for private
sector development include: (a) performance assessments of a number of policy measures taken
in previous years, including the voucher-based duty exemption scheme, the Export Credit
Guarantee Scheme and the Suppliers Credit directive; (b) implementation of recommendations
from the studies on approving and clearing of export shipment and on the regulatory framework
of public utilities; (c) a review of the minimum investment requirement for foreign investors
(including for production for the domestic market); (d) completion of the privatization program of
111 state owned enterprises which had begun in 2000/01; and (f) implementation of the action
plan derived from the fertilizer marketing and credit.
54.    Expected results from reforms to promote private sector development and to improve
export competitiveness include: an improved and simplified regulatory framework for private
sector development; an increase in export activity, the result of a greater access to duty-free
inputs and credit and simplified customs procedures for exporters. In the medium-term, continued
progress on trade and foreign direct investment liberalization, as well as market deregulation, will
ensure the emergence of an open and competitive economic system and will facilitate the
integration of Ethiopia into the world economy.
23



III. THE PROPOSED CREDIT
A.   CREDIT RATIONALE AND COMPONENTS
55.   The proposed ERSC supports the Government's efforts in stabilizing the economy a;d
moving back to a sustainable path of growth, as a necessary condition for poverty reduction. Tlhe
proposed Credit would allow the Government to reduce domestic financing of the deficit and
rebuild foreign exchange reserves; it would finance increased private sector imports associated
with the removal, in early 2001, of restrictions in the foreign exchange market; and it would help
restoring key economic and social services, and rebuilding the institutional capacity needed to
deliver them.
56.   The Credit supports the implementation of a sound macroeconomic program, including
the reallocation of public spending towards poverty-reducing interventions. It also supports three
main components of the reform program outlined in the I-PRSP, namely: i) public sector
management; ii) public expenditure policy and management; and iii) private sector development
and export competitiveness. Other aspects of the reform program, e.g. financial sector
liberalization and foreign exchange markets reform, are supported by the IMF in the context of
the PRGF and by other stakeholders.
Link to the Country Assistance Strategy and the PRSP
57.   The last full CAS for Ethiopia was approved in 1997. Following the Cessation of
Hostilities Agreement in May 2000, IDA prepared the current Interim Support Strategy. The
strategy, endorsed by the IDA Board on December 5, 2000 is aimed at addressing the countr,'s
immediate post war recovery needs during the coming 12-24 months. A new CAS for Ethiopia
will be prepared in 2001/02. The CAS will draw on the PRSP, and will support the effective
utilization of additional resources that may become available under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.
58.  The ERSC provides transitional support for economic recovery from the conflict w:th
Eritrea and a drought, against the background of a sharp decline in the terms of trade. Moreover,
it supports some of the reforms outlined in the I-PRSP and expected to be further extended in Ithe
PRSP. If progress remains on track, the PRSP could be presented to the Boards of the IMF and
IDA in early 2002. The scope and pace for moving into a possible policy-based follow-on
operation would depend, inter alia, on progress with core diagnostic work in the areas of civil
service reform, public expenditure and financial management systems, procurement, and social
and private sector development.
Coordination with the IMF and Other Donors
59.   Effective donor coordination is an important goal of IDA's assistance strategy in
Ethiopia. The staffs of IDA and the IMF have worked closely with the authorities in designing the
macroeconomic framework and the program of structural reforms. Joint IMF-IDA missions are
currently helping the Government in the preparation of a sound financial sector reform. The staffs
of IDA and the IMF have completed and presented to the respective Boards a joint staff
assessment of the I-PRSP in March 2001. An agreement has been reached with the Government
on a timetable and process for preparing the full PRSP in the next fiscal year. Together with IDA
and the IMF, several development partners are actively involved with the Government in the
preparation of the PRSP. Since the signing of the peace agreement, a number of donors have
indicated their willingness to step up both technical and financial assistance to support the
implementation of the Government's medium-term reform program. The European Union, the
24



UNDP and other development partners are financing some of the studies and the technical
assistance required by the ERSC.
B.   CREDIT AMOUNT AND TRANCHING
60.   The Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia would borrow an
amount of US$150 million equivalent. The credit would be released in one tranche upon
effectiveness.
C.   SUMMARY OF FiDucIARY ARRANGEMENTS
61.   Disbursements: Disbursement arrangements will follow the Bank's standard simplified
procedures for structural adjustment credits. The proceeds of the credit will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the reform actions before Board presentation. Disbursements are
not linked to specific imports or expenditures. Upon effectiveness, IDA will deposit the proceeds
into a deposit account at the NBE at the request of the Borrower. A deposit account will be
opened at the NBE before effectiveness. If deposit account proceeds should be used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Development Credit Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to
either: (a) return that amount to the account for use for eligible purposes; or (b) refund the
amount directly to IDA, in which case IDA will cancel an equivalent un-disbursed amount of the
Credit. The administration of the credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance.
62.  Audits: If requested by IDA, the borrower will arrange for the audit of the deposit account.
The account would be audited by an independent extemal auditor acceptable to IDA, based on
Intemational Standards on Auditing applied on a consistent basis. The said audit report would be
submitted to IDA as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of
the Government fiscal year. Since the National Bank of Ethiopia will be responsible for the
management of the overall borrower resources, the Borrower will submit the annual auditors'
report on the accounts of the National Bank of Ethiopia.
63.  Reports: The Borrower will fumish to IDA  quarterly reports on receipts and
disbursements from the deposit account.
D.  REFORMS SUPPORTED BY THE ERSC
64.   The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia has embarked on a medium-term reform
program, being implemented within the framework of the I-PRSP. The main elements of the
reform program are set out in the Letter of Development Policy (Annex B) and summarized in the
Policy Matrix (Annex A).
65.   I-PRSP and Macroeconomic Framework. In their recent review of the Joint Staff
Assessment (ISA) of Ethiopia's I-PRSP, the Executive Directors of the IDA and of the IMF have
concluded that the I-PRSP provides a sound basis for the development of a PRSP and for IDA
concessional assistance. Ethiopia's macroeconomic framework is supported by a PRGF
arrangement.
66.    Ethiopia has completed the following reform actions prior to presentation of the
proposed Credit to the Board:
* Adoption of draft Civil Service Law by the Council of Ministers.
* Adoption by the Council of Ministers of the Draft National Policy on Service
Delivery.
25



*  Launch of diagnostic survey of Job Classification and Grading.
*  Completion of 1999 labor market survey on wage differentials between
private-public sector jobs.
*  Development of criteria for integrating findings from JCG and the labor market
survey in view of formulating a medium-term pay and employment policy.
*  Establishment of a committee consisting of staff from the MEDaC and the
MoF to, inter alia, facilitate the Government-donor dialogue on public
expenditure issues. The above committee will hold semi-annual meetings with
donors on public expenditure issues.
*  Agreement with IDA on Action Plan to develop an improved FMIS.
*  Adoption by the Council of Ministers of new Voucher-based Duty exemption
scheme, open to all exporters with a genuine export order and to exporters
using Franco valuta imports.
*  NBE has issued an Amended Directive on Export Guarantee Scheme allowing
participating banks to charge market interest rate, limiting the maximum
collateral requested to new entrants and simplifying eligibility criteria
*  The coverage of the NBE export price monitoring has been restricted only to
products where international prices are available from recognized international
sources.
-  Export price information responsibility has been shifted out of NBE to the
Export Promotion Agency.
*  The requirement for the presentation of the Standards Authority's quality
certificate as a condition for export clearance where the buyer confirms his/her
acceptance of a different specification, or internationally accepted standard,
and his/her acceptance of certification of compliance by a party other than the
Standards Authority has been waived.
E.   IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
67.   The Ministry of Finance will have responsibility for the overall management of ihe
reform program. The Minister of Finance coordinates a working group, which includes, inter aia,
the Minister and representatives from MEDaC, the Ministry of Trade, the Federal Civil Service
Reform Commission, the Prime Minister's Office and the National Bank of Ethiopia. The group
has been working closely with IDA and IMF staff in preparing the reform program and will
continue to monitor its implementation. A number of technical committees, as detailed in the
Policy Matrix have been established to implement and monitor various aspects of the program
and to facilitate Government-donors dialogue. IDA and other donors will provide technical
assistance for the implementation effort as needed. The preparation of the full PRSP is Ethiopia-
led. The Govemment has established a Steering Committee at the Ministerial level to guide the
process and a technical committee to organize the analytical work and the consultative process.
The latter will involve consultations with the regions and municipalities, as well as with civil
society and representatives of the development community, NGOs and multilateral and bilateral
agencies.
26



F.   RISKS
68.  Besides economic risks, already discussed, the Credit faces three other categories of risks.
First is the possibility of resumption of hostilities with Eritrea. This risk is reduced by the
deployment of UN peace keeping troops which are monitoring the implementation of the peace
agreement; the creation of a border Temporary Security Zone, from which Ethiopia and Eritrea
have withdrawn their troops; and the demobilization of the army, which is proceeding at a faster
rate than anticipated. In addition, for the current year the Government anticipates a further
reduction of defense spending over the budgeted amount. Second, there is a significant risk of
delays in the implementation of the reform program because of weak institutional capacity in both
the public and private sectors. This risk would be reduced by the financial and technical
assistance provided by the donor community. The Government has also asked for an increase in
IDA assistance specifically in the area of capacity building. Finally, there is a risk of weakening
govemment commitment. So far, the Government has shown its strong commitment to the
reform program by implementing a number of reform actions in anticipation of the ERSC and by
parallel efforts to strengthen public expenditure management to improve monetary management,
and continue the financial sector reform.
IV. RECOMMENDATION
69,   I am satisfied that the proposed Credit complies with the Articles of Agreement of the
Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

MIr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
International Development Association
1818 H Street, NW
Washington DC 20433
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn.
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
1.    I am writing to request, on behalf of the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic
of Ethiopia, an Economic Rehabilitation and Support Credit (ERSC) of US$150 million from the
International Development Association (IDA) in support of our poverty reduction and cconomic
recovery strategy. The proposed credit will support our efforts to stabilize the economy and move
back to a sustainable path of growth. This letter sets out the actions that the Government of
Ethiopia will undertake over the short and medium term in order to implement its reform
program, focusing on measures that will improve public sector management, enhance the direct
impact of public expenditure on poverty reduction, and stimulate private sector development and
export competitiveness. I am attaching a policy matrix which we have prepared in collaboration
with the IDA team and which sets out the contents of this letter in summary form.
2.    The Government is preparing a poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) in which it will
articulate more fully the specific policies that will be implemented to reduce poverty and achieve
the International Development Goals by 2015. We expect to complete the full PRSP within the
next year, i.e. around March 2002, with the participation of the poor and in consultation with civil
society, the private sector and development partners. As a step towards the full PRSP, we have
prepared an Interim PRSP (I-PRSP). The I-PRSP was discussed by the IMF and the IDA Boards
in March 2001. It was endorsed as a sound basis for the preparation of a full PRSP and for

obtaining concessional assistance from the IDA and the IMF. Apart from the timeline and process
for preparing the full PRSP, the I-PRSP also spells out our objectives for promoting poverty
reduction and equitable growth.
3.    The reform program for the ERSC is based on the objectives described in the I-PRS P.
The ERSC has an important bridging function. It provides interim support until follow on
operations can be requested on the basis of our medium and long term reform program of poverty
reduction which is being elaborated in the full PRSP. For the prioritization process in the attachod
Policy Matrix we have concentrated, in conformity with this timetable, on short term measures
that are critical to our reform program. These measures are therefore proposed as specific
milestones for the ERSC. The remaining actions for 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 indicate our best
current estimate of measures that will be at the core of our poverty reduction strategy.
Background and Recent Developments
4.     Poverty in Ethiopia: During the 1990s, Ethiopia has made progress in increasing growth
and reducing poverty. However, it remains one of the poorest countries in the world: 47 percelnt
of its rural population and 33 percent of its urban population count as poor. Our per capita incormie
of US$100 is among the lowest of the least-developed countries, and reliance on agriculture is
among the highest in the group. Socio-economic indicators in Ethiopia are also among the worst
worldwide, reflecting widespread poverty: life expectancy at birth is only 43 years, 47 percent of
children under five are malnourished, the illiteracy rate is 63 percent and gross primary
enrollment is 43 percent; all these figures are worse than the sub-Saharan average.
5.    In 1999/2000 our economic situation deteriorated because of severe drought conditions, a
22 percent decline in the terms of trade - reflecting a sharp drop of coffee export prices and a
steep rise in petroleum import prices - and the impact of a border conflict with Eritrea which had
erupted in 1998. Thanks to large food grants by donors and government purchases of grain in
surplus areas a catastrophe in the drought stricken areas could be avoided. Nevertheless, our
external position worsened, and official reserves declined to two months of import cover. In
December 2000 we signed a peace agreement with Eritrea, thus ending a two year long conflict.
In March 2001 the IMF Board approved a three-year arrangement under a Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF). However, our external economic position will remain vulnerable during
the current year because of lower than expected coffee prices and an anticipated 30 percent fall in
coffee production. Simulations show that a further deterioration in the terms of trade may prove
disruptive, and would exacerbate poverty in our country.
6.     The ERSC will provide essential funds to: sustain the economic recovery; restore key
economic and social services; reduce the domestic financing of the deficit and re-build foreign
exchange reserves; and finance the surge in private sector imports associated with the recent
elimination of restrictions in the foreign exchange market.
7.    Against the background of pervasive poverty in Ethiopia, the overriding objective of our
policy is to achieve sustainable equitable growth and poverty reduction. Central to tile
achievement of this objective is the implementation of a long-term strategy of agricultural-
development-led industrialization (ADLI), aimed at stimulating a rise in incomes in rural areas,
where 83 percent of the Ethiopian population lives, and at inducing industrialization in urban
areas. The ADLI strategy has recently been reviewed and reconfirmed through a wide process of
consultations and forms the basis of the National Development Strategy, and the five year
National Development Program (NDP, 2000/01-2004/05). The NDP has guided the preparation
of our Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy (I-PRSP).

8.    With the end of the war, we now face the challenge of demobilizing the army,
reconstructing damnaged infrastructure and key public services, stimulating private sector
development and regaining investor confidence. We would like to express our appreciation of the
support IDA is providing us to overcome the negative economic and social impact of the war,
under its Interim Support Strategy of December 2000.
9.    Within a context of peace and macroeconomic stability, Government now wishes to
accelerate the economic recovery and the reduction of poverty. To this aim, it wishes to improve
administrative efficiency and the delivery of public services by implementing a public sector
management reform and expenditure strengthening; and to increase the employment opportunities
for the poor by accelerating private sector reforms. The ERSC that we are requesting from IDA
will support the initial round of reforms in these areas and the economic recovery. The reform
program outlined below will help to ensure the success of our program.
The Reform Program
10.   Our medium term strategy for growth and poverty reduction - laid out in the I-PRSP - is
based on four pillars: (i) raising rural incomes through increased agricultural productivity and
improved conditions for the non-farming economy; (ii) removing impediments to private sector
activity, reducing the role of the state in the economy and accelerating export growth; (iii)
reforming the judiciary and the civil service to improve effectiveness and accountability and
strengthening public expenditure policy and management; and (iv) increasing the quality of life
of the poor through the decentralized provision of primary health care, education, water and
sanitation services.
11.   This strategy is supported by a macroeconomic framework which aims at maintaining
macroeconomic stability and promoting the recovery of growth. The 2000/01 - 2002/03 program
is supported by a PRGF arrangement with the IMF. We are also currently seeking assistance
under the Enhanced Initiative for HIPC to reduce the external debt burden to a sustainable level,
and where we hope to reach the decision point in the near future.
12.  Funding provided by the ERSC will support the continuation of a stable macro-economic
framework, and the reallocation of public expenditure from defense to poverty-targeted sectors
(education, health, agriculture, natural resources and roads). Funds expected from the HIPC
initiative (including the interim support) will be allocated to these sectors. Expenditures would be
executed through the re-defined and improved sectoral development programs. The current
budget already includes a significant increase in spending allocated to poverty-targeted sectors
(from 8.6 percent of GDP in 1999/2000 to 12.1 percent in 2000/2001). Even further, we
anticipate an additional reduction of defense spending over the budgeted amount which will allow
additional expenditure to be reallocated to poverty-targeted sectors. Consistent with the PRSP
objectives, the budgets for 2001/2002 and 2002/2003 will reflect further increases to 13.1 percent
of GDP (after HIPC) and 14 percent of GDP (after HIPC) respectively. The Government will
also ensure that executed public expenditure for poverty targeted sectors will be consistent with
budgetary allocations. In preparing the PRSP, the Government has launched a study to analyze
poverty incidence and trends using the new 1999 Household Budget Survey; and it has started a
work program (which will be implemented in the Welfare Monitoring Unit) to analyze the
impact of Government policies and programs on the incomes of the poor. Both studies will be
completed during next fiscal year.

13.   In addition to the macroeconomic program, the ERSC will support policy reforms and
improvements in the following three areas: (i) Public Sector Management; (ii) Public Expendituire
Policy and Management, and (iii) Private Sector Development and Export Competitiveness.
Public Sector Management
14.   Civil Service Reform Program.  In 1996, we launched the Civil Service Reform
Program (CSRP) as part of an overall effort to build a transparent, efficient, and ethical Civil
Service, that would meet our standards for improved governance. We find that the process of
decentralization offers civil servants opportunities to be more responsive to local needs but
demands much more in terms of front-line service delivery performance, client-orientation, nmd
capacity. There is a need to develop arrangements that place a premium on improved sen ice
delivery and client orientation; and to address incentive problems, primarily caused by inadequate
remuneration. The role of the federal Government, particularly in areas of national interest such
as policymaking, standards setting, and monitoring, requires greater clarification as regional
authorities take on the bulk of responsibility for the delivery of essential services. The five ma.jor
Sub-Programs of the CSRP comprise: (i) Expenditure Control and Management; (ii) HunmLan
Resource Management; (iii) Service Delivery and Quality of Service; (iv) Top Management
Systems; and (v) Ethics. While the Program is comprehensive in scope, implementation ]has
lagged in the last two years because of the effects of the war, and lack of implementation
capacity. Strengthening the civil service is now a high priority for the Government as we seek to
carry out the ambitious development strategy articulated in the I-PRSP.
15.  Elements of a renewed implementation strategy for the CSRP over the short- to medium-
run include: (i) establishing the legal framework and ethics infrastructure for a modem civil
service; (ii) improving service delivery performance; (iii) creating an enabling environment for
civil servants by improving pay and remuneration; and (iv) enhancing the transparency of
personnel management systems. Progress has been made in these four areas, which build on the
Human Resources Management (HRM), Service Delivery and Quality of Service, and Ethics
Sub-Programs of the Government's CSRP. Annual Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs),
conducted jointly by the Government, IDA and other donors, have increasingly focused on the
institutional constraints that hinder effective policy and program implementation at the federal
and regional levels. We expect that a successful implementation of the reforms will make a
qualitative change in governance, transparency and accountability within the public sector.
16.   Public Sector Management - Recent Actions: A number of regulatory measures were
recently taken to reform and enhance public sector management in preparation of the ERSC. In
particular the Council of Ministers has adopted the draft Civil Service Law which provides a
broad framework for a modern and efficient civil service, drawing on international good
practices. The Council of Ministers has also adopted the draft National Policy on Service
Delivery to improve the management and client-orientation of institutions involved in the
delivery of public services. We have also launched a diagnostic survey of job classification and
grading (JCG); completed and presented the 1999 labor market survey on wage differentials
between pnrvate-public sector jobs, and developed criteria for integrating findings from JCG and
labor market survey in view of formulating a medium-term pay and employment policy. Finally,
we have completed piloting of a software for records and filing system, as a pre-requisite for the
Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS), and initiated the roll out of the
system across federal line agencies.
17.   Before the end of 2001/2002, we are planning to undertake a number of measures in the
area of Public Sector Management. Subject to approval by the Council of People's



Annex B
Page 5 of 9
Representatives we will implement the Civil Service Law and the National Policy on Service
Delivery. The Council of Ministers will also adopt the Civil Service-wide Code of Conduct in
line with the National Charter of Citizen's Rights and Responsibilities which will provide for the
strengthening of accountability relationships between government institutions and public at large.
The Council of Ministers will also adopt a medium-term pay and employment policy for federal
civil service consistent with the Macro-economic and Fiscal Framework. Furthermore, we will
develop an ethics training curriculum for federal civil servants, and monitor client feedback using
report cards in federal institutions piloting the national Policy on Service Delivery. We will
complete the automation of all personnel data for federal civil servants in the Federal Civil
Service Commission and federal line agencies. Finally, after having established an Inter-
ministerial Technical Committee to develop an Information and Technology (IT) policy for
systems integration by July 2001, a draft IT policy will be adopted by the Council of Ministers.
18.   Further actions are planned during the 2002/2003: It is envisaged that we will
implement the medium-term pay and employment policy in federal government and in the largest
region, and undertake the first phase of ethics training at the federal level. We will also complete
drafting of the institutional charters for all federal ministries, department and agencies, and
publicize the results of client report cards for all participating federal institutions. Finally, we will
install the Wide Area Network and roll-out HRMIS across federal institutions.
Public Expenditure Policy and Management
19.   Public Expenditure Policy and Management Reform Strategy. The main objective of
the reform of the public expenditure system is to enhance its accountability and effectiveness.
Our public finance management system is disciplined and spending is in compliance with
budgeted allocations. Budget allocations are honored by the MoF and the regional finance
bureaus, and are adhered to by the spending agencies as hard budget constraints. While there are
bottlenecks in timely reporting of expenditures at the regional level and below, generally the
variations between the budget allocations and actual outcomes are minimal. Nevertheless, there
is scope for improving linkages between planning, policy and budgetary allocations; for
integrating capital and recurrent budgets; and for improving preparation of accounts and then
audits. The overarching framework of the reform strategy is detailed in the Expenditure
Management & Control (EMCP) Sub-Program of the CSRP. The resource management strategy
is also reflected in our I-PRSP and will be supported by the ERSC and follow-on operations.
20.   Public Expenditure Policy and Management - Recent Actions: In preparation for the
ERSC, we have undertaken the following measures: we have established and made operational a
committee consisting of staff from the Ministry of Economic Development and Cooperation
(MEDaC) the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to facilitate, inter alia, Government-donor dialogue on
public expenditure issues. This committee will hold semi-annual meetings with the donors on
public expenditure issues. We have also provided IDA with an action plan to indicate progress
and future plans for improving the accounting system, in particular for reducing the current
backlog of accounts preparation and reporting for audit, and we have agreed with IDA on an
Action Plan to develop an improved Financial Information Management System (FMIS). As
regards social sectors, we have completed reviews of the Sectoral Development Programs (SDPs)
in Education and Health, and a Task Force has submitted a report on implementation bottlenecks
of the SDPs (procurement, financing management, monitoring and reporting).
21.   Before the end of 2001/2002, we are planning to undertake the following measures: By
October 2001, the Council of Ministers will adopt a Macro-Economic and Fiscal Framework
(MEFF) and a Public Investment Program (PIP), which will lead to the budget for 2001/2002, and



Annex B
Page 6 of 9
2002/2003 and by December 2001 it will submit it to the Council of People's Representatives
We will also prepare any necessary legislation relating to the PEP and present it to the Council of"
People's Representatives for approval. Furthermore, MEDaC, in coordination with the MoF will.
prepare a plan that lays out the resource requirements and a timetable to help the regional states ir,
carrying forward their multi-year planning and budgeting process. We will also adhere to the
financial calendar (as specified in the Budget Design Manual) for the annual planning an/l
budgetary cycle leading to the budget of 2002/2003, and notify Regions of estimated subsidies for
the budget of 2002/2003 in conformity with the financial calendar (January 9 - January 16, 20021
outlined in the Budget Reform Design Manual. We will reduce the backlog of accounts and audits
from over 5 years to 3 years. In addition we will constitute a technical coordination committee
with staff from MEDaC and MoF to better integrate current and capital spending by June 2001,
and prepare an action plan for the implementation of the findings of the FMIS study. Finally, we
plan to complete and adopt an Action Plan to reformulate the sector development Programs
(SDPs) in Health and Education in line with PRSP priorities, and resolve the bottlenecks fcr
improving implementation of SDPs.
22.   The following actions are planned  during 2002/2003: we will review  the
implementation of the MEFF and Public Investment Plan (PIP) for the budget of 2001/2002. On
the basis of this review, they will be rolled over for the 2002/2003 period. We will also review th e
adherence to the Financial Calendar and in particular its impact on improving the quality of
planning and budgeting at the regional and sub-regional level; the implementation of the FMIS to
identify areas in need of further strengthening and prepare an action plan accordingly; and the
SPDs as part of the PRSP review process. We will also begin the implementation of the Public
Expenditure Plan (PEP) at the federal level, and outline a plan of action for implementing the
PEP at the regional level, and take steps to implement it. We will again timely notify Regions of
estimates for subsidies for the budget of 2003/2004. As regards accounts and audits, we will
continue implementing the reform program, further reduce the backlog of accounts and audits,
and take action according to the audit report after its submission to the Council of Ministers.
Private Sector Development and Export Competitiveness
23.   Private Sector Development: Our economic growth strategy rests on ADLI, and the
industrialization part of it is inter-woven with the development of a strong private sector. The
country has shifted from a socialist to a market economy and many elements for a take-off of the
private sector are already in place. These include macroeconomic stability, market liberalization
and expansion of the education sector. As a results of our reform program, we expect the private
sector to grow significantly in the medium termn. Partly, such growth will result from existing
investment projects in the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors. More importantly, however,
is an expected increase in industrial investment. To stimulate private sector growth, we will
concentrate on measures in three areas: (i) identifying and eliminating regulatory constraints, an-d
improving administrative implementation capacity; (ii) encouraging public-private sector
partnerships and dialogue; and (iii) improving the business environment and investment climate.
The measures supporting the ERSC mainly address the first area; measures envisaged for the
medium term address the second and the third areas.
24.   Export Orientation: The ADLI strategy recognizes the critical role of exports, both in
terms of income growth and foreign exchange generation. Furthermore, ADLI provides for a
progressive integration into the global economy. Therefore, we see export orientation and ADLI
as mutually reinforcing. The importance attached to export growth is reflected in the formulation
of an export strategy in 1998, and the establishment of the Export Promotion Agency in the samne
year.



Annex B
Page 7 of 9
25.  Private Sector Development and Export Competitiveness - We have identified the
following as constraints for private sector development: (i) regulatory constraints, (ii) low share
of exports in GDP and little diversification of exports, (iii) incomplete privatization program, (iv)
no efficient fertilizer market, (v) limited private sector participation in infrastructure, (vi) entry
barriers for foreign direct investment (FDI). Regulatory constraints impose high transaction costs
on business operations and discourage investment. Export diversification has been disappointing,
although a number of policy improvements have been made in several key areas in recent years:
elimination of ex-ante price verification for all exports, except coffee, simplification of
procedures for non-equity collaboration with foreign firms; introduction of a duty draw-back
system; and an Export Guarantee Scheme. A temporary 10 percent surcharge on imports was
dropped in the current fiscal year, thus reducing average tariff rates to 19.5 percent. Ethiopia is in
the midst of the second phase of an ambitious privatization program that began in March 1995.
Since 1995, 166 state owned enterprises (SOEs) were sold, mostly retail outlets, restaurants and
small scale firms. The privatization process is well organized, and conducted in an open and
competitive framework. The current privatization phase involves enterprises that are larger and in
key industrial sectors (e.g. leather industry, textiles, construction, mining, agricultural industry).
The Ethiopian Privatization Agency (EPA) is planning to bring to the point of sale 111 SOEs, by
2002/2003, thus completing the program of privatization in the agriculture and industrial sectors.
26.    A number of other issues are important to private sector development. In agriculture, an
efficient fertilizer market, which is a crucial condition for increasing yields, has so far failed to
materialize. Private participation in infrastructure (PPI) continues to face significant obstacles.
Much remains to be done to increase competition in service provision. So far, private
participation has been piecemeal (a few years ago, a decision was taken to allow private
participation in power and telecommunications). Various entry barriers (cumbersome
administrative processes, regulations conditioning FDI) still represent an important obstacle to
attracting foreign investment. Furthermore, institutional weaknesses are hindering the
development of an efficient land market and the use of land as collateral.
27.    Private Sector Development and Export Competitiveness - Recent Actions: The
Council of Ministers has adopted a new Voucher-based Duty Exemption Scheme, recommended
by the Board of Export Promotion Agency. The scheme is open to all exporters with a genuine
export order and to exporters using Franco-Valuta imports. The National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE)
has issued an amended directive on the Export Credit Guarantee Scheme allowing participating
banks to charge market interest rates, limiting the maximum collateral requested to new entrants
and simplifying eligibility criteria. NBE's price monitoring coverage has been restricted to only
products where international prices are available from recognized international sources; and the
export price information responsibility has been shifted to the Export Promotion Agency. We
have also waived the requirement for the presentation of the Standards Authority's quality
certificate as a condition for export clearance where the buyer confirms his/her acceptance of a
different specification or intemationally accepted standard, and his/her acceptance of certification
of compliance by a party other than the Authority. As far as analytical work is concerned, we
have signed a contract with consultants to initiate a study agreed with IDA to identify regulations
which hinder private sector development; we expect the study to be completed by March 2002.
Furthermore, we have signed the contract with the selected consulting firm to conduct a study
agreed with IDA on fertilizer marketing and credit. As regards fertilizer, pending the results of
the study, we have recommended to all regional governments to procure fertilizer for distribution
under the extension programs only on the basis of competitive bidding procedures, as it is already
the practice in some regions. We have also continued our privatization program by completing
the preparation for privatization of 21 enterprises (i.e. we have compiled all documentation



Annex B
Page 8 of 9
necessary to send out the invitation to tender), and selected the winning bidders for the
preparation of 13 enterprises. Finally, the Export Promotion Council, normally chaired by the
Prime Minister, has resumed its regular meetings to provide a forum of discussion to improve the
environment for exports.
28.    Before the end of 2001/2002, we are planning to undertake a number of important policy
measures. Regulatory reforms will include making the changed Export Credit Guarantee directive
operational early in the financial year. We will also prepare standard coefficients for imported
inputs needed for most common exports in order to facilitate the application of the voucher
scheme. The Suppliers Credit directive will be extended to cover suppliers credit for inputs for
the purpose of exports on a cash basis; the NBE will allow for automatic registration, and drop
the debt/equity ratio requirement for suppliers credit in relation to exports. Furthermore, the
Urban Land Lease Proclamation (80/1993) will be reviewed to ensure that banks taking leases as
collateral are able to realize the full value of that collateral at any time. As far as foreigr
investment is concerned, we will eliminate case by case screening of foreign investment not
specified in the Negative Lists (four lists under the Investment Code which specify the areas of
activity where private investment is restricted), and eliminate the minimum investment:
requirement for 100 percent export investments. We will allow private sector participation in the
Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation. We will continue the privatization program b)
bringing to the point of sale at least 40 additional enterprises (of which ten enterprises before
September 2001) and complete preparation for privatization of at least 20 enterprises. We will
prepare a study to examine the relevant regulatory framework in key public utilities (gas,
electricity, water), and one on the process of approving and clearing of export shipment. We will
also begin to implement the action plan derived from the private sector study, and prepare an
action plan based on the recommendation of the fertilizer study; these findings will also be shared
with IDA. As regards land availability, we will recommend to each region to establish and
maintain a Register of Land available for investors (to include all charges and rights over each
parcel of land fully investigated), and to enter into negotiated arrangements with private investors
to develop industrial parks. Finally, pending the result of the fertilizer study we will limit
government's direct supply of inputs to the Extension Intervention Program farmers to no more
than two years (three years in woredas where alternative channels are not available). We will
also replace the export ban on raw hides and skins with an export duty.
29.    Further actions are planned under the ERSC during 2002/2003: We will assess tho
performance of the Voucher Based Duty Exemption Scheme, the performance of the Export
Credit Guarantee Scheme, and of the Suppliers Credit. We will further review the minimun-
investment requirement for foreign investors. EPA will complete the privatization program of Il l 
state owned enterprises which begun in 2000/2001. We will also begin implementation of thc
recommendations from the study on export shipment; the study on the regulatory framework of
the utilities, and the action plan based on the fertilizer study.
30.    Actions taken in the preparation of the ERSC and planned for the future represent a
significant progress in an ongoing process of regulatory improvement, and of a reduction in the
role of the State in the economy, and in ensuring an acceleration of exports. A policy framework
for addressing the remaining issues, including constraints for FDI, urban land lease market and
private participation in infrastructure, will be fully developed in the context of the PRSP.

Conclusions
31.   I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our commitment to the implementation of
the poverty reduction strategy spelled out in the I-PRSP and the actions to be undertaken in the
short and medium term under the reform program outlined above, focusing on measures which
improve public sector management, strengthen public expenditure policy and management, and
stimulate private sector development and export competitiveness.
32.   Within a context of peace and macroeconomic stability, the Credt will help to bring
about a sustained economic recovery and accelerate the reduction of poverty. Public sector
management and expenditure strengthening will increase administrative efficiency, and improve
the delivery of public services. Private sector reforms will spur growth and create employment
opportunities for the poor, particularly in agriculture and in the export sectors. We hope that IDA
will continue to support our program of poverty reduction with follow up operations based on the
PRSP.
33.   On behalf of the Government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, I wish to
thank the IDA for the assistance already provided under the "Interim Support Strategy". I trust
that this request for additional assistance through the proposed ERSC will receive your favorable
consideration.
Yours sinqe4ely,
.... . -/ -   ----

Annex I
Portfolio Improvement and Project Implementation
1.    The portfolio for Ethiopia consists of 15 projects, two of which, totaling US$467.90 million were
approved in 2000/01. This year's lending alone is 45 percent of the $1 billion undisbursed balance. The
relatively young portfolio ($669 million approved in 1997/98) has recently undergone an extensive perlormance
review in October 2000. IDA's recent reengagement in substantial investment lending for reconstruction and
rehabilitation will necessitate more rigorous monitoring of the portfolio. Even though the war has slowed
implementation, particularly disbursements over the last two and half years, only two projects are currently rated
unsatisfactory.
2.    Portfolio Review: The Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) carried out in Addis Ababa
earlier this fiscal year discussed the weaknesses in portfolio implementation and made helpful recomme:ndations
on portfolio improvement measures. The IDA disbursement ratio fell from 15 percent in 1998/99 (US$148
million disbursed) to only 11 percent in 1999/2000 (US$105 million disbursed). However disbursements are
picking up and the ratio is almost 20 percent for 2000/01 as of April 1, 2001. In addition, the audit compliance
ratio fell from 24 percent in 1998/99 to 11 percent in 1999/2000. In some cases, the CPPR identified insufficient
progress on policy and institutional objectives. While low disbursements in 1999/2000 were due to th-te impact
of the war and to slow international contractor mobilization on several large infrastructure projects, a more
fundamental lack of public sector capacity are at the root of the poor performance - as shown by instances of
disappointing project management, and weaknesses in procurement and financial management.
3.    Portfolio Improvement Program: Following the CPPR, a Portfolio Improvement Program was
prepared and agreed with the MEDaC. Actions include the closing of a poorly-performing credit, preparation of
a Country Financial Accountability Assessment, tighter supervision of infrastructure contracts, and the
streamlining of planning and procurement under the Education and Health SDPs. Implementation of the
program will be monitored by a joint IDA/Government team. Early signs are encouraging, with disbuirsements
for 2000/01 up significantly from 11 percent in 1999/2000 to 20 percent in 2000/01. A Country Procurement
Assessment Report is also under preparation. Currently, 90 percent of the required audit reports are up to date.
4.    Of the 14 projects in the portfolio only two (14 percent) are rated problem projects, the Educ.ation and
Health Sector Development Programs. A task force was set up to discuss implementation impediments. The
task force has completed the review of SDPs in Education and Health. They are going to be reformulated during
next fiscal year in line with PRSP priorities. A report was also submitted by the task force to the MolF with
recommendations on how to improve implementation bottlenecks at a regional level. In addition, a number of
regions had their own implementation workshops over the past months, and have invited the participation of
Bank experts as resource persons.
5.    Portfolio Reallocations: In preparing the emergency operations for reconstruction and demobilization,
reallocations from the portfolio were made to support new activities. The Government had requested a total
reallocation of US$30 million consisting of US$17.5 million from the Social Rehabilitation Development Fund,
US$9.8 million from Energy II, and US$2.5 million from the Multi-Sectoral HlV/AIDS program.
6.    Over the next several months, IDA will work closely with the Government to strengthen its National
Capacity Building Program and to help facilitate the smooth flow of funds to regional or decentralized
implementing units. Improvements in the planning and approval processes at local levels combined with
increased harmonization of procurement and financial procedures will be critical for enabling the regions to
more efficiently implement projects.
