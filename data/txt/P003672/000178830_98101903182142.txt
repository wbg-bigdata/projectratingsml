INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE TAIWAN POWER COMPANY
1.        I submit the following report and reccmmendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $55.0 million to
the Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) to be guaranteed by the Republic of
China.  The proposed loan would be for a 20-year term, including 9i years
of grace, and bear interest at 71% per annum0 The Government of the
Republic of China and Taipower have asked the Bank for the loan to finance
the foreign exchange cost, including interest during construction, of a
project which fornspart of the company's 1971-76 expansion program. The
proposed loan will be the Bankts third for power in China. The projects
for which the two previous loans were made in 1969 and 1970 respectively,
are described in Part III below.
PART I - HISTORICAL
2.        China has received twelve Bank loans and four IDA credits for
a total amount of $274.7 million; as of March 31, .1971, disbursements
amounted to $116,6 million and cancellations to $18.4 million. The
bulk of the Bank Group's assistance was for power ($9Ms5 million),
railways ($68.7 million) and industry, channeled through the China
Development Corporation - a privately-owned development finance company
($53.0 million). Other loans were made for fishing vessels, irrigation,
water supply, education and harbor dredging. Disbursements of loans and
credits rose from $103 million in FY 1969 to $26.9 million in FY 1970,
reflecting the increasing pace of project execution. Three projects
encountered disbursement delays; the closing dates of two railway loans
had to be postponed on account of delays attributable to the complexity
of the Government's procurement procedures. A supervision mission
discussed and agreed upon measures to improve the situation in August
1970 and procurement has speeded up significantly since then. Procure-
ment problems also affected a telecommunications project. A summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of March 31, 1971 is
attached as Attachment I.
3.        China became a member of IFC in 1969 and the latter committed,
in 1970, a total of $7.2 million equivalent for two projects, an expansion
program of the Asia Cement Corporation, and the Oriental Chemical Fiber
Corporation, a newly established company for the production of polyester
fiber. IFC's investment in Asia Cement consists of a $3 million loan
and a $1.2 million equity participation; the commitment to Oriental
consists of a $3 million loan. Prospects for further IFC investments
in China are good.  IFC has several projects under preliminary considera-
tion; these include schemes to produce nylon tire cord and polyester



filament, an investment in the privately-owned Taipei Gas Corporation,
a shipyard in Kaohsiung, and in the petro-chemical industry.
PART II - ECONOMIC ASPECTS
Ba ckgrorind
4.        An economic report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects
of the Republic of China" (EAP-17a, dated September 11, 1970) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on September 17, 1970. An
economic mission visited Taiwan last month; its report is expected to
be circulated in July this year. Updated economic data are contained
in Attachment II.
5.        Taiwan has made remarkable economic progress during the last
few years. GNP grew at an annual average rate of about 10% in the
sixties and per capita GNP more than doubled from $160 in 1960 to $370
in 1970. A progressively diversified industrial sector is now the most
important segment of an economy which was predominantly agricultural
twenty years ago.  Even so, agricultural output grew at about 4 - 5%
per annum from mid-fifties onwards; despite serious setbacks from factors
like declining sugar prices and typhoons sufficient rice is produced to
feed a population which rose from 8 million in 1950 to 14 million in 1969.
However, the rate of population growth fell,in response to an active
family planning program, from 3.3% in 1960 to 2e3% in 1969.
Industrial Development
6.        The poor resource endowment of Taiwan and the small domestic
market have led to a development strategy centering on expanding exports
by exploiting the advantage of a low-cost, skilled and adaptable labor
force. The availability of experienced managers and imaginative entre-
preneurs has been a vital ingredient in the marked success of this
policy. Manufacturing output grew at an average rate of over 18% per
annum during the 1960-70 period and its net value added to. the domestic
product was 23.5% in 1970 while agriculture's contribution was 19.2%.
The export of manufactured goods increased by about 40% a year during
1965-70; their share of total exports increased from 45% in 1965 to
nearly 80% in 1970.
7.        Food processing, textiles, and non-durable consumer goods
were the mainstays of the industrial sector in the early sixties. More
recently, growth has been concentrated in industries producing chemicals,
electrical machinery and appliances, and electronic equipment. The
encouragement of basic and intermediate goods industries is given
priority by the Government.



-3-
Investment and Savings
8.        A basic factor in Taiwan's economic progress has been the
rapid growth of savings as well as investment. The investment rate
increased as a proportion of GNP from 20.1% in 1960 to 26.3% in 1970;
the savings rate has doubled since 1960 and had reached about 25% of
GNP in 1970. It has almost kept pace with gross domestic capital
formation which increased by more than 20% annually over the last five
years and is now about 26% of GNP. The resource gap is fairly small and
China has been able to sustain an unusually rapid development largely
from its own resources.
9.        Public expenditures in some critical areas such as transport,
urban infrastructure and education have nevertheless been inadequate.
Under-investment in infrastructure has begun to be a constraint on the
continued development of the industrial sector. Inland transportstion
facilities, especially highways, have not kept pace with demand. Severe
port congestion occurred, although this has now been temporarily alleviatied
by the substantial enlargement of existing ports. The supply of trained
manpower for industry will fall below demand during the first half of the
seventies. The country's electric power system has found it difficult,
despite substantial capital expenditures during the last six years, to
meet demand and operates with virtually no reserve capacity.
10.       The lag in public investment during the sixties was due partly
to the fact that high growth rates were not foreseen; for instance,
the target growth rate during the 1969-72 Fifth Development Plan period
was 7% per annum, while the actual figure attained so far has been in
the order of 10% per annum. The rather slow increase in Government
revenues was also partly responsible. Planned investment levels for
infrastructure are now being revised on the premise of an 8.5% per
annum GNP growth rate. During the last two years a Government commission
has reviewed the tax system and proposed a series of reforms. Their
main objective is to increase the proportion of direct taxes to total
tax revenues; revenues from taxes on income and profits have been too
low and the tax system had regressive characteristics. A number of
recommendations made by the commission have been implemented and this
coupled with additional taxation,/total government revenue at current /resulted>
prices rising    by 314% in 1969; the proportion of government revenue   in/
to GDP increased from 19% in 1965 to over 23% in 1969. Government
savings including savings of Government corporations as a percentage of
GDP increased from about 3% in 1965 to 9% in 1969. However, with public
investment running at about two-fifths of total fixed capital investment
in 1969 the gap between government savings and investments continues
to be substantial and has been covered by external borrowing and some
domestic bond issues.
Need for Investment in Infrastructure
11.       Investment requirements in the next five years will be largeticular9y
in utilities, transportation and education. Gross fixed capital investment



- 4 -
for the current Plan period will be about $5,3 billion equivalent, or
about 25% above the original Plan. During 1969-76 gross capital forma-
tion is expected to grow at 10.7% per annum reaching a level of almost
30% of GDP in 1976. During 1969-72 public fixed investment may be as
high as $2 billion equivalent, or 50% higher than the original Plan
estimate. At this level, it would continue to account for two-fifths
total fixed investment.
12.       A greater inflow of foreign capital during the next few years
will be crucial for ensuring an adequate level of investments in the public
sector.  The revenue effects of tax reform ryiy tend to tc.per eff and the
gap between public savings and investment may widen temporarily until
further proposals for the tax reform are implementedO A substantial
increase in the level of public bond issues may be limited by the scope
of the capital market. Public borrowing from the private sector by bond
issues may become more important in the future if the bond market c3n be
developed. The Central Bank is now studying this question and expects
to come up with recommendations before the end of June.
13.       In these circumstances, the Bank's objective is to direct
its assistance towards helping the Government's plan to develop infra-
structure facilities and to confine its support of the directly productive
sectors of the economy to financial assistance for the China Development
Corporation, The bulk of the Bankts support would be directed towards
agriculture, highways, sewerage and water supply projects.
14.       Although in recent years the Government raised the question
from time to time, there did not appear to be a good case for the Bank's
financing local expenditures, since the Bank was able to provide China
with substantial amounts of capital by disbursing against foreign
expenditure on high priority projects as in the case of the proposed
project. Now as the need for financing agriculture, education, highways
and such urban projects as sewerage and water supply is becoming
increasingly pressing, the Bank would be lending for projects with
relatively low foreign expenditure components, and may be justified in
financing some local expenditures in order to make an adequate contribu-
tion to development, Such a shift in emphasis would mean that in future
China would have to rely increasingly on supplier credits and bilateral
loans for electric power, railway and otherprojects of a kind which have
been financed in the past by the Bank.
Future Growth Prospects
15.       A slower growth rate during 1969-76 than achieved during
1960-69 appears likely because manufacturing industry is entering a phase
of more sophisticated and technologically complex production. Further,
there is some uncertainty about the behavior of exports. At present
China sells 50% of its exports to the U.S. and Japan and any serious
change in the level of economic activity in those countries or in their
trading policies could have a major impact on China's econnmic growth,



If protectionist tendencies gather momentum, China's exports of
manufactured goods, and textiles in particular, may be adversely
affected by import quotas and higher tariffs.
16.       Even so, the long-term export prospects are good.   The
quality, skill and size of China's labor force, and its substantial
managerial and commercial experience give the country a competitive
edge over its neighbors. As wages in Japan are relatively high and
likely to rise fast, a growing number of labor intensive products will
have to be imported from countries with a more abundant labor supply.
Because of its proximity and the relatively advanced stage of its
economy China would be among the first to benefit from such a develop-
ment.
External Debt and Debt Service Capacity
17.       China's external debt outstanding at December 31, 1970, was
$776 million. There has been a reduction, in recent years, in the
relative importance of net external capital inflows; there have also
been significant changes in the type and sources of assistance which
China has received. The level of net transfers is declining and
becoming insignificant but the amount of direct investment has risen
rapidly (from $8 million in 1966 to over $50 million in 1969) and the
net inflow of long-term loan capital increased from $20 million in
1964 to $113 million in 1969. In the early part of the decade, nearly
all this loan capital was made available by the U.S. Goverment. Recently,
however, the Japanese Government and the Bank have become important
sources of loan c&pital together with the rapid growth in credits
extended by private suppliers. In 1969, official Japanese and U.S..
sources each accounted for about 14% of the gross inflow; the Bank
accounted for 20% and private suppliers provided the remainder. The
total debt outstanding in 1976 is projected at $1,h70 million. Debt
service payments are estimated to rise from about $60 million in 1969
to $250 million in 1976 and the debt service ratio would go up from
slightly below 5% in 1969 to about 8 - 10% in 1976. Unless there are
major export difficulties, debt service beyond 1976 is not likely to
increase much abcve 10% of export earnings. Chinats creditworthiness
is therefore not in doubt and it is considered suitable to receive
Bank financing.

PART III- THE PROJECT
A. Sector Bac    gund
18.          Taiwan lacks primary energy materials. The major domestic
source of energy is coal. Deposits are located largely in the north of
the island but the quality is poor. The thinness of the beds and obso-
lete methods make mining expensive and production has remained stagnant
over the past few years. Proven reserves of natural gas are estimated
at about 27 billion cubic meters and are used almost exclusively for
industrial fuel and as feedstock for chemicals. Domestic production of
crude oil is negligible.
19.          The derand for commercial energy has risen at about l{t%
per annum during the past five years.  At present, roughly 50% of this
is met by imports - largely of crude oil and petroleum products. This
trend is expected to contjinue over the next few years.
20.          The rapid growth of Industry and per capita inromes coup_ed
with rural electrification has substantially increased the d-mand for
electricity.  Actual power sales have risen at an average of' nearly 15%
per annum since 1963 and are expected to increase by about 12.5% per
annumn during the next few years. Sales to hou-seholds and small commer-
cial consumers have increased more rapidly than those to industrial and
larger conmercial users although the latter accournt for about 77%O Of
total power sales. Senerating capacity has been increased by ovrer 160%
duringo the last six years (from. 1,130 MW in 196L to 2294 mu in 1969)
but has barely kept pace wTith demand. At times, usually in the dry
season, power supply has had to be curtailed. Such shorta;es haave not
seriously affected overall economic growth as yet but production of
aluminium., fertilizer and chemicals and metals has suffered.
21.         The Taiwan Pcwer Company (Taipower) is responsible for
the supply of electric power throuchout the country.  It is a stock
corporation owned almost wholly by the National and Provincial Govern-
ments. Taipower had an installed generating capacity at the end of
1970 of 2,720 14W in nine thermal plants and 27 hydro-electric plants,
with aggregate capacities of 1,819 and gOl 14 (67% and 33% respectively
of total capacity). Thermal capacity is concentrated in the north and
south ends of the island. Most of the hydro-electric power sites on the
island have now been developed. The company's major problem has been -
the provision of adequate generating capacity. It has been a consider-
able system planning achievement to keep generating capacity almost
abreast of the unexpectedly large demand; Taipower's capital expendi-
tures on system expansion have been just about at the lowest level
consistent with not jeopardizing development.
22.          Taipower has formulated and received Government approval
of a six-year (1971-76) expansion program which envisages a 3,500 IMW
increase of capacity. This represents an increment of 130% to the



present installed capacity of 2,720 NW. This program is designed to
meet the rising demand for electricity and provide a certain amount of
reserve capacity for the system. Taipower is studying, in the light
of a recent revised load forecast, whether the 1971-76 expansion pro-
gram should be enlarged further. A project involving the installation
of still more generating capacity is likely to be developed and the Bark
fiancing requested for it during the next year or so.   In this event,
the Bank does not envisage, as Taipower has already been told, finan-
cing the entire foreign exchange costs of such a project.   Instead, the  .
would encourage Taipower to seek financing from other sources and limit
the Bank's involvement to providing funds for items for which suitable
financing terms were not obtainable.
23.          The expansion program includes the construction of two
600 MUk nuclear units scheduled for operation in 197T and 1976, reflect-
ing Taipower's strategy of developing large nuclear and conventional
thermal generation plants     for base load tog-ether with pumped-storage
facilities in peaking.  This strate_y is appropriate for, given that most
of the island's hydroelectric resources have now been developed, there
are no longer larger resources of indigenous fuel available, and the
system is reaching a size large enough to benefit from the economies
of scale attached to large conventional thermal and nuclear generating
units.
24,          The total capital expenditure on the 1971-76 expansion
program is estimated to be about $1,230 million equivalent.   Internal
cash generation sales of equity and consumers' contribution will meet
about $50O million (41lb) of this.  The remaining $730 million needed
will have to be met through borrowings. Arrangements for obtaining moSG
of the funds have already been made. However, some $110 million (about
9% of the 1970-76 expenditures on construction) remain to be secured.
This is not unusual for a company with an expansion program as large as
Taipowerts and given the comparatively small size of the financing gap
does not constitute a major problem; prospects for obtaining the neces-
sary funds are good. The means by wrhich the gap is to be filled 1ill
be discussed with the Bank. The possibility of providing part of the
shortfall by domestic bond issues is being considered; the question
of making an exploratory issue of bonds in Taipower's name is to be
studied and discussed with the Bank by the end of September 1971.
25.          The Bank has already made two loans to assist in the
implementation of Taipower's expansion program. A $50 million loan
(57h-CHA) was made in December 1968 to help finance the construction
of a hydroelectric station with a capacity of 234 NW on the Tachia
River in Central Taiwan and its associated extra high-voltage trans-
mission facilities, the first in Taiwian. A second loan was signed in
May 1970 for $4h.5 million and involved: (1) the installation of 375 NW
thermal unit at Talin in the south of Taiwan; (ii) an additional 180 NJ
of generating capacity at the Lower Tachien Hydroelectric station; and



- 8 -
(iii) the provision of additional EHV transmission facilities.  At the
end of January 1971, about $5.7 million had been disbursed from the
proceeds of loan 574-CHA and $83,000 from the proceeds of loan 671-CI.A.
Progress on both projects is satisfactory.
B. Project Aspects
26, --      The proposed project represents about 7% of Taipowerts
1971-76 expansion program. The main features of the loan are summarized
in Attachment III. The project will consist of: (i) the construction of
the Talin No. 5 thermal generation unit with a capacity of 500 NW, the
major item of the project; (ii) the provision of sub-station facilities
to transmit the powor generated by the Chinsan No. 1 nuclear generating
unit; and (iii) the provision of equipment for system load dispatch.
Talin No. 5 Thermal Generating Unit
27.         The Talin No. 5 unit would be located at the south end of
the island in proximity to the concentration of industrial development
in the city of Kaohsiung. At this site, Talin No. 1 and No. 2 units,
both rated at 300 n1f,are in operation, and Talin No. 3 and No. 4 units,
both rated at 375 IYJ, are scheduled to begin service in March 1973 and
ADril 1974 respectively. No space for additional units wrill remain at
the site after Talin No. 5's installation.
28,          The Talin No. 5 unit represents the most appropriate and
economical means of meeting the increase in load. There is no hydro-
electric site large enough to compete with a large base-load thermal
plant    and another nuclear plant    would take too long to construct.
Gas turbines would be much too expensive for base load. The only al-
ternative therefore would be the construction of two smaller conventional
units, perhaps similar to Talin No. l, both of which would be needed to
cope with the expected demand. One of them would be installed at Talin
and the other at a new site since there is space for only one more unit at
the Talin site. T,o smaller units would probably have a higher overall -
availability factor, but this wiould be more than offset by the lower cap.-
ital cost per KW installed of the 500 MNW unit. Furthermore, opening a
new site would lead to additional costs in infrastructure and transmission
facilities. Thus the 500 VRJ unit at Talin is the least cost means of
meeting the load expected in late 1975. Another factor is the heavy bur-
den that would be imposed on Taipower's management when opening a new site
and constructing two units instead of one.
29%          Chinshan lNo. 1 nuclear unit, which is being financed by the
U.S. Export-Import Bank, is scheduled for operation in December 1975.
It is sited approximately 28 km northeast of Taipei on the northern-
most extremity of the island. The power generated will be transmitted
to the Taipower transmission grid by means of a 117 km-long double-
circuit 345 KV transmission system extending from the site to the primary
The location of the project is shown on the attached map



-9-
sub-stations of Nankang and Panchiao. The Bank-financed construction
comprises the 31h5 KV primary sub-stations of Nankang and Panchiao and
the Chinsha switching station, including 500 MVA of transformer capacity
and ten 345 KV line terminals.
Load Dispatch
30.     Taipower is planning a system control facility which will -
provide for (i) automatic control of frequency; (ii) automatic dis-
tribution of load between the large thermal and hydroelectric units;
(iii) transmission system load flow supervision; (iv) system data
logging and alarms; and (v) other miscellaneous control functicns.
31L          The master control station will be located in the system
dispatch office in Taipei. The provision of this facility will be
tirnoly in ensuring the continued efficient operation of the power sys-
tem, when as the result of increasing size, it would be difficult to
maintain fully efficient operation with manual control.
nount of Proposed Loan
4^         The arnposod loan of $55 million is comprised of
US$447 million ior the estimated foreign cost of the equipment and
services (64/L of the total estimated cost of the project of $73.2
million) and US$8 million for interest on the proposed loan during
the construction period. Altogether, the Bank would be financing
about 1l/O of Taipower's planned construction expenditure for the
1971-76 expansion program.
Procurement and Disbursement
33.          Procurement of goods financed by the loan would be on
the basis of international competitive bidding except for components
required to be compatible with existing equipment, and items of minor
cost for which such bidding would be impractical, the total cost of
which should not exceed US$800,000 equivalent. Disbursements would
be made for the full foreign exchange cost of the equipment imported
and services provided. No disbursements would be made for expendi-
ture made before the signing of the proposed loan.
3h4          Two bids for the largest element in the proposed project
the Talin V turbo-generator - have been received and were opened on
April 2, 1971. This was probably the first time that a unit of a size
as large as 500 MW has been procured after international bidding. The
bidding procedure conformed with the Bank's guidelines for procurement.
The contract is expected to be awarded in late May following evaluation
of the bids.
E,ological Aspects
35'.         The only significant ecological problem is air pollution
frnui chimney discharges. However, at full output from the Talin plant th§Ls



- 10 -
will not exceed standards found acceptable in other countries. Fur-
thermore, the prevailing winds will carry pollution away from Kaohsiung
city. A moritoring program will be carried out by Taipower.
PART IV - LEG-AL INSTRTMEINTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Taiwan
Power Company, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of
China and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan documer.ts follow the
general pattern of other agreements used for power projects.
37.       The Borrower has obtained certain funds from the Gover..ment
through the Bank of Communications on terms which include certain
provisions relating to security. The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements
provide that such security would not be effected without the agreement
of the Bank, but that if the Bank agrees to the security being made
effective, the Bank's loan would share pari passu in the security.
Similar provisions were in the two previous loan agreements. It might
also be noted that the two previous loan agreements are modified in the
loan agreement to include cross default provisions in the three loan
agreements.
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
