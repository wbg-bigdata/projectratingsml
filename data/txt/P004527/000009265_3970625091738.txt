MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A PROVINCIAL PORTS PROJECT
*1.
1.        The following report on a proposed loan to the.Republic of the
Philippines for US$32.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan, which would be onlent to the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA)
would help finance a provincial ports project; it would be for twenty years
including a five-year grace period, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.        Background.  The proposed project was identified during preparation
of the Philippines Third Ports Project (Loan 1855-PH). A component of that
project was a feasibility study, carried out by consultants for PPA, for 16
secondary ports in Southern Luzon and adjacent islands, and the Visayas and
Mindanao. These ports were selected for study from a long list of ports
recommended by the National transportation Planning Project (1982). The
feasibility study determined that several of them would require some expansion
of facilities to meet the projected volumes of traffic while others could be
rehabilitated at relatively low cost to serve projected traffic. The ports of
Calapan, San Jose, Tagbilaran, Nasipit, Surigao and Pulupandan were selected
for expansion and the ports of Bauan, Cagayan de Oro, Sta. Cruz, Legaspi,
Tabaco, and Pulauan were selected for rehabilitation. Under the Third Ports
Project, detailed engineering of the selected ports was undertaken and final
designs and tender ;ocuments prepared. In addition, the project includes ten
ports to be selected shortly for minor rehabilitation/maintenance; this will
enable the project to respond in a flexible way to additional rehabilitation(
maintenance needs.
3.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to strengthen
the institutional setup for the management of ports in the Philippines and
help expand and improve port capacity by (a) expansion of facilities at six
ports and rehabilitation/maintenance works at six others, with further
provision for rehabilitation at ten additional ports to be identified; and
(b) technical assistance in project implementation, financial management,
training and studies needed for further development of the port system in the
country.
4.        Project Description and Cost.  The proposed project would:
(a) expand facilities at six ports, Calapan, San Jose, Tagbilaran, Nasipit,
Surigao and Pulupandan; (b) rehabilitate/maintain existing facilities at the
ports of Bauan, Cagayan de Oro, Sta. Cruz, Legaspi, Tabaco and Pulauan, and
ten additional ports to be prepared and selected according to criteria re-
viewed and approved by the Bank; (c) procure equipment for communications,
water supply and sewerage, management information system (MIS) and fire-
fighting; (d) provide technical assistance to PPA for construction
supervision, MIS, feasibility studies for future port projects, special



- 2 -
studies, and training; and (e) provide training of personnel in port planning,
design, management and operations. Three to six week workshops/seminars will
be conducted by expatriate consultants to train staff in port engineering,
intermodal transport and port operations and management. The project wilL be
carried out over five year.
5.        The total cost of the project is estimated at P 933 million (US$46.6
million equivalent) with a direct and indi-ect foreign exchange component of
P 530 million (US$26.5 million). A breakdown of costo and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disburse-
ments, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of
key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the
Philippines are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also
attached . The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6566-PH dated Hay 1, 1987, is
being distributed separately.
6.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  One of the Bank's principal objec-
tives in transport sector lending in the Philippines has been, and continues
to be, to improve the infrastructure of the country. The Bank has also
assisted in strengthening the institutions dealing with the sector, especially
in establishing an appropriate framework for planning and policy develop-
ment. Continued assistance in attaining these objectives is needed in the
context of the country's constrained economic conditions. The Bank has had a
Long association with the Philippine ports subsector and was instrumental in
the creation of PPA. It is important that the Bank maintains this close
collaboration with PPA now that it has completed work in the major ports and
is moving to improve secondary and tertiary ports in the provinces. This is
in line with the new Government's and the Bank's focus on aLleviating the
conditions in some of the more deprived areas of the country. Because of the
importance of shipping to an archipelago country like the Philippines, it is
also important that the Bank assist the Government in addressing issues
affecting the maritime sector as a whole. The proposed project would provide
a vehicle to reduce barriers to domestic trade in the form of unnecessary
customs procedures and to improve safety of ships in interisland traffic.
7.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, PPA and the Government agreed
with the Bank on the following actions: (a) furnish the Bank by February 1
ench year with a draft of PPA's annual expenditure plan for comment, and
furnish by August 1 each year the final plan to the Bank; (b) establish
procedures to separate passenger and cargo traffic flows in ports by
June 30, 1988; (c) develop a plan to define PPA's role in port operations
(which now varies from port to port) and review current revenue collecting
procedures by December 31, 1987; (d) prepare an inventory of additional
rehabilitation/maintenance needs by December 31, 1987, submit an action plan
for such work to the Bank by June 30, 1988, and report on the implementation
of the said action plan by March 31, 1989, and each March 31, thereafter; (e)
maintain a project executive comfittee to oversee implementation of the
project; (f) use the established selection criteria for ten additional ports
to be chosen for minor rehabilitation; (g) continue to revalue PPA's fixed
assets at their estimated replacement cost every five years starting
December 31, 1991; (h) maintain PPA's operating expenses below 65% of PPA's
operating revenues for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1987;



- 3 -
(i) finance at least 30% of PPA's capital investments from PPA's internally
generated funds for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1987; (j)
deveLop a pLan of action by June 30, 1988, to improve safety of operations in
domestic shipping; and (k) develop a plan of action satisfactory to the Bank,
by June 30, 1988, to facilitate domestic shipping and cargo clearances. Prior
to loan effectiveness, the Government and PPA would sign a subsidiary loan
agreement on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
8.        Justification.  The principal benefits of the port investments are
increased port capacity, which would result in avoided lighterage operations,
avoided inland highway diversion and avoided congestion in ports, thus reduc-
ing ship waiting time.  The principal beneficiaries will be the people living
in the economically deprived hinterlands of the project ports. The gradual
introduction of Roll on-Roll off (ro-ro) services, made possible by the pro-
posed project, will enable increased transport of perishable farm products to
existing and new markets. Improved port facilities should also make the
hinterlands more attractive tocations for industry, stimulating employment.
However, these and other development benefits are difficult to estimate and
have not been taken into account in the economic evaluation. Even so, the
quantifiable benefits yield economic returns ranging from 17Z to 86% for the
project ports and an average return of 27% for the entire project.
9.        Risks.  The project poses no particular risk other than unrealized
traffic expectations. It is hoped, however, that the long delayed economic
recovery of the Philippines will soon accelerate. When this happens, the
project will help the selected ports to cater to the accompanying development
requirements for increased port capacity.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
