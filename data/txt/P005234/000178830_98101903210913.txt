APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN IRAQ
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i         The education system of Iraq is based on the traditional pattern
of six years of primary education, six years of secondary education, divided
into three years of intermediate education and three years of preparatory
education, followed by university and other post-secondary courses varying
in length from two to six years.
ii.       Considerable educational development in the past decade has led to
the attainment of moderately high enrollment ratios. The system is still in-
efficient and costly; education planning and management needs improvement.
The government is taking steps to remedy these defects.
iii.      Secondary education is largely oriented toward literary and science
courses which account for 84% of the total enrollment while prevocational
courses are limited. Rigid boundaries between these disciplines restrict
individual choices. The government proposes to develop on an experimental
basis comprehensive secondary schools which would increase prevocational
options and allow for a more flexible choice of courses.
iv.       Science teaching at secondary level suffers from a lack of science
laboratories; workshops in intermediate schools are inadequate for effective
handicraft education. The inadequate application of modern educational tech-
nology to school and adult education programs is responsible for further
deficiencies in the educational system. Government efforts to improve teach-
ing facilities and techniques require support in the form of science labora-
tories, workshops and educational television equipment.
V.        Facilities for training industrial and agricultural technicians
are inadequate to meet manpower requirements. The government has decided
to expand existing and to open new industrial and agricultural institutes.
A serious gap in the vocational training system results from the virtual
absence of facilities for practical training of industrial and agricultural
workers. To remedy this, Work Training Centers will be established and farmer
training wings will be added to existing agricultural secondary schools.
vi.       The proposed Bank project would assist the government in meeting
the needs outlined above by providing the following:
(a)  four comprehensive secondary schools;
(b)  one new institute of technology and equipment for an existing
institute:
(c)  five work training centers;
(d)  two agricultural institutes;
(e)  twelve science laboratory units to be added to existing
secondary schools;



- ii -
(f) twenty workshop units to be added to existing intermediate
schools;
(g) ten farmer training wings to be added to existing agricul-
tural secondary schools;
(h) educational television equipment and supplies;
(i) technical assistance and fellowships.
vii.      The newly reorganized College of Education would train teachers
of academic subjects to staff the proposed schools. Technical assistance
would be required to provide specialists for the Basrah Institute of Tech-
nology. Using existing facilities, the government would need to organize
local training programs for vocational instructors for some of the project
schools.
viii.     An Inter-Ministerial Project Coordinating Committee and a project
unit within the Ministry of Education have already been established by a
resolution of the Planning Board. The unit would coordinate relations with
the government and with private agencies and would provide liaison with the
Bank.
ix.       The total project cost is estimated at US$19.9 million and the
foreign exchange component at US$12.9 million. Procurement would be in
conformity with the Bank rules regarding international competitive bidding.
The government would recruit architectural consultants' services for the
project.
x.        The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$12.9 million to the
Republic of Iraq, equal to the estimated foreign exchange component of the
project.



IRAQ
APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A UNESCO Identification Mission visited the Republic of Iraq in
March/April 1970 to identify priority projects for Bank financing. This
was followed by two shorter visits in October 1970 and April 1971, to com-
plete project identification.  In June 1971, a ULESCO Project Preparation
Mission assisted the Government in preparing an education project for sub-
mission to the Bank. The proposed project was appraised in October/November
1971 by a mission composed of Messrs. T. Terrefe (mission leader, general
educator), E. Ferzad (architect), S. Futagami (specialist in educational
media), G. F. F. Gayle (agricultural educator), J. C. Jones (technical edu-
cator) and B. Thoolen (Economist).
1.02      During appraisal, the proposed project was slightly modified with
Government's agreement. A proposed Technical Education Support Center which
was largely directed to the printing of texts for a relatively small number
of vocational students, was excluded from the project in view of Ministry of
Education's planned extension of its central printing facilities. Construc-
tion of workshops for the Baghdad Institute of Technology was already under-
way with government financing and thus was excluded from the project. Pro-
vision of equipment for this institute is, however, retained. The capacity
of the proposed Institute of Technology in Basrah was increased from 520 to
840 to utilize fully the facilities provided. The number of work training
centers was increased from four to five and the capacity of each was reduced
from 550 to 300 to improve their regional distribution and to make them more
easily manageable and more realistic in their projected enrollments. Since
organized courses for farmers are new to the country, it was considered ad-
visable at this stage to establish farmer training facilities in only 10 of
the 13 agricultural secondary schools requested.
II. SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
General
2.01      The total area of Iraq is 435,000 sq. kms., 65% of which is desert,
mountains and wasteland. Agriculture is concentrated in the northeast and
in the central and southern regions. The total population of Iraq is 9.7
million, consisting mostly of Arabs, includes a sizable Kurdish community in
the northern regions. The population is increasing at 3.2% per annum, a high
rate which is expected to increase to 3.5% p.a. in the second half of the
seventies. 48% of the population is under 15 years of age; 57% lives in
urban centers of which more than one-third is in the Baghdad area.



- 2-
Economic Development Strategy
2.02      The financing of the National Development Plans relies on oil which
provides 50% of government revenues. The Government policy is to lessen this
dependence by reorienting its development policy more toward agriculture and
manufacturing.
2.03      Agriculture is the only source of income for more than half of the
population. Its low productivity is partly due to hasty implementation of
agrarian reform without adequate management capabilities and partly to in-
sufficient application of new technology. Only 25% of the arable land is
actually under cultivation. The remainder is either temporarily kept fallow
or not used at all. The Government policy is to improve the control of the
water resources by expanding the irrigated areas and providing better drain-
age, and thus to bring more land under cultivation. Together with the in-
troduction of better agricultural methods and practices, through farmer
training and the promotion of cooperatives, it is expected that such im-
provement will increase rural employment and improve living conditions on
the land so as to slow down migration to urban areas.
2.04      In manufacturing, the government wants to change the emphasis from
traditional handicrafts to modern industry. Despite large government invest-
ments in infrastructure and industry, the industrialization policy has had
limited success. Shortages of skilled workers and managerial talent have
slowed down the implementation of plans and led to low utilization of capac-
ity. The Development Plan emphasizes improved utilization of existing idle
capacity and the establishment of new industries in the field of foodstuffs,
petroleum, petrochemicals and cement. Other sectors which receive special
attention are transport (roads, river navigation), power and construction.
To achieve these objectives, the government plans to expand technician train-
ing and to develop a network of work training centers for the training of
skilled and semi-skilled workers.
Manpower Requirements
2.05      The total labor force is estimated at 2.7 million and is expected to
grow at 3.8% p.a. to 3.9 million by 1980 (Appendix I). A small but increas-
ing proportion is women, many of whom are employed in teaching and in govern-
ment offices. Employment is expected to increase at a slightly lower rate:
Annual
Employment           1970 _              Growth        1980    %
Total             2,580,000   (100)       3.6%      3,650,000 (100)
Agriculture       1,450,000   ( 56)       2.3%      1,325,000  (50)
Industry            250,000   ( 10)       6.7%        475,000  (13)
Services            830,000   ( 34)       4.5%      1,350,000  (37)

Industrial employment is growing rapidly but since this sector is still very
small, the development of the agricultural sector is essential to avoid large-
scale unemployment. In addition to the official estimate of unemployment of
5%, there is a large amount of disguised unemployment.
Industrial Manpower
2.06      There is a critical shortage of skilled workers and technicians
which is likely to persist in the foreseeable future. The lack of skilled
workers is one of the factors limiting the development of modern manufactur-
ing. Only a few of the larger enterprises, like the Iraqi Petroleum Company
and the Iraqi Railways Service, have established their own vocational train-
ing facilities. A new Labor Law requires all large enterprises to organize
in-plant vocational training while the government will establish centers for
those employed in smaller establishments and for the unemployed.
2.07      The shortage of technicians is increasing and many vacancies which
require only technician training are being filled by engineers who are now in
ample supply. This is both costly and unsatisfactory since the engineer has
had less training in those practical skills required by the technician for
the supervision of (insufficiently trained) workers at craft level. The gov-
ernment plans an immediate increase in technician training while temporarily
slowing down the development of engineer training.
2.08      Average annual industrial manpower requirements for 1970-1980 com-
pare as follows with the existing training capacity (Bank staff estimate):
Required      Training      Shortage/      Planned Expansion
Numbers       Capacity       Surplus           (After 1975)
Total               7,800          2,850       - 4,950               2,600
Engineers             800            900       +   100                ---
Technicians         1,900            450       - 1,450                 700
Skilled Workers   5,100            1,500       - 3,600               1,900
The surplus of engineers is likely to be confined to the early '70's.  To
meet part of the shortage of skilled workers and technicians after 1975, the
government is now preparing plans to expand training to about 50-60% of the
estimated requirements. The remaining shortage would be covered by on-the-
job training.
Agricultural Manpower
2.09      The agricultural development strategy, outlined in para. 2.04 is
greatly dependent on a skilled agricultural labor force. This remains one
of the weakest points in the development of agriculture in Iraq. Large and
costly irrigation schemes sometimes fail to produce the expected returns be-
cause farmers lack the required skill and knowledge to benefit from them.



- 4 -
The government has started farmer training, but so far only on an ad hoc
basis and on too small a scale.  Expansion and improvement of such train-
ing are needed.
2.10      The need for agricultural technician training is equally pressing.
The expansion of the extension service and the cooperative movement is hampered
by the serious shortage of agricultural technicians. The Extension Service
in the Ministry of Agriculture will need 110 additional extension officers
per annum in the next five years; the Department of Cooperatives in the Min-
istry of Agrarian Reform will need 320 technician and degree level special-
ists by 1975, for posts which have already been established. The develop-
ment of irrigation and drainage requires large numbers of technicians for
research, preparation and implementation of government schemes. Further,
general and agricultural secondary education would require an estimated 740
agricultural technicians to be trained as teachers by 1980 (Appendix II).
2.11      Total supply and requirements for agricultural technicians and
degree holders by 1980 are estimated as follows:
Shortage/      Planned
Requirements    Supply      Surplus       Expansion
Technician level         5,000        1,300       - 3,200         1,100
Degree level             2,100        4,500      + 2,400           ---
To avoid an increasing shortage of technicians, the training capacity will be
greatly expanded. At degree level, a surplus could develop because of recent-
ly expanded training facilities. The government intends to reduce the intake
of students into Agricultural Colleges.
III. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM:
TRENDS, CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES AND NEEDS
3.01      The Iraqi educational system provides for six years of primary
(grades 1-6) six years of secondary (grades 7-12) and four to six years of
university education. Secondary education is divided into a three-year in-
termediate course (grades 7-9) and a three-year preparatory course (grades
10-12). In addition, two years of post-secondary vocational and teacher
training courses are offered (Charts I and II). The Ministry of Education
has overall responsibility for primary and secondary education and the Min-
istry of Higher Education and Scientific Research is responsible for post-
secondary and university education. Educational planning is hampered by the
division of responsibility among different ministries and by the inadequacy
of technical staff in the Ministry of Education. The Government has recently
established an inter-ministerial Council for Educational Planning but needs
technical assistance to establish proper planning procedures.



3.02      Primary school enrollment has doubled during the last decade to
about one million in 1970 representing 64% of the age group 7-12 (Annex 1).
Government plans are to enroll 95% of the boys and 75% of the girls in the
appropriate age group by 1980.
3.03      Secondary Education:  Enrollments have increased more than three-
fold in the last decade to a total of 317,000 in 1970 representing 25% of
the age group 13-18.  The Government has not yet quantified its plans for
the rate of future increase in enrollments.  The Bank staff estimate is
that the present enrollment ratio of 25% will be maintained in which case
total enrollments will increase to approximately 390,000 in 1980.
3.04      Education at this level is suffering from a number of structural
weaknesses which prevent the schools from preparing the students adequately
for future life. At intermediate level opportunities for practical, prevo-
cational work are limited by the absence of workshops and equipment. Science
teaching is largely ineffective because it is by demonstration rather than by
individual experimentation. At preparatory level there is a distinct imbalance
between academic and technical education. More than 56% of the students are
in literary courses, 27% in science, more than 4% in teacher training and only
12% in technical courses provided in separate industrial, agricultural, home
economics and commercial schools (para. 3.07). As in intermediate education,
science teaching is not very effective; science equipment is grossly inadequate.
A major weakness of secondary education is that the courses are rigidly separa-
ted; this provides little choice of study options to the student, gives no
flexibility in the school system and tends to deepen the bias against technical
training as compared with academic education.
3.05      The pupil/teacher ratio is reasonable (26:1).  Most of the second-
ary school teachers are university graduates but their pedagogical training
is inadequate, and they are unfamiliar with modern teaching techniques, par-
ticularly the science teachers. The Government has recently discontinued
the training of secondary school teachers in a regular four-year degree pro-
gram and is proposing to replace it by a more advanced and professional one-
year course leading to a post-graudate diploma.
3.06      The efficiency of the secondary school system is low; dropout and
repeating rates are high particularly at the preparatory level. Studies
undertaken by the Educational Research Center so far indicate that the
unequal distribution and standards of educational facilities, shortage of
qualified science and mathematics teachers, and curricula ill adapted to in-
dividual needs are major causes of the low efficiency of the school system.
3.07      Specialized training is provided in a large number of uneconomically
small secondary schools. In 1970 there were 69 secondary schools specializing
in industrial, agricultural, commercial, home economics and teacher education.
Their average size was less than 200 students. The training program of some
of these schools is not effectively geared to the country's need for trained
manpower.



-6-
3.08      Twelve technical (industrial) secondary schools provide three-year
training courses for 2,400 students who will join the skilled labor force.
Graduates are not generally well received by industry due to the inappro-
priateness of their training. The need at this level is for more practically-
oriented short courses in vocational training centers.
3.09      Previous attempts to train technicians in a five-year course at
the post-intermediate level and more recently in a three-year course at the
post-preparatory level have not been successful principally because both
courses were too long and failed to differentiate clearly between technician
and professional engineering status. The Institute of Technology, until re-
cently attached to the University of Baghdad, is now offering a revised two-
year course for 520 students at the post-secondary level in civil, mechanical
and electrical engineering.
3.10      Thirteen agricultural secondary schools provide training over a
three-year period for 3,600 students. Graduates of these schools are em-
ployed in the Ministries of Agriculture, Agrarian Reform, Irrigation and
Education; very few have become farmers. Some continue university education
or other post-secondary training. The agricultural secondary school courses
are academically oriented and give insufficient attention to practical train-
ing. There are adequate workshops but none is fully equipped. Livestock and
crop farms attached to the schools are too small to provide practical ex-
periences for the students. As a result, graduates lack the competence
required of skilled agricultural workers. In an effort to provide opportu-
nities for entry into farming, the Government initiated as a pilot project,
a collective farm which attracted a large number of applicants. The program
of Agricultural Secondary Schools in the future will include more practical
farming along these lines.
3.11      The need for organized programs for farmer training has been rec-
ognized, but programs have not yet been developed. Eleven of the thirteen
agricultural secondary schools have each conducted one course of 7-15 days
for groups of 15-30 farmers during 1971. The courses include Farm Machinery,
Horticulture, Vegetable Production, and Poultry. This aspect of non-formal
education needs to be expanded and institutionalized.
3.12      Facilities for the training of agricultural technicians are pro-
vided in a two-year post-secondary agricultural institute at Abu Ghraib near
Baghdad. The current enrollment is 400. There is considerable demand for
the graduates of this institute.
3.13      The number of students enrolled in higher education has more than
tripled since 1958 and in 1970 had reached a total of 36,700. The four pub-
lic universities of Baghdad, Mosul, Basrah, Sulaimaniya and the government
supported Mustansiriya University provide courses of four to five years lead-
ing to a first degree. Inadequate scientific preparation of the students at
the secondary level is a major cause of high dropout at this level. Two-
year post-secondary courses are provided for the training of technicians in
home economics, business administration, and medical laboratory work in ad-
dition to the courses carried out in technical and agricultural institutes.

3.14      In higher education, emphasis will be placed on technician training
so as to improve the present low ratio between technicians and high level pro-
fessional personnel (para. 2.08). A Council for Higher Education was recently
established with the development of science, agriculture and engineering edu-
cation as well as the planning of secondary teacher training programs as its
major objectives.
3.15      Educational television was initiated during the academic year
1970/71. The Directorate of Educational Television in the Ministry of Edu-
cation is responsible for program production. Recording and transmitting
facilities belong to the Iraqui Broadcasting and Television Establishment
(IBTE). Five weekly programs were telecast on an experimental basis for
students in the final year of secondary education. In addition model lessons
were broadcast for teachers. During school vacations an adult education pro-
gram was also televised for the general public.
3.16      Major weaknesses of this experiment are the lack of a proper plan
for integrating educational television with the school programs, a training
scheme for teachers, program producers and technical staff, a cost-benefit
study, an evaluation and feedback system, and a distribution and maintenance
plan for TV receivers. In addition, the present managerial and engineering
staff lack experience in the effective use of ETV. The frequent transfer of
senior staff, the limited budgetary allocations for staff recruitment, and
the present unsatisfactory arrangement which in the past allowed IBTE to
use part of the studio facilities of the ETV, have adversely affected its
operation and management.
3.17      Despite these weaknesses the potential benefits of further invest-
ment in educational television are large. Investments already made (mainly
for production and transmission) represent a value of $0.5 million but are
not yet fully and effectively used. The existing national television network
already covers the greater part of the population anid does not require costly
additional investment. Additional production equipment (video tape recording
equipment) and receivers for schools are the main items still required. The
recurrent cost of an ETV program would add only 3% to the unit cost of a prim-
ary school student and would not unduly increase the education budget. An ef-
fective ETV program can be expected to have a moderating effect on the high
rate of drop-out in the last years of primary education; even a small reduc-
tion in the drop-out rate would fully compensate for the high cost of ETV,
quite apart from the benefits of adult education.
3.18      The Government has decided to extend the ETV program to cover the
last three grades of primary education. Two to three regular daily programs
in science, mathematics, languages and social studies are envisaged. The
switch from secondary to primary schools will reduce per pupil cost and will
extend the facility to a majority of rural schools. The Government also in-
tends to produce programs for promoting adult education and for further train-
ing for out-of-school children, particularly in rural areas.



- 8 -
3.19      To make this program succeed the Government has appointed a full-
time, qualified director and is developing local and overseas training pro-
grams for producers, engineering technicians and graphic arts personnel. In
the past the British Council, mainly through the Center for Educational De-
velopment Overseas (CEDO), has provided some technical assistance for staff
training but due to recent political developments the continuation of this
assistance is uncertain.
IV. COST AND FINANCING OF EDUCATION
Education Expenditure
4.01      In 1970 total expenditures on education amounted to ID 65.5 million,
representing a high 7.1% of GNP, a sharp increase from 5.6% of GNP in 1965
(Annex 5). Total government expenditure on education, however, remained at
16% of the total government budget during the same period which is low in
comparison with many other countries but represents a high level of expend-
iture on education in view of the fact that the public budget represents 41%
of GNP. Public education is free at all levels. Private education accounts
for only 5% of total expenditure. All subsidies to private education have
been discontinued since 1967, but government exercises a firm control and
supervision over private schools. External aid to education constitutes a
small part of education expenditure and is limited to expertise and some
equipment.
4.02      Of total education expenditures as much as 59% is used for primary,
23% for secondary, 15% for higher education and 3% for general administration
and supervision. The share of vocational education is only a small 3.5% of
the total expenditures, or 15% of the expenditures for secondary education
(Annex 3).
4.03      Recurrent costs per student are high for primary and vocational
schools and moderately high for general secondary and higher education:
US$110 for primary education, US$120 for general secondary education, US$470
for home economics, US$510 for agricultural and US$900 for industrial schools;
and US$1,010 for higher education. High unit costs are a result of the low
pupil/teacher ratios, caused by small class sizes, and a light teaching load.
Teachers are relatively well-paid: average annual salaries are US$2,100 for
primary, US$2,800 for general secondary and US$3.700 for technical secondary
teachers. As a result, there is a large interest in the teaching profession.
The number of primary school teachers on the payroll is excessive and the
scope for useful deployment is limited as the pupil/teacher ratio is already
low. Financial provisions for equipment, supplies and materials are not
always adequate and maintenance is poor (Annex 4).
4.04      Data on educational investments are not complete.  Recorded capital
expenditures are only 3% of total education expenditures, but schools, espe-
cially primary schools, are sometimes constructed with the help of voluntary
labor. Capital expenditures are not adequate as evidenced by the fact that



- 9 -
46% of the primary and 42% of the general secondary schools are substandard,
a large number of them being in rented buildings which are not designed as
schools. During the last 5 years only 40% of the budgets allocated for
school construction were actually used. As with other sectors in the Devel-
opment Plan, there is an urgent need for more attention to the preparation
and implementation of educational investment projects.
Future Education Expenditures 1970-1980
4.05      Based on assumptions outlined in Annex 5 total education expendi-
ture would increase to ID 177 million by 1980 if pupil/teacher ratios, class
sizes and teaching loads remain at their present low level. Even if GNP rose
at a rapid 8% p.a., education would still claim as much as 9% of GNP by 1980.
There is need to develop a coordinated education plan which would consolidate
smaller schools into more economical units, increase class sizes and pupil/
teacher ratios and improve staff utilization. Total education expenditure
would then increase only to ID 139 million by 1980 and its present 7% share
of GNP would not rise (Annex 5). The recurrent cost resulting from the pro-
posed project would be ID 1.8 million, or 1.3% of 1980 expenditure.
V. EDUCATION AND TRAINING DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
5.01      The Government has not yet completed a comprehensive plan for the
development of the education and training system, but following three high
level education seminars in 1970 and 1971, the broad objectives of the Gov-
ernment's policy have emerged and decisions concerning a number of important
reform measures have been taken which will greatly improve the relevance and
efficiency of the country's education system.
5.02      More specifically, the Government intends, inter alia, to take
the following steps which merit full support:
(a) Secondary education will be improved by the introduction, on an
experimental basis, of comprehensive secondary schools offering greater
flexibility of course structure and greater emphasis on technical, as dis-
tinct from academic courses, in accordance with the needs outlined in paras.
3.04 and 3.06 above; the experimental schools will also be more economical
in size, which will enable the Government to increase the pupil/teacher
ratio and reduce unit costs. Technical assistance will be required to
assist in the administration of the new schools during the initial years.
It will take some years before the results of this experiment are known
but in the meantime the Government intends to give greater emphasis, in
existing secondary schools, to practical, pre-vocational courses at lower
secondary level and to the improvement of science teaching at both lower
and upper levels. This step will require additional investments in labora-
tories, workshops and equipment. Teacher training will be reorganized and
improved and the training of technical teachers will be expanded. Research
to find the causes of the high rate of drop-out and repetition will be
continued.



- 10 -
(b) Training of technicians for industry and agriculture will be im-
proved and greatly expanded. The Government has acknowledged that the de-
gree courses in engineering and agriculture have already expanded beyond
the country's need and that the emphasis should be on short two-year post-
secondary technician courses, in accordance with the manpower needs outlined
above (paras. 2.08, 2.09 and 2.12). UNDP is already providing some technical
and other assistance for industrial technician training but additional tech-
nical assistance in this field and in agricultural technician training will
be required.
(c) Training of skilled workers will be greatly expanded. UNDP/ILO
are assisting the Government in establishing a national vocational training
scheme in response to the urgent need for skilled workers and supervisors
(para. 2.09). In 1971 a new Labor Law was enacted which gives full respon-
sibility for vocational training to a newly established Central Bureau of
Vocational Training under the Labor Establishment in the Ministry of Labor
and Social Affairs. The Bureau, with UNDP/ILO technical assistance, is lay-
ing the basis for a vocational training scheme and planning the establishment
of a first training center in Baghdad. To meet fully the considerable
training needs the country will require an expanding network of training
centers in major industrial areas. Additional technical assistance is re-
quired to train staff for the work training centers.
(d) Farmer training centers will be established at ten agricultural
secondary schools to train young and adult farmers in the use and applica-
tion of modern farming techniques and practices so as to increase agricul-
tural productivity.
(e) Educational television: The Government wants to make fuller use
of the potential of ETV by expanding the experimental programs, both in
scope and coverage, not only to primary schools but also to adult education
courses particularly in rural areas. Plans for the proposed extension are
tentative and need considerably more preparation before further investment
is made. A competent full-time director would be required to head up the
program supported by appropriately qualified production and technical staff.
The Government is taking steps to correct these deficiencies. Further in-
vestment in ETV should be preceded by continued government measures to solve
the pressing management problems and to develop a realistic plan (para. 3.16).
Technical assistance is required for this purpose.
VI. THE PROJECT
General
6.01      The proposed project would assist the government to expand the
training of middle level technicians and skilled craftsmen/farmers, to in-
troduce comprehensive secondary education and to improve the teaching of
science and vocational education in the secondary schools and to make better
use of its ETV potential. It would help to finance (i) construction and



- 11 -
equipment for new and existing facilities, as shown below, and (ii) 55 ex-
pert man-years and 46 fellowship man-years of technical assistance to devel-
op the new secondary comprehensive and vocational curricula, to train staff
for technician training institutes and work training centers, to improve the
production of education television programs and to strengthen educational
planning and project implementation as detailed in Annex 8.

Comprehensive Secondary Schools
6.02      These schools would provide an experimental program aimed at bridg-
ing the present gap between academic and technical prevocational courses by
providing facilities which will enable students to make a choice among literary,
scientific and technical courses. The proposed project would finance four
comprehensive secondary schools (three for boys, one for girls), two of whiich
will be located in Baghdad, one in Suairah and one in Sulemaniya. The schools
would provide six-year courses of general and vocationally-oriented secondary
education for 3,200 students and would serve as a pilot project for diversifying
the curriculum to suit individual need (paras. 3.04--3.07). The proposed cur-
ricula are appropriate and emphasize courses in fields where a considerable



- 12 -
employment opportunity exists for the graduates (Annex 6). The schools offer
courses in industrial arts, commercial studies, agriculture and home economics
as well as general courses in science and arts. Specialization into the various
streams is possible during the last two years of the six-year program and the
proportion of vocational enrollments will constitute 75% of the total in these
grades (Annex 7). Individual choice and aptitude will determine the distrib-
ution of students among the options.
6.03      The two schools to be located in rural areas will require boarding
accommodation and staff housing. The College of Education in the University
of Baghdad will provide the required 93 teachers of academic subjects with
post-graduate diploma courses in education. The In-service Teacher Training
Institute in Baghdad offers courses in industrial arts. It should also ac-
cept responsibility for the training of industrial arts teachers. The Col-
lege of Agriculture and the schools of home economics and commerce in the
University of Baghdad will train the required agricultural, home economics
and commercial teachers.  The project provides for technical assistance in
the form. of an adviser for the Ministry of Education to develop the compre-
Lnensive school program and eight fellowships for staff training.  Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Government would organize the
teacher training courses needed and recruit qualified directors and assist-
ant directors to plan the school programs as early as possible.
Science Laboratories
6.04      The proposed project would provide for the construction, furniture
and equipment of science laboratories for 4,000 science students in twelve
preparatory secondary schools located in Baghdad, Mosul and Basrah in accord-
ance with the needs outlined in para. 3.04. The science curricula of these
schools are satisfactory. The majority of the graduates would enter univer-
sity science faculties and post-secondary institutes for enGineering, agri-
culture and paramedical training. Some 40 teachers already in service should
receive training in the use of laboratory techniques in the College of Educa-
tion. During negotiations assurances to this effect were obtained from the
government.
Intermediate School Workshop Units
6.05      The project would provide for the construction and equipment of
workshop units in each of 20 intermediate schools. Courses would be offered
in woodwork, metal-work, electricity, handcrafts and technical drawing in
accordance with the needs outlined in para. 3.04. In addition, four expert
man-years of technical assistance would be provided. The project would im-
prove practical training and establish a basis for general skills training
in areas where such skills are in great demand. It is expected that as a
result of the better facilities and improved training of some 10,000 students,
the standards of entry to technical and vocational courses at the preparatory
level would be greatly enhanced. For those who wish to join the labor force
at the end of the intermediate school employment prospects as semi-skilled
tradesmen would also improve.



- 13 -
6.06      To prepare the required 120 vocational instructors, selected grad-
uates from the technical secondary schools would be recruited for a one-year
course in which approximately one-half of the time would be devoted to fur-
ther training in technical skills and the other half to pedagogy and teach-
ing practice. The courses would be given in the appropriate technical sec-
ondary schools in Baghdad with the necessary supporting staff from the Col-
lege of Education. During negotiations assurances were obtained that satis-
factory arrangements will be made for carrying out this proposal.
Institutes of Technology (Basrah and Baghdad)
6.07      To meet the need for technicians outlined in paras. 2.07-2.09, the
project would provide for (i) the construction and equipment of a new Insti-
tute of Technology at Basrah, with a capacity of 840 students, to train tech-
nicians in civil, mechanical, electrical and processing engineering and (ii)
equipment for the Baghdad Institute of Technology to increase its capacity
from 520 to 1,490 students and to develop new courses in water supply and
treatment, power generation and transmission, radio and television telecommu-
nications, refrigeration and air conditioning, textiles, petro-chemical and
laboratory technician training in addition to the existing civil, electrical
and mechanical engineering courses. The Institutes, under the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research, will offer two-year post-secondary
courses with provision for vacation periods to be spent in industry. The
curricula of the Institutes are satisfactory.
6.08      UNDP has agreed to finance about US$345,000 for some equipment,
technical assistance and overseas training for the Institute at Basrah. How-
ever, in addition to this, about 8 expert man-years and 4 fellowship man-
years of technical assistance are also required for this Institute. These
have been included under the proposed Bank project. It is anticipated that
around 1975, additional technical assistance would be required. At the ap-
propriate time, the Government will try and arrange further UNDP financing
for it, or finance it itself. The proposed project also includes 8 fellow-
ship man-years of technical assistance for the Baghdad Institute (Annex 8).
6.09      The two institutes would ultimately require 152 additional teachers
who should be trained by the College of Education following technician train-
ing and industrial experience. A program for the recruitment, training and
appointment of these teachers should be developed before December 31, 1972
and carried out before June 30, 1976. The Director and Assistant Director
for the Basrah Institute should be appointed sufficiently in advance of the
completion of construction. Assurances to this effect were obtained during
the negotiations.
Work Training Centers
6.10      The project would help to cover part of the shortage of skilled
workers (Paras. 2.05-2.09) by providing for the construction and equipment
of five centers (two in Baghdad, one each in Mosul, Basrah and Kirkuk).
These would offer initial full-time training programs for newly employed
workers as well as part-time and full-time trade training courses for the



- 14 -
upgrading of existing workers in metal, auto mechanics, electricity, con-
struction, plastics, ceramics, textiles and weaving. The proposed courses
are directly related to the needs of the respective regions. The initial
full-time courses will last approxinately 9 months. The upgrading courses
will be of varying character and length according to the needs of industry
and the trainee. Completion of intermediate education would be required for
admission. The centers will operate on a double shift system and graduate
a total of 3,000 skilled workers per year.
6.11      A total of 240 instructors should be trained, using a number of
existing technical institutions which all have staff available. An ILO team
of experts is now in Iraq assisting the Government in vocational training.
The Government will arrange with the ILO to continue the services of these
experts for assisting in the organization and supervision of the staff train-
ing. The construction and equipping of the centers will be undertaken by
the Ministry of Education in close cooperation with the Central Bureau of
Vocational Training in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, and the
administration of these centers would be transferred to the latter Ministry
as soon as the centers become operational. This program would require 18
expert man-years and 10 fellowship man-years of technical assistance for
staff training, as detailed in Annex 8.
Agricultural Institutes (Eski Kellak and Amara)
6.12      The project would provide for the establishnent of two new agri-
cultural institutes to train middle level agricultural technicians in ac-
cordance with the needs outlined in paras. 2.11 and 2.12. One of the in-
stitutes would be at Eski Kellak in the North, with an enrollment of 240,
and the other at Amara in the South with an enrollment of 260. Both in-
stitutions would be provided with full boarding facilities and would offer
two-year, post-secondary courses with three streams following partially
specialized options in animal production, crop production and farm mechani-
zation and irrigation. The annual output from both institutions would be
approximately 220 technicians. The curricula of the Institutes are satis-
factory.  The institutes will be operated by the Ministry of Higher Educa-
tion and Scientific Research.
6.13      Successful operation would require technical assistance, which
has been included in the project (para. 6.19). A recently enacted law would
enable the establishment of salary scales and terms of service which would
facilitate the recruitment of 30 adequately trained and experienced staff
needed for the Institutes.  Assurances have been obtained from the govern-
ment that directors for the agricultural institutes will be appointed suf-
ficiently in advance of the completion of construction.
6.14      The location of the institutes is satisfactory.  The Institute in
the North is to be located adjacent to an agricultural complex of a forestry
institute, a livestock research center, a senior agricultural high school,
regional offices of the M1tinistries of Agriculture and Irrigation, and a new
irrigation project of 20,000 donums (5,000 hectares) of land. The Institute
in the South is to be located on a main highway in a new irrigation develop-
ment project of 90,000 donums (22,500 hectares).



- 15 -
Farmer Training Centers
6.15      A major objective of the project is to acquaint farmers with modern
techniques and practices needed to improve agricultural productivity (paras.
2.04, 2.10 and 3.11). The project would provide training facilities in the
form of a lecture-demonstration room and a poultry house, together with teach-
ing and farm equipment at 10 of the existing 13 agricultural secondary schools
in the country. In addition, three expert man-years and six fellowship man-
years of technical assistance would be required.
6.16      Courses for up to 30 participants and lasting from seven to four-
teen days will be mainly practical in nature and geared to the development
of selected farm skills and practices. It is proposed that eventually about
15 courses will be offered each year. The subject matter for each course
will be developed by thie Board of Managers; the arrangements for the courses -
including the transport of farmers, will be the responsibility of the staff
of each school, and the conduct of the training will be shared by the school's
staff and appropriate specialists from the Ministries of Agriculture, Agrarian
Reform, Irrigation and Education. The selection of participants for the
course, now a function of the local branch1 of the farmer's union, will be-
come a joint responsibility with the Board of Managers to be appointed for
each school.
Educational Television
6.17      To enable the Government to make better use of its ETV potential
(para. 3.17) througlh a well-designed e<iucational television program that
will reinforce classroom teaching in primary education, improve student
performance and support the large number of unqualified teachers, the Proj-
ect wouldl provide expert services and fellowslhips (as detailed in Annex d)
to be followed at a later stage by production equipment and television re-
ceivers. During the negotiations assurances were obtained that the Govern-
ment would continue to employ a qualified, full-time director for ETV, with
authority over central and district audiovisual personnel and to allocate
sufficient funds for ETV operations. Assurances have also been obtained
from the Government that normally the ETV studio facilities would be used
solely for educational purposes. Before Decemiiber 31, 1973, with the assis-
tance of consultants or technical experts provided under the Project, the
staffing of ETV would be improved, a detailed program, mutually satisfactory
to the Government and the Bank, would be developed for the use of ETV facil-
ities in the last tharee grades of primary schools and in adult education and
a detailed equipment list would be prepared. This program will include,
(a) an evaluation of the existing experimental  rTV program, (b) selection
of schools and subjects appropriate for ETV, (c) trainin} of teachers in the
use of ETV, (d) traininj of program producers in ETV, (e) program production
and establishmiLent of an evaluation and feed-back systemii, (f) an analysis of
expected cost and benefits.

Technical Assistance
6.18      Successful implementation of the proposed project will require
specialist manpower in fields where local expertise is lacking or inadequate;
to meet those requirements which are not forthcoming from other external
sources, the project would include 55 expert man-years and 46 fellowship
mar.-years (as specified in Annex 3) for the following purposes:
(a) to organize educational planning in the Ministry of Education and
to strengthen the inter-ministerial Council for Educational Planning in ac-
cordance with the needs in para. 3.01;
(b) to develop comprehensive school curricula and supervise the Voca-
tional Workshop programs in secondary schools (paras. 6.03 and 6.05);
(c) to develop programs at the technical institute in Basrah to sup-
plement UNDP technical assistance (para. 6.08) and at the two agricultural
institutes and the farmer training centers (paras. 6.13 and 6.15);
(d) to train staff for the work training centers (para. 6.11);
(e) to assist the government in establishing a viable ETV program
(para. 6.17);
(f) to assist the project unit in procuring equipment and furniture
for project institutions (para. 7.01).
Tracer System
6.19      As part of the evaluation of the proposed project., a "tracer system"
would be established to conduct a systematic follow-up study on student with-
drawal and repetition and on employment and/or further training of graduates
of the project schools and a representative group of the more traditional
schools. Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
Cost of the Project 1/

6.22      The cost estimates for school buildings in the proposed project
are based on contracts concluded by the 'Ministry of Public Works in the past
two to three years and on information obtainecd from public and private enter-
prises.  The building cost per square meter of gross floor area, ranging
from US$76 for secondary schools to USS100 for the Institute of Technology,
are somewhat higher than in similar projects but the unit costs per student
place and the use factor of the project institutions compare favorably with
similar Bank/IDA financed projects in other countries (Annex 10). A local
cost adjustment of 10% of the basic price has been made for Basrah and 15%



- 19 -
for Mosul and vicinity due to additional transportation costs and lack of
local skilled labor. Site development costs are estimated at 7-15% of building
cost depending on the conditions of each site. The cost estimates for furni-
ture and equipment are based on c.&f. prices (i.e. net of taxes and duties),
including insurance to be arranged by the Government. No preferential trade
agreements exist for the goods and services to be provided.
6.23      The cost of the project includes a contingency allowance for un-
foreseen factors equal to 10% of the estimated costs for buildings, site
development and professional services (Annex 11). The estimated unit costs
are expected to increase 4-5% p.a. and the project costs, therefore, would
also include allowance to cover possible price increases during the imple-
mentation period equal to 15% for buildings, site development, professional
services and furniture and equipment and 10% for technical assistance (Annex
11). Total contingencies would thus represent 19% of the total project cost
excluding contingencies and 16% including contingencies.
6.24      The foreign exchange component of US$12.9 million representing 65%
of the total project cost has been calculated as follows: (i) site develop-
ment 25%; (ii) buildings 43%; (iii) professional services 60%; (iv) furniture
and equipment 95%; and (v) technical assistance 80%.
VII. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
7.01      The Project Implementation Unit:  A special unit has been estab-
lished in the Ministry of Education which will be responsible to an Inter-
ministerial Coordinating Committee composed of responsible officials from
the Ministries of Education (Chairman), Higher Education and Scientific
Research, Labor and Social Affairs, Planning and Communications (IBTE).
The project unit would be responsible for: (a) supervision; (b) coordina-
tion within the Ministry and with other government agencies; and (c) liaison
with the Bank. The Director of the unit will be a member of the Inter-minis-
terial Coordinating Committee and is directly responsible to it. The unit
will include (i) a qualified full-tine project directcr and a qualified full-
time project architect; (ii) a specialist in furniture and equipment procure-
ment to be provided as part of the tecinical assistance included in the pro-
posed project; (iii) a qualified accountant; and (iv) secretarial and support-
ing staff. The project director and the project architect are being selected.
7.02      Professional Services:  The implementation of the whole project
would require employment of professional manpower beyond the government's
present resources. A consultinig firm of architects and engineers, mutually
satisfactory to the Government and the Bank, would therefore be needed for
the design and supervision of construction. It is likely that a local and
an international firm will form a joint venture to provide these services.
For some project items, such as additions of laboratories and workshops to
existing schools, competent Government architects would however be employed.
Even in this case preliminary designs and specifications will have to be
satisfactory to the Bank prior to detailed designing and construction.



- 20 -
7.03      Site Acquisition:  Satisfactory sites have been selected for most
of the project items and assurances have been obtained that suitable sites
will be selected before December 1973 to replace those which were not found
appropriate.
7.04      Procurement:  All contracts for the supply of furniture and equip-
ment and for construction of schools would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. The number of local general contractors is
adequate to carry out the construction work. Except for equipment and furni-
ture, most of which will be imported, it is unlikely that the project would
attract many foreign bidders. Local furniture manufacturers would be allowed
a preferential margin of 15% of the c.&f. costs (plus insurance) of competing
imports or the rate of import duties whichever is less. Iraq does not normal-
ly allow import of furniture of the type manufactured domestically. However
the Government has agreed that all bid documents would clarify that import
licenses would be issued to successful bidders.
7.05      Disbursements:  The Bank would finance the c.&f. costs of imported
furniture and equipment or the ex-factory cost of furniture if it is locally
produced, 100% of the foreign exchange cost of professional services and tech-
nical assistance and 41% of the cost of civil works representing the foreign
exchange cost. The project would be carried out in about five years; con-
struction can be completed in 2-1/2 years, but technical assistance is re-
quired for up to 5 years (Annexes 12 and 13).
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACHEI) AND REC0V-EINDATIONS
8.01      Before the negotiations, the Government established an Inter-
Ministerial Coordinating Committee and a Project Implementation Unit in the
Ministry of Education (para. 7.01). The Government has also confirmed the
availability of UNDP (Special Fund) technical assistance for the Basrah
Institute of Technology (para. 6.03).
8.02      During the negotiations satisfactory assurances were obtained on
the following matters:
(i)  recruitment, training and appointment of teaching staff
for the project institutions (paras. 6.03, 6.04, 6.06,
6.09, 6.11, 6.13 and 6.17);
(ii) acquisition of sites (para. 7.03).
(iii) development of a plan for the use of ETV (para. 6.17);
(iv) establishment of a tracer system (para. 6.19);
(v)  staffing of the project unit (para. 7.01).

8.03      The proposed project is suitable as a basis for a Bank loan of
US$12.9 million to the Republic of Iraq, for a period of 25 years including
a 10-year grace period.

TECrUNICAL MANPOWER REQUIREFENTS
1.        The Mission's estimate of Iraq's requirements for technical trained
manpower in the period 1970-1980 is based on reports by Nils Strom, a U.N.
manpower expert, and by the Unesco Project Identification V'ission. The
mission elaborated on the estimates for population, labor force and employment
by sector, taking into account the revised population estimates and various
new priorities introduced in the National. Development Plan. The mission's
revised employment estimates are summarized in Tahle 1.

2.        The table shows that the labor force will increase faster than
ponulation, mainly because of an increased participation by women. Thus,
it will be difficult to avoid growth of unemplovment; agriculture may re-
main the largest employment outlet if urbanization is checked and the area
under cultivation is increased. The industrial sectors (mining, manufacturing,
utilities and construction) may develop very rapidly, reflecting the high pri-
ority these sectors have in government's development plans.

3.        The above employment projections were disaggregated into smaller
sectors, and the number of new entrants determined. The proportions of new
entrants into each sector requiring technical training was estimated using
normative percentages of similar countries and the basic data of the surveys
of large establishments, carried out in the past few years. A survey of
manpower demand in the next 4 years was being carried out while the mission
was in the field. The survey covered 21% of total employment in the in-
dustrial sector, trade and transport. Demand for technical trained manpower
was on the average 38% of total manpower demand (Table 2). When estimated
demand for smaller establishments is added, one arrives at the ratios in-
dicated in Table 3.
4.        Requirements for workers with technical training are of particular
importance in manufacturing.  Other sectors such as construction, transport
and services have lower technical skill requirements but they are important
because of their overall size. Total technical training requirements will
be of the order of 29,000 in the period 1970-1975 and 49,000 in 1975-1980.
These numbers would constitute respectively 3.4% and 4.6% of total new en-
trants into the labor force.
5.        The assumed distribution by level of training is again to a large
extent normative. The recent survey, mentioned above, indicated that demand
for technical trained manpower is composed of 14% engineers, 18% technicians
and 68% skilled workers. This ratio reflects the present situation where
large numbers of engineers are working in technicians' positions. Estimates
for technical manpower requirements were made using the normative ratios of
10:25:65 between engineers to technicians to skilled workers. The expected
output capacity of the education and training system as compared with these
estimates is given in Table 4.

6.        The following general conclusions can be drawn:
(a)  The existing technical training capacity falls far short
of requirements resulting in the growing shortage of tech-
nical trained manpower. The proposed Bank project will
cover one-third of the shortage of technicians after 1975,
and thus provide an imPortant contribution to the country's
needs.
(b)  The work training centers will cover half the shortage
of skilled workers. The comprehensive schools will not
have produced skilled manpower in this period.
(c)  At present, engineers are in surplus supply.  The situation
maY change towards the end of the 1970's.  Till that ti,e,
no further exransion of engineering education seers justi-
f4ed.
1/   The comprehensive schools will not graduate during this period and their
output is therefore not included in this figure.

AGRICULTURAL MANPOWER REQUIREYENTS
1.        For the year 1980, requirements for agricultural technicians and
graduates are estimated as follows:
College
Technicians    Graduates
(a)  Extension service
irrigated land:  440,000 units                  1,470           440
rainfed land:    170,000 units                    340            170
(b)  Cooperatives                                       240           120
Total                                      2,050           730
(c)  Research                                           450           150
(d)  Administration                                     200            70
(e)  Development                                     1,000            300
(f)  Mniversity education                                60           280
(g)  Other education                                    740           360
(h)  Private farming, manufacturing, etc.               500           210
Total requirements                         5,000n        2,100
2.        These estimates are based on the following assumptions:
(a) Total employment in agriculture in 1Q80 is estimated at
1,825,000. An estimated 22 million donums of land would
be irrigated; an averaoe size of 50 donums per farm unit
would give 440,000 units. Further, the 24.4 million
donums of arable rainfed land, including seasonal grazing
areas, would consist of 170,000 farm units with an aver-
age size of about 150 dontnms. The requirements for tech-
nician.s and graduates would be:
- irrigated land: one technician per 300 units; one
graduate per 1,000 units.
- rainfed land:  one technician per 500 units; one
graduate per 1,000 units.



APPENDIX II
Page 2
(b)  Cooperatives:  one technician per 2,500 units; one graduate
per 5,000 units.
(c)  research:  20% of graduates in the field; 3 technicians per
graduate.
(d)  Administration and planning:  10%1 of graduates and technicians
in the field.
(e)  The agricultural development program calls for an expansion of
the irrigated area by 1 million donumns per annum.
(f)  Included, in 1 (g) above, are teachers for agricultural and
general secondary schools.
3.        A comparison of the requirements for the years 1970, 1980 and 1990
with the supply would give the following results:

APPENDIX II
Page 3
The supply is estimated on the basis of the output of 150 technicians and
400 college graduates per year from existing institutions and 220 technicians
per year from the Bank project.
4.        The following general conclusions can be drawn from the above
exercise:
(a)  At present a critical shortage of both agricultural technicians
and college graduates exists.
(b) As a result of a large expansion of agricultural colleges
in the last few years, the shortage of graduates will change
into a surplus within two or three years.  Unless the intake
of students is restricted, this surplus will assume very
large proportions.
(c)  At the same time, the shortage of agricultural technicians
will be growing. The Bank project would reduce this shortage
by increasing the output capacity by 150%. Thus, in spite of
growing requirements, it would be possible to keep the short-
age at least about constant.

Assumptions for projection up to 1980:
1.        GNP is assumed to grow either at 6% per annum (high) or at 6% (low).
Government's share in GNP is for both alternatives supposed to be !40%.
2.        Enrollment targets for 1980 have only been established with respect
to primary education (Para. 3.2). The mission has estimated that the present
participation rate for secondary education of 25% will be maintained, but with
a higher proportion of vocational education (8% instead of 3.2%) and that about
5% of the appropriate age group will be enrolled in higher education.



ANNEX 5

3.        Average teacher salaries will rise with 2% p.a. consistent with rising
per capita income and with an additional 1% p.a. because of improving qualifi-
cations. Non-personnel recurrent expenditures per student will increase even
faster as a result of more emphasis on science teaching and improved provision
of teaching materials and maintenance. Further, it is assumed that capital
expenditures will be kept at a low level by using low-cost buildings and by
continuing reliance on voluntary labor. Private education is expected to maintain
its present share of educational expenditure at all levels, except in secondary
education where government schools would expand relatively faster. The intro-
duction of educational television in some 2,500 primary schools is expected to
increase the unit cost only slightly.
4.        Two alternatives have been worked out for the education expenditures:
a high one assuming a continuation of the present situation with low pupil/teacher
ratios, and a low alternative which assumes that the public education system will
be made more efficient, increasing the pupil/teacher ratios as follows: from
21.5 to 30 in primary education,from 25.6 to 30 in secondary general and from
10.6 to 15 in secondary vocational education.
The results are summarized in the following table:
