INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF IRAQ
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Iraq for the equivalent of US $12.9 million to
finance the foreign exchange cost of an education project designed to
help meet the country's needs for skilled workers and technicians and to
initiate, on a pilot basis, the reform of the secondary and vocational
educational system. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including
10 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Pbsition and Prospects of
Iraq" (EMA-35a) dated August 20, 1971 was distributed to the Executive
Directors on August 26, 1971 (R 71-213). More recent information on the
economy was obtained by a mission to Iraq in April, and has been incor-
porated in the following paragraphs. Country data is at Annex II.
3.        The l958 revolution established a republican form of govern-
ment and initiated a decade of fundamental social and political change.
The landowner and entrepreneurial classes steadily lost their political
and economic influence as successive governments introduced a comprehen-
sive land reform and gradually assumed control of the larger commercial
and industrial enterprises. This gradual but fundamental transition to
a socialist economic system, together with frequent changes of govern-
ment and key officials, has for several years resulted in a lower rate
of growth than Iraq's economic potential would permit. However, the
present military Ba'athist Government has been in power for four years
and has consolidated its position. A number of measures taken since
late 1970, reflect a growing sense of confidence and concentration on
domestic economic and social problems.
4.        The economy is dependent on oil which provides 35 percent of
national output, over 90 percent of exports and over 50 percent of govern-
ment revenues. However, the growth of crude oil production has averaged
less than 5 percent per year during the 1960's compared to 10 percent
for all Middle Eastern producers. This has been due to the low level of
investment by the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), as a result of the pro-
tracted and continuing dispute with the Government going back to 1961,



-2-
mainly over oil exploitation rights and the treatment of royalty payments
for taxation purposes. The latter issue has been partially resolved by a
series of agreements reached since October 1970, which provide for, inter
alia, increased production and higher posted prices for oil delivered at
Gulf and Mediterranean ports. Agreement was also reached in January 1972
on compensation for losses resulting from the realignment of exchange rates.
5.        While the dispute with western petroleum interests over exploi-
tation rights continues, the government-owned Iraq National Oil Company
(INOC), established in 1964, made its first oil shipment from the North
Rumali'a field to the Soviet Union in April 1972. Although this is in
itself significant, INOC is not expected to produce and export much more
than 5 million tons per annum in 1972 and 1973, which would represent about
7 to 8 percent of Iraq's total oil exports. This figure is expected to rise
to about 15 million tons a year by the late 1970's. Before'INOC can become
a major exporting company it will have to develop further production
capacity, solve a number of marketing problems and develop new terminals
and possibly a pipeline to the Mediterranean, since the Gulf ports are not
suitable for super tankers. In December 1971, the Government announced
that a ten-year petroleum development program, aimed at a 10 percent per
year. growth rate in total oil production, was being prepared.
6.        The recent oil agreements have substantially strengthened Iraq's'
financial position; in 1972, for example, they are expected to provide
revenues to the Government of about $1 billion. However, they do not-
materially alter the basic problems of the economy. Per capita GNP (around
$330 in 1970); is still relatively low and income disparities between
rural and urban areas, as well as between various regions, are large.
Population is growing at a high rate (more than 3 percent a year) leading
to unemployment particularly in urban areas, where employment opportunities
have increased less than economic growth in recent years. The growing
urban population also demands better housing, public utilities and transport.
There is a serious shortage of public economic and social services throughout
the country. Substantial investment in agriculture is needod. The Govern-
ment is faced with the task of channelling increased resources into produc-
tive use, in order to diversify the economy and to create additional income
and employment.
7.        Agriculture, although employing more than half of Iraq's'labour
force, developed very slowly over the last ten years. Dependence on rain
rather than irrigated water in nearly 50 percent of the cultivated acreage,
and soil salinity in-irrigated areas due to inadequate drainage, are major
constraints. They are aggravated by traditional farming methods and the
consequent limited use of improved seeds, fertilizers and machinery, and
by inadequate credit and poor extension services. The study of Iraq's land
and water resources, which the Government is mounting with the Bank's
assistance, should provide a basis for assessing the priorities to be
accorded to proposals to extend irrigation and drainage and to bring new
lands under cultivation, as well as for measures to make better use of
present resources. The Government is also keen on developing the agricul-
tural potential of Northern Iraq, following the settlement of the dispute
with the Kurds, including exploiting the potential of this and other
regions of Iraq for livestock production.



-3-
8.        Iraq has a small and unsophisticated manufacturing sector which
contributed around 10 percent of GDP in 1970 and employed less than 5 per-
cent of the total labour force. The major industries are foodstuffs,
beverages, textiles, clothing, petroleum refining and building materials.
Other industries include soaps and detergents, furniture, assembly and
repair work. Most industries rely on imported materials, produce for the
home market and receive protection through tariffs and import quotas. The
shortage of trained manpower is probably the most serious impediment to
industrial growth. The sector is largely nationalized, with centrally-
directed policies determined according to the national plan. The petroleum-
based and other chemical industries have considerable potential for further
development.
9.        The transport system consists of river transport on the Tigris and
Euphrates, about 2,300 km of railways whose efficiency is reduced by the two-
gauge system and a heavy backlog of replacement needs, and about 10,000 km
of roads, of which less than half are paved for all-weather use. Traffic
demands on the rail and road systems are increasing. Further investment is
required to help increase the capacity of the present networks and extend
them into the more remote parts of the country. A transport study being
prepared under the 1966 road project is expected to identify priorities for
the road system. Meanwhile, the Government proposes to complete the system
of main trunk roads linking the major economic centers of North and South
Iraq.
10.       Largely due to increased oil revenues, current revenues which
rose by 10 percent per year during fiscal years 1965-69, rose by over
18 percent per year during fiscal years 1969-70. In the same period,
growth of current expenditures averaged 12 percent per annum, not signi-
ficantly above the 11.4 percent per annum growth achieved in the previous
four years. As a result, government savings which were negative in 1967
increased to about 4 percent of GNP in 1969-70. The budgeted increases in
development expenditures for these two years were 40 percent and 50 percent
respectively, compared to the average annual increase of 8.3 percent between
fiscal years 1965-69. Implementation rates have however been comparatively
low. Increased oil revenues also accounted for a surplus in the current
account of the balance of payments amounting to US $109 million in 1970,
and an estimated US $150 million in 1971. Foreign reserves rose by US $123
million during the two years, equivalent of eight months of imports and a
rise in gross reserves of US $98 million. Growth of money supply, which
rose to 14 percent in fiscal 1969, has declined to 5 percent in fiscal 1970
and the first three-quarters of fiscal 1971. Consequently, the rate of
inflation has declined from 9.7 percent in fiscal 1969 to 7.3 percent in
fiscal 1970. Recent government measures liberalizing imports should alleviate
further pressure on prices.
11.       The current Development Plan (1970-74) represents an important
departure from the priorities adopted under previous plans, in that the
highest priority has been given to the development of agriculture and human



-4 -
resources, while the building up of import substituting and extractive
industries has been given second priority. The Plan foresees an annual
growth rate of 6.8 percent in GDP,with agriculture expanding at an annual
average rate of 7 percent and industry at 12 percent. It foresees a
total investment of $3 billion, to be financed mostly from oil revenues,
together with modest external assistance. Because of the additional
resources that will accrue to Iraq under the new oil agreements, Plan
expenditures have recently been significantly increased. Public investment
allocated for the major productive sectors has been increased from
$1,350 million to $2,310 million. Although sector priorities have been
retained, there seems to be a shortage of well-prepared projects for which
these new' resources can be readily used.
12.       In the last few years, Iraq's reliance on external financing for
public investment has been modest. The total amount of external public
debt stood at approximately $290 million at the end of 1970, most of it in
the form of long-term loans at relatively low interest. Of this, 26 per-
cent was owed to USSR and another 33 percent to Kuwait. As a result, the
debt service ratio is still low (2.8 percent in 1970). In the last decade,
in the absence of assistance from western sources, Iraq has been relying
increasingly on suppliers' credits and on bilateral assistance from East
European countries. In March 1971, for instance, Iraq obtained a 200-million
rouble credit from the USSR to be repaid by oil exports. The credit will be
utilized primarily for exploiting oil and mineral resources, and for
industrial development. Similarly in June 1971 ,Iraq obtained a $39 million
loan from the People's Republic of China, to be repaid in the same manner.
This pattern of financing can be expected to continue for oil and industrial
investments. There are little or no prospects for foreign private capital
except suppliers' credits and any necessary investments by oil companies
under recent oil agreements. Long-term finance for agricultural development,
training of human resources and expansion of basic infrastructure has not
been available from Eastern Europe or through suppliers' credits, and thus
is likely to be sought from sources such as the Bank and the UNDP.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IRAQ
13.       The Bank has made three loans to Iraq over a period of 25 years
totalling $52.8 million, net of cancellations. These were for a project
for flood control in 1950, one for roads in 1966 and most recently, for
telecommunications in 1971.  $4.5 million-of the 1966 Roads loan     -
(US $19 million) remains undisbursed.  Disbursements under the 1971 loan
have not yet started.  While the execution of the roads project has faced
many difficulties, the Government is giving greater attention to project
implementation than was the case some years ago. Annex I contains a
summary statement of Bank loans as of April 30, 1972, and notes on the
execution of the two on-going projects, with particular reference to the
problems encountered with the roads project. There have been no IFC
investments in Iraq so far and none are expected.



14.       After the first loan in 1950, Iraq did not seek further assistance
from the Bank for a long time, partly because foreign exchange requirements
for public investment were being met from oil revenues. An increase in
public investment in the mid-1960's was largely responsible for a brief
revival of interest in Bank lending, which resulted in the 1966 roads project.
Over the past two years, the Government has again expressed considerable
interest in Bank assistance in several key sectors and a number of projects
have been prepared. The telecommunications loan was the first of these.
15.       As mentioned in Part I, while Iraq will continue to earn substantial
oil revenues, most parts of the country are still at an early stage of
development and have a low per capita income. Substantial resources are
required to gradually build up adequate public services and create additional
sources of income and employment. However, progress under the current
Development Plan has been constrained by limited capacity in project iden-
tification, preparation and management. Conscious of these shortcomings, Iraq
recognizes the need to make greater use of the assistance of organizations
such as the Bank and is pursuing a more open policy of welcoming technical
assistance and foreign contractors and consultants from whatever source, to
help make the best use of its resources.
16.       Notwithstanding Iraq's increasing oil revenues, Bank lending to
Iraq is justified,not only because of Iraq's continued low per capita income,
buat also because of the need to provide the Government with the experience
required to use its financial resources more effectively. The Government
is interested in obtaining from the Bank expertise on sector planning and
particularly on project preparation and implementation, including institution
building, which it believes it cannot obtain so well from other sources.  It
is hoped that the demonstration effects of the projects in which the Bank is
likely to participate over the coming years will spread throughout the
economy. Since this involvement in Iraq's development can be obtained only
through direct participation £ii specific projects and since Iraq is credit-
worthy for substantial amounts of foreign borrowing, continued Bank lending
to Iraq on a moderate scale' is justified.
17.       In its lending program for Iraq the Bank proposes to give particu-
lar attention to investment in agriculture, education and transportation.
During the past two years, the Bank has been providing technical assistance
for the preparation of projects in these sectors. The proposed education
project, the Lower Khalis irrigation project which is likely to be presented
to Executive Directors shortly, and the grain storage project which has
already been appraised and is likely to be ready for presentation in the
first half of FY 1973, were prepared with the assistance of the Bank and
the cooperative programs with FAQ and UNESCO. Similarly the Bank is
helping with the preparation of a second roads-bridges project and an
irrigation project in Northern Iraq, which are expected to be included in the
the lending program for FY 1974. Other projects in the agricultural sector
have been identified and preparatory work on them should begin shortly. The
Government's appreciation of the Bank's technical role is further demonstrated
by the request for assistance, which the Bank has agreed to provide, with the



-6-
design, monitoring and evaluation of a comprehensive study of Iraq's land
and water resources. Iraq will bear the cost of the study. Technical
proposals are now being invited, based on terms of reference drawn up with
the Bank's assistance. The Study is expected to start in October 1972.
The Government has also requested similar assistance for a study of Iraq's
tourism potential.
Outstanding Disputes
18.       In recent years the Bank has been approached with regard to
outstanding claims by foreign contractors for works or services contracted
or performed under earlier regimes and has been in contact with the govern-
ment from time to time on this matter. The Government has stated that it
is willing t,o discuss the claims either on a government-to-government
basis or, where this is not feasible, to continue negotiating settlements
with individual firms, under Iraqi law. The Government has stated that
claimants have the right to appeal to Iraqi courts if they are dissatisfied
with the compensation offered. The Bank is not aware of any departure in
recent months from this procedure.
19.       As a result of recent political conflicts and border incidents,
Iraq has expelled about 60,000 Iranians who until recently lived in Iraq,
and who appear thereby to have lost their properties. The Iranian Govern-
ment has represented to the Bank that, in view of these events, it should
not go forward with loans to Iraq. I have replied that on the basis of
the limited information which has been provided this dispute does not seem to
Justify a refusal to lend, but I stated that I would bring the Iranian
Government's view to the attention of the Executive Directors. Iraqi
representatives had earlier informed the Bank that the Government is willing
to discuss the many outstanding issues between the two countries.
PART III - THE SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
The Sector
20.      Several Government agencies have some responsibility for educa-
tional administration. The Ministry of Education has control over secondary
education, which is divided into two levels -- intermediate and preparatory --
each of three years duration, and for primary education. The Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research is responsible for all post-secondary
education. The Ministries of Education, Industry, Communication, Interior
and Labour and Social Affairs are all involved in technical training. A
standing Consultative Committee on Education, composed of high level officials
from the Ministries concerned, advises the Revolutionary Command Council, the
highest executive authority in Iraq, on educational matters.
21.       Total expenditure on education reached 7.1 percent of GNP in 1970
and government expenditure -- all public education is free -- absorbed
16 percent of the budget. While these figures demonstrate the importance



- 7 -
attached to education, they also reflect high recurrent costs per student
at the primary and secondary levels, due to low pupil/teacher ratios and
low teaching loads. Teachers are relatively'well paid and there is no
shortage of recruits to the profession. Without cost-reducing measures
educational expenditures would probably continue to rise more rapidly than
GNP but their relative share may be held at the present level with the
emergence of a coordinated educational plan (see para. 23). The private
sector accounts for only about 5 percent of educational expenditures.
22.       Present enrollment at the 7 to 12 age group is about 65 percent,
falling to 25 percent at the secondary level. Enrollment for girls lags
behind that for boys but attention is being given to correcting this
imbalance.
23.       The educational system in Iraq is being restructured.  The tradi-
tional emphasis on literary and scientific courses at the secondary level
is giving way to emphasis on technical and vocational training to meet
the growth of job opportunities for skilled workers and technicians. At
the same time steps are being taken, on an experimental basis, to replace
the proliferation of small, uneconomic, vocational secondary schools by
introducing comprehensive education, which would permit a wider range of
academic and pre-vocational subjects to be taught and give the student
more flexibility in the selection of his curriculum. Educational tele-
vision will be developed for use in primary and adult education. The
policy guidelines embodying these and other changes emerged from an official
seminar on educational policy in 1970. An inter-ministerial Council for
Educational Planning is preparing a development program based on the new
guidelines.
Project History
24.       The proposed project was identified by a UNESCO/Bank Co-operative
Program mission which visited Iraq in March 1970. Following several visits
by Bank staff, a further Co-operative Program mission helped the Government
to prepare the project. Bank appraisal took place in October/November 1971.
Negotiations were held in Washington at the end of April 1972. The Iraqi
delegation was headed by Dr. Rashid Al-Rifai, formerly Minister of Planning,
and included Dr. Al-Shaikhly, Acting Undersecretary of the Planning Ministry
and Mr. Abdel-Zaidan, Undersecretary of the Education Ministry.
Project Description
25.       As part of its policy to improve the relevance and efficiency of
the educational system, the Government proposes to take certain measures to
meet short-term needs for skilled workers and technicians. The number of
agricultural and industrial technicians under training will be increased
and facilities for training agricultural and industrial workers will be
improved. At the secondary school level, instruction is to be oriented more
towards vocational training.



-8-
26.       The proposed project, the main features of which are summarized
in Annex III, would support these measures. The Project would include the
construction, furnishing and equipping of four comprehensive schools, one
institute of technology at Basrah, two agricultural institutes and five
work training centers. Additional facilities for science teaching would be
provided at 12 secondary schools, for vocational training at 20 intermediate
schools, for technician training at the Baghdad Institute of Technology and
for farmer training at ten agricultural secondary schools. Technical assis-
tance would be provided through 55 man-years of specialists and 46 man-years
of fellowships in various fields, including educational planning, curriculum
development and staff training. Places would be created for about 3,200
comprehensive school students and over 2,300 students in agricultural and
technical institutes. In addition some 17,000 secondary students would
receive better science and vocational training and a large number of indus-
trial workers and farmers would be given new opportunities to undergo short
training courses.
27.       A special feature of the project would be the preparation and
implementation of a detailed program for the development of educational
television to reinforce teaching at the primary level and in adult educa-
tion. The program would support the work of a large number of unqualified
primary school teachers, taking advantage of the extensive geographical
coverage by television in Iraq.
Organization
28.       An Inter-Ministerial Coordinating Committee under the chairman-
ship of the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Education has been established
with overall responsibility for the project. The members of the Committee
will be senior officials from the Ministries of Planning, Higher Education
and Scientific Research, Labour and Social Affairs and Information, and
will include the Director of the Project Unit, which has been formed to
implement the Project. While the Director of the Project Unit would be
responsible for carrying out the Project, the preparation and implementation
of ,the plan for the extension of educational television in primary and
adult education would be the concern of the Director of Educational Tele-
vision in the Education Ministry. Responsibility for procuring educational
television equipment financed out of the proceeds of the proposed loan would
rest with the Director of the Project Unit.
29.       The Government would employ architectural and engineering consul-
tants satisfactory to the Government and Bank for the construction, furnishing
and equipping of the institutions financed under the proposed loan. However,
government architects may be used for designing some of the workshops and
science laboratories to be added to existing institutions.



-9-
Project Costs
30.       The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at $19.94 mil-
lion. An analysis of the costs is given in the Loan and Project Summary in
Annex III. The proposed loan of $12.9 million would cover the estimated
foreign exchange component, or about 65 percent of total project costs.
The estimated capital costs per student place are considered reasonable and
would compare favorably with the cost of similar facilities in other Middle
Eastern countries.
Procurement
31.       Contracts for civil works, furniture and equipment would be
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. A preferential
margin for domestic bidders of 15 percent or the applicable customs duty,
whichever is the lower, would be applied in the comparison of foreign and
local bids for furniture. The furniture industry in Iraq is protected
against foreign competition by import restrictions on items of furniture
similar to those manufactured locally. The Government has given_an
assurance that under the project the necessary permission to import would
be granted promptly if a foreign bidder were to win an award; all notices,
bid invitations and other appropriate bidding documents would carry a
statement to this effect. Should a contract be awarded to a local
manufacturer following international competitive bidding, the ex-factory cost
of such a contract would be financed from the loan.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
32.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Iraq and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, the draft Supplementary Letter on Procurement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The draft Agreements conform substantially
to the normal pattern for loans for education projects.
33.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
34.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Implementation of the 1966 Road Project (Loan No. 457-IRQ) got
off to a satisfactory start but encountered difficulties early in 1969
because of the Government's desire, at the time, to dispense as far as
possible with the services of foreign consultants. Also in 1969, with
the Government's agreement arxi the approval of the Executive Directors,
$4 million of the loan was cancelled, and construction of the Diyala
Bridge and Ramadi-Haditha road added to the Project. Project construction
continued reasonably close to schedule despite damage by flooding to work
on two bridges. In general, the Government has taken an over-
cautious approach to final certification of work canpleted and has thus



Annex I
Page 1 of 2
delayed final payments to contractors and has not sought disbursements
promptly. The composition of the final tranche of road maintenance
equipment to be purchased under the project has now been agreed and its
procurement is underway. The closing date of the loan has been extended
once to September, 1972, but the Govemment should request a further
extension to March 31, 1973, to allow final payments to be processed.
The telecommunication loan (No. 788-IRQ) signed in October 1971
and declared effective at the end of January 1972, is progressing satis-
factorily. Bids for microwave equipment were opened last month and are
being evaluated.
