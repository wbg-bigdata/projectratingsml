MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
FOR A NATIONAL FORESTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed loan of US$9.0 million equivalent
to Malaysia is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be for 15
years including three years grace, at the standard variable rate, and would
help finance a national forestry research and development project.
2.        Background.  Malaysia's forests are among the largest areas of
tropical rainforest left in the world and contain more tree species than any
other ecosystem. The forests are also noted for the high value of the
timber. Malaysia is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of
tropical timbers with annual output of about 36 million cubic meters. Of
this, some 65Z is exported, mostly as unprocessed logs. Export earnings from
forestry in 1986 were valued at M$4.2 billion making forest products the
second largest generator of foreign exchange in the economy, behind petroleum
exports. Forestry exnorts have cushioned the impact of falling prices for
Malaysia's commodity exports. Although direct employment in forestry is only
some 200,000 people or 10% of agricultural employment, indirect employment
generation is much greater. Forestry is the mainstay of the rural economies
of the sparsely populated states of East Malaysia and forestry activities not
captured in employment statistics are central to the Livelihood of indigenous
groups. Timber output grew rapidly between 1974 to 1984 because of strong
demand for logs for export and because of land clearing, particularly for oil
palm establishment. During that decade, Malaysia lost almost 3 million
hectares of forest provoking a greater policy interest in conservation.
3.        Forest conservation has become an important issue as Peninsular
Malaysia would become a net importer of timber by the mid-1990s, if current
logging rates continue, and Sabah has lost its accessible supplies of quality
timber. Part of Malaysia's unique tropical plant and wildlife ecosystems will
disappear in the coming decade unless timely remedial action is taken. The
Government's 1984 National Forestry Act which has been ratified by the States,
aims to strengthen forest conservation through legislation, management and
planning. The Act unifies legislation among States with regard to timber
concessions, tax levels and royalties and makes provision for 14 miLlion ha of
permanent forests to be reserved for environmental protection, research and
sustained production. The trade-off between production and conservation is
likely to become an increasing issue as an appreciation of tne ecological
value of Malaysia's forests becomes more widespread; demand for recreational
and scientific use of these resources increases; and increasing international
attention is paid to preserving tropical forests.
4.        In order to develop and implement a forestry policy with more stress
on domestic timber processing, reforestation, conservation, and regulation of
sustainable harvesting, the Government created a statutory authority called
the Malaysian Forestry Research and Development Board (MFRDB), responsible to
the Minister of Primary Industry, in 1985. The former Forest Research
Institute, a division of the Forest Department, was reconstituted as a



-2-
statutory research body governed by the MFRDB, and became the Forest Research
Institute of Malaysia (FRIM). FRIM's responsibilities are to take the lead in
research into: (a) environmental conservation, (b) rehabilitation of degraded
national forests, (c) reforestation with fast growing species, (d) increased
domestic processing, and (e) to extend its forestry advisory services to state
forest departments and to the private ~ector.
5.        Project Objectives.  The main objective of the project would be to
improve and reorient forestry research and development by strengthening of
PRIM's institutional capacity to carry out an expanded program in ecology,
national forest management, plantation forestry, timb%r processing, economic
and policy issues.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project comprises a five-year
(1987-91) time-slice of FRIM's work program. The time-slice is estimated as
necessary for FRIM to become proficient in new fields of research. Specifi-
cally, the project would fund an agreed program of research and development
activities through the engagement of scientists and experts, on a consulting
basis, to supplement the cadre of 50 professional staff already working in
PRIM. The project would also fund vehicles, scientific equipment, and infra-
structure, including laboratories, office buildings and roads, required to
strengthen FRIM's ability to sustain its R&D program, and staff training. The
research program has been defined in detail and supports the government's
shift in forest research priority away from logging for export to one of con-
servation, reforestation, environmental protection and domestic processing of
timber.
7.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$37.3 million.
Foreign exchange costs would be about US$9.0 million, 24Z of total. A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the disbursement
schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and
the status of Bank operations in Malaysia are given in Schedules C and D
respectively. Staff Appraisal Report No. 6729-MA dated April 27, 1987 is
being distributed separately and includes a map.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank is already involved in
forestry research in Malaysia through support to the Sabah Forestry Technical
Assistance Project (Loan 2550-MA). This project, approved in May 1985, is
providing research results specific to Sabah State and has highlighted the
need for a longer term research program for the whole of Malaysia looking into
comparatively new concerns of environmental protection, reforestation and
forestry economics. Results of the ongoing project are encouraging and
indicate that the Bank can play a substantial role in assisting Government to
address these issues through institutional support to FRIM during its
developmental phase.
9.        Actions Agreed Upon.  The Government agreed to the following
actions: (a) FRIM to recruit department directors by December 31, 1987, and
branch heads by June 30, 1988; (b) FRIM to recruit consultants to assist in
implementing new research and training programs by June 30, 1988; (c) FRIM to
submit to Bank a long-run research plan by December 31, 1988; (d) Government



to engage an expert panel for research review midway through and at the end of
the project.
10.       Justification.  Project benefits include protection of unique forest
ecology, improved management of commercial forestry on a sustainable basis,
increased value-added in the Malaysian economy by local processing and
development of a strong research institution able to provide the technical
basis for forest policy and forestry investment planning. These benefits are
n.ot quantifiable and no rate of return is applicable.
11.       Risks.  The project faces no significant technical or organizational
risks since the existing core staff are experienced researchers and FRIM's
organizational structure has been carefully reviewed by independent forestry
researchers and research administrators. The main risk would be a slower
build-up to full development of FRIM's research program and staffing that
would result from a budgetary shortfall. Government has given assurances that
the project is of high priority and its relatively small size would ensure its
continued and appropriate funding.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
