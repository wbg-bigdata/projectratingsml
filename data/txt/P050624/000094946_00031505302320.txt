A. Program Purpose and Project Development Objective
1 Program purpose and program phasing
I I    The purpose of this Adaptable Program Loan is to ensure the sustainable delivery of adequate
urban infrastructure and services, particularly in under-served secondary towns This will be achieved
through local level capacity building and improvement of urban infrastructure and services in support of
the Govemment of Ghana's decentralization program
1 2    Program scope The World Bank has been involved in the provision of infrastructure services in
Ghana through three recent projects--Urban II and the Urban Environmental Sanitation Project (UESP),
which cover basic urban services in the five main cities, and the Local Government Development Project
(LGDP), which covers basic social and economic infrastructure in 12 secondary towns The proposed
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) seeks to improve basic infrastructure and services in the remaining 25
urban towns, in 23 District Assemblies (DAs) in Ghana, thereby reaching the urban population that has
received least attention in the past by government or donors, and focusing on areas which would benefit a
large percentage of the low income urban population Since the majority of these constitute the weaker
DAs, the APL is designed to launch a phased program of capacity building for the DAs, combined with
physical investments in critical basic infrastructure and services
1 3    Program phasing The program has three phases The first phase will cover 3 years, and the two
subsequent phases will each cover 4 years  The underlying principle of the program is to ensure
ultimately that infrastructure needs are demand-driven from the DAs and reflect communities' needs and
priorities, and that DAs compete for scarce resources In order to reach this ambitious goal, a program of
capacity building is critical to strengthen DAs' financial, management and technical capacities Because
the DAs are starting from such weak positions, the program is phased in such a way that the institutional
strengthening activities, which would be initiated in the first phase and continue and deepen in the
subsequent phases, would be accompanied by a program of physical investments
•  Phase I The objective of the first phase is to strengthen the technical, financial and management
capacities of the 23 participating DAs and finance the provision and/or rehabilitation of some basic
infrastructure It will focus on institutional strengthening and capacity building activities through
training of DA staff and technical assistance in activities such as improving financial management
and revenue generation through mapping, land revaluation and improved financial and accounting
systems This phase will also finance at least one infrastructure sub-project in each of the 25 towns to
enable DAs to go through the process of procuring and managing consultants and contractors for sub-
project preparation and implementation using Bank guidelines (a learnig-by-doing approach) A
profile of the 25 project towns is attached as Annex 11
*  Phase 2  The objective of the second phase will be to strengthen and deepen the capacity building
initiatives from Phase I and provide basic infrastructure for the participating DAs on a demand-
driven and competitive basis  During this phase, the program will be expanded to include 11
additional secondary towns (which are currently a part of the LGDP project) This phase will (i)
continue to provide training and technical assistance, with additional specific training needs provided
to DAs on a demand-driven basis to ensure relevance, and (ii) provide funds for physical
infrastructure investments which DAs will access on a competitive, demand-driven basis, with clear
selection criteria that each DA will have to meet before they become eligible for the funds During
this and the subsequent phase, there will be close monitoring of DA performance improvements
(particularly regarding financial management and own source revenue generation) in order to assess
and strengthen the sustainability of investments
*  Phase 3 The objective of the final phase of the program will be to finance infrastructure needs in all
urban cities and towns in Ghana The scope of the program will therefore be expanded to include the
five metropolitan and municipal assemblies (Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema and Tamale),
-3-



as well as the LGDP towns which were brought in during Phase 2. Funds will be provided on a
demand-driven competitive basis, and each proposal will have to meet the selection criteria. Training
will continue to be provided on a demand-driven basis.
1.4    Since the program will be implemented in three phases, each phase will constitute a "project"
with a separate credit agreement. Any references to "the project" in the remainder of this document will
thus refer to the first phase of the program.
2. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
2.1    The objective of Phase 1 of the program (i.e. the project) is to strengthen the technical, financial
and management capacities of the 23 participating DAs and to finance the provision and/or rehabilitation
of some basic infrastructure.

B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: 17002-GH                Date of latest CAS discussion: September 4, 1997
1.1    Two of the goals of the World Bank's CAS for Ghana are to promote higher private investments
and alleviate poverty. This program will support these two goals by improving basic infrastructure and
services, particularly in secondary towns, and strengthening the management of local governments.
1.2   Since the Government's decentralization policy gives responsibility for management and delivery
of urban services to the DAs, this project will work towards ensuring adequate, efficient and sustainable
service delivery by the DAs. Combined with improving basic infrastructure such as roads, drainage,
sanitation, water supply, transport terminals, and markets (through physical investments), the project also
aims to set the basis for greater private sector activity in these urban centers and improve the quality of
life of the population. Since small and medium cities serve as agricultural marketing and service centers
in support of the rural economy, strengthening the management and infrastructure of these small towns
will provide benefits to both the urban and rural economy in these regions. In addition, a significant
number of the urban poor in Ghana live in secondary towns. By intervening in the urban areas that have
been given the least attention by donors in the past, the project will directly address poverty alleviation.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
2.1    Provision of basic urban infrastructure and services: The most important government policy
related to urban development is the Government's decentralization initiative. Under the Local
Government Act of 1993, Ghana's metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies were given the status
of autonomous local governments with legislative and executive powers within their areas, and the power
to prepare and approve annual budgets, raise revenues from taxes and fees, borrow funds, acquire land
and provide basic services and local infrastructure. To assist DAs in carrying out these functions, the
constitution requires that a minimum of 5 percent of central government revenues be distributed as grants
to the districts annually for capital investments through the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF).
However, investment needs in DAs are far greater than the transfers from the DACF, and DAs' capacity
to deliver on their newly granted responsibilities is weak.
2.2    Staffing of District Assemblies: Currently, DAs do not have full authority over their personnel
management issues. DA staff are appointed through the central civil service with government transfers
covering most of their salaries. Thus, there is little incentive for DAs to use staff efficiently, and needs
are mandated by central government. A Local Government Service Bill is being discussed by
Government currently, which would place civil servants working for local governments on a separate
roster and enable DAs to participate with the Central Government in decision making regarding
recruitment of their staff. However, the Bill has not yet been passed by the Cabinet. Once the Bill is
passed and operationalized, granting full autonomy to DAs to directly manage their own staff would be
the next necessary step in the process.
2.3    Management capacity at the DA level: In order to enable the DAs to provide basic infrastructure
and services and to operate and maintain them effectively, their managerial, administrative and technical
capacity and ability to raise revenues will have to be greatly enhanced. A few initiatives financed by
GOG and other development partners (such as GTZ, KfW and DANIDA) are already under way; these
aim to assist DAs in a few pilot districts to better coordinate local government activities. The European
Union (EU) is providing capacity building support to all DAs primarily through training local government
-6-



officials and councilors. Previous IDA projects have also provided institutional, technical and training
support to participating DAs. These efforts need to be supported and coordinated in order to make a
significant impact.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
3.1    Strengthen capacity of the DAs: The project will strengthen DAs' capacity in the following
areas: (i) supervision of infrastructure works; (ii) operations and maintenance; (iii) resource mobilization;
and (iv) urban planning and management. The project will primarily use the Institute of Local
Government Studies in implementing this component.
3.2   Improve municipal resource mobilization and utilization: The weak capacity at the DA level
results in low billing and collection rates of local taxes, i.e., property and business taxes. The unrealistic
targets, compared to actual revenues and expenditures, make it difficult for municipalities to have a clear
picture of the amount and allocation of their resources. This is a contributing factor to the shortage of
basic urban infrastructure and services.
3.3    Provide infrastructure to improve living conditions: The project will finance construction and
rehabilitation of basic infrastructure in towns in the participating districts that have had limited investment
in the past. A preliminary analysis of the 25 towns has identified the main investment priorities in
infrastructure. DAs will utilize this analysis, as well as their own project preparation skills, to prepare
sub-project proposals and compete for resources from the project on a demand-driven, performance based
basis.
3.4   Improve financial sustainability of project interventions: The project will also attempt to
strengthen DAs capacity to mobilize and allocate funds for operations and maintenance (O&M) of the
infrastructure created. O&M responsibilities for all rehabilitated infrastructure will be clearly outlined
from the outset, with indications as to which aspects are the responsibility of central government, DAs,
and communities, and where possible, cost recovery mechanisms will be worked out. To improve
efficiency, DAs will be encouraged to contract out O&M to the private sector.
3.5    Review of fiscal relationship between central and local governments: CIDA is financing a
fiscal decentralization study which is reviewing the adequacy of central government transfers to DAs in
light of the Government's decentralization initiative, and examining institutional issues such as the
management and reporting structure of fiscal transfers. Based on the results of this study, the project will
finance the implementation of relevant recommendations of the study and/or undertake additional work
that may be necessary.
4. Program description and performance triggers for subsequent loans:
Please see Section I above for program description. The following indicators will have to be achieved
before the project can move to Phase II, and subsequently to Phase III:

C. Program and Project Description Summary
1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):
1.1     The Program  has three phases.  Each of the phases will comprise two types of activities: (i)
strengthening municipal management; and (ii) urban infrastructure rehabilitation and construction. The
objective of the first activity is to improve the level and quality of local public services provided by the
DAs through: (i) studies; (ii) training and capacity building for DAs; and (iii) strengthening of line
ministries' capacities to support DAs. The objective of the second activity is to improve access to basic
services and infrastructure for urban residents of DAs, particularly those in low-income areas, and to
improve the urban environment. Investments in infrastructure and services will be carried out through a
relatively small amount of funds during the first phase (since the emphasis in Phase I is on capacity
building) and upscaling the fund during the second and third phases to include additional districts.
1.2     Training:  Training will be provided DAs' staff in the areas of planning and management,
including (a) contract management; (b) maintenance management (development of maintenance
programs); (c) overall financial management and revenue mobilization; and (d) updating and monitoring
development plans. A particular emphasis of the courses will be to train DA staff in involving
-8-



communities in the planning and development process, especially with regard to formulating development
plans and prioritizing needs
1 3    Capacity building:  Technical assistance will be provided in specific areas to enhance the
planning, management and resource mobilization capacities of DAs in the long run These include (a)
strengthening financial management capacities of DAs through Revenue Improvement Action Plans and
putting in place effective financial management systems, and (b) property revaluation following the
completion of the mapping exercise
1 4    Mapping: Financing will be provided by the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) to produce new
digital and hard copy base maps for all 25 towns and build capacity in the Survey Department, 8 regional
survey offices and the 23 DAs This will improve the availability of information for planners, engineers,
providers of utility services, land valuers, revenue collectors and title registrars The Survey Department
will benefit from technical assistance to be acquired through a twinning arrangement contract and also
from short-term technical and management training and attachments to appropriate organizations
1 5    Infrastructure and municipal services sub-projects  The project will finance infrastructure
investments that meet the following objective to provide/rehabilitate basic municipal infrastructure and
services necessary to improve health and environmental conditions and the economic efficiency of
benefiting communities/locations   Eligible sectors include  (a) water supply, (b) liquid waste
management, (c) solid waste management, (d) access roads and footpaths, (e) storm drainage, (f) security
lighting, (g) markets, (h) lorry parks/transport terminals, (i) community infrastructure upgrading, and (1)
slaughterhouses DAs will, with the participation of community groups, prioritize infrastructure needs of
each town from Town Development Plans They will prepare sub-project proposals which include, inter
alia, justification for the sub-project, number of beneficiaries, evidence of community participation in its
selection, environmental impact statement, O&M requirements and arrangements, as well as relevant
financial data, such as costs and cash flow forecast, DA contributions, O&M costs, and so on The
proposals will be evaluated according to guidelines agreed with the Bank These will include ensuring
consistency with other sector programs, particularly with regard to user fees and charges (depending on
the type of sub-project, the appraisal/evaluation team will include staff of the relevant sector ministry or
agency) and evaluating the consequence/impact of the sub-project (for example, if water is provided,
ensuring that adequate measures are taken to deal with an increased amount of wastewater in the area)
Once sub-projects are evaluated and certified that they meet the set criteria, the DAs will take charge of
sub-project implementation and subsequent O&M requirements
1 6    Co-financing. The Nordic Development Fund will finance the mapping component for a total
estimated cost of US$3 6 million (including contingencies) The Agence Francaise de Developpement
(AFD) will finance infrastructure sub-projects (specifically roads sub-projects) for a total cost of US$6 0
million, including US$1 0 for design and supervision consultants

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
2.1    Local government staffing review:   The responsibility  for recruitment and personnel
management are important for the efficient functioning of DAs. At present, DAs do not have the
authority to hire and fire their own staff. The Government has drafted the Local Government Service Bill
which provides for an independent Local Government Service separate from the general civil service.
When passed, the Act would place civil servants working in local governments on a separate roster, and
enable DAs to participate with the Central Government in decision making regarding recruitment of their
staff. By giving DAs a say in the hiring, promotion and transfer of their own staff, efficiency of staff
management and responsiveness in terms of staffing needs at the DA level are expected to improve. The
passing and operationalization of this act, and any remaining legislature and administrative or fiscal
bottlenecks, will be dealt with as part of the policy agenda under the project.
2.2    Fiscal/financial review: The financial capacities and performance of DAs depend to a great
extent on the nature of the fiscal relationship between central and local govemments. This relationship
determines the level of resources that DAs have to carry out their newly granted responsibilities under the
government's decentralization program and their incentives to improve their own source revenues. CIDA
is financing a fiscal decentralization study which is reviewing the adequacy of central government
transfers to DAs in light of the Government's decentralization act, and examining institutional issues, such
as the management and reporting structure of fiscal transfers. Based on the results of this study, the
project will finance the implementation of relevant recommendations of the study and/or undertake
additional work that may be necessary.
2.3    Monitoring local government performance:  MLGRD  is responsible for monitoring the
performance of DAs, identifying problem areas, providing policy guidance on growth and development
issues, etc. To do this effectively, MLGRD needs to collect data from DAs, particularly financial data,
and monitor this on at least a quarterly basis. To increase transparency and accountability in central
government support of local governments and decentralization, the project will strengthen the local
government finance unit in MLGRD and improve coordination with the Controller and Accountant
General's office (which also collects local government finance data for the Ministry of Finance).
2.4    Land administration: Many investment decisions in districts would involve decisions on land
use (e.g., landfill site, liquid waste disposal site, market, lorry park, etc.). The availability of land for such
-10-



sites and land titling has been a problem in past projects. Pilot studies to review and analyze the land
delivery and titling system have been carried out through previous projects, and a report on the Urban
Land Administration Study published in May 1998 which lays out specific recommendations to improve
the system. These include, commercializing activities of land agencies, establishment of a Land Data
Bank, establishment of a "one-stop-shop" for land registration, and the establishment of a modernized
system of urban planning and guiding development. The project will support the implementation of key
reforms recommended by these studies when these are adopted by the Government.
3. Benefits and target population:
3.1    Residents: The project will benefit the general population in participating urban centers (for 25
towns, a total population of about 964,000). These urban centers contain some of the poorest people in
the country but have received the least attention from government or donor support in the past. Social
and economic benefits will occur through improved access to municipal services. Improved roads will
reduce travel time and vehicle operating costs; improved drainage, sanitation, solid waste management,
and water supply will contribute to better health; increased street lighting will improve safety and
security; and markets and lorry parks will enhance economic activity. The program will also improve the
linkage between the urban population and local governments by promoting more participatory planning
for infrastructure investments, which should lead to more efficient use of developmental resources as
investments would be better aligned with people's expressed needs.
3.2    District Assemblies.  The project will benefit the DAs directly through capacity building,
especially with regard to the management of basic urban services and municipal finances. Improved
capacity for resource mobilization, increased transparency of local finance, more coordination with line
ministries, more locally devolved responsibilities, improved understanding of local priorities and closer
linkages with urban residents will enable municipal decision-makers to make better informed and targeted
decisions on use of resources. Contracting out to the private sector and participation of communities in
the prioritization of urban infrastructure and services provision will improve efficiency and enhance
ownership of infrastructure. It will also alleviate the burden on municipal government and allow it to
focus on planning, programming and managing.
3.3    Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. MLGRD will benefit from additional
technical and professional staff, equipment and other resources that would be required to provide support
to the DAs from the central government level. MLGRD's capacity to monitor local government
performance will be improved.
3.4   Institute of Local Government Studies and other training institutes. The program will utilize
the Institute of Local Government Studies to provide courses and other forms of training for DA staff.
3.5    Local contractors and consulting firms: The program will promote private sector participation in
the provision of local government services by encouraging the contracting out of service provision to
local small and medium enterprises (a policy already endorsed by the decentralization policy).
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
APL Implementation period:        FY 2000-2011 (11 years)
Proposed project--Phase I of APL  FY 2000-2003 (3 years)
4.1    MLGRD:  The key sector ministry responsible for this project is the Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development (MLGRD). The Local Government Project Support Unit (LGPSU)
in MLGRD will have primary responsibility for project implementation.
-11-



4.2   Project Coordination Committee:  A  Project Coordination Committee (PCC) will be
established to provide overall policy guidance and will be responsible for overarching directives and key
decisions to be undertaken in the course of the project. It will also be a forum to discuss implementation
progress and share experience. The PCC, which will meet twice a year, will be chaired by the Chief
Director of MLGRD and will be comprised of the head of LGPSU, representatives of the Ministries of
Finance, Roads and Transport, Works and Housing, Land Valuation Board (LVB), Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), Survey Department (SD), Town and Country Planning (TCP), Ghana Water
Company Ltd. (GWCL), and the National Development Planning Commission (NDPC), as well as
representatives of the 23 participating DAs (the designated Project Coordinators). LGPSU will act as the
secretariat for the PCC.
4.3    LGPSU:  LGPSU  will have primary responsibility for guiding, promoting, facilitating,
monitoring, evaluating and reporting on project activities. LGPSU will manage all project funds,
including disbursements, accounting, auditing, and financial reporting (see Financial Management).
LGPSU will be responsible for procurement and contract management for the capacity building
components (mapping, property revaluations, development of Revenue Improvement Action Plans,
financial management strengthening, (see Annex 2), and will implement and manage the training
component (see ILGS and Annex 2). One of LGPSU's primary responsibilities will be to provide support
to the DAs. This will include:
* Assisting DAs in evaluating DA capacities, identifying training needs, and setting targets
* Assisting DAs in the preparation of realistic District Development Plans, using greater stakeholder
participation (including assisting the Town Councils of the 25 towns covered under the project in the
preparation of their specific Town Development Plans)
• Assisting DAs in analyzing and implementing improvements to their financial management systems
* Providing procedural guidance to DAs in the preparation of sub-project proposals (which should
originate from Town Development Plans)
- Appraising sub-project proposals according to selection criteria and methodology agreed upon with
IDA
* Providing technical support to the DAs in procurement, engineering, and contract management
4.4   In order to effectively build capacity at the district level, LGPSU will establish a field office for
the Urban 5 project to bring its services closer to its clients. The field office will focus on training,
institutional development, and related capacity building issues for the districts in its vicinity, as well as
carrying out the sub-project technical appraisal and providing technical support for sub-project
implementation. The Accra office will provide the same services for the districts in its vicinity. The
Accra office will also be responsible for implementing the capacity building components, managing the
training component, and overall project coordination and management, including financial reporting and
auditing. The need for field office support, as well as the size and skills mix of the Urban 5 LGPSU
team, will be reviewed at the end of the first phase of the APL in light of the increasing capacity built at
the DA level.
4.5    DAs: DAs will have primary responsibility for identifying their training needs and taking action
to fulfill these needs, and for implementing sub-projects. DAs will, with the help of LGPSU, carry out
capacity and training needs assessments, and prepare and implement sub-projects using private
contractors. They will thus be directly responsible for monitoring the technical and financial
performance of sub-projects, as well as the performance of all technical assistance and training programs
provided in that regard. Specifically, DAs will:
* Develop District Development Plans with a focus on Town Development Plans for participating
towns
* Prepare sub-project proposals for funding
* Manage and implement sub-projects (participate in bid evaluations; become signatories for contracts,
review and approve modifications to sub-projects, etc.)
-12-



*  Develop and implement RIAPs
*  Develop realistic annual budgets to implement District and Town Development Plans
*  Develop and implement an effective financial management system
•  Establish O&M funds, prepare annual O&M plans and contract out work to the private sector
*  Identify training needs and request training for staff from LGPSU
*  Recruit technical staff to strengthen their capacities
*  Report quarterly to LGPSU on project implementation progress
4.6   No parallel structure for project implementation will be established at the district level for the
purposes of this project. To be sustainable, project management has to be mainstreamed within the
existing administrative structure of each DA, with training and other technical assistance provided to
directly strengthen project management and implementation functions. Each DA will nominate a senior
officer from its existing staff as Project Coordinator who will liaise with the LGPSU and represent the
district in all areas related to this project. DAs will be free to contract out project management services
such as procurement and project monitoring to the private sector if they are unable to recruit required
staff. DAs will also make their Finance Officers (seconded from the Office of the Controller &
Accountant General) responsible for maintaining project accounts and preparing quarterly financial
reports. These reports will be incorporated in the quarterly project status reports prepared by the DA
coordinators and sent to LGPSU. Sub-project Accounts will be opened for each participating DA which
will be replenished on the basis of replenishment requests submitted by the DA to LGPSU. Payments for
the equivalent of US$50,000 and above and all foreign exchange transactions will be sent to LGPSU for
direct payment.
4.7   ILGS:  A bill was approved by Cabinet in June 1999 establishing the Institute of Local
Government Studies (ILGS) as a corporate body whose objective is to "organize the training of District
Assembly members ... as well as the staff and other personnel in the local government ... to enhance the
managerial, administrative and operational efficiency of the units of decentralized government." The
ILGS will therefore be responsible for the preparation and delivery of training activities under contract to
LGPSU. Training needs will be identified by DAs with the assistance of LGPSU and/or consultants.
LGPSU will then contract ILGS for the provision of the requested training. Specifically, ILGS will:
*  Identify and hire "experts" in their field of specialization to teach courses under temporary contract;
* Identify specific learning outcomes for each course in collaboration with contracted instructor and
requesting DA, and provide a modular curriculum and training guides keyed to these learning
outcomes;
* Identify needed learning aids and ensure that necessary arrangements and logistics are in place;
*  Monitor delivery of training and prepare and implement quality assurance/quality control
mechanisms.
LGPSU will provide overall management of the training system under the project, including processing
training requests from DAs, preparing budgets, contracting and making payments for instruction, and
carrying out training impact assessments (see Annex 2).
4.8   Special Implementation Arrangements for Phase I: This project was originally designed as a
traditional, centrally implemented project to provide infrastructure to secondary cities. Preparation
activities were initiated by the existing LGPSU, including hiring consultants to work with DAs and
communities in prioritizing infrastructure investment needs and carrying out preliminary engineering.
These were almost completed when the project was redesigned to one where sub-projects are to be
demand-driven by DAs and implemented by DAs. This new concept will normally require DAs to select
their own sub-projects as well as contract consultants to carry out the preliminary engineering, and
subsequently the detailed engineering and hiring of contractors.  However, since the preliminary
engineering studies already exist, each DA has been advised to select a sub-project for financing under
Phase I of the APL, each sub-project to be within a US$200,000 budget (see Annex 2). For this first set
of sub-projects only, LGPSU will centrally appoint consultants to carry out the detailed engineering in

one batch in order to expedite the process and provide a concrete sub-project for each DA to "cut their
teeth on." DAs will then take over the hiring and supervision of consultants and contractors for
implementation of the sub-projects. For all other sub-projects and in the future, DAs will be in charge of
feasibility, preliminary engineering, detailed engineering and every other step in sub-project
implementation (LGPSU and/or consultants will provide assistance where needed).
4.9   APL and Project Financing: IDA and co-financiers will provide 90 percent of project financing
during Phase I of the APL and DAs and GOG will provide 10 percent combined. During Phases 11 and
III, IDA and co-financiers are expected to provide about 80 percent and DAs and GOG 20 percent of
project costs. IDA and all other co-financing will be contingent upon provision of DA and GOG
contributions and execution of the annual maintenance program (according to indicated targets) by each
DA.
4.10  Financial Management: LGPSU will be in charge of project financial management. A Special
Account will be opened in the name of LGPSU for the IDA credit, and a Project Account opened for
deposit of Government counterpart funds. The LGPSU field office will operate on anlmprest Account to
meet its administrative expenses which will be reimbursed on a quarterly basis. Two sub-project
Accounts will be opened in each DA when a sub-project is certified by LGPSU. The financial
management and accounting system of LGPSU was analyzed during project appraisal for application of
the Loan Administration Change Initiative (LACI). It was agreed that LGPSU will maintain financial
records in compliance with accepted accounting principles, as is presently done for the on-going LGDP
and UESP projects. Agreement was reached with Government on an action plan to implement LACI
within the first year of project effectiveness. LGPSU will provide interim and annual financial
statements to reflect the financial performance and position of the project. The Borrower will cause
LGPSU to engage independent, external auditors, acceptable to IDA, to canry out annual audits of the
project. Audit reports will be submitted to IDA within 6 months of the end of the fiscal year.
4.11   Release of funds for each sub-project contract will be made by LGPSU only after the DA has
fulfilled the following conditions: (i) opened two bank accounts in a commercial bank, one for IDA funds
and the other for DA counterpart funds; (ii) deposited 5 percent of sub-project cost for Phase I in the
Sub-Project Account; (iii) provided expenditure justification to LGPSU; and (iv) submitted their
Statement of Funds Requirement (SFR) for the first quarter of sub-project implementation. As an
alternative to (ii) above, DAs may authorize MLGRD to deduct, at source, their contribution from their
share of the Common Fund and deposit into the Sub-Project Account. MLGRD will be expected to
deposit the amount deducted into the Sub-Project Account within four weeks of the date of deduction.
DAs will provide mandatory monthly returns of Bank statements, Bank reconciliation statement and
statement of monthly expenditure to reach LGPSU no at later than 15 days following the end of the
reporting month. DAs will also provide quarterly progress reports and requests for replenishment of their
Sub-project Accounts. These will be examined by LGPSU for: completeness, internal financial
consistency, procurement justification, consistency with sub-project proposal, relevant field supervision
reports, etc. Auditors will be hired to undertake audits of financial and procurement compliance and
random physical verification of works in the field with a focus on output.
4.12  Monitoring and Evaluation:  LGPSU  will submit quarterly activity reports covering
implementation progress, financial status, status of each convenant, DA management and component
performance indicators. Independent evaluators will be appointed by LGPSU to assist in carrying out
impact assessments of the project and monitoring performance indicators and triggers at mid-term and
end of the project. Progress will be reviewed at mid term (2002) and project end in workshops with full
participation of all stakeholders. Based on the mid-term indicators, preparation of the second phase will
begin and will be evaluated when trigger targets are reached.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
1.1    The infrastructure needs in the urban centers of Ghana are great. This program is preceded by
three urban projects in Ghana, which dealt with various infrastructure and DA capacity constraints in the
primary cities and the "second tier" cities. Under the previous urban projects five DAs have benefited
from the Urban 2 project and eleven DAs from the Local Government Development project (LGDP).
There are 23 DAs with urban settlements (as defined in the Local Government Act) that have been the
lowest priority in the country's urban development agenda and have benefited the least from donor
intervention due to their small size and remote locations. In the interest of promoting growth more
equitably throughout the country, the Government is keen on supporting investments in all these
remaining urban centers.
1.2    Stand alone traditional infrastructure projectfor 25 towns: The possibility of financing all 25
towns in one project was rejected on the basis of lessons learned from past projects which revealed the
complexities of supervising a centrally managed project in so many towns simultaneously, and the need to
concentrate a critical mass of resources in each town in order to achieve some measurable impact.
1.3    Stand alone infrastructure project for 12 towns: Cutting the scope of the project down to 12
towns only was also discussed with the Government. The Government was reluctant to select only 12,
but agreed on condition that preliminary engineering studies would be carried out for all 25, of which
IDA would finance investments in 12, and the Government would then seek other donor financing for the
remaining 13.
1.4    Program approach: The above stand alone infrastructure project for 12 towns was rejected when
the possibility of taking a program approach through the new Adaptable Program Lending instrument was
accepted as a more viable option. The APL allows the phasing of the capacity building elements in such a
way that investments in subsequent phases can be based upon improved performance of DAs and based
on demand, thus providing incentives for taking capacity building seriously and actually improving
performnance.
1.5    Basic resource transfer mechanism: The possibility of setting up a separate grant system was
considered. However, the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF) is in place through which the
central government transfers 5 percent of the national revenue to the DAs based on a formula which takes
into account factors such as equity, population, and local revenue generation, amongst others. There is
therefore no need to develop a separate grant system. However, a fiscal decentralization study is being
carried out and the project will assist the Government in implementing the findings and recommendations
that are relevant to DAs.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
3.1   IDA has been financing urban projects in Ghana for over a decade. Significant progress has been
made: urban roads have been improved considerably; waste management systems have been established
and are functional in major cities; a number of upgrading schemes have been successful; and inroads have
been made in municipal capacity building, although more needs to be done. This project has built on the
key lessons learned and will address them in the following manner:
3.2    Establishing effective institutional arrangements: There is need to ensure that the agency or unit
given the responsibility for project implementation is also given adequate autonomy to enable it to
function efficiently. The program will focus implementation authority in one ministry, MLGRD, and
build the capacity of the existing Local Government Project Support Unit to provide the necessary
support to DAs. A comprehensive project management system will be put in place to effectively monitor
and coordinate implementation.
3.3    Strengthening capacity of DAs and central government agencies: The implementation of the
Government's ambitious decentralization program has been slow due to weak capacity both at the sector
ministry and the DA levels and in other Ministries. The focus of this program will be on training and
institutional development for DAs as well as MLGRD. The specific actions will build on past support by
IDA in this sector.
3.4   Increasing own source revenues: The fiscal health of DAs can be significantly improved by
maximizing local revenue generation through the preparation and implementation ofRIAPs and using
budgets as a management tool. The program will provide support for the preparation, implementation and
operationalization of RIAPs.
3.5    Ensuring adequate operations and maintenance: There is a need to ensure that proper
institutional and fiscal arrangements are in place to carry out adequate operation and maintenance (O&M)
of the infrastructure created/rehabilitated through the program.  The program  will ensure the
establishment of institutional arrangements for maintenance and setting up of O&M funds at the DA level
for longer term sustainability of the project.
3.6    Reforming local government staffing policy: The centralized staffing policy which places
authority in the civil service to hire staff for DAs needs to be changed in favor of a policy that encourages
DA participation in decisions relating to DA staffing. The project will support Government's initiative to
build an effective separate Local Government Service.
3.7    Continuing donor coordination: The Resident Mission in Ghana and other donors based in
Accra have formed an informal group which meets every quarter to coordinate donor support of the
Government's decentralization program. Project activities will be coordinated with the donors through
these informal meetings.
3.8    Private Sector Participation: Delegating contract management for and involving the private
sector in urban service provision is an effective approach which alleviates the burden on DAs and ensures
better utilization. The project will encourage greater private sector participation in O&M of municipal
services.
3.9    Balanced Growth: There is a need to balance growth (i.e. spread investments) across the country
to avoid overwhelming the primary cities and stimulate regional development. During the third phase of
the APL, the program will be opened so that all 39 DAs with urban towns in the country will be eligible
to participate.
-17-



4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
4.1    Government is keen on getting this program on board as soon as possible. The Minister of Local
Government and Rural Development has announced the Government's commitment to go ahead with the
program in Parliament. Using funds from the on-going Local Government Development Project,
Government commissioned a study by local consultants to assess the development needs and investment
prospectus for the 25 secondary towns which was reviewed and discussed during a project preparation
mission in April 1998. The Government commissioned consultants (February 1999) to undertake
preliminary engineering studies of priority investments, including environmental and economic analyses,
which were reviewed and discussed during the pre-appraisal mission in May 1999. During these
missions, meetings were held with senior officials of all 23 DAs to introduce the demand-driven concept
of the project and seek their inputs in project design. All participating DAs have since then appointed a
Project Coordinator and a workshop has been held to identify training needs and learning outcomes. A
second workshop was held before the appraisal mission where DAs selected their first priority sub-
project.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
5.1   The Bank has a history of involvement in the urban sector, has been the major funder of urban
development programs, and has established a strong relationship with the key government agency,
MLGRD. It is in a position to draw on past experiences and lessons and to address urban issues on a
wide and comprehensive scale. The Bank therefore has a comparative advantage in encouraging
institutional development and long term sustainability, and ensuring the appropriateness of investments.
The European Union (EU) has initiated a capacity building program for all 110 DAs which became
effective two years ago. The proposed program will complement the EU's activities by supporting some
of the weaker DAs. The program will liaise closely with the EU program to ensure consistency and
compatibility of approaches.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
Cost effectiveness    NPV=US$ million; ERR= %
This project comprises two different types of activities: (i) infrastructure and municipal services sub-
projects; and (ii) training and capacity building to support better planning and management of physical
infrastructure investments. Briefly, the project analysis refers to ensuring the sustainable delivery of
adequate urban infrastructure and services through local level capacity building in support of the
Government of Ghana's decentralization policy.
The demand-driven nature of the projects implies that communities will determine the nature and scope
of each sub-project funded. Accordingly, neither benefits nor costs can be completely identifiedex ante.
As such, it is not possible to estimate an ex ante overall economic rate of return (ERR) for the project nor
individually for the variety of potential sub-projects. Eligible sectors for sub-project financing will
primarily include: (a) water supply, (b) liquid waste management, (c) solid waste management, (d) access
roads and footpaths, (e) storm drainage, (f) security lighting, (g) markets, (h) lorry parks/transport
terminals, (i) community infrastructure upgrading, and (j) slaughterhouses. Sub-projects funded under
the APL will, in general, be similar to sub-projects funded under the Bank-financed Local Government
Development Project. Detailed methodology for economic analysis and expected ERRs for the most
typical sub-projects based on the experience of previous urban development projects in Ghana are
included in Annex 4.
-18-



In summary, the economic analysis of roads and drainage sub-projects will be measured in terms of
savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time (under LGDP the actual ERRs ranged from 57 percent
to 110 percent). For markets and lorry parks, ERRs will be calculated by taking into account the
incremental higher fees users are willing to pay for improved facilities (under LGDP, the range forERRs
is between 10 percent and 15 percent). For solid waste management, ERRs will be based on estimates of
willingness-to-pay for services such as the actual (market) user fees charged by private providers (under
LGDP, ERRs were between 24 percent and 32 percent). For liquid waste management, a similar method
resulted in ERRs of 20 percent to 28 percent. ERRs for storm drainage and security lighting will be
based on property damage savings from flood alleviation and willingness to pay for security,
respectively.
A significant percentage of the project will finance institutional development and capacity building.
Although the impact of these are not quantifiable, it is expected that DAs will benefit significantly from
these components. Specifically, DAs will increase their own source revenues, improve their financial
management capacities as well as their capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure investments.
2. Financial (see Annex 5):   NPV=US$ million; FRR = %
Financial policy for sub-projects: DAs are expected to contribute 10 percent of all sub-project costs
which will be paid into the DA Urban V Matching Fund Account as follows: (a) the first five (5) percent
at the time of the contract award, and (b) the remaining five (5) percent three months thereafter. DAs
will also be expected to make a contribution of 3 percent of the sub-project cost to an O&M fund on an
annual basis starting one year after completion of the sub-project. IDA will share 50 percent of the cost
of O&M.  Appropriate user fees and charges will be reviewed and levied for sub-projects where
applicable and will conform to sector practices.
Financial Management System: Financial systems acceptable to the Bank are already in place under
ongoing urban projects. Under a revised project implementation arrangement, the project accounting
staff, who previously reported to the Ministry of Works and Housing, will now report to MLGRD along
with the rest of the project staff. The financial management system will be modified to fit the new LACI
requirements, within one year of project effectiveness.
Fiscal Impact:
A main objective of Phase I is to strengthen the revenue generating and financial management capacities
of DAs. A detailed O&M plan (including sources of financing) will be developed for each sub-project
indicating incremental O&M costs and expected revenues. Evidence of DA capacity to finance O&M
costs will be required for the evaluation exercise before a sub-project can be approved by LGPSU. Since
the project is demand-driven, the types of sub-projects ultimately financed will depend on the needs
expressed by DAs during project implementation. Some sub-projects, such as drainage and access roads,
are public goods for which cost-recovery will not be possible through direct user charges. These will be
covered through property rates. The Revenue Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs) will estimate any
required increases in property taxes as a result of increases/improvements in general services. For
revenue-generating sub-projects, such as markets and lorry parks, user fees will be charged. For sub-
projects in water supply and sanitation, the present government policies followed by on-going water
sector projects (e.g., CWSP-2) regarding user fees and subsidy ceilings will be applied.
-19-



3. Technical:
The main issues are: (i) the choice of technical standards and consistency of standards and cost recovery
mechanisms with other projects in the sector; and (ii) establishment of adequate mechanisms for
operation and maintenance of the facilities built/rehabilitated. The following activities have been
included in the project selection criteria to address these issues and LGPSU will assist DAs to achieve
them: (i) LGPSU and/or consultants will discuss different design options and costs for different sub-
projects with DAs and communities before standards are selected; (ii) the project will liaise with other
projects in the sector (e.g., water, sanitation, roads, etc.) to ensure consistency of technical standards and
cost recovery mechanisms; and (iii) O&M plans for each investment will be worked out at the design
stage, involving to the extent possible, the participation of local communities and the private sector
(especially for sub-projects, such as markets, public latrines and road side drains), and DAs will be
required to provide at least 3 percent of sub-project costs per annum in an O&M fund for the facility.
IDA will share 50 percent of O&M cost.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies:
The sub-projects will be executed using a decentralized approach with key roles being performed by DAs
with community and private sector participation. The current capacities of DAs to implement and
manage urban infrastructure is generally weak but varies amongst the 23 DAs (DAs have some
experience in implementing capital projects using their share of the Common Fund). The project will
provide technical assistance and training for DAs, including a short term training program to be
implemented during project preparation, in the areas of planning, contract management, financial
management, and O&M. The demonstration of adequate capacity to implement and maintain a sub-
project is a pre-requisite for approval of sub-projects by LGPSU. The project will seek to ensure that the
Government's initiatives in creating a separate Local Government Service are realized. However, these
interventions will partially address the capacity problem as the longer term issues, such as improving
salary levels and conditions of service to attract the right calibre of recruits into the Local Government
Service, will have to be addressed through the body given the authority to implement the Act.
b. Project management:
Problems with project management for previous urban projects have been addressed by combining the
staff of the two existing implementation units, the Technical Services Center (TSC) of the Ministry of
Works and Housing and LGPSU, into one consolidated unit under one ministry, MLGRD. Both units
had developed project management capacity through the implementation of two completed and two on-
going urban projects. Finance and accounting systems acceptable to IDA are in place. The financial
management system will be upgraded during the first year of implementation to meet the LACI
requirements.
5. Social:
No significant social risks are expected, since communities have been involved and will
continue to be involved in prioritizing infrastructure needs and selection of sub-projects
in each town. The project is generally expected to have a positive impact as poverty will
be reduced through better access to urban services.
-20-



6. Environmental assessment:                   Environment Category: B
Justification/Rationale for category rating: The project is not expected to have a major adverse
environmental impact. There is no significant resettlement expected in the project. Rather, the project
will improve environmental conditions in the towns.
Each sub-project proposal that comes to the LGPSU for approval and funding will require an
environmental impact assessment or statement to ensure that environmental concerns have been taken
into account and appropriate mitigation measures taken. For example, the final disposal of solid waste
and liquid waste (human waste evacuated from latrines, septic tanks and cesspits) is of particular concern
in the towns, as the most common mode of disposal is indiscriminate dumping at "convenient" locations,
such as fringe areas of the town, lagoons, streams, or the sea. Any project proposals for disposal sites
would be required to be appropriately located and engineered to provide maximum protection to the
environment, specifically with regard to groundwater, drainage, air pollution and odor. The project will
also ensure the establishment of appropriate operational practices for the sites. The project will take into
account the policies and strategies undertaken by the Government and other projects in urban
environmental sanitation to ensure the use of appropriate technical options and consistency in approaches.
7. Participatory Approach (key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced or may
influence; if participatory approach not used, describe why not applicable):
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The first prioritization of sub-projects and preliminary engineering was carried out by consultants with the
full participation of DAs and community organizations. For future sub-projects, District and Town
Development Plans will be prepared using a participatory approach. LGPSU will assist DAs in taking a
more consultative approach to the development of District/Town Development Plans, and other
consultants and/or local NGOs may also be used to facilitate community and stakeholder meetings and
consultations. Future sub-project proposals will be selected only from these plans, ensuring that the
proposals financed respond to community needs and priorities. The project follows a demand-driven,
participatory approach and communities will play essential roles during project implementation.
Technical standards and design options will be discussed with communities (e.g., the width of roads).
Communities and the local private sector will be involved in the O&M of some infrastructure (especially
markets, lorry parks, keeping drains clean, etc.). DAs will be involved in every aspect of project
preparation, implementation and evaluation.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Other key stakeholders include the LGPSU, ILGS, relevant ministries (Local Government and Rural
Development, Roads and Transport, Finance, Works and Housing, National Development Planning
Committee, Controller and Accountant General) and the private sector. They will be part of the
Monitoring and Evaluation process as well as implementation and coordination.

F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Sustainability of investments depends on: (i) ownership of sub-projects by DAs and communities; (ii)
availability of resources for operations and maintenance; and (iii) management capacity at the DA level,
especially for O&M. The project aims to involve DAs and communities in the preparation, design and
implementation to ensure ownership and aims to enhance the management of municipal infrastructure and
services, including improving DA own-source revenues. Involvement of communities and DAs from the
beginning will sensitize them to the need to pay for services where appropriate, and ensure cost recovery.
2. Critical Risks (reflecting assumptions in the fourth column of Annex 1):

Annex 2: Project Description
GHANA: URBAN 5
1.    The Program has three phases. Each phase will comprise two types of activities: (i) strengthening
DA management; and (ii) urban infrastructure rehabilitation and construction. The objective of the first
activity is to improve the level and quality of local public services provided by the DAs through: (i)
studies; (ii) training and capacity building for DAs; and (iii) strengthening of line ministries' capacities to
support DAs.  The objective of the second activity is to improve access to basic services and
infrastructure for urban residents of DAs, particularly those in low-income areas, and to improve the
urban environment. Investments in infrastructure will be carried out through establishing a fund for
infrastructure sub-projects that all participating DAs can access by fulfilling certain conditions and
submitting Sub-project Proposal Forms which have been agreed upon with the Bank. The fund will be
relatively small during Phase I as the focus in Phase I is on training and capacity building, but will be
increased substantially during the second and third phases (second phase to include the 11 DAs under
LGDP and third phase will include all urban Assemblies).
By Component:
Project Component I - US$1.13 million (base cost)
COMPONENT 1: TRAINING FOR DAs
2.    A needs-based system has been designed to systematically and efficiently support capacity
building for participating DAs through training of DA staff in technical, financial, and management skills.
Training will be provided in planning and management including: (a) infrastructure management
(procurement and management of consultants and contractors); (b) maintenance management
(development of maintenance programs); (c) management of privatized contract maintenance; (d)
updating and monitoring development plans; (e) overall financial management; (f) revenue mobilization
and management; and (g) property tax expansion and improvement. A particular emphasis of the courses
will be to train DA staff in involving the communities in the planning and development process,
especially with regard to formulating development plans and prioritizing needs. No set amount of funds
will be "reserved" for a particular DA. DAs will be provided training as requested. Funds for training
will be provided according to training activities actually delivered from within the US$1.13 million
allocated for Phase 1.
Introductory Training Courses
3.    In order to implement the first set of infrastructure sub-projects, DAs will require some key skills.
The project will therefore require each DA to attend short skills training courses which will be provided
prior to project effectiveness (funds to support this activity will be accessed from the ongoing Local
Govemment Development Project). These will include (a) budgeting and accounting (Loan Accounting
Change Initiative); (b) selection of consultants; (c) goods and works procurement; (d) development
planning; and (e) training leadership. A Training Needs Workshop was held in August 1999 to determine
the leaming outcomes for each of these courses.
Training Program
4.     Training to be delivered by the project will be needs-driven, and early training will focus
primarily on supporting the identification, design, and implementation of sub-projects.  LGPSU will
request ILGS to develop at least five courses, identified as the highest priority, during the Training Needs
Workshop. These will include the following two courses that are critical for sub-project implementation:
-27-



(i) civil works contract management (knowledge of requirements and duties of the engineer, the Project
Manager, and authorized representative as set out in contract document five days for each DA engineer
and technical support staff); and (ii) maintenance planning and programming (development and
supervision of DA maintenance program and annual plans development and supervising typical bid
document for maintenance "term or annual" contract: 10 days for each DA engineer and technical support
staff). A list of other potential courses that may be delivered during the rest of Phase I was identified
primarily from inputs from the Training Needs Workshop and are available in the Project Implementation
Manual. These include training for financial, technical and planning staff, and for District Chief
Executives. Curriculum and training materials for the rest of the courses will be developed/adapted as
DAs request them.
5.    ILGS will generally deliver training through two modes.  For professional staff in senior
financial, technical, and management roles, training will be offered primarily through short courses
provided at ILGS, followed by on-the job coaching to help each participant utilize acquired skills in
his/her daily work. For non-professional staff, such as O&M technicians, training will be provided by
ILGS primarily within the participants' workplace. The budget for this component will allow for the
delivery of approximately 50 training courses at ILGS (for an average of 3 days for each course) over 3
years, about 20 days of training at the DA level for each DA per year, plus about 10 days of on-the-job
coaching per DA per year.
Implementation Arrangements
6.    Training will be needs-based in that each DA is expected to determine its own training needs and
demand that training from LGPSU. There will be two Training Administrators within LGPSU (one in
Accra, one in the field office) who will provide overall management of the training system. Each DA will
assign the responsibility of coordinating training to an existing DA staff, who will collaborate with a
Training Administrator within LGPSU in requesting training courses and identifying specific skills to be
strengthened or acquired (learning outcomes). Once needs and outcomes have been identified, LGPSU
will contract ILGS to prepare and deliver the training by hiring "best practitioners" (experts in their field
of specialization, normally from outside ILGS) under short term contracts. LGPSU will be in charge of
carrying out impact assessments of the training provided.
7.     Specific roles and responsibilities of each agency are the following. LGPSU: Each Training
Administrator in LGPSU will, for their respective towns: (a) provide overall management of the training
system, including providing continuing assistance to DAs in identifying training needs; (b) process
training requests; (c) prepare budgets and contracts and make payments within guidelines agreed by the
World Bank; and (d) carry out training impact assessments. DAs: DAs will identify their own training
needs. Once needs have been identified, each DA delegate (or training coordinator) will be requested,
through his/her Chief Executive, to consult with appropriate persons within the DA in order to identify
specific learning outcomes appropriate to each course. This data will then be discussed and agreed upon
at a Training Needs Workshops a,tended by representatives from the DA interested in the course and staff
of LGPSU, ILGS and MLGRD. ILGS: ILGS will be responsible for (a) identifying "best practitioners"
(experts in their field of specialization, normally from outside ILGS) to deliver training courses under
short-term contract; (b) identifying learning outcomes in collaboration with the instructor and requesting
DA; (c) developing modular curricula (one module for one day) and training guides to meet learning
outcomes (it is envisaged that most curricula and training guides will be adaptations of existing materials
which have been developed through previous related projects or initiatives); (d) ensuring that necessary
logistical arrangements (either within the Institute or on site) are made; (e) monitoring the delivery of
training; and (f) providing quality control. Steps a-c will need to be undertaken only once for each
course, as the course will then become part of ILGS's standard course list (though updating may be
necessary from time to time). In recognition of the important role to be played by ILGS, specific learning
resources for ILGS will be provided by the project within an agreed budget.
-28-



8.    Each training activity will require a no-objection from the World Bank. No-objections for the
five pre-effectiveness workshops will be sought in two packages. Budgets for each training activity
(developed by the LGPSU Training Administrators) will follow the following parameters: (a) fees to
instructors (or to any task-specific consultant engaged by ILGS with approval of LGPSU), expected to be
between US$100-120 per day; (b) approved resources and consumables; (c) actual approved expenses of
instructor; (d) actual approved costs of pre-training meeting with requesting DA; and (e) approved costs
of ILGS monitoring of training in the workplace. Where instructors or consultants are hired to adapt
training materials (curricula and training guides), payment is expected to be about US$50 per eight-hour
day and the number of days for adaptation of each product is not expected to exceed 15 days. A model
contract between LGPSU and ILGS for the delivery of training as well as payment schedules have been
developed and are included in the Project Implementation Manual.  In order to contribute to the
development of ILGS as a long-term provider of high quality training, the Institute will receive an
administrative fee of 15 percent of the total approved actual cost of each training activity that it delivers,
which will cover overhead expenses, such as equipment, facilities and operational support.
Performance Monitoring and Triggers for Subsequent Phases
9.    It is expected that at least 70 percent of the targeted days for training and coaching will have been
delivered--this indicator will serve as one of the triggers for moving the project to Phase II. Other
performance indicators related to training include an improved quality of sub-project proposals (with
adequate provisions for operations and maintenance), and satisfactory management and implementation
of approved sub-projects according to the implementation plan. The impact of training on institutional
development and financial management will be monitored under those respective components. Training
will continue in Phase II on a demand-driven basis, and it is expected that 80 percent of DAs will have
trained professionals in key posts and will have adopted participatory means of planning and prioritizing
investment decisions by the end of Phase II (a trigger for moving to Phase III).
Project Component 2 - US$0.92 million (base cost)
COMPONENT 2: STRENGTHENING FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
10.    Technical assistance will be provided in specific areas to enhance the planning, management and
resource mobilization capacities of DAs in the long run. These include: (i) strengthening financial
management capacities of DAs through Revenue Improvement Action Plans and putting in place efficient
financial management systems; and (ii) property revaluation following the completion of the mapping
exercise. These activities will be handled centrally by LGPSU who will manage the relevant studies and
consultants, and will cover each of the 25 towns.
System development and implementation (US$0.57 million)
11.   The DAs' current system of accounting and financial reporting has many weaknesses, including
poor basic accounting skills; cumbersome manual systems which result in a lack of timely production of
financial reports to both the DAs and the center; limited and subjective chart of accounts which does not
identify costs and revenues by activity; and lack of forward financial planning. Comparisons of actual
financial performance against budgets indicate that the actual budgets are unrealistic in many cases. In
the first phase of the APL, an assessment will be carried out of all 23 DAs of their capacity to accept and
support a computerized budgeting and accounting system that will enable DAs to effectively control, plan
and report on all financial aspects of their activities. Not all DAs will be able to install these systems
during the first phase of the project due to lack of electricity, secure facilities or other problems. For
these DAs, support will be provided for improving their manual accounting systems through the two
financial specialists who will be hired in LGPSU. Following the assessment, eight DAs, one from each
-29-



region, will be chosen as pilots for the implementation of the computerized system. This will entail
consultancy support for the installation of a simple computerized budgeting and accounting system in
eight DAs, including the development of: (a) an activity-based chart of accounts; (b) computerized
budgeting and accounting module (with provision for monthly, quarterly and annual reports, accounts and
balance sheets); (c) a single and multi-year budgeting module for recurrent and development expenditure;
and (d) a revenue management module. The approach will build on current initiatives developed under
previous urban projects and will be in two parts. Part I will deal with system design, procedures, manuals
and related training programs (approx. 8 months). Part II will involve pilot testing in eight DAs, related
modifications, and preparation of replication plans and budgets for the remaining DAs (approx. 12
months). The systems will be developed using a standard accounting software package that is supported
in Ghana.
12.   The project will also support the rationalization of the fiscal relationship between central and
local governments. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is financing a fiscal
decentralization study which is reviewing the adequacy of central government transfers to DAs in light of
the Govemment's decentralization act, and examining institutional issues, such as the management and
reporting structure of fiscal transfers. Based of the results of this study, the project will finance the
implementation of relevant recommendations of the study and/or undertake additional work that may be
necessary.
Preparation of Revenue Improvement Action Plans (US$0.25 million)
13.   Maximizing direct DA revenues is considered essential to the successful participation of the
selected DAs in the project. Financial perfornance of DAs has generally been poor over the last 4 years,
and major revenue sources, such as property rates have fluctuated significantly from year to year.
Specific project interventions will focus on property rates with technical assistance for both mapping and
preparation of new valuation rolls, with improved systems for revenue management. In addition,
consultant support will be provided to assist the DAs in preparing and implementing Revenue
Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs) through the project. Each of the 23 DAs will be required to appoint a
RIAP preparation team to work with the consultants. The framework for preparation of RIAPs, prepared
under the on-going Local Government Development Project (LGDP), is available with MLGRD and will
be used as a guide.
Property Revaluation (US$0.1 million)
14.   As part of a comprehensive package of measures designed to improve revenue mobilization and
financial management, this sub-component will provide a comprehensive register ofrateable properties in
each of the 25 project towns to enhance revenue from this source. The program will provide for the
revaluation of all rateable properties in the 25 towns, largely by the private sector, under the supervision
and guidance of the Land Valuation Board (LVB). LVB has successfully completed revaluation exercises
in some DAs under previous urban projects and has developed some expertise for effective
implementation and supervision of revaluation work. Since the LVB will need to develop its capacity to
maintain the Valuation Lists produced in the future, this component will undertake to carry out the
revaluation exercise as well as strengthen the LVB's capacity in the process. The actual revaluation of
properties for rating purposes will be carried out in Phase II of the APL after the mapping component has
been completed in Phase I, and hard copy maps have been made available to the DAs. However, during
Phase 1, some activities will be initiated to set the stage for valuation of properties as soon as the maps
have been completed, including the identification and banding of properties.
15.   Activities. It is estimated that a total of 186,000 parcels are to be assessed under the project
(subject to confirmation following the initial survey). The revaluation of properties in the 25 towns will
be carried out by private valuation firms under the direction and supervision of LVB. The activities will
-30-



include (a) street identification and property numbering (in conjunction with DAs), (b) preparation of
valuation scales, (c) preparation of plans based on maps (see Mapping section), (d) survey of rateable
properties in each DA, (e) valuation of rateable properties in each DA, (f) computer production of
Valuation Lists, (g) deposit of new Valuation Lists with DAs, and (h) maintenance of new Valuation
Lists Based on past experiences with other urban projects, only "high value" properties will be revalued
and the remaining properties "banded" together based on the type of construction, size, and so on, into a
number of groups This would mean that a fixed graduated rate of property tax could be applied to each
property in a particular "band" while the normal levy of a percentage of the value of the property would
be applied to the others It is projected that about 20 percent of the estimated 186,000 properties would
need to be revalued This would considerably simplify the billing and collection system for the DAs
The design of computer systems to maintain the valuation roll will have to be compatible with the
computerized accounting package that will be installed under the financial management component The
process of identification and banding of properties will commence in Phase I  For this purpose, an
estimated amount of US$100,000 has been allocated under this phase
Performance Indicators and Triggers for Subsequent Phases
16    Improvements in financial management and performance of DAs during the first phase will be
measured using the following indicators, which will serve as the triggers for moving to Phase II of the
project (a) annual tax billing rate of at least 60 percent of participating DAs increases to total potential of
tax base, (b) the collection rate for annual local tax bills is over 50 percent, (c) annual routine
maintenance budgets for infrastructure of at least 60 percent of DAs are sufficient to cover the needs
estimated in annual maintenance programs, and (d) the capacity of DAs to provide counterpart funds for
project investment is sufficient to increase from 10 percent to 20 percent of sub-project costs for Phase II
Capacity building and technical assistance will continue in Phase II for towns not covered in Phase I, to
complete the property revaluation exercise, and to deepen the initiatives started under Phase I To move
from Phase II to Phase III, it is expected that the following targets will be achieved (a) annual tax billing
rate of at least 80 percent of participating DAs increases to total potential of tax base, (b) the collection
rate for annual local tax bills is over 75 percent, (c) own source revenue increases by 2 5 percent per
annum in real terms, (d) annual routine maintenance budgets for infrastructure of at least 80 percent of
DAs are sufficient to cover the needs estimated in annual maintenance programs, and (e) DAs maintain
their capacity to provide 20 percent of sub-project costs as counterpart funding
Project Component 3 - US$ 3 43 million (base cost)
COMPONENT 3- MAPPING
17     This component is being co-financed by the Nordic Development Fund  The objective of the
component is to produce new digital and hard copy base maps for all 25 towns and build the capacities in
the Survey Department Head Office, 8 regional survey offices and the 23 DAs so as to improve the
availability of informnation for planners, engineers, providers of utility services, land valuers, revenue
collectors and title registrars This will be carried out in phases over the 11 year APL program period
During the first phase of the APL (this project), hard copy and digital maps will be developed for all 25
towns to be used by the eight professional surveyors located in the capitals of the regions covered by the
project (Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern, Greater Accra, Northern, Volta and Western regions) In
addition, computer-based digital mapping equipment will be installed in one pilot region (BrongAhafo)
to improve its capability
Activities Under Phase I of the APL
18     The following activities will be undertaken under this component, managed by the Survey
Department and supervised by LGPSU (details of specific responsibilities are in PIM)
-31-



(a) Premarking and ground control. Prior to commencement of the aerial photography, the Survey
Department (SD) will mark the urban areas concerned (approx. 750 sq. km) by painting reference
points in order to reduce the survey work to be undertaken after photography. The SD (or
subcontracted Licensed Surveyors hired for this task) will establish the required ground control base
through: plotting existing control points prior to photography and, as appropriate, by photo-point
identification after photography. The pattern of plan and height control points (necessary for aerial
triangulation) will be agreed between the SD and the subcontractor.
(b) Aerial photography and scanning. Under the general supervision of the LGPSU, consultants will be
hired by the SD to plan and fly aerial photography of the towns (1000 sq. km), process films,
produce prints and diapositives, scan the photos digitally, and produce index plots and flight reports.
(c) Digital mapping. Digital line maps are printed maps similar to conventional line maps, but they can
be displayed on computer screens and printed selectively at different scales for urban planning
purposes. Under the general control of the SD, the consultant will observe and adjust the aerial
triangulation of each town as a single block, using a recognized and proven package for block (or
bundle) adjustment. The consultant will notify the SD of any error detected in the ground control
results, and the SD will check and confirm the correct coordinates and photo-identifications. The
consultant will produce samples and preliminary plots of the digital mapping at a 1/2500 scale (area
covered by mapping is approximately 750 sq. km). The SD will carry out quality control and
checking of digital maps and data submitted by the consultant.
(d) Field completion. The SD (or consultants) shall carry out field completion on the ground to collect
names and other information not visible on the aerial photographs.
19.   Technical assistance will be provided to the Survey Department through training arrangements
made by NDF with a member country of the NDF. Services of a contractor will be obtained through
NDF's standard bidding processes to provide 18 person-months of technical assistance in different fields
of surveying, mapping and land titling (including photogrammetry, ground control, digital cartography,
field completion, printing, lathography and others). Other consultants to be hired for mapping will also
be contracted out as NDF-financed contracts, except for pre-marking, ground control and field
completion, which will be carried out by the SD itself or subcontracted in coordination with the NDF-
financed contractors through national consultants. The SD will also benefit from short term technical and
management training and secondments to appropriate organizations. The estimated base costs of this
component is US$3.43 million.
20.   The SD will be responsible for the distribution of the hard copy maps and digital products, and
will be responsible for supporting the mapping needs to all DAs through its eight regional survey offices
which will be managed by qualified staff from the SD. In the first phase (APL I), only the regional
survey office in Brong Ahafo will be equipped with computer-based digital capabilities as a pilot. In the
second phase (APL II), the other nine regional survey offices will also be equipped with computer-based
digital capabilities. While the SD will supply the products of this component to MLGRD and the
participating DAs free of charge, it is expected to publicize these new products to generate revenue for the
department, which should enhance self-sufficiency.
-32-



Mapping Activities for the Second and Third Phases of the APL
21.   During the second phase of the program (APL II), the capacity of the SD will be improved
through equipping it with digital mapping capabilities. A "soft copy" digital production system, which
includes an image production instrument and a photo scanner, will be provided and the existing analogue
photogrammetric systems at the SD will be modified to become fully analytical. The SD will also be
assisted in producing sectional maps for all 25 towns. In addition, based on lessons learned from the
Brong Ahafo pilot, the capacities of the other nine regional survey offices will be improved, through the
installation of simple computer-based digital systems (computer, digitizer, plotter and printer). The
estimated base cost for this phase (APL II) is US$3.0 million.
22.   During the last phase (APL III), the mapping activities will move from just mapping to land
registration. The Land Commission, the Title Registration, the Town and Country Planning and the SD
will work in a coordinated way to develop the process of title registration, again using the two selected
towns in Brong Ahafo as a pilot. The sectional maps produced in the second phase will be developed into
parcel maps to be used in title registration. During this phase, the regional survey offices will be assisted
in updating and maintaining their maps in the computer through undertaking periodic revisions with
support from headquarters. The estimated base cost for this phase (APL III) is US$4.4 million.
Performance Indicators
23.   Performance indicators for the first phase include (i) hard copy maps prepared for all 25 towns;
(ii) digital maps and digital capacity in the regional survey office inBrong Ahafo; and (iii) trained staff at
SD and its eight regional survey offices in digital mapping. Indicators for the second phase (APL II)
include: (i) functional urban digital mapping facilities at SD and its regional survey offices in 10 regions;
(ii) digital maps produced for all 25 towns plus the 12 towns mapped during the LGDP project; and (iii)
trained survey staff at SD and all 10 regions. Indicators for the third phase (APL III) include: (i) area
registration completed for two towns in Brong Ahafo; (ii) on demand registration capability in all 25
towns; and (iii) update mapping programs in all 25 towns.
Project Component 4 - US$12.90 million (base cost)
COMPONENT 4: INFRASTRUCTURE AND MUNICIPAL SERVICES SUB-PROJECTS
Eligible physical investments
24.   The project will finance infrastructure investments that will improve basic municipal
infrastructure and services necessary to improve health and environmental conditions and the economic
efficiency of benefiting communities/locations. Eligible sectors include: (a) water supply; (b) liquid
waste management; (c) solid waste management; (d) roads and footpaths; (e) storm drainage; (f) security
lighting; (g) markets; (h) lorry parks/transport terminals; (i) community infrastructure upgrading; and (j)
slaughterhouses. It is a general requirement that all sub-projects be demand-driven and thus be of highest
priority to the communities at large. This would be demonstrated in the project identification and
planning process which, where relevant, would involve participation of beneficiary communities. The
roads sub-projects under this component would be co-financed by AFD. A sub-project should meet all or
most of the following criteria to be eligible for funding:
*  Support implementation of District/Town Development Plans to facilitate rational and orderly growth
of municipal infrastructure networks or systems.
•  Maximize the efficiency of existing investments in infrastructure and municipal services.
•  Relieve bottlenecks and/or fill strategic gaps in infrastructure and services.
*  Serve as large as possible number of town residents.
*  Target (wherever possible) lower income group beneficiaries.
-33-



*  Provide maximum employment opportunities (i e, sub-projects which lend themselves to use of
labor-intensive construction and mamtenance, within sound economic parameters)
*  Utilize functional least cost planning, design and construction standards while taking cognizance of
the need to minimize future operation and maintenance requirements
Sub-project Cycle
25     Through the capacity building and training components described above, DAs will prepare Town
Development Plans, which will include all main physical investment requirements for that town DAs
will, with the participation of community groups, CBOs and NGOs, prioritize infrastructure needs of each
town from the Town Development Plans They will complete Sub-project Proposals (along a format
acceptable to the Bank) which include, inter alia, justification for the sub-project, number of beneficiaries,
evidence of community participation in its selection, environmental impact assessment, O&M
requirements and arrangements, as well as relevant financial data, such as costs and cash flow forecast,
DA contributions, O&M costs, etc DAs can seek procedural guidance from LGPSU as well as hire
consultants for the preparation of the proposals The LGPSU will evaluate the proposals according to
guidelines agreed with the Bank (an Appraisal Checklist) These will include ensuring consistency with
other sector programs, particularly with regard to user fees and charges (depending on the type of sub-
project, the appraisal/evaluation team will include relevant sector ministry or agency staff) and evaluating
the consequence/impact of the sub-project (for example, if water is provided, ensuring that adequate
measures are taken to deal with an increased amount of wastewater in the area) Once a sub-project is
evaluated by LGPSU and meets the set criteria, MLGRD will provide the funding and the DA will take
charge of sub-project implementation   This will include hiring consultants and contractors, and
monitoring progress, with technical assistance from LGPSU if needed (the Sub-project Proposal Form
and Appraisal Checklist are available in project files and the PIM) The DA will also take responsibility
for subsequent O&M requirements
26     Any proposal may be accepted provided it fulfills the eligibility criteria and the DA is able to fill
out the Sub-project Proposal form adequately, including (a) demonstrating financial, technical and
management capacity to implement the sub-project, (b) meeting the financial obligations of counterpart
funding (10 percent of sub-project costs in Phase I, and 20 percent in Phases II and III) and O&M
funding, and (c) as long as funds remain (funds will be available on a first-come first-serve basis) To
prevent a particular DA from submitting a number of proposals at the same time and thereby blocking
funds, a DA would have to demonstrate that construction progress on the first sub-project is 50 percent or
more before it would receive formal approval for the second sub-project and is able to access fund for its
detailed engineering   Sub-projects will be categorized as small (between the Cedi equivalents of
US$20,000 and US$100,000, base costs) or large (more than the Cedi equivalent of US$100,000, base
cost) Sub-projects costing less than US$20,000 will not be eligible for funding under the project
27    AFD has agreed to finance roads sub-projects at a total cost of US$5 million The procedure will
be the same as for selection of IDA-funded sub-projects AFD roads sub-projects will be financed in
parallel with IDA with no restrictions on the degree of implementation progress of IDA sub-project for
approval of subsequent sub-projects O&M for roads project would be covered under the Road Fund, and
therefore no contribution to the O&M fund will be required from the DA However, the DA will be
required to finance 10 percent of the sub-project cost as for IDA sub-projects
Financial Obligations of DAs
28     DAs will be required to provide a minimum of 10 percent of total sub-project costs  This 10
percent will be paid into the DA Urban V Matching Fund Account as follows (a) the first five (5) percent
at the time of the contract award, and (b) the remaining five (5) percent three months thereafter DAs will
-34-



also be required to set aside at least 3 percent of the capital investment into an O&M fund one year after
sub-project completion and every year thereafter on an annual basis (to be equally shared by IDA).
Special Arrangements for the First Set of Sub-projects
29.    Because the original design of the project was a traditional infrastructure project designed and
implemented centrally, preliminary engineering has already been carried out for priority investment needs
of all 25 towns. A fundamental principle of the re-designed project is that infrastructure will be demand
driven (by DAs and their constituents) and not be supply driven (by central government). Ultimately, this
should apply to the whole sub-project preparation and implementation cycle (i.e., from engagement and
funding of consultants for feasibility and engineering, through implementation and operation and
maintenance). However, since the preliminary engineering has already been done for a number of sub-
projects per town, and in order to kick-start implementation so that DAs will be able to see results on the
ground quickly, each DA will, as a first step, select one of these sub-projects worth US$200,000 or less
for each project town (for a total of approximately US$5 million). DAs will fill out a Sub-project
Proposal Form (with assistance from LGPSU if required) ensuring that all the criteria have been met and
submit this to LGPSU for funding. MLGRD hosted a workshop with all participating DAs prior to
project appraisal to assist DAs in selecting their first sub-project and filling out the Sub-project Proposal
Form. LGPSU will procure and manage the detailed engineering and bid document preparation for this
first set of sub-projects in one batch (the cost for detailed engineering will be funded from the on-going
LGDP). Once the detailed engineering has been carried out, DAs will take over the procurement and
management of contractors and supervision consultants (using Bank guidelines) for the entire
implementation cycle. The rationale for having a different approach for the first set of sub-projects is: (i)
it will give each DA an opportunity to go through the process of procuring and managing consultants and
contractors using Bank guidelines (a learning-by-doing approach) for the actual implementation of a sub-
project (rather than preparation) and enable them to see results on the ground quickly--and thereby give
them an incentive to take advantage of the training and capacity building being provided in Phase 1; and
(ii) it will enable each DA to get a piece of the pie, even if the stronger DAs take a larger share of the
funds in future.
30.    Although the detailed engineering and bid document preparation will be managed and funded
through LGPSU, in keeping with the project objectives, supervision consultants will be procured, and
managed by the DAs. To this end, LGPSU will hold a procurement workshop on consultant selection
following Bank guidelines. DAs, with the support of LGPSU, will prepare the RFPs for the consultants
that they would require for construction supervision of the first set of sub-project contracts. DAs will
then invite consultant proposals, evaluate and select consultants to manage the contracts.
Preparation of Second Set of Sub-projects
31.   In addition to supervising the first set of sub-projects, DAs will also have to plan and prepare
detailed engineering and bid documents for subsequent sub-projects. Although the second sub-projects
will be prepared in Phase I, it is expected that their actual implementation will take place in Phase II, due
to the limited available time in Phase I. As mentioned above, formal approval of the second sub-project
depends on 50 percent implementation progress of the first sub-project. However, in order to ensure
continuity between Phase I and Phase II, DAs will be expected to prepare and issue RFPs, receive and
evaluate proposals and be ready for award of consultant contract prior to achieving 50 percent
implementation progress on their first sub-projects. This will ensure that once the second sub-project has
been formally approved, the contract for detailed engineering can commence immediately, since all the
preparatory work will have already been done.
-35-



Funding arrangements
32    In addition to the US$5 million that will be made available on an equitable basis to all 25 towns,
an additional allocation of US$2 02 million will also be available to DAs for supervision of the first set of
projects and preparation of the second sub-projects Approximately US$5 million will be available from
AFD for roads sub-projects and an additional US$1 million for design and supervision About US$35
million will be allocated by IDA for sub-project investments in Phase II of the APL, and approximately
US$50 million in Phase III with the possibility of additional investment from AFD as well The need for
any caps on the size of sub-projects for Phases II and III will be reviewed at a later stage It will be the
responsibility of DAs to carry out all the preparatory work for sub-projects including engineering designs
(other than for the first batch of sub-projects)  However, the estimated cost of detailed sub-project
preparation may also be included for consideration for funding along with the capital cost of the
investment
Operations and Maintenance
33     To ensure that project investments are sustained, DAs will be required to establish a funding
mechanism and operational procedures and practices at the district level for operation and maintenance of
the infrastructure, service vehicles and equipment to be provided through the project  DAs will be
required to submit a maintenance program and set up a Maintenance Fund as part of each sub-project
proposal The maintenance program will set out, inter alia, the following (a) how the DA proposes to
maintain and operate the facilities provided, (b) the estimated annual O&M costs, and (c) the expected
date that operation and/or maintenance activities for the sub-project are to commence Approval of a sub-
project will be contingent on submission of an acceptable maintenance program (or detailed proposals of
how and when it is to be prepared) and DA agreement to set up the Maintenance Fund (I e, to open an
account and to contribute agreed contributions to the account at the appropriate times) It is expected that
maintenance of infrastructure will be carried out by the private sector under contract to the DA For civil
works, the adoption of term (annual) unit rate contracts for maintenance of various facilities will be
introduced For vehicles and equipment procured for waste collection and disposal, DAs will, when
feasible, lease the vehicles and equipment to private contractors who will provide the services The
contracts will include the necessary safeguards regarding service levels, cost recovery, and equipment and
maintenance standards
34     Actual annual sums required for maintenance, which will determine the level of funding to be
deposited by the DA into the Fund, will be determined in the detailed maintenance program However
the minimum annual sum for sub-project maintenance, which may include building up a sum for
replacement of vehicles and equipment provided under the project, will not be less than 3 percent of the
capital cost of the sub-project per annum IDA will share the cost equally to the Fund each year once the
DA has deposited its own contribution As maintenance of a sub-project would not normally be required
until I year after completion of the sub-project (other than simple routine maintenance such as street
sweeping and drain cleaning), DAs (and IDA) will start making their contributions commencing one year
after the completion of the sub-project The fund will be expected to continue beyond the life of the
project, and DAs are expected to maintain their contributions to the fund to ensure sustainability
-36-

Performance monitoring and triggers
35.    Approval of subsequent sub-project proposals in Phase II will depend on the performance of the
DA in managing consultants and contractors in the implementation of the sub-project according to the
implementation plan, and on whether adequate O&M funds have been provided by the DA for completed
sub-projects. These will be monitored through quarterly Project Monitoring Reports, annual audits and
supervision on the ground by LGPSU as well as Bank missions. By developing the DAs' capacity in
contract management, it is expected that DAs will improve the efficiency of service delivery and
infrastructure management by increasingly contracting out to the private sector. As a trigger for moving
from Phase I to Phase II of the project, 70 percent of civil works and design contracts in participating DAs
are expected to be contracted out (the expected amount will increase to 90 percent of civil works and
design contracts as a condition of moving to Phase III).
Project Component 5 - US$2.02 million (base cost)
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT
36.    The key focus of the proposed project management and implementation arrangements is to enable
DAs to effectively perform their responsibilities with regard to the development of local infrastructure.
The overall responsibility for the implementation of the project will be with MLGRD. The Local
Government Project Support Unit (LGPSU) in MLGRD will provide project management and
implementation support to the DAs. LGPSU will operate with a core team of 8 specialists, 4 in Accra and
4 in the field office, including 2 engineers, 2 finance specialists, 2 training administrators, and 2 planners
who will provide technical, institutional development and capacity building support to DAs. The project
will finance these 8 specialists for a three year period, as well as operational support to LGPSU for
vehicles, equipment, and other operating costs. The position of Project Director (PD) is currently being
funded under the on-going Local Government Development Project. A provision has also been made for
the hiring of a limited number of short-term consultants for specialized support not available within the
core staff of LGPSU and for other aspects of the program, such as the implementation of the Local
Government Services Act, when passed, and implementation of the recommendations of the fiscal
decentralization study. The project will strengthen the capacity of MLGRD to monitor the financial
performance of DAs by facilitating the processing of monthly financial returns and improving
coordination between MLGRD and the Controller and Accountant General in this regard. Any
consultancies that may be required for this purpose will also be financed from the provision for short term
consultants.
37.   In addition, the project will provide a limited amount of operational support to each of the 23
DAs to facilitate the implementation of their sub-projects. This will be in the form of one vehicle, one
motorcycle, and US$3,600 for operating costs for each DA for the duration of the project. This token
support is being provided to give DAs as an incentive to commit their funds for project related activities.
It is expected that once DAs prepare and implement their first sub-project, they will recognize the need
and value in providing the requisite funds for operational support that would enable them to access funds
for additional sub-projects as well as to access the training and capacity building support being provided
by the project on a demand-driven basis.
38.   Currently, all but three LGPSU professional staff are on contract supported by various Bank-
financed projects. In order to ensure that capacity building is sustainable and that in the future MLGRD
will continue to be able to provide support to DAs, the project will require the Ministry to attach at least 3
professional counterpart staff to LGPSU. This will serve as a trigger for moving to Phase II of the APL.
The trigger to move to the Phase III will be that MLGRD attaches at least one additional professional
counterpart staff to LGPSU.

Annex 4: Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
GHANA: URBAN 5
Basic Conceptual Framework: Cost benefit analysis (CBA), and cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) are
two methods of determining the project's economic efficiency. CBA is commonly used to calculate the
net present value (NPV) of a project, which is an indicator of its economic desirability; it essentially
involves estimating the stream of economic benefits of a project from which the project's stream of costs
(during the life time of the project) are subtracted. And to the difference a discounted rate is applied.
Where benefits cannot be estimated, the CEA procedures may be used as an alternative. Cost
effectiveness or cost minimization approach would be more appropriate and will be used when
undertaking an economic evaluation of institutional development and capacity building components. On
the other hand, cost benefit analysis will be used for physical infrastructure investment sub-projects.
Project's Objective: The proposed Adaptable Program Loan seeks to improve basic infrastructure and
services in 25 urban towns, reaching the urban population that has received least attention in the past by
government or donors, and focusing on areas which would benefit a large percentage of the low income
urban population. The purpose of this APL is to support the Government of Ghana's decentralization
policy by providing the framework for institutional development and capacity building for local
governments to ensure adequate urban service delivery and improve basic infrastructure.
Summary of benefits and costs:
Project's Expected Impact:
The program has three phases. The first phase (APLI) will cover 3 years, and the two subsequent phases
(APL2 and APL3) will each cover 4 years. The first phase will strengthen the capacity of local
governments (District Assemblies--DAs) to prepare subproject proposals, mobilize resources, improve
service delivery and improve DAs management. The expected impact will be measured in terms of the
minimum number of staff in each DA capable of carrying out planning, financial analysis and contract
management. Adequate management is expected to include: (i) community participation in development
plans; (ii) adequate provision of O&M for each sub-project proposed and an O&M fund established; and
(iii) implemented changes in the billing and collection systems.
Project's Design Alternatives: The possibility of financing all 25 centers in one project was rejected on
the basis of lessons learned from past projects, which revealed the complexities of supervising projects in
so many towns simultaneously, and the need to concentrate a critical mass of resources in each tow in
order to achieve some measurable impact. Cutting the scope of the project down to 12 towns only was
also discussed. The Government was reluctant to select only 12, but agreed on the condition that
preliminary engineering studies would be carried out for all 25. IDA, it was proposed, would finance
investments in 12, and the Government would seek donor financing for the remaining 13. The above
option was also rejected when the possibility of taking a program approach through the new Adaptable
Program Lending instrument became a viable alternative. The APL allows phasing of the capacity
building elements so that investments in subsequent phases can be based upon improved performance and
demand, thus providing incentives for effective capacity building.
Linkages of Project's Components: In order to achieve the project's objectives, two areas have been
identified as fundamental components of the project. The first component comprises capacity building
and training for planning, local revenue mobilization (the property tax), and involving communities in
the planning and development process. Specific Revenue Improvements Action Plans will be put in
place, and will be linked to property revaluation following the completion of mapping of the core

developed areas. Training and capacity building will support better planning on investments on physical
infrastructure. The second component comprises investments in priority infrastructure. DAs, with the
participation of community groups, will prioritize infrastructure needs of each town from Town
Development Plans. They will be linked through the preparation of sub-projects proposals which include,
inter alia, justification for the sub-project, number of beneficiaries, evidence of community participation
in its selection, environmental impact assessments, as well as relevant financial data, such as costs, cash
flow forecast, DA contributions, and O&M costs. The Local Government Project Support Unit will
evaluate the proposals according to guidelines agreed with the Bank.
NPV Vs Cost-Effectiveness:
Even if a benefit estimate can be based on institutional strengthening programs, experience suggests that
calculation of a single NPV is not necessarily helpful. The benefits associated with effective management
of urban service provision typically far outweigh the cost of institutional capacity building. However, it is
clear that there are different ways of generating the benefits associated with building local institutional
capacity. If an institutional capacity building project costing US$20 million can have a similar effect as an
institutional project costing two or three times that amount, then there is no economic rationale for
investing on the basis of the most costly alternative. The major consideration in institutional valuations,
therefore, is the project cost. This holds true, provided that the different alternatives have similar
expected benefits (i.e., that they have the same chance of success and that, if successful, they will lead to
similar improvements in local management of service provision). An appropriate methodology, and the
approach taken here, is therefore to provide an institutional structure that would be capable of achieving
the potential future benefits but at a minimum cost. This is why the emphasis will be on setting up a well-
trained core team of staff in each district assembly.
Winners and Losers:
In principle, national taxpayers (current and future) will have to bear most of the cost of the project
through national taxes. However, one of the project's targets is to strengthen local government finances,
so that they may be able to contribute to project financing with initially 10 percent and subsequently 20
percent of sub-projects cost. As only a part of the taxes (national and local) will be shifted to the
consumer, the public as a whole would be sharing in the cost of the project. Equally, the nation in general
and the residents (local taxpayers) in the 25 towns in particular would be the beneficiaries of the project
as a whole. Therefore, the cost is being distributed among those who benefit directly and indirectly from
the project and the cost, in principle, is distributed in relation to their fiscal capacities. In this sense the
fiscal burden is directly related to national and local fiscal capacities. Hence, the burden of the cost seems
to be distributed in an equitable manner.
Beneficiaries and Cost Recovery: Whenever the direct beneficiaries of the sub-projects are identifiable
on an individual basis (i.e., the corresponding households), cost recovery policies must in principle be
adopted in order to be eligible for financing. This would be the case primarily of those sub-projects that
are revenue generating, such as water provision, and solid waste collection and disposal. Cost recovery is
expected to make more rational use of these services and contribute to make their provision more cost-
efficient.
Project's Financial Sustainability: The financial sustainability of the project is particularly relevant for
the component comprised by investments in physical infrastructure. Among those investments, the most
critical, regarding their sustainability, are those that are not revenue generating, such as access roads and
footpaths, storm drainage, public lighting (security), and other community infrastructure. As a response
to this need, the project's design includes as a requirement to be eligible to the project's benefits, the
creation of Operation and Maintenance Funds. Also, part of the target is to ensure that O&M Funds

would contract out most of the services needed (See section F of this document on Sustainability and
Risks for more details)
Project's Risks: The project's success, however will depend, among other factors, on (i) the ability of
DAs to retain their staff after training and technical assistance is provided, (ii) the involvement of the
communities on the ownership of the sub-projects, and (ii) the effectiveness of local governments to
mobilize local revenues and establish the O&M funds to insure the sustainability of services provided
(See Section F of this document on Sustainability and Risks for more details)
Main Assumptions
It is being assumed that current needs of urban physical infrastructure will be transformed into effective
demand for eligible sub-projects Also, it is assumed that the training and institutional strengthening of
the first phase of the project will be able to mobilize resources and community participation to identify,
prioritize and support required counterpart financing Furthermore, it is assumed that the expected net
economic benefits of the eligible sub-projects will offer ERRs similar to those generated by such sub-
projects in other urban centers (See illustrative tables including cost/benefit and sensitivity analysis
attached to this annex )
Cost-effectiveness indicators:2
Two main indicators would be the size and per capita cost of the local administration Other quantitative
measures would be focused on the cost effectiveness (i e, the unit cost) of service provision of each
locally provided service For those physical investments taking place during the first phase of the APL,
cost benefit analysis would be applied
Economic Rates of Return
The economic analysis of four specific subprojects are included in the following pages (tables 1 to 4). In
summary the ERR for these four subprojects are as follows
Subproject                          Economk Rate of Return (ERR)

Annex 5: Financial Summary
GHANA: URBAN 5
Local Government Project Support Unit (LGPSU) of the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development (MLGRD)
Overview of LGPSU
Under previous Bank-financed urban projects, two implementing agencies were created which have
developed considerable experience and expertise in project management and World Bank procedures and
guidelines. These are the existing LGPSU in MLGRD and the Technical Services Center (TSC) of the
Ministry of Works and Housing, both of which currently share project management responsibilities for
on-going urban projects. There is adequate capacity in the existing two units to deal with the accounting,
reporting, engineering and technical matters relating to project implementation including the concept of
decentralized project implementation. Under LGDP, in addition to TSC, there were four zonal offices
with planning, engineering and financial officers who provided support to the eleven DAs. Under UESP,
each of the five DAs are responsible for implementation of their components and maintain sub-project
implementation units in their respective DAs in addition to LGPSU at the center. All DAs are responsible
for maintaining their sub-project accounts and preparing and submitting quarterly reports to LGPSU or
TSC which are consolidated into the quarterly project reports.
The present LGPSU has technical staff, such as engineers, planning officers and support staff. The
accounting and financial functions for both on-going projects (i.e., UESP and LGDP) are carried out by
the accounts unit at TSC. To effectively implement Urban V and to prevent overlap of functions, relevant
staff from TSC and LGPSU have been merged to constitute a new LGPSU under MLGRD which is
responsible for all Bank supported urban projects.
Current Accounting Unit
The unit is headed by a professionally qualified accountant and assisted by four additional staff, two
project accountants (partly qualified _ part II of ICA) and two accounts assistants (C&AG staff). They
have been responsible for the implementation of several Bank and other donor-funded projects and are
very familiar with Bank disbursement and other requirements.
The financial procedures designed to implement the previous and on-going projects have been
functioning well and meet the Bank's requirements of adequate systems for transactions recording and
accounting processing. These procedures, as contained in their manual, will be modified to incorporate
the decentralized implementation arrangements for Urban V and its reporting needs.
Revised Financial Arrangements
The Urban V implementation will be decentralized to the DA level; and therefore, the mode of
disbursements and reporting from the DAs will be modified, as deemed necessary, to meet this situation.
A funds flow arrangement and disbursement mechanism was agreed with GOG at Appraisal. These
procedures will be documented in the financial procedures and project implementation manuals.
The procedures to be covered under the financial management section of the financial procedures
manual/project implementation manual will address the financial policies and procedures governing the
project, the preparation of project budgets, the necessary supporting documentation for release of funds,
-47-



the necessary forms and formats and other steps required in the financial administration of the project. In
addition, the financial procedures manual will include changes to the chart of accounts, authorization
procedures on the decentralized basis, and additional reporting for all identified levels. The computerized
accounting system will also be modified to ensure that it can address the Bank's new Project Management
Reporting (PMR) requirements (see PMRs below).
The weaknesses at the DA level in the areas of inadequate skills, insufficient and untimely financial
reporting, lack of forward planning and inadequate supervisory and control oversight over financial
resources will be addressed through the financial management strengthening component of the project
during Phase I of the APL.
Funds Flow Mechanism
Funds under the project will be managed centrally by the finance unit at LGPSU. However, the sub-
project investment component will be fully implemented by the DAs with help from the LGPSU. To
ensure that the DAs are accountable for the implementation, funds will be transferred to them under this
component. Funds for the other components will be managed by LGPSU finance unit.
DAs will follow the guidelines outlined in the Project Implementation Manual to get their sub-projects
evaluated and approved. Funds flow or disbursement mechanism from the HQ to the DAs are as follows:
Steps
I1.    For each DA to be eligible to receive funds it must open a Ghana Cedi bank account, to be known
as the DA Urban V Matching Fund Account and a second account in US dollars called the DA
Urban V Account solely for Urban V project funds. IDA funds meant for the sub-projects will be
lodged in this Urban V Account while the DA's counterpart funds will be lodged in the Matching
Fund Account.
2.    Authorized signatories and specimen signatures must be communicated to LGPSU. It is expected
that there will be two groups of signatories; one group consisting of the District Coordination
Director (DCD), or in his absence, the Project Coordinator (PC) and the other group, the District
Finance Officer (DFO), or in his absence, the Budget Officer (BO) for this project. Two
signatures, one from each group, will be considered sufficient mandate for the release of funds
into, and disbursement of funds from the PBA.
3.    After a sub-project has been approved and when the DA is ready to award contract (which will be
in accordance with agreed guidelines as outlined in the PIM), the DA will prepare their Statement
of Funds Requirements (SFR) for the first quarter of sub-project implementation.
4.    The SFR will be based on contracts signed (or ready to be signed) and termns of payment
contained therein. DAs will submit their funds requirement to the LGPSU for verification and
subsequent disbursement directly into the DA account. Works for which contracts are not ready
will not form part of the SFR.
5.    The SFR will show details of contract percentage amounts being claimed in the first instance, and
for subsequent amounts already claimed and percentage completion to date. A sample form is
attached in Annex A.
6.    The LGPSU finance unit will disburse the funds directly to the DA's accounts, with information
to the officer who submitted the request.
-48-



7.    DAs will, on receipt of funds from  HQ, immediately  effect payment to  various
contractors/suppliers and submit monthly returns on disbursement/expenditure back to the HQ,
either directly to Accra, if they are located in close proximity of Accra, or through the field office.
8.    The monthly returns should include the following statements:
i)    Bank statement
ii)    Bank reconciliation statement (Annex B)
iii)   Statement of monthly expenditure (Annex C)
These are mandatory and should be submitted even if no activity has taken place in the previous month.
Sample formats are attached as annexes.
9.    These reports are to reach HQ no later than 15 days following the end of the reporting month.
LGPSU Field Office
To ensure that the field office operates effectively and provides the needed support to the relevant DAs,
funds will be allocated and will be operated as a revolving fund of Cedis equivalent of US$15,000.
Monthly returns of expenditures will be submitted to HQ. Resources will be allocated and accounted for
with the supporting documentation in line with the following procedures:
10.   The office will open Urban V project bank account for this purpose and provide to the HQ the
details, including the signatories and specimen signatures.
11.   At the beginning of each quarter, the office will prepare a quarterly budget for its operational
activities. This will be in line with their agreed program approved by HQ.
12.   Resources will be released to the office based on their approved budget for the quarter. They will
submit monthly returns to HQ with all the supporting documents for replenishment of the
account. The returns will include: statement of the monthly expenditure; bank reconciliation
statement; Bank Statement for the month and supporting documentation.
External Audit.
The audit of Urban V will be carried out by independent and qualified auditors acceptable to the Bank.
The selection of auditors shall be on a competitive basis and will be in place by effectiveness of the
project. The audit will also cover project activities in the participating DAs.
Project Management Reports (PMRs)
The Bank has introduced a new initiative to change loan administration, the Loan Administration Change
Initiative (LACI). This initiative has been formally launched in Ghana and it is expected that all projects
should comply fully with this new requirement at start of implementation or put in place an action plan to
ensure compliance in 12 to 18 months of commencement of implementation. LACI requires projects to
prepare quarterly project management reports in the areas of finance and procurement, including contract
details and project progress.
The Quarterly Financial Reports will consist of Project sources and Uses of Funds, statement of Uses of
Funds by Project Activity, Project Cash Withdrawals, Special Account Reconciliation statement and a six
months Project Cash Forecast;
-49-



Quarterly Project Progress Report will consist of Output Monitoring Report on contract Management
and on Unit of Output by project activity;
Quarterly Procurement Management Report will consist of procurement process monitoring for goods,
works and consultants' services, and contract Expenditure reports for goods, works and consultants'
services.
Due to the expected new disbursement arrangements involving the DAs and DA contracting and
reporting, Urban V will be unable to fully comply with the LACI-PMR requirements at the start of
implementation. Agreements were reached with GOG at appraisal on the initial reports to be produced
(same as for on-going projects, UESP and LGDP) and an action plan to achieve full compliance in the
first year of implementation.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
GHANA: URBAN 5
Procurement
Guidelines
Procurement will follow the World Bank guidelines for procurement of goods, works and
services; Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (1995 edition, revised in January
1999), and Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (1997
edition, revised in September 1997 and January 1999). Preference for domestically manufactured goods
will be allowed in accordance with World Bank Guidelines. National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
procedures will include: (a) explicit statement to bidders of the evaluation and award criteria; (b) local
advertising with public bid opening; (c) award to lowest evaluated bidder; and (d) foreign bidders would
not be precluded from participating in NCB. Shopping procedures will include inviting in writing for
written quotations from at least three different suppliers, setting a deadline for submission of quotations
and opening them at the same time. For ICB procurement, the project will use Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents for procurement of goods and works. For NCB procurement, Bank's Standard Bidding
Documents for procurement of goods and works with appropriate modifications. For selection of
consultants, the Standard Request for Proposals for selection of Consultants would be used. For small
consultant contracts, other simpler versions of documents acceptable to the Bank would be used.
Procurement Notices
A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in the UN Development
Business and in a National newspaper of wide circulation as provided for in the Guidelines. The GPN
would be updated annually in case ICB procurement would not be completed in the first year of the
project. Specific procurement Notices (SPN) would be required for goods and works contracts to be
procured on ICB and NCB basis and for expressions of interest for consultant contracts exceeding US$
100,000. SPNs would (as a minimum) be published in local newspapers of wide circulation.
Procurement Planning
Except for sub-projects, a global procurement plan covering the entire project period and a
specific procurement plan for the first year of the project showing contract packages, and for each
package its estimated cost, procurement method and processing times until completion (including
bidding documents for items to be procured under ICB in the first year of the project) would be prepared
and sent to IDA for Bank's review and comments before credit effectiveness. By September 30 of each
year, the LGPSU would prepare and submit to IDA, for review and comments, a specific procurement
plan for the following year as part of its annual work program. For sub-projects to be implemented by
District Assemblies, a tentative procurement plan has been prepared for phase one of the project and is
attached to this annex as Appendix 1. No annual procurement plans will be required for sub-projects as
the sub-projects will be generated by the District Assemblies from time to time during the project
implementation period on a demand driven basis. However, the appraisal document of each approved
sub-project will include a procurement plan for completing contract packages under the sub-project.
-51-



Procurement methods (Table A)
Scope of Procurement and implementation arrangements
Procurement under the project will involve the following
(i)     The sub-projects component, estimated to cost US$ 14.52 million, will consist of water
supply, waste disposal, roads and footpaths, stormn drainage, public parking terrinals,
security lighting and other community facilities, such as slaughter houses, public toilets
and markets The cost of the sub-projects is inclusive of works, goods and consultant
services Contracts under the sub-projects would be packaged by DAs and procured
following the procurement procedures specified in the DCA DAs would prepare a
procurement plan for each contract package under a sub-project as it gets approved
The DAs will be responsible for calling for bids, receiving and evaluating bids,
awarding and signing contracts, supervising performance and making payments No
ICB procurement of goods and works is envisaged under the sub-projects in phase one
As part of this component, Agence Fran9aise de Developpement (AFD) will provide
US$5 0 million for road sub-projects (civil works) and US$1 0 million for design and
supervision Individual contracts for road sub-projects would be packaged by DAs and
procured following the specified procurement procedures, including those agreed with
the development partner for this component
(1i)    Goods (excluding those under sub-projects), estimated to cost US$ 0.90 million for
sector strengthening and for supporting project management by MLGRD, will consist
of a limited supply of vehicles, computers, office equipment and miscellaneous items
of supplies and furimture Contracts for these goods will be packaged by LGPSU,
incorporated into the project's procurement plan and procured following procurement
procedures specified in the DCA
(1ii)   Consultant Services and Technical Assistance, estimated to cost US$ 0.97 million,
would consist of systems development and implementation in eight DAs, preparation of
Revenue Improvement Action Plans (RIAPs) and property revaluation Technical
Assistance would consist of consultants providing implementation support to LGPSU
Resource persons required for training programs would be included in the training
packages and not under this component  Contracts for Consultant Services and
Technical Assistance will be packaged by LGPSU, incorporated into the project's
procurement plan and procured following procurement procedures specified in the
DCA
(IV)    Training component, estimated to cost US$ 1 18 million, will consist of training to be
provided to DAs in planning and management  LPGSU would prepare training
packages (as part of the project's Annual Work Plan) and send them to the Bank for
review and comments before they are implemented
(v)     Mapping, estimated to cost US$ 3.60 million, will consist of aerial mapping and
scanning, ground mapping and verification and digital mapping, including associated
capacity building, technical assistance, vehicles and equipment Individual contracts
under this component would be packaged by LGPSU and procured following specified
procurement procedures, including procedures agreed with the Donor for this
component, and acceptable to IDA
-52-



Procurement capacity
Procurement capacity in the LGPSU is adequate while that in the District Assemblies is weak as indicated
in procurement capacity assessment under other Bank-financed projects, to be implemented by DAs. This
fact is recognized in the project design as under the project implementation arrangements, capacity of
DAs would be enhanced by the training programs to be implemented by LGPSU, as well as by use of
procurement and financial procedures to be specified in the Project Implementation Manual.

Prior review thresholds (Table B)
Procurement methods and thresholds
(i)     Contracts for civil works would be awarded on basis of NCB. Goods contracts estimated
to cost more than US$100,000 would be by ICB, contracts estimated to cost between US$100,000
and US$30,000 would be by NCB and below US$30,000 by shopping procedures. Direct
contracting would be allowed only with prior clearance with the Bank.
(ii)    Procurement of consultant services will follow the guidelines. The Bank's Standard
Request for Proposals (SRFP) will be used for all contracts estimated to cost more than
US$100,000 equivalent.

Konongo/Odumase is one of the main commercial centers in the Ashanti Region The presence of the
railway line, which helps in the transportation of food crops cheaply from the hinterland to the market
center as well as timber to feed local sawmills, also enhances the town's role as a marketing center
Mampong-Ashanti, the capital of Sekyere West District is located 5 1km North-East of Kumasi
along the Kumasi-Yeji Trunk Road and lies on the Mampong scarp which has an average elevation of
about 1268 metres above sea level The vegetation of the area is part of a belt of mixed patches of dry
forest and grassland which borders to the north of the rain forest belt to the country The population of
Mampong-Ashanti for 1960, 1970, 1984 were 8,462, 14,990, 22,463 respectively This shows an

1970 and 1984. The town owes its growth and development to the gold mining industry. The major
economic activities in Obuasi are mining, other industries, services, trading and agriculture. According to
the Adansi West District Development Plan, agriculture accounts for 51 percent of the total labor force in
the district. Though agriculture constitutes a major source of income for a large number of people,
industry, specifically mining and its related subsidiary and ancillary sectors provide employment to a
sizeable number of people. Farming has therefore been overshadowed by mining.

Nkoranza are commerce, industry and agriculture. According to the District Development Plan for
Nkoranza District, the predominant occupation in the District is agriculture engaging over 90 percent of

CENTRAL REGION
Dunkwa the Capital of the Upper Denkyira is about 144km from Cape Coast and is located at the
northern part of the Central Region. The area falls within the wet semi-equatorial climate and supports a
moist semi-deciduous forest. Dunkwa had a population of 12,689, 15,437,andl6,905 for 1960, 1970 and
1984 respectively. Between 1970 and 1984 the population increased at a meagre average annual rate of
0.65 percent. The removal of the headquarters of the Cocoa Marketing Board of the Western Region
from Dunkwa to Sefwi Wiaso in the mid 1980s partly accounts for this low population growth rate. The
1984 population of Dunkwa accounted for 25 percent of the population of the Upper Denkyira District.
Trading, agriculture and mining are the major economic activities in Dunkwa. Mining activities are
carried out by private companies such as Continental Goldfields and NEVSUN Goldfields Ltd, who
-64-



employ the local people but operate outside the settlement. Dunkwa is one of the major towns on the
Western Railway line, and this forms an important link with the rest of the country. Dunkwa is linked to
Kumasi, Awaso and Takoradi thus making trading, especially in agricultural produce, viable. As one of
the major markets in the district, it serves as one of the assembling points for agricultural produce. There
are a number of small-scale industrial activities in Dunkwa. These are cassava processing, palm oil
extraction, baking, distilling, dress making and soap making. Mining is also an important activity in
Dunkwa. The people engage in small-scale mining of alluvial gold.

Region. The population of Winneba for 1960, 1970 and 1984 were 25,400, 30,800, and 27,105
respectively. Between 1970 and 1984, the population declined at an intercensal decline rate of about 1.1
percent per annum. Winneba developed as the administrative headquarters of the Central Province of the
Gold Coast and major trading port servicing Agona and West Akim Districts. However, the northward
movement of the trading firms to Agona Swedru after 1940 affected the growth of the town. Winneba,
being a District Capital at the coast was a port town. With the completion of theTema Harbor after the
1960s, the port activities were shut down and all commercial activities moved toTema, thus the decline
of activities in the town. The major economic activities in the district are fishing, farming, trading and
education. The School of Education was established in Winneba in 199?. Pineapple is grown on
commercial basis.
EASTERN REGION
Nsawam, the district capital of the Akwapim South District is located within the Densu Valley
along the main highway from Accra to Kumasi; a distance of about 35km from Accra. Nsawam as a
district capital has experienced fluctuations in population growth. However, the population is now
increasing due to the emergence of a number of manufacturing companies, the status of the town as the
Akwapim South District capital, and the use of Nsawam as a dormitory town by people who work in
Accra.  The population of Nsawam  for 1960, 1970 and 1984 were 20,240, 25,518 and 20,439
respectively. This shows an annual growth rate of 1.9 percent between 1970 and 1984. The major
economic activities are commerce, agriculture, and industry. According to Ghana Export Promotion
Council, the Akwapim South District is the source of about 60 percent of pineapples exported from the
country. With the strong agricultural base, there are a number of agro-based industries at Nsawam; these
include Astek Fruit Processing Industry, AgriPlast Ltd, and Nsawam Cannery. Trading at present
accounts for about 26 percent of the service sector labor force. Increasing interaction with Accra has
boosted the trade and transport sector. However, commerce has generally declined with the diversion of
the Accra-Western Region traffic through Winneba Junction.  Agriculture is the main source of
employment in the District (40.1 percent), followed by trading, services and industry.
Suhum, the Capital of the Suhum-Kraboa District is located in the south-western sector of the
Eastern Region. The major soil type in the area promotes the cultivation of both cash and food crops and

are cassava, maize, plantain and vegetables, while the main cash crops are cocoa and oil palm.
Akwatia is located in the Kwaebibrim District and lies about 9km south-east of Kade which is
the District Capital. The vegetation in the area is basically of the semi-deciduous forest type with
predominantly medium height hardwood tree species. Also prominent are large plantations of teak, which
have been cultivated by individuals and institutions outside theAyaola and Atiwa Forest Reserves. These
reserves cover very large areas of the District. Apart from agriculture, Akwatia is noted for its prominent
mining activities. Ever since mining began in the town, most of the people have engaged in small-scale
mining as a means of earning their livelihood. Mining operations have resulted in the deforestation of
most of the land and this has resulted in soil denudation. Akwatia had a population of 12,177 in 1970,
and 15,000 in 1984. The town owes its growth to the operations of Ghana Consolidated Diamonds Ltd,
which owns and operates a mining concession in the area. This has attracted a number of immigrants into
the area, thus increasing the population. Akwatia is also an agricultural town. Information available in
the 5-year Development Plan for the District indicates that apart from the numerous small-holder farmers,
there are large scale oil palm plantations located adjacent to the mining concessions.

followed by industry (20 percent), commerce/service (15 percent) and public service (5 percent). Akim
Oda is one of the main commercial centers in the Eastern Region, and this is enhanced by its role as the
district capital of the Birim-South District. Many of the outlying settlements depend onAkim Oda for
their shopping needs.
Begoro, the Capital of Fanteakwa District is about 58km to the north-west of Koforidua the
Regional capital. The district mostly has a semi deciduous forest vegetation, but human activities such as

level. Nkawkaw the project town, has commerce as the highest employer of the labor force. As a
junction town, it is one of the main commercial centers in the Eastern Region and this is enhanced by its
location on the Accra-Kumasi trunk road.

URBAN V PROJECT
Programme Letter
MR. PETER HARROLD
COUNTRY DIRECTOR
THE WORLD BANK
ACCA
Dear Mr. Harrold:
The purpose of this letter is to describe the sector policy framework within
which the Government of Ghana (GOG) will work during the implementation
of the Fifth Urban Project to address the development needs of 23 urban
settlements.
Background
Cities and urban towns, as centers of industry and services, contribute more
than half of Ghana's GDP. Urban settlements also play a vital role in rural
development as market and service centers. The severe inadequacy of
urban infrastructure and services such as roads, water supply, electricity,
telecommunications, sanitation, and solid waste management, human excreta
management is a major constraint on the productivity of urban households
and eri(erprises and consequently on both local and national development.
Improving the coverage of urban services requires not only investment in
physical infrastructure, but also major efforts to build institutional capacity in
the fields  of planning, management, finance, and operations and
maintenance.
The Government of Ghana's initiatives in the urban sector over the last few
years include a number of multilateral and bilateral-assisted urban projects,
the provision of incentives for private developers to become involved in
housing, and the provision of some municipal services, such as solid and
liquid waste management.
-69-



GOG is implementing a comprehensive decentralisation programme which is
required by the Constitution of the Fourth Republic and the Local
Govemment Act of 1993 (Act 462). The Act gives District Assemblies (DAs)
the power to "exercise political and administrative authority in the District and
provide guidance, give direction to and supervise all other administrative
authorities in the District". The Act also gives the DAs the responsibility for
"*overall development", "development control", and "the development of basic
infrastructure", "the provision of municipal services", and the "management
of human settlements and the environment", among other activities.
Urban Sector Strategy
The Govemment's urban sector strategy is to: i) continue to improve basic
urban infrastructure and services to increase the productivity of urban
households and enterprises by carefully selecting investments in a
participatory way; iii) improve services to the urban poor through targeted
upgrading programmes, and focusing on secondary urban towns where many
of the urban poor live; iii) make urban service delivery more efficient,
sustainable and relevant to the people through needs based on demand and
competition; iv) improve and make more efficient local government; v)
increase private sector participation in the sector; vi) build human resources
capacity for urban planning and management.
GOG is applying to the World Bank for an Adaptable Programme Loan (APL)
to support the Government of Ghana's urban sector strategy.  The
programme will provide the framework for institutional development and
capacity building for District Assemblies to enable them to meet their
responsibilities of ensuring adequate urban service delivery and improving
basic infrastructure.
Policy Issues and Actions
As part of the programme loan, GOG will address the following policy issues.
Local Government Service Act. (1) GOG will take steps to ensure
that, by the end of the Phase I programme period, at least the
Metropoiitan and Municipal Assemblies have full jurisdiction over their
staff under the Local Government Service Act. (2) The passing of the
Act and a plan for its implementation will be a condition of the
programme and will serve as a trigger to move from Phase 1 to Phase
2. District Assemblies currently do not have direct control over their
staff who presently form part of the Civil Service and therefore report
to central government ministries.  The passing of the Local
Government Service Act would place local government staff on a
separate public service and enable DAs to participate, with a Service
Council, in decision making regarding the recruitment and
management of their staff.
-70-



Fiscal decentralization.  Donor-supported fiscal decentralization
* studies are on-going.  GOG  will present to IDA the key
recommendations of these studies along with a phased plan for
implementation during the program period to minimise the mismatch
between the allocation of responsibilities/functions and funding of the
DAs for their performance.
Key Principles of the Programme
The program will be implemented in accordance with the following principles:
*    Demand-driven approach.  DAs will have the responsibility for
choosing and prioritizing sub-projects, in accordance with priorities in
their Town Development Plans.
*    Community participationlconsultation.   A key objective of the
programme will be greater participation of stakeholders in preparing
and/or updating the Town Development Plans from which priority sub-
projects will be chosen. Training in participatory planning will be
continued through the programme
-    Decentralization of planning, implementation and management of
services. In accordance with the Local Government Act of 1993, the
Ministry of Local Govemment and Rural Development (MLGRD) will
continue to provide the necessary support to the DAs to enable them
to adequately provide infrastructure and services. This includes
continued support and giving the MMDAs greater control over both
financial resources and personnel management functions.
=    Capacity building. Since the success of the urban sector strategy
depends critically on the capacities of local governments, MLGRD will
ensure continued support to the Institute of Local Government Studies
established as a centre of excellence to provide, co-ordinate and
manage training of the staff, Assembly Members, Councilors and
Community leaders in collaboration with other relevant training
institutions that are involved in building capacity of DAs.
*    Financial principles. DAs will contribute towards the capital as well as
O&M costs of every sub-project financed through the programme.
*    Private sector participation. Implementation of sub-projects as well as
O&M will be contracted out to the private sector to the extent possible.

Programme Scope and Phasing
The proposed APL seeks to improve basic infrastructure and services in the
25 urban secondary towns (in 23 DAs)in Ghana which have not been covered
in any of the previous Bank-financed urban projects. The program has three
phases:
Phase 1: The objective of the first phase is to strengthen the capacity
of DAs to prepare development plans, prioritize investments, prepare
sub-project proposals, mobilize resources, improve service delivery
and improve the efficiency and management of the DA through training
and technical assistance. This phase will also provide funds for at
least one infrastructure sub-project in every town. It is expected that
the experience of implementing one sub-project will enable each DA
to go through the process of procuring and managing consultants and
contractors for sub-project preparation and implementation using Bank
guidelines (a learning-by-doing approach).
Phase 2: The second phase will (i) continue to provide training and
technical assistance, and specific training needs for DAs will also be
provided on a demand-driven basis to ensure relevance to the current
needs of the Towns; and (ii) provide funds for physical infrastructure
investments which DAs will access on a competitive, demand-driven
basis with clear selection criteria that each DA will have to meet before
they become eligible for the funds. The second phase will also finance
improvement of the capacities, infrastructure and services of the 12
other secondary towns, currently covered under the Local Government
Development Project.
Phase 3: The final phase will finance additional investments on a
demand-driven basis, where all 37 towns (the original 25 plus the
additional 12) will compete for funding for investments. There will be
close monitoring of DA performance improvements, particularly
regarding financial management, own source revenue generation and
O&M of infrastructure during the last two phases. Training will
continue to be provided on a demand-driven basis.
Programme Financing
The MMDAs funding and the provision of infrastructure and services is
mainly through the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF). This currently
constitutes the main source of funding for DA capital expenditure. However,
this is grossly inadequate to meet the infrastructure and services demands.
The programme will complement the DACF to fulfill the unmet demands in the
secondary and poorer Towns in the Districts.
DAs will provide at least 10% of sub-project costs and make provision for 3%
of sub-project costs of O&M as their matching funds to funding through the
programme. Because a strong focus of the programme is to help DAs to
increase their financial management capacities, DA counterpart contributions
-72-



towards sub-projects will be increased during the second and third phases of
the programme to approximately 15% of sub-project costs.
GOG will provide matching funds to support the program. Total programme
financing is estimated as follows:
(in US dollars)    GOGIDAs             IDA           Total
Phase 1          1.6 m             12.4 m           14.0 m
Phase 2          6.6 m             33.4 m           40.0 m
Phase 3          8.4 m             37.6 m           46.0 m
TOTAL            16.6 m            83.4 m           100.0 m
Program Management and Implementation
MLG&RD has overall responsibility for providing policy guidance and for
project management through its Local Govemment Project Support Unit
(LGPSU).  LGPSU has primary responsibility for promoting, facilitating,
monitoring, evaluating and reporting on project activities. DAs will have
primary responsibility for (i) identifying their training and capacity building
needs and taking actions to fulfil these needs, and (ii) implementing sub-
projects.  The Institute of Local Government Studies (ILGS) will be
responsible for the preparation and delivery of training activities while the
LGPSU will manage all related contract issues.
Yours Sincerely
(KWAMENA AHWOI)
