Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
(a) Reduce the rate of growth of the incidence of HIV infection by 15 percent. To achieve this objective the following strategies
would be adopted:
(i) Improved information for decreased misconceptions about HIV transmission and prevention;
(ii) More effective adoption of preventive measures against HIV;
(iii) Improved facilities for diagnosis, treatment and care of HIV/Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD);
(iv) Improved monitoring and evaluation of HIV and STD infection, diagnosis, treatment and care;
(b) Improve the quality and efficiency of care provided to AIDS patients.
2. Project components:
The project would finance mostly HIV/AIDS- and STD-related health promotion and disease prevention activities, with an emphasis
on the Federal Capital and the Provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe, where 85 percent of HIV cases are concentrated.
The project would also strengthen existing diagnostic, treatment, counseling, and care services in the targeted areas. Finally, it
would support HIV- and STD-related research and development.

3. Benefits and target population:
The project would benefit vulnerable and high risk groups, as well as the general population, by reducing their risk of contracting
HIV. It would target the Federal Capital, Provinces of Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe, where 85 percent of HIV cases are
concentrated, although some activities such as mass communication campaigns would reach the whole country.
Over a period of 10 years the project would:
* avoid between 12,000 to 23,000 AIDS cases, in low effectiveness or high effectiveness scenarios, respectively;
* avoid about 21,000 HIV related deaths and about 700,000 years of life lost due to premature death;.
* improve care for an estimated 85,000 people presently infected with HIV and another 100,000 people which are estimated to
contract the disease over the period of project implementation.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:.
Project coordination and management
* The project would be coordinated by a Steering Committee which would include the Vice-Minister of Health, the Director of the
AIDS/STD program, the Coordinator of Projects financed by bilateral and multilateral agencies and the Project Coordinator.
This committee would ensure integration of the project with the Ministry in general, with the AIDS Program, and with the Bank
health portfolio in Argentina.
* The project would also have a High-Level Advisory Board to assist in building consensus within civil society and ensuring its
participation in the Project.
Project implementation
* The project would be executed by the Ministry of Health (MoH) through a Project Coordination Unit (P.C.U). UNDP will assist
in the procurement of goods and services.
* The primary and secondary education subcomponent would be executed by the federal and state ministries of education (MoE),
with financing and technical assistance provided by the project. To this effect, an agreement would be signed between the
MoH, the MoE and the relevant Provincial MoE.
* Most health promotion, disease prevention and health care subprojects would be carried out as subprojects selected on a
competitive basis from those presented by Civil Society Organizations, including various religious groups, companies, trade
unions, and other institutions which have privileged access to the relevant focus groups.
* Diagnosis, treatment and care subprojects would be selected on a competitive basis from those presented by the MoH,
provincial/municipal MoHs, social security, and private non-profit health care providers which have contracts with the public or
social security sectors.
Project monitoring and evaluation
* The PCU would hire independent consulting firms to regularly carry out (a) financial and management reviews of a sample of
the subprojects and (b) ex-post economic and beneficiary evaluations of a sample of subprojects, under terms of reference to be
agreed with the Bank.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project   CAS discussed at Board Meeting on May 4, 1995, with Progress Report
discussed on April 25, 1996.
The project would:
*  Directly support CAS objectives of enhancing social development in Argentina and improving social services for the most
vulnerable groups in society. It is consistent with the CAS emphasis on institution building, improving the ongoing process of
decentralization, and enhancing the participation of community-based organizations in project implementation. It would also
support other CAS objectives of improving the efficiency of public expenditures.
*  Reduce mortality and morbidity mostly among young and economically active people (ages 0-40), reduce the catastrophic
economic impact of AIDS in lower-income families where the disease is now more prevalent, reduce the expected growth of
health care expenditures due to the AIDS epidemic, and strengthen social services and community involvement.
*  Complement the Provincial Health and Development and Health Insurance Reform Project through the development of a
minimum service level for HIV/AIDS patients.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Main Health Sector Issues
*  Poverty and associated health problems i.e., maternal and child health indicators worse than expected, given the income and
education indicators;
*  Aging population and associated 'epidemic" of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and
injuries;
*  Emerging infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS and resurgence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs);
*  Multiplicity of social insurance and public and private health subsystems adding up to an intricate, inequitable and ineffective
financing and delivery of health services;
*  Need for institutional development in national and provincial Ministries of Health (MoHs) to reinforce their capacity to regulate
and control health care system.
Government Strategy:
*  Rationalize health system, giving more emphasis to ambulatory care and general medical care i.e. family medicine programs
and managed referrals to secondary and tertiary care;
*  Improve quality of care through accreditation of institutions, licensing of professionals, standards, technical assistance and
training, medical auditing and evaluation;
*  Strengthen the maternal and child health program;
*  Strengthen the epidemiological surveillance system;
*  Increase the coverage with the expanded immunization program;
*  Improve food and drug administration;
*  Restructure social insurance-based health care finance and government policy and regulatory capacity (Bank support through
the Health Insurance Reform and Health Insurance TA Projects, Lns 4002/3/4-AR);
*  Modernize the public hospital network and improve the provider payment system;
*  HIV/AIDS and STD Control program.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
AIDS Sector Issues to be addressed by the project:
Epidemioloev of AIDS in Argentina
*  The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Argentina has increased significantly since 1992 and 1993, when for the first time more than 1,000
cases were reported each year, and in 1994 it doubled. By the end of the first trimester of 1996, 8,198 cases had been reported
cumulatively (10,793 cases after correcting for delay in the reporting) or 312 AIDS cases per million inhabitants. According to
the number of reported AIDS cases, Argentina ranks fifth in the continent, located after the United States, Brazil, Mexico and
Canada; according to the cases per population (rate), it is located third. It is noteworthy that these three countries with the
highest AIDS rates in the Americas have significant HIV transmission associated with injected drug users. The sexual
transmission of HIV, excluding secondary cases of injecting drug users, has a pattern similar to that of neighboring countries
(i.e. Chile).
*  The rate for male cases (82% of the total cases) is 383 per million men, while there are 86 cases among females per million
women. Of the total number of reported cases, 74% are men 15 to 49 years of age; 14% are among women of the same age
group.
*  Eighty-five percent of the total cases are located in three geographical areas. The most affected area (ranked by rate) is the
Federal Capital (Buenos Aires City) with a rate of 1,036 cases per million inhabitants (3,096 cases); the second most affected
area is Santa Fe jurisdiction with a rate of 237 cases per million (732 cases) and thirdly Buenos Aires provincial jurisdiction
with a rate of 237 cases per million inhabitants or 3,120 cumulative cases (38% of the total). Of these three areas, the highest

Country: Argentina                                                               AIDS and STD Control - LbSIDA
increase since 1990 was in the Buenos Aires jurisdiction, with 106 cases reported by 1990 and 726 bv 1995.
The majority of cases at the beginning of the epidemic (1982-87) were homosexual and bisexual men (76%), however by 1995
this category represented 26% of the total. Cases among hemophiliacs and blood transfusion recipients have decreased over
time, and in 1996 they represented 1% of the total. Forty-two percent of the cases are injected drug users (IDU); AIDS cases
among IDUs are typically young (63% less than 30 years), and low educational attainment (23% have junior high school or
more). The number of cases among heterosexual individuals is steadily increasing, and in 1995 represented 20% of the total
reported cases that year. A cumulative of 494 cases were newborns from HIV-infected women. Even when the exact figure is
unknown, a significant number of cases in the heterosexual category are the female sexual partners of injected drug users and
their newborns. Because of the difficulties in determining the size of the population of men who engage in same-gender sexual
behavior and of injected-drug users, the rate estimates (cases per population) is unknown. A larger concentration of cases
among IDUs is in the Federal Capital City, and in Buenos Aires province and Santa Fe jurisdictions (92% of cases); while in
these three areas 83% of heterosexual cases and 78.5% of cases among homosexual and bisexual men are clustered.
Government response
*   The federal government is committed to fight HIV/AIDS and STDs. It has established a National Program of Retrovirus, AIDS
and STD Control, including screening blood donors for HIV and STDs, the provision of antiretro,iral and prophylactic drugs
for HIV-infected and AIDS patients and  the control of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The budget of the National
Program increased from USD$8,058,000 in 1994 to USD$19,332,000 in 1996, and is mainly devoted to the provision of
reagents for HIV testing and financing antiretroviral drugs to AIDS patients (98% of the budget).
*  The National AIDS/STD program pays the antiretroviral drugs from the federal budget without participation of the social
security or private insurance systems. A new social security and health insurance regulatory law which is being discussed
includes provisions to address this issue. The predominant way of providing care for HIIV/AIDS patients is through in-hospital
care. However, alternate and more efficient ways for the provision of care are being sought (i.e., through ambulatory and
domiciliary care).
*   The National AIDS Program has devoted only limited resources to the prevention of HIV-transmission. Strict norms for bio-
securitv in blood banks have been issued and have been enforced in major hospitals in urban areas. However, the screening of
100% of blood packages before transfusion and 100% compliance with universal precaution norns have not yet been reached in
all facilities.
*  Many Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) are conducting HIIV/AIDS control activities, and it has been shown that their
involvement with affected communities allows them to provide effective and humane HIV-related services. Also, due to their
conmmunity-based nature, scarcitv of resources, and recent creation, many of these institutions need to develop their institutional
capacity and improve the sustainabilit of their operations.
*   AIDS patients in Argentina suffer discrimination and stigmatization. Their discrimination relates not only to discrimination in
the workplace, but also to the avoidance of preventive interventions, and the provision of inadequate health care senices,
resulting in delay or avoidance of earlv diagnosis and treatment.
Strategic Choices:
*  Public financing, due to the fact that most interventions to be financed by the project (i.e., media campaigns and primary and
secondary education) are public goods with significant externalities.
*  Private/vublic mix in provision of services because high-risk and other focus groups are better reached through the churches and
NGOs, while vulnerable occupations are better reached through company or trade union-based senices, or other CSOs.
*  Health promotion and disease prevention (i.e. mass and targeted communication campaigns; control of blood quality; and
control of mother-child HIV transmission), as opposed to antiviral treatment, because they are more cost-effective, are
affordable and/or constitute public goods;
*  Day care centers and domiciliarv services as opposed to hospital inpatient care, because they are more efficient and provide
more humane health care.
* Targetine: (i.) general public, opinion leaders and decision makers for dissemination of information on the disease and modes
of transmission to the general population to increase awareness, reduce denial and put HIV/AIDS on the agenda of opinion and
decision makers; (ii.) primary and secondary students for general education on FHV/AIDS and STD; and (iii.) focus groups for
behavioral interventions including not only traditional high-risk groups but also vulnerable groups such as women, certain
occupations, prisoners, etc.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
*  Public deliverv of services was rejected because CSOs are often more effective and efficient in delivering HIV/STD services and
because the government already finances HIV diagnosis, treatment and care in both public and private institutions.
*  Financing anti-retroviral or protease inhibitor pharmaceuticals was rejected (except for controlling mother-child transmission)
on the basis of poor effectiveness, low cost-effectiveness, or not being affordable (i.e. US$1.5-2.0 billion per year);
* Vertical vrogram organization, in which activities would be organized and carried out by a federal agency, was rejected due to
the existing decentralization of the health system and because of poor sustainability of,centralized vertical programs.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in proposed project design:
*  Importance of agreeing on performance indicators at the outset of the project, and on an adequate monitoring system. Project
input, process, output and impact indicators, as well as the information sources, were agreed at pre-appraisal, and the project
will strengthen the MoH management information system. A set of 14 agreed Monitoring Indicators is part of the Loan
Agreement's Supplemental Letter.
*  CSO capacity is limited for presenting subprojects, for ensuring the administrative requirements of a typical Bank project and
for maintaining good accounts. When working through CSOs, the need for TA should be anticipated for project preparation and
presentation. The proposed project would retroactively finance TA for subproject preparation (i.e. up to 10% of estimated
project costs). In addition, the PCU will organize or contract launching workshops and offer technical assistance to CSOs which
do not have sufficient technical capacity for preparation and presentation of the subprojects. Likewise, the PCU will provide and
maintain a standard software for accounting and stating expenditures.
*  Single disease projects tend to become isolated in the respective provincial MoH, leading to progressive alienation. Within
projects it is easy for different components to overlap and duplicate efforts. The project would be guided by a steering committee
which would ensure integration with the MoH and the AIDS/STD program. In the third and fourth year of project
implementation, the project would progressively merge with the AIDS/STD program.
*  Bank procurement procedures are often ill-suited for the procurement of condoms, diagnostic supplies, and pharmaceuticals,
leading to shortages and delays. The Project would be assisted by UN agencies (i.e. UNDP, UNAIDS) in the procurement of
such goods, and in contracting consultants.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
*  Establishment of National AIDS/STD Program and National AIDS Council;
*  Passing of an AIDS Law against discrimination in schools, employment, social benefits etc.;
*  Regulation making condom commercialization, sales and marketing more open;
*  Passing of other laws important for HIV control: Blood Law and Transfusion Standards, Biosecurity Standards;
*  Project counterpart fuids available;
*  Diagnosis and treatment of HIV and part of standard prenatal care included in the essential benefits package of both social
health insurance and pre-paid schemes;
*   Social Insurance and pre-paid health care payment system to cover AIDS/STD diagnosis, treatment and care;
*  Ongoing AIDS/HIV mass communication campaigns coordinated by both the GoA and the Catholic Church.
*  Letter of Health Policy addressed to the Bank in September 1996, including a strategy to control the spread of HIV/AIDS and
STDs

12. Value added of Bank support:
Cross country experience:
* The Bank is the largest financier of HIV/AIDS and STD control projects in the world;
* Bank has regional leadership: it developed the LAC Initiative for AIDS and STD control (SIDALAC), and finances Brazil's
HIV/STD control program/project, the largest in the world. A recent mid-term review showed significant impact on the
epidemic and a highly satisfactory project performance;
Analytical capacity: The Bank has authored some of the best economic analysis of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, measuring its impact
on the microeconomy, on specific economic sectors and on the economy in general.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Anmex 8)
13. Economic Assessment (see   3 Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$363      Z Cost-Effectiveness Analysis:       | Other
Annex 4):                         mil.; IERR= 67%                          About 530,000 life-years saved at
about US$56 per year of life
Cost-benefit analysis:                                                     saved
Using a conservative estimate of a 50% project success rate, and estimating a 10-  Cost-effectiveness analysis: The project is expected to
year stream of benefits and costs, the net present value of the benefits (NPV)  prevent about 15,000 HIV infections, equivalent to
exceeds US$360 million, with an internal economic rate of return (IERR ) of  about 530,000 years of life lost due to premature
over 67 percent.                                                        death, at a cost of about US$56 per year of life saved.
Sensitivity Analysis: If the project were delayed by 2 years, the NPV and IERR    This would place the project among the most highly
would be reduced to US$205,057,000 and 38 percent respectively. If the benefits  cost-effective interventions.
were to be reduced by 40 percent, NPV and IERR would be reduced to
US$206,137, 000 and 48%, respectively.
14. Financial Assessment Fiscal impact of recurrent costs (See Annex 5): The burden of recurrent spending generated by the proposed
project on total public health spending is estimated at US$870,000 per year from years 5 through 9, which appears modest in terms of the
US$4.8-billion annual public health spending and within the US$19-million annual AIDS/STD program budget.
15. Technical Assessment: The project is technically justified on the basis of the importance of the problem it addresses, its vulnerability
to cost-effective interventions, the public nature of the proposed interventions, their affordability and the social consensus on the need for
public intervention.
*  Importance of AIDS/STDs: The problem is important due to the growth rate of the epidemic and due to the fact that it is spreading
out of focus groups into the general population.
*  Adequacy of selected interventions: Although the disease is not vulnerable to treatment, the epidemic can be slowed through health
promotion, preventive activities among focus groups, control of blood transfusions, diagnosis and treatment of STDs and HIV among
pregnant women. These are generally recognized as the most cost-effective interventions to control the spread of HIV/AIDS; home
care and day care are perceived by patients as more humane and can liberate beds in communicable disease hospital wards.
*   Justification for public intervention: HIV/AIDS and STD control are typical public goods given: (i.) the externalities involved; (ii).
that the private health insurance and health care system do not adequately cover the necessary benefits and services, (iii.) that it
affects mostly the poor; and (iv.) that it generates catastrophic health expenditures.
*   Affordability: The economic analysis (Annex 4) suggests that the proposed interventions are affordable within the present public
allocation to the health sector.
*   Social value: There is consensus on the priority of HIV/AIDS control among the political body, i.e. the Government, the parliament
health committees, and among other major civil society stakeholders, the church and other CSOs.
16. Institutional Assessment:
Executing agencies: The Government is committed, as can be judged by the letter of health policy, willingness to put substantial
counterpart funds, and fast project preparation process. The Ministry of Health is satisfactorily managing four Bank projects. State
health ministries have been quite effective in implementing Bank projects ( i.e., the Provincial Health Project). CSOs may need technical
assistance to implement subprojects. Such technical assistance would be provided or contracted by the PCU, and budgeted in individual
subprojects. Primary and secondary education on HIV/AIDS and STDs needs the active participation of Federal and Provincial Ministries
of Education. The MoH will sign an Agreement with the National Ministry of Education and Culture and Provincial MoHs will sign an
agreement with LUSIDA.
Project management: The project coordination unit is well organized and staffed. The administrative arrangements are acceptable and
the line managers hired for the PCU have the necessary background and experience. Its work can be judged by the excellent quality of the
project preparatory work. At appraisal, the Borrower presented an Operational Manual (OM) acceptable to the Bank, including the
criteria and procedures for subproject identification, preparation, and appraisal, as well as implementation arrangements and project
performance indicators. The Monitoring Indicators will be part of the Loan Agreement's Supplemental Letter. The PCU will benefit from
the experience and management systems of other Bank projects managed by the MoH, which have been satisfactory to the Bank.
17. Social Assessment: Although a social assessment was not undertaken during project preparation, the main social issues concerned
were identified and the key stakeholders (traditional and non-traditional focus groups, CSOs such as the Church, NGOs, trade unions, etc.
Policy makers, and opinion makers were properly identified, and key sectoral CSOs were consulted. The project will be implemented
through the involvement of CSOs which will be in charge of part of the delivery mechanisms. The participatory activities initiated during
preparation will continue during implementation to inform and mobilize the beneficiaries and their representatives. The project will use
social research techniques and mass and focused media publicity as part of its execution and monitoring. Stakeholder assessments (SA)
with both beneficiaries and CSOs and organizations involved will be conducted periodically.

18. Environmental Assessment:          Environmental Category          C
The project consists mostly of mass and focused communication campaigns, training, and community-based subprojects with no
environmental impact. Refurbishment and equipment of existing laboratories and day care centers will not add significant hazardous
medical wastes. Issues related to hospital hazardous waste treatment and disposal, including those derived from AIDS and STD patients,
are being addressed by the Provincial Health Sector Development project (Ln 3931 -AR).

* CSOs were consulted during project preparation and were involved in defining the eligibility and selection criteria to be used in the
selection of CSO-based subprojects. CSOs will prepare and carry out a significant number subprojects, which are estimated to
account for 20-30 percent of total project costs.
* The Catholic Church is already carrying out a significant number of HIV control programs, was consulted during project preparation,
will be executing a number of subprojects, and will participate in the High Level Advisory Board described in Box 4.
* Academic institutions will be involved in carrying out many training, monitoring, evaluation and research activities related to Part D
of the project.
* Provincial and municipal governments will prepare and carry out most of the diagnosis, treatment and care subprojects, described in
Part C of the project.
* UNAIDS was consulted during project preparation but was not able to contribute significantly to project preparation; its involvement
may increase during project implementation, if it establishes itself more solidly in the region.
20. Sustainability: The Project would be sustainable because:
* The Govermnent is committed to the project;
* The fiscal impact of the project is very modest (See financial analysis)
* The PCU is strong and will merge progressively into the National Program for AIDS and STD control
* Major stakeholders in civil society will be involved in project oversight.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects
The use of condoms and syringe swaps for drug users is important for achievement of development objectives. The Argentinean
Catholic Church has had a conservative stance on both issues, but has recently shifted towards a more tolerant view on both issues.

Detailed Project Description
Project Objectives and Description
The objectives of the Project are to reduce the rate of growth of the incidence of HIV infection, and to
improve the quality and efficiency of care provided to AIDS patients.
The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such modifications thereof as the Borrower and the
Bank may agree upon from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A: Health Promotion (US 12.5 million: 42 percent of total project costs)
Carrying out of Subprojects in the Participating Provinces and the City of Buenos Aires to increase the
knowledge of the population about the transmission and prevention of HIV/AIDS and STDs, and to reduce the
social discrimination against HIV/AIDS patients, including:
(1) design, production, distribution, and diffusion of mass- and targeted communication campaigns; and
(2) education on HIV/AIDS in primary and secondary schools, including the development of educational materials,
the training of teachers, and the preparation and execution of school-based participatory activities.
Part B: Prevention of HIV and STD Transmission (US$7.3 million: 24 percent of total project costs)
Carrying out of Subprojects, selected on a competitive basis, in the Participating Provinces and the City of
Buenos Aires to reduce the spread of HIV and STDs through increasing the proportion of the population at high
risk that adopts preventive measures, to reduce the transmission of HIV through transfusion of blood and other
biological products, and to reduce the mother-child transmission of HIV and syphilis, including:
(1)    prevention activities for specific high-risk focus groups organized by CSOs and other elements of
civil society (e.g. church groups, local community groups, companies or trade unions);
(2)    improved blood quality control through equipping and training of staff in blood banks where the
quality of blood is not yet filly ensured; and
(3)    review and, if necessary, revision of routine prenatal care standards to include the diagnosis and
treatment of HIV in pregnant women. Introduction by the Participating Provinces, Municipalities or other entities
that provide medical care to people without insurance coverage, of the diagnosis and treatment of HIV in pregnant
women as part of the standard prenatal care package; and review of and, if necessary, preparation of draft
amendments to legislation to include diagnosis and treatment of HIV in pregnant women in the package of
essential services to be covered by government health services by the social insurance system and by pre-paid
health services.
Part C: Diagnosis. Treatment and Care of HIV Infection and STDs (US$6.5 million: 21.7 percent of total project
costs
Carrying out of Subprojects, selected on a competitive basis, in the Participating Provinces and the City of
Buenos Aires to improve the quality and efficiency of the diagnosis, treatment, counseling and care provided for
HIV and STDs by reducing the number of hospital admissions per patient and the average length of hospital stay,
including:
(1) establishment by Participating Provinces, Municipalities or other entities that provide medical care to
people without insurance coverage, of anonymous diagnostic centers and, as deemed necessary by the Borrower,
care centers for HIV/AIDS orphans and hospice care;

Internal Economic Rate of Return                                                67 %
Main Assumptions:
The economic analysis is based on a stream of benefits and costs estimated over a ten-year period. The main assumptions
include: (i) 85,000 people currently infected with HIV as of 1996; (ii) an estimated 10,000 new cases per year; (iii) an
average 35 healthy years lost per case; (iv) gross domestic production of US$8,000 per person; (v) sixty percent of the AIDS
cases occur among the productive population; (vi) discount rate of eight percent; (vii) average cost per case over a 9 year
period of US$105,000 based on cost studies carried by the Argentine Ministry of Health; (viii) and estimated 40 percent of
the infected population receiving adequate treatment; and (ix) 30 percent reduction in new AIDS cases over a ten year
period.
There are two reasons for selecting an 8% discount rate for the LUSIDA project, a little lower than what would be
appropriate for a private investment project. First, the highly redistributional nature of the project, demonstrated by a high
proportion of the target population in the lowest 40 percent of the income distribution. And, second, the public goods
nature of the investment, discussed elsewhere in the chapter, provides a justification for a discount rate different from the
discount rate traditionally assumed for investments where the output is a private consumption good. Based on these
considerations and extended conversations with Argentinean economists, a discount rate of 8 percent was chosen for the
project.
Nonetheless, the analysis was also repeated using a 10 percent discount rate in order to ensure that the project remained
viable. Estimates with the ten percent discount rate show that the net present value (NPV) of the project (benefits minus
costs) would be reduced to just over $210 million with an estimated IERR of 52 percent.
Benefits presented are based on the conservative estimate of a 50 percent success rate in achieving the expected reduction in
new AIDS cases.
Switching values of critical items:
Given the high IERR for the project and the low initial and recurrent investment required, the critical switching values
depend almost entirely on the two cases analyzed in the section of the paper on 'Risk and Sensitivity Analysis", available in
the project files. The second element which would 'switch" the results of the analysis would be a lower than expected
reduction in the number of new AIDS cases. This has been mitigated by using a conservative 50 percent of the reduction
estimated by experts in the field and experience in similar projects in the United States.

total Ministry Spending.
Note: GDP growth estimates are based on the Argentina CAS: 3% for the period 1996-98 and 5%1999-2003
The estimates assume that the recurrent expenditures of the project will be generated by annual maintenance costs of 5 percent per
year and an annual depreciation cost of 10 percent per year. Upon project termination the estimated recurrent costs will account for
US$870,000 per year. The table displays the recurrent expenditures as a share of total central government spending on health,
provincial government spending, Municipal government spending, and, lastly, as a share of total Ministry of Health spending on
health.  This analysis does not consider the spending through the social security system or through the private sector, as it is
estimated that the ministry will continue to assume the majority of the spending on AIDS given the public goods nature of AIDS
spending.
The assumptions include: annual health care spending increases equal to the projected growth of GDP; that is, it is assumed that
public health spending will continue to account for approximately 1.7 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Based on these
estimates, the following table compares the recurrent expenditures generated by the project with the estimated public health
spending.
Estimated recurrent expenditures for the project are projected to decrease from 0.12 to 0.10 percent of total central government
health spending. Comparing the estimated recurrent cost burden of the project with the projected provincial government spending,
the estimated recurrent expenditures would account for only 0.02% of provincial expenditures. Given the proposed strengthening of
the public health system, particularly with respect to increases in provincial spending, it is probable that the 0.02 percent of recurrent
spending would be even lower assuming increases in public health spending. Overall, the recurrent cost burden would amount to
just under 0.015% of total public sector spending by year ten.
In order to test the sensitivity of these estimates to spending growth estimates an alternative scenario was also analyzed assuming
that public spending on health grows at just a half a percentage point faster than GDP. Given the trend in health spending in
Argentina and other Latin American countries, this scenario is very reasonable. Under this scenario, the total burden of recurrent
costs would be reduced from 14 percent to 12 percent by the fifth year following project completion. At the same time, a reduction
in health spending, stimulated by maintaining constant current expenditure (equivalent to a reduction in public sector spending from
1.7% GDP to 1.3%) would increase the total recurrent cost burden from 0.014% to 0.018% by the fifth year following project
completion. Even under this conservative estimate, the total recurrent costs would not be significant in terms of the sustainability of
the proposed project.

Procurement of works, goods and services, as well as contracting of consultants with Bank funds, would be carried out in accordance
with Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA credits (as received January and August 1996) and the Guidelines for
the Use of Consultants (August 1981). Most procurement would be carried out at central level by the PCU.
The PCU will include a full-time procurement officer whose main responsibility will be to prepare and: (a) submit to the Bank all
procurement documents which require Bank's prior review; (b) carry out any procurement at central level; (c) coordinate and
monitor procurement carried out by each executing unit; and (d) prepare and submit to the Bank at the beginning of each calendar
year a detailed procurement schedule. The appointment of the procurement officer will be done in consultation with the Bank. At
project launch, the Bank will deliver a procurement workshop to present and explain procurement guidelines and commence
preparing specific bidding documents.
Civil works. The project would finance civil works to rehabilitate ambulatory health care facilities, laboratories, hospice and orphan
care services. No new civil works are expected to be constructed under the project. It is estimated that about US$3 million
equivalent of the project's costs will be allocated to civil works.
Goods. The project would finance equipment and supplies, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to support promotion, prevention,
diagnosis, treatment and care services for HIV+/AIDS patients, for a total amount estimated at US$5 million. Because of the special
nature of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, they will be procured using Limited International Bidding.
Consultant Services. The project would finance consultant services including information, education and communication services
(i.e. media campaigns), educational materials and training for teachers, health care professionals and community health workers, for
a total estimated at US$20 million.
At appraisal the Borrower presented a procurement plan for the first year of project implementation acceptable to the Bank (Annex
6, Table C). During annual review meetings the Bank would review the procurement schedule for the following year, including
international or national tenders, as well as the number and estimated costs of the subprojects to be financed under the loan.

The proceeds of the Loan (US$15 million) would be lent to the Argentine Republic. The proceeds of the loan would be passed to the
beneficiaries as grants linked to management contracts and output indicators. The Borrower would bear the foreign exchange risk.
In the case of subprojects, the beneficiaries would contract for the respective works, goods and consulting services.
The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of four years up to June 30, 2001 (Annex 6, Tables D and E). The project
completion date (i.e. the final date for presentation of requests for approval or authorization to disburse in respect of subprojects
would be December 31, 2000). The project closing date would be June 30, 2001, six months after the completion date. Consistent
with Bank experience with health projects in Argentina, we expect disbursements to occur faster than usual for traditional
investment projects in Latin America.
(The percent of expenditures for works, goods and equipment, and consulting services to be financed under the Loan is given in
Annex 6, Tables A, B and C )
Retroactive Financing The Bank would finance contracts retroactively for eligible expenditures incurred up to 12 months prior to
Loan signing, up to an amount of US$1.5 million. These funds would be used to finance eligible subprojects approved in line with
the eligibility and appraisal criteria acceptable to the Bank.
Documentation The Project Coordination Unit would present full support documentation for all withdrawal applications with a
contract value of US$350,000 for goods, US$ 100,000 equivalent or more for service of consulting firms, and US$50,000 equivalent
for individual consultant contracts. The PCU would submit withdrawal applications of smaller contract values having a statement of
expenditures (SOEs), and would maintain the respective supporting documents for Bank review.
Special Account The Ministry of Health would open a Special Account at Banco de la Naci6n Argentina with an initial deposit of
US$1.5 million equivalent. This would correspond to about four months of expenditures required under the project. The Project
Coordination Unit would forward to the Bank the documentation necessary for disbursements (SOEs or full documentation),
covering a number of subprojects or contracts for services whose aggregate sum would be at least US$600,000.
Financial management, accounting and auditing The Project Coordinating Unit would be audited annually by auditors acceptable to
the Bank. No later than six months after the end of its fiscal year, the project Coordination Unit would submit to the Bank copies of
audit reports containing the auditor's opinion on (a) project accounts, including statement of expenditures and the Special Account;
Loan assumed to be effective by August 22, 1997
