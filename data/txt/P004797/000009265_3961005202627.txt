SECOND GAS T SMSSION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:              Petfoleum Authority of Thailand (PTT)
Guarantor:             Kingdom of Thailand
Amount:                US$155.0 million equivalent
Terms:                 17 years, including a grace period of four years, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Project Obiectives:    The project's objectives are to promote greater sector efficiency and
increase the utilization of domestic natural gas resources. As such,
they will help PTT to: (a) move towards a fully commercial operation
(corporatization) under the new organization, as well as continue
previous efforts to strengtnen its institutional capacity to apply safety
and environmental standards and conduct project aralyses, including
investment programming and (b) construct a pipeline for transporting
domestic gas, which is the .cast-cost option to meet Thailand's
growing power generation requirements.
Project Description:   The project includes: (a) a comprehensive study regarding PTM's
corporate strategy, organizational effectiveness and ownership
structure; (b) institutional building and training of PTT's staff; (c) a
36" diameter, 425 km offshore gas transmission pipeline that extends
from an existing platform at the Erawan fields in the Gulf of Thailand
to onshore receiving facilities at Rayong; (d) a 28" diameter, 110 km
onshore pipeline that extends from Rayong to an area near the EGAT
power plant at Bang Pakong; (e) related facilities, including a
compressor station, metering stations, gas processing facilities, and
telecommunication and control systems and (f) project engineering and
management consultancy services.
Benefits:              The project would have significant economic and environmental
benefits. The gas would be used for power generat.on, in combined-
cycle plants, which has been shown to be part of Thailand's least-cost
solution to power generation. The economic benefits of the project are
derived from the higher value that gas attains, when displacing other
fuels. Equally important, natural gas is a clean and low-polluting fuel
when compared to alternative sources of energy. In addition, the
project will provide a detailed analyses for PMT's corporatization and
eventual privatization.
Risks:                 Risks entail the following:  (a) the availability of sufficient gas
reserves and the cost of producing such reserves; (b) safety and
environmental problems associated with the construction and operation
of the project facilities and (c) potential disputes in various contractual
arrangements. However, the gas reserves have been assessed and
certified to be sufficient. nle risks associated with a potenial increase
in production cost.- have been minmized because appropriate



- ii -
contingencies have been included in the cost parameters. The safety
and environmental risks have been miniimzed because approprate
mitigation measures have been designed. The potential for contractual
dispute has been reduced because the agreements have been structured
according to international norms.

CHArR I
ENERGY SECTOR
A. Backgomund
1.1       Over the last decade, energy consumption in Thailand has been strongly affected by rapid
economic growth and funmentl dhanges in the structure of the economy. During this period, the
Government and the Bank have cooperated to devise the best policy mix with regad to investment
planiing, pnce formulation and institutional strucuing in order to meet the country's future energy
requirements and avoid ifrastructure botflenecks that could hamper economic performance. in this
effort, the Bank helped Thailand construct several major energy projects and cenducted a major study
to identify the optimum fuel supply options over the next decade or two, while the Govermnent is
considering to introduce organizional reforms that should corporaize, and, eventually, privatize the
energy entities. The proposed project represents another step towards this end.
1.2        Psas Consption Patern  In 1991, the total supply of commerial energy in Thailand
was about 33 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) - a two-and-one-half fold increase over 1980 - and
the figure was growing at an average rate of 11% per year. Petroleum represented 62% of the total,
natural gas 21%, lignite 13%, hydropower 3% and coal 1%, and 60% of the supply was imported. In
addition, Thailand consumed about 10 million toe of renewable eneirgy in 1991, mainly in the form of
wood-fuels. However, despite the country's impressive economi;, growth (10% a year, for the last six
years), per capita energy consumption and the type of energy consumed is that of a low-income
developing country, which is a modest 540 kg oil equivalent of energy per capita and a reltively high
share (25%) of traditional fuels. This pattern is due to the large mrual popuation and the relatively high
price of commercial energy (compared with rural income levels), which plases commercial energy
beyond the reach of the low-income group. Table 1.1 shows the past supply of primary energy by
sources.

1.3       Commercial energy, particularly oil and gas, plays a critical role in the economy because
(a) the country is only modesdy endowed with these resources and (b) the dramatic in usalion in
recent years has led to a sharp increase in energy consumption. In fhat, demand continues to far exceed
domestic supply and this gap is likely to increase in the future, in view of the conthiued and rapid



-2-
economic growth expected and the uncertain prospects of discovering any additional major oil and gas
reserves.
1.4        Final commercial energy consumption in the economy is dominated by the transport
sector, which in 1991 accounted for 39%, followed by the industrial sector (31 %), and residental and
commercial sectors (24%). Traditional fuels continue to represent a significant, albeit rapidly declining
share of energy consumption in the rural residential sector (see Table 1.2).

1.5        Providing fuel in the power sector is a particularly critical issnie. since electricity demand
has grown by about 14% a year over the iast five years: To meet projected demand for the year 2000,
the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) needs to double its generating capacity from
the current 9,000 MW to about 18,000 MW. In 1991, the fuels used to generate power included
natral gas (40 %), lignite (25%) and heavy oil (24%), while hydro was about 9%. However, EGAT's
cholzes are increai1ngly limited. First, the remaining supply of hydro is difficult to develop because of
high costs and environmental and resettlement problems. Second, lignte reserves are insufficient to
meet the increased requirements and its use creates environmental problems, as well. However, if gas
(which is the most preferred fuel) would ultimately not be available, then EGAT must include locaUy
produced lignite plants (or imported coal-based plans) and dual-firing capability (to supplement gas
with fuel oil) in its master plan.
B. Resource Endowmenot
1.6        While Thailand has a diversified energy resource base, consisig of petroleum (oil,
condensate and natural gas), lignite, hydropower, biomass and geothermal energy (which is still at an
exploratory stage in the northern region), these resources are limited, which means Thailand is a net
importer of energy.
1.7        Oil. Given the geological features of the country's hydrocarbon basins, crude oil is not
expected to be a major contributor. At the end of 1992, there were about 245 million barrels of proven
and probable oil reserves. Of these, about 177 million barrels are condensate, which would have to be
produced in association with offshore gas, and about 68 million barrels are crude oil. Additional oil
reserves are estimated at about 440 million barrels, of which about 350 million barrels are condensate
and 90 million barrels are oil. Production is currantly limited to Phet crude from the Sirikit oil field,
which produced 22,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 1991. In addition, about 27,000 bpd of condensate



-3-
were produced in association with gas fro;n offshore fields in the Gulf of Thailand. To meet the oil
demand, Thailand imported 160,000 bpd of finished petroleum products, and 220,000 bpd of crude for
processing in its three local refineries.
1.8        Gas. Natural gas has been discovered mostly by companies looking for oil. At the end of
1992, the remaining reserves were 7-8 trillion cubic feet (tcf). Gas production in 1992 was 850 million
cubic feet per day (mmcfd), of which 750 mmefd were produced from the offshore fields However,
the country's natural gas resources will not be sufficient to meet future demand; therefore, Thailand has
looked into importing piped gas from neighboring countries (potentially from Malaysia, Myanmar and,
recently, Vietnam), or importing it in the form of LNG from international markets. The demand for
natural gas arises mostly from the power sector and the trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable
future: A conservative estimate indicates that the country's demand will continue to exceed supply by
over 60% for the next 1D-20 years. Gas is an attractive option for power generation, both economically
and environmentally, when used in combined-cycle power plants (para. 6.4); it is ths feature of naural
Vs in the context of Thailand's economy, along with its environmental benefits, that gives rise to the
p.oposed project. Table 1.3 shows past gas consunpption.

1.9        Coal. Coal resources are all relatively low grade; the quality is generally categorized as
lignite, although some deposits verge on being sub-bituminous. Information about reserves is somewhat
ambiguous since no common standards are used to classify them. Total minable reserves are estimated
at around 1,200 million tons which, according to current projections for lignite demand for power
;.- -teration and industry (about 25 million tons per year by 1996), should last for about three decades.
Ln 991, about 65% of the total coal consumed in the country was for power generation which uses
domestic coal (lignite) exclusively. Non-power n e of domestic lignite is mainly in the cement ;tdustry.
Lignite therefore, is expected to play a long-term, albeit limited role as an energy source.
1.10       Hydro. Hydroelectric potential is estimated at about 10,600 MWV, of which only 3,000
MW have already been developed or committed. The remaining potential is, in general, economically
less attractive and environmentally quite difficult to develop. Thus, the potential for hydro would be
limited to small/medium scale new projects and low-impact pumped-storage stations. This said, no
serious attempts have been made so far to clearly define and classify the various environmetal
problems involved, and, particularly, to quantify the costs of mitigating measures needed to curtil the
adverse impacts. Thus, given the country's large and unexploited hydro potential, and given its need
for increased energy supply, Thailand should more rigorously reexamine its potential hydro projects;
and, through an enhanced financing plan (schemes such as BOOT or BOT) and an enhanced design of
the environmental mitigation plan, some options which are economically and environmentally viable,
could materialize.

C. Future Outlook and Energy Demand
1.11        Thailand's economic performance over the last ten years has been very impr.ssive,
registering double-digit GDP growth over much of that period. While growth is expected to slow, the
outlook continues to be good because of a favorable international economic environment for Thailand
and the country's sound economic policies and credit-worthiness. The Bank's long term projection is
for Thailand's economy to grow at 6%-8% over the next 10-15 years. With regard to the energy
sector, it is expected that private sector participation will increase, that the energy entities will soon be
corporatized (and eventually privatized), and that the Government wil: intervene less in energy affairs.
1.12        Final energy demand projected by the Bank (as part of the analyses carried out for the
Fuel Option Study) is presented in Table 1.4 below. The Bank's forecast is slightly different from the
Government's in that the Bank calculates a higher share of energy consumption in the transport and
industrial sectors.

1.13        With regard to the type of fuel needed to meet the above sectoral demand, it is expected
that (a) the consumption of non-wcommercial energy, such as bagasse in the industrial sector and
woodfuels and charcoal in the residential sector, will decline from its current share of 24% to 11% of
the total by 2010, as the country develops; (b) industrial use of gas will be reduced to a level lower
than the one currently projected by PTT, consistent with the priority ranking of the economic value of
gas in different applications (this will mean more gas for the power sector); (c) residential and
commercial sectors will increasingly use either LPG, as long as it is subsidized, or electricity (gas is not
economic as there is no need for space heating, and kerosene, the most common woodfuel replacement,
is not subsidized); (d) transport and agriculture will continue to use mainly oil (the role of compressed
natural gas (CNG) in transport is expected to be very limited, if any) and (e) where end-use application
is not a constmaint, imported coal, fuel oil, lignite and electricity will compete based on their total
economic costs, which include environmental costs. Table 1.5 provides the total prianry energy
requirements, including the fuels needed for the power sector.

D. institutions
1.14       The institutions in Thailand's energy sector are mature, and their inter- and intra-sectoral
arrangements are quite sophisticated. The policy framework is extensive and there are numerous
energy-related agencies that spread across many ministries and include several cabinet-level committees.
The chart in the annex provides an organizational diagram of Thailand's energy sector.
1.15       The key governmental organizations involved in energy affairs are:
(a)   At the highest level, the National Energy Policy Council (NEPC), which is chaired by the
Prime Minister, and whose members include deputy prime ministers and ministers whose
portfolios involve energy, as well as representatives from the National Economic and
Social Development Board (NESDB), the secretary general of National Energy Policy
Office (NEPO), the director general of the Department of Energy Development anid
Promotion (DEDP) and the director of the Budget Bureau. On behalf of the cabinet,
NEPC approves major policy changes, plans ar.2 projects in the energy sector and defines
roles, functions and priorities of the various ministries and state enterprises in the sector;
(b)   The NEPO, which is the secretariat to NEPC, and adts as an operating arm to the
Council. NEPO functions primarily as a link between NEPC and the country's state
energy enterprises. NEPO plays a pivotr4 role in fonrulating the energy sector policy as
well as providing coordination and advisory functions;
(c)   The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR), whose Director General reports to the
Permanent Secretary of the Min!stry of Industry; it is responsible for assessing the
country's coal and petroleum reserves, and for the preliminary exploration of coal and
petroleum. Two of its important functions are to grant concession licenses for exploration
and mining, and to supervise the various exploration and production activities (including
the monitoring of their enviromnental impacts);



-6-
(d)   NESDB, which is a central planning agency that assesses the country's economy and
prepares the five-year plans. In the energy sector, it is responsible for recommending to
the Council of Ministers whether it should approve or reject major energy projects;
(e)   DEDP, which is a recent establishment (it assumed the responsibilities of the now-defunct
National Energy Administration), is under the Ministry of Science, Trchnology and
Environment (MSTE), and is responsible for developing non-conventional energy sources.
1.16       The two major state energy enterprises are the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTI) and
the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). PTT, the proposed borrower (see para. 4.1),
is involved in downstream oil and gas activities (upstream activities are carried out by the private
sector; see para. 2.12). EGAT is involved in generating electricity and producing and utilizing
domestic coal (lignite). Since it was established about 25 years ago, EGAT has grown to a staff of
32,000 with US$2 billion in annual revenues. At the end of 1991, it had an installed capacity of 8,000
MW and generate. 50,000 GWh of electricity. As with ?1T, EGAT is devis4g plans for restruct'rng
and privatization to promote a larger private sector role in power development. From 1994-1996, this
will invoive (a) corporatizing EGAT, including the sale of EGAT equity on the security market; (b)
selling 51% of the Electricity Generating Company (EGCO), an EGAT subsidiary created in 1992; (c)
soliciting build-own-operate (BOO) proposals for new generating plants through an open competition
among independent power producers and EGCO and (d) incorporating the Metropolitan Electricity
Authority (MEA) and Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA), and increasing PEA's regionalization, to
prepare for privatization.
E. Prices
1.17       Current prices for all energy products in Thailand reflect their actual economic costs,
except lignite. Thai lignite, due to its poor quality (high sulphur and ash content), can not be traded in
the international market; therefore, its economic cost is based on EGAT's internal transfer price. While
no other major issue exists in the pricing structure of the energy products in Thailand, some minor
distortions remain in the price structure of petroleum products (LPG continues to be subsidized) and in
electricity tariffs (power distribution companies .ay no capacity charge). The Government is aware of
the potentially negative effects these minor distortions can have on investment decisions and inter-fuel
substitution and is taldng steps to narrow the differences, consistent with the structure of economic
costs. (Annex 1 provides the domestic prices of energy products. Gas prices are discussed in paras.
2.8-2.11).
F. Issues and Strategy
1.18       In principle, Thailand's energy sector faces two major is-sues. The first is how to meet the
country's future ena.gy requiemets, given the insuiiciency of domestic energy resources, in a manner
which is econrmically rational, enviromnentally sound and financially viable. The second is how to
divide the heavy burden of massive energy investment between the public and private sector - given
that neither can carry this alone - so as to ultimately shift investment to the private sector completely,



-7-
without disrupting the country's rapid economic growth. The proposed project contains elements which
address both: The pipeline would transport domestic gas to the market (the fuel is the least-cost and
least-polluting solution for power generation in Thailand), and the proposed technical assistance includes
a component for restructuring PTT to a corporatized and, eventually, privatized entity (see paras. 3.7
and 4.234.28).
1.19      Other ;mportant issues in the sector are:
(a)  Enviironental impacts. The environmental impact of energy production and consumption
has become a topic of public debate and a real constraint to developing lignite power
generation and hydropower. The Government recognizes the importance of these issues
and is committed to developing the sector in an environmentally sound manner. Thw, it
now requires the power sector and major industries to use pollution-control technologies,
such as scrubbers, in all existing and future lignite-fired power plants and in the cement
industry. Further, the Bank is helping the refinery operation, through the Air Qality
Enhancement Project (scheduled to be appraised in July 1994), to produce less polluting
prod cts. In addition, the Government is in the process of developing enviromnental
policies and standards to mitigate pollution through taxes, penalties and incentives.
(b)  Reguatory Jfamework. The Govermnent has pursued sector efficiency objectives with
conviction and the results are impressive. However, one key issue is that there is no
independent regulatory body. Given that the need for sector regulation in Thailand is not
driven by inefficiency, but by the need to bring in private investment, the regulatory
framework must be designed in conjunction with the decision on restructuring the sector.
While the issue of regulatory framework at macro level is being currently addressed
through an on-going sector study by the Bank (Increasing Private Participation and
Improving Efficiency in State Enterprises), there is still need to examine the benefits of
regulatory framework at sectoral level. Therefore, the Bank has recommended (in the
Fuel Option Study) that the Govermment prepare an independent regulatory framework that
could be functioning by the time Thailand restructures the sector (during the planned
corporatization of the energy entities).
(c)  Energy conservaion. The Govermnent recogiizes that energy use must be rationalized if
the country is to cope with its supply constraints. Thus, conservation is a formal objective
of Thailand's energy sector policy, which is beginning to move towards an integrated-
resource planning approach that focuses both on supply and demand. Two prograrAs that
presently address this are adopting a master plan for demand side management (D¶SM) and
introducing time-of-day tariffs aimed at reducing peak demand. The DSM mAster plan
proposed an initial five-year pilot program t'rough which EGAT would save
approxinately 1,427 GWh per year by the end of the fifth year. These savings, which
also include a capacity saving of 225 MW, would be achieved through iroentives for all
categores of consumers to produce and/or instaU energy-effitcent technologies. The
program is estimated to cost US$188 million. Potential benefits are calculated to be about
US$260 million in capital investment and US$30 million per year in fuel expenses. This
would equal a very low energy supply cost of US$2.051 per kWh. Also, the structure of
electricity tariffs is being gradually improved through the introduction of time-of-day
tariffs for major consumers. This measure aims to increase the power system's load
factor, thus reducing expansion needs.



(d)  Environmental ad S4fey Stand.  There is a need to create an acceptable se,, of
enviroMnental and safety standards to exploit hydrocarbon resources in the Gulf of
Thailand. This issue is currently being addressed through a study carried out by DMR
(para. 3.13).



CHIAPrER B
GAS SUB-SECTOR
A. Badcground
2.1        Exploration for hydrocarbon in Thailand began about 1971 after the Government
established the petroleum Law. Oil and gas exploration and development activities have been extensive
enough to conclude that the area has gas resources but relatively minor oil potential. The country's
total hydrocarbon resources are spread over at least eight different geological structures, offshore and
onshore. In the offshore areas, the most sigrificant to date have been found in (a) the Pattani Basin,
which extends through the middle of the Gulf of Thailand and includes all the currenty producing
Unocal fields (the source of supply for the proposed project) and (b) the Malay Basin, which extends
from Malaysian waters into the Gulf of Thailand and includes the Bongkot structure, the largest known
existing gas field in the Gulf (also the source of supply for the proposed project). In the onshore areas,
hydrocarbon potential is believed to exist in the northeast (in the Khorat Basin), and in the central-west
(in the Phitsanulok Basin), where Shell's small Sirikit oil field is situated. Annex 2 provides a
description of Thailand's petroleum geology.
2.2        Most of the discoveries from work in the existng basins have been non-associated gma
deposits, which have been rich in heavier hydrocarbons, including ethane, propane and natural gas
liquids (NGL).
2.3        Although the poteal for hydrocarbon resources exists, the prevailing geology in the
basins indicates that further development will not be easy: Due to the erratic deposit of fluvial
reservoirs and complex structurig, the hydrocarbons are trapped in numerous small reservoirs that
ned sophistcated drilling and recovery techniques. Further, the small size of many fields and the
rapid reservoir depletion create the need for a large number of offshore platforms, which, in turn, lead
to high development and production costs. In a number of cases, the long lead time and additional
costs have made field development uneconomic.
B. Domestic Gas Supply and lInport Potential
2.4        Due to the complex geology mentioned above, calculations of Thai reserves (prior to
production history) are generally based on statistical occurrence rather than measured quantities. In
essence, when statistical methods are used, the disinction between the proven and probable reserves
becomes less clear, with the proven reserves being somewhat less assured and the probable reserves
being somewhat more probable than indicated by the American Petroleum Institute (API). The official
basis for the data on Thailad's hydrocarbon reserves are the DMR reports, which, in turn, are
compiled primarily from the latet information submitted by each company that has made discoveries.
Based on these reports, the most likly level of gas resemves remaining in Thailand ranges from 6.5 to
11 tef, and the possible reserves could be as high as 17 tcf. However, for the purpose of the proposed
project, only the cerdfied level of gas reserves has been used in the project analyses, which represents



-10-
a conservative estimate. The details of the certified reserves which have been designated to the project
have been provided to the Bank.
2.5         Except for minor oil production by tie Defense Department in Fang Basin (the
northernmost part of the country) in the 1960s, comnercial production of hydrocarbon began in 1981
by Unocal at the offshore Erawan field. This was followed in 1983 with the production of Thai Shell's
onshore Sirikit oil field. Table 2.1 lists the production by major fields since 1981. As shown in Table
2.1, over the past 12 years, hydrocarbon production increased from 1,000 bpd of petroleum liquids and
29 mmcfd of gas, to 49,00 bpd of liquids and 853 mmcfd of gas. Production is expected to increase
further.

2.6         Gas Imports. Given the country's limited gas supply, Thalba     has often considered
impordng gas either in the form of piped gas from the neighboring cointes of Malaysia, Myamar
and, recently, Viet Nam, or in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from international markets.
While discssions with Malaysia and Myanmar have occasionally led to the various goveents
amnouncing final gas sales-prchase agreemens, to date no agreements have been signed.  With
Myanar, negotations have resumed and it is expected that about 300 mmcfd gas will be imported
begining early 1998. With Malaysia, the issue is more complex because the two countries possess
radically different gas utilization plans and different levels of relative need. Thus, it is expected that the
Thai-Malaysian joint development of the JDA gas fields in the Gulf of Thailand will progress more
rapidly than will negotiations on imporng gas. Nonetheless, it is possible that about 150 mmcfd of gas
from Malaysia will be imported by the year 2001, to be used in the border areas. The option of



-11-
importing gas from Viet Nam is not being considered because that country does not produce enough gas
to export. The high netback value that natural gas produces, and the projected growth in the country's
power generation (which ensures a high-volume gas consumption), justifies, prima facie, the large-scale
investments required to import LNG. The potential use of LNG in Thailand would be identical to that
of imported gas with regard to its economic value and priority ranking in various applications and
sectors. The Government is looking into LNG option, to detennine whether it is viable.
C. Gas Demand
2.7        Demand for gas in Thailand is substantial: Based on estimates, it will exceed the projected
domestic supply by an average of over 60% for the next 15-20 years. The largest consumer is the
power sector which currently uses over 90% of the country's total supply. Because of the enhanced
economic value of gas (para. 6.4) when used in a combined-cycle power plant, as well as its
environmental benefits, the demand for gas in the power sector is growing. And, because demand for
electricity has grown at 14% a year over the last five years, even under a high-case gas supply scenario
of 1,700 mmcfd available by 2003, this quantity meets roughly just one-third of Thailand's power
requirment, under a low growth scenario. Moreover, if the requirements of industrial users are added
to those of the power sector, the covAtry could use an estimated 3,000-3,500 bcf. This quantity would
not be available through domestc resources or from imports from neighboring countries.
D. Gas Prices
2.8        The unique features of the domestic gas industry in Thailand have produced a relatvely
sophisticated pricing structure which involves a separate pricing system for producers and consumers.
2.9        Prodcer Prices. The cost of producing gas in Thailand is relatively expensive compared
to neighboring countries such as Malaysia or Indonesia. This is due to the gas fields' complex
geological features which result in tho well-head transfer price bearing the high cost of field
development and production. At present, only one major company, Unocal, is producing offshore gas
in the Gulf of Thailand. By mid,-i94, Total Company will also produce offshore gas from the
Bongkot field (in the Gulf). While the gas sales-purchase contracts between PTT and the two
companies are different, the principles are essentially the same: (a) the initial transfer price is based on
the long-run economic cost of supply and on the replacement value of altemative fuels; (b) the price-
adjustment mechanism contains indices reflecting the international prices of energy products (mostly
fuel oil), the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in the domestic and international rates of
inflation; (c) prices include a floor and ceiling level to protect sellers and buyers and (d) prices are
adjusted annually, except after devaluatons, when they are inmnediately.Y'  The Bank-estimated
average well-head price for Unocal's gas ranges from US$1.77 per mmbtu to US$2.08 per mmbzu; for
.1/ The gs pcing stuctue for the Namphong field, which produces a relatively small amont of the dry gas used in the
adjacent power plant, is somewhat different because of specific development costs and the composition of the gas (all methme).
The average well-head price for Namphong gas is about US$1 per mmbtu.



-12-
the Bongkot gas, the range is US$1.98 to USZ2.25 per mmbtu. The structure and level of producer
prices in Thailand is consistent with international norms.
2. 10      Consumer Prices. The principle the Government applies when setting consumer prices
(for power and industry) is also sound in that it links the consumer gas prices to alternative fuel prices
in each activity. The present price of gas to industry, which consumes less than 6% of the total, is
intende,i to encourage LPG consumers to shift to gas-.' The price to the power sector - which uses
over 90% of total gas - was previously set by the Government. However, on December 12, 1991, an
agreement was signed between PTT and EGAT which set the price based on (a) the price paid by PTT
to upstream producers (well-head price); (b) the average cost of gas transmission including a reasonable
return to PTT and (c) the value-added tax. The Bank estimates that the current average price of gas
sold by PTT to EGAT is about 78 Baht per nmmbtu (US$3.06 per mmbtu). During negotiations
agreement was reached with PTT that it submit to the Bank, by December 31, 1994, an amendment to
the gas sales-purchase agreement (between PTf and EGAT), to ensure the sale and purchase of new gas
reserves under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
2.11       Although current gas sales-purchase agreement referred to in para. 2.10 covers the
principles of gas sales-purchase between PTT and EGAT, since last year, P1T and EGAT have been
involved in a Bank-sponsored study which would establish a long-term pricing formula for future gas
supply that is in line with international standards. It would create two separate contracts - one for the
"firm" gas supply and one for the "interruptible." A daily quantity would be defined for the firm
supply (about 500 mmcfd), to fuel EGAT's combined-cycle power plants, and the contract would be a
take-or-pay agreement. The price of the firm contract would be equal to the pipeline cost of
transporting the gas, plus the gas commodity price, which is equal to PTT's volume-weighted average
purchase cost. The price of an interruptible contract would be based on the cost of alternative fuel and
negotiated by the parties. The new price mechanism was approved by the Government on August 17,
1992.
E. Role of the Private Sector
2.12       Thailand's hydrocarbon resources are produced either totally by the private sector or
through a joint venture between the private sector and PTTEP, which is a subsidiary of PTT. In the
latter case, the private sector is the major shareholder and has included major international oil
companies such as Unocal, Shell, Esso, Total and British Gas. In the oil sector, Thailand's three
existing refineries are either privately owned (by Esso), or owned through joint ventures between the
private sector and PTT (PTT owns 30% and 49% of Bangchok and Thai Oil refineries). ihailand is
currently constructing two new refineries, with majority shares owned by Caltex and Shell. In
distributing and marketing oil, PTT competes with international oil companies, having a one-third share
2/ No such inecntive is provided to fuel oil users, because gas has a lower netback value when substiting for fuel oil.
3/ Industry's price is significantly higher than the one established for the power sector, since the margin of subsion between
LPG and gas has been high, even after a discount, to allow for penetration of gas into the LPG market.



-13-
of the market. The other two-thirds are shared among Caltex, Shell and smaller finns. The only area
in which PTT has sole responsibility is the transmission of gas, the bulk of which is sold to EGAT.V1
2.13        With regard to private sector participation in gas transmission, the most likely investors
would be Unocal and Total, the two private gas producers currently active in the Gulf of Thailand.
However, both have told the Bank they are not interested in participating in gas transmission because of
corporate strategic reasons.1Y Not only are Unocal and Total disinterested, but no other private party
has approached PTT or the Government to invest in the project. ADB, JEXIM and EIB, which are
cofinancing it, have also found this same lack of interest from the private sector. In fact, with projects
in the oil and gas sectors of this dimension, where investors are interested in participating, they register
this very early in the project cycle, often even before the Bank is involved. Thus, it is unlikely that
there are any viable interested parties.
F. Experience with Previous Bank Loans
2.14         Until now, the Bank has made four loans to Thailand's oil and gas sector: The first (loan
1773-TH) was to construct the country's first gas transmission pipeline; the second (loan 2184-TH) was
to construct a gas separation plant; the third (loan 2184-TH) supported oil field development; and the
fourth (loan 3508-TH), now being disbursed, is to construct the Bongkot gas transmission pipeline.
These projects, implemented over the past 11 years, have been completed on schedule and within the
budget, and have realized their main objectives. Three lessons are particularly relevant to the design of
the proposed project. First, given that the region's geology is complex, the hydrocarbon reserves must
be evaluated comprehensively (before proceeding to full development and production) and the high cost
of developing the fields should be addressed: The proposed project has considered these factors.
Second, given Thailand's procurement practices and import tax laws, the Bank has learned to prepare
procurement packages in a way that  inimzes their numbers, yet conforms with Bank guidelines, hence
avoiding potential delays resulting from procurement-related issues. As a result, the proposed project
consists of only about eight main single-responsibility contracts, of which the Bank loan will fund two.
Third, the Bank learned that coordination at two levels was problematic; this occurs within the PTT
(between the Engineering and Finance Departments), and outside (between PTT and EGAT), regarding
the timing, load requirements, capacity and type of power plants that rely on the PTT gas supply.
During project preparation, the Bank helped increase cooperation and interactions between PTT and
EGAT, as well as within the agency.
i/ Pff is also responsible for the primary transportation of oil in the country. However, Thailand has very little indigenous oil.
5/ In an October 27, 1992 letter to the Bank, Unoal stated that its 'reason for not wanting to paricipate is rooted in thebelief
that we can return the maximum benefits to our shareholders when we stick to our core business, and that is developing and
producing oil and gas.' Total provided essetially the same response with regard to the Bongkot project. Moreover, the
companies believe th e large capial commitment neerd to develop and produce the additional gas would constrain their
resources.



-14-
G. Ratonale for Bank Involvement
2.15       The overriding rationale for Bank involvement is to continue helping the country build a
policy framework with which it can operate the sec or efficiently. For the many years that the Bank has
been involved in Thailand's oil and gas industry, the Government and energy-affiliated agencies have
sought and implemented Bank advice on how to build such a framework. These interactions have
produced major energy projects based on economnically-rational justifications, deregulation of all but one
of the petroleum product prices, rigorous analyses of environmental impacts (of the energy projects),
and the initial reforms to ultimately create completely commercial entities. Further, the Bank, with help
from the agencies, identified the optimum fuel choice (see the Fuel Option Study) and prepared a master
plan for utilization of domestic and imported gas over the next decade or two. These activities have
significantly enhanced the sector efficiency and its profitability; however, issues remain. The most
important are corporatizing/privatizing the energy entities (so as to raise capital to meet the massive
investment requirements); establishing an independent regulatory body (to assure private investors their
venture capital is protected by a fixed set of rules and procedures): creating an internationally-
acceptable set of uniform environmental standards and regulations (to cxploit hydrocarbon resources in
the Gulf of Thailand); and amending the country's legal codes for oil and gas activities (to provide an
environment that would attract greater private sector participation). The proposed project addresses one
of the key issues of corporatization, which constitutes a first step towards privatization. As for creating
appropriate regulatory structures, these can only be defined after the Government decides the nature of
the restructuring (corporatization).
2.16       The project is consistent with the country strategy discussed by the Board in September
1994, because the physical infrastructure and institutional weaknesses will be the main issues for the
next decade or two. It includes components relevant to both constraints. First, it helps finance the
construction of a pipeline, which will ease the bottleneck in transporting the domestic natural gas.
Second, it will train staff to carry out project analyses and application of safety and environmental
standards, as well as help the borrowing entity reorganize towards a corporatized structure, which
would reduce the public sector's need for investment capital.
2.17       The project is also consistent with the sector strategy because it promotes the use of
natural gas, which the recendy completed Fuel Option Study concluded was the least-pollutng and
least-cost fuel with which to generate power.
2.18       Therefore, Bank lending in the sector is consistent with both the country and sector
strategies and the Government decision regarding sectoral priorities. Without Bank involvement, key
sectoral issues may not receive proper attention, and the development of an enabling environment, for
greater private sector participation may be deferred.



THI PROJECT
A. Background
3.1        Over 90% of Thailand's natural gas comes from the Gulf of Thailand, transported thr )ugh
a 34-inch offshore pipeline from the Erawan platform to Rayong, on the northern shore. The pipeline
has been operating for almost nine years, and its present flow rate is about 750 mmcfd. Althougn the
pipeline has never operated at its maximum capacity of 850 mmcfd (because of limited supply), the
latest major inspection confirmed that the pipeline could safely transport that amount.Y
3.2        During the negotiations (in the spring of 1992) of Loan 3508-TH  (Bongkot Gas
Transmission Project), PTT and the Bank agreed that the need for the second pipeline depended on (a)
the present and projected reserves and production of gas from the Unocal and Bongkot fields; (b)
maximum allowable capacity of the existing 34-inch pipeline (at that time, the latest inspection report
was not yet completed) and (c) the possibility of malfunctions in the existing (sole) pipeline to Rayong
and the speed in which the malfunction could be corrected.
3.3         To assess the above factors and to determine whether the second pipeline project was
needed, the Bank agreed to provide, as part of Loan 3508-THl, US$2 million for the required
investigations. The studies intended to confirm the reserves' availability, the time needed to develop
and produce gas and the optimal means of transporting it from the Erawan platform to the onshore
consumig centers. Also, the studies would establish whether the proposed pipeline should be
constructed offshore, closer to the shore, or onshore.
3.4        Two studies were conducted. The first confirmed that gas was indeed available and a gas
ulization master plan study concluded that the proposed project should be given high priority and also
ddetrined the routing and size of the pipeline. The Bank reviewed the consultant's report and agreed
that the project constituted a high priority investment in the master plan created for the country's gas
transmission network.
B. Project Objectives
3.5        The objectives of the project are to achieve greater efficiency in sector operations and
increase the utilization of domestic natural gas resources. They involve helping PITT to: (a) move
towards a fully commercial operation under the new organization; (b) strengthen its institutional
capacity to apply safety and environmental standards as well 'as carry out project analyses and
6/ The Brish Gas Corporation conducted a comprehe    inspection in April 1993, using the lates tectnology and a
sophiscated surveying mehanism to detect any corrosion and/or defonration   the pipeline. MTe resutd of the inspection, in
form of a summaiy report, was made available to the Bank, confirmig that the pipeline could in fiact wthstand a maximum flow
Te of 85O mmcfd.



-16-
investment programnming and (c) construct a pipeline to transport domest-i gas, which is the least-cost
option to meet the country's growing power-generation requirements.
C. Project Description
3.6        The project consists of an offshore and an onshore pipeline and the facilities to transport
the natural gas produced in the Bongkot and Unocal fields in Gulf of Thailand to onshore locations in
central part of the country. Map IBRD No. 25766 shows the location of the offshore and onshore
facilities and the routing of the proposed pipeline as well as the existing pipeline. Annex 6 describes
the project facilities.
3.7        The major project components are:
(a)   A technical assistance component, which includes a study on corporate strategies and
financing plans for PTT's corporatization, as well as a training program for PTT staff in
project analyses (including investment programming) and in applying safety and
environmental standards (see paras. 4.23-4.28)
(b) A 36-inch diameter, 425 km offshore gas transmission pipeline installed in water depths
ranging from 200 ft-270 ft. It will extend from an existing platform at the Erawan field to
onshore receiving facilities at Rayong;
(c)   A 28-inch diameter, 110 km onshore pipeline that extends from Rayong to the block valve
No. 6, near EGAT's power plant at Bang Pakong;
(d) Related facilities at Erawan riser platform, at Erawan compression and central processing
platform, at Rayong receiving terminal and at block valve no. 6, that include scraper
launchers and receivers, slug catchers, pressure and flow controls, pipe manifolding,
various tie-ins, as well as an onshore compressor station;
(e)   Modification/expansion of the existing supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system and the pipeline telecommunications network;
(f)   Consultancy and management services for bisic design, detailed engineering, preparation
of bid documents, procurement of goods and works, supervision of the construction and
commissioning the facilities;
D. Status of Project Preparation
3.8        The project is in an advanced stage of preparation. Technical specifications, details about
the project management unit, various studies and basic design have been partially completed. Contracts
for the pipeline materials and the coating (financed by the ADB and JEXM), have been awarded
according the ADB's procurement guidelines. Bidding documents for the contract to lay offshore pipe
had been prepared by PTT's consultants (Bechtel), and were reviewed with the Bank in late January.



-17-
The bid documents were issued and the bids have been received. The Bank is in the process of
reviewing the bid evaluation report submitted by PTT. Other engineering, procurement and project
related activities are progressing according to schedule. No land acquisition problem is anticipated (see
para. 3.15). The overall status of project implementation suggests no impediment to the current rate of
progress.
E. EnvironmentW and Safety Aspects
3.9        Termns of reference for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project were
prepared jointly by the Bank and PTT's environmental consultants (the Team Company), which also
conducted the EIA for the Bongkot Gas Transmission Project (Loan 3508-TH). The final ETA report
for the proposed project has incorporated the Bank's comments, including measures to ensure that the
project complies with the Bank's environmental guidelines (see Project File for a summary of the EIA).
3.10       Tht project would have minimal negative impact on the environment because the use of
natural gas would be significantly less harmful than either fuel oil or coal. While natural gas is not
pollution free, it is inherently cleaner than other fuels: It is free of most pollutants present in liquid and
solid fuels and generates less carbon dioxide (CO2). The reduced CO2 emissions offer a highly cost-
effective response to the greenhouse effect. The gas used in combined-cycle power plants emits only
40% as much CO. as a coal-fired power plant. Moreover, treated natural gas has no sulfur content. In
addition, the gas to be transported by the project pipeline is non-associated gas, which carries much less
environmental risk than of oil or associated gas. Nonetheless, a few areas carry some potential risk to
the environment. These include the disruption to marine life (which could be caused by changes in
seabed conditions near the pipeline during construction); the discharge of liquids such as processed
water, deck drainage and sewage from production and living quarters platforns; the disposal of
mercury (which is sometimes present in the gas) and the noise and vibration caused by equipment on
the production platforms. The EJA report fully addresses these issues and provides for appropriate
actions such as pre-treatment of liquid effluent before discharge to the sea, safe disposal of solid wastes
to approved land sites and safe disposal of elemental mercury. Any disruption to marine life would not
be severe because the project involves only about 0.37 square kilometers of seabed. In fact, once the
pipeline is operating, it is expected that its surface would provide attachment points for plant species
and will provide cover for fish. The design of equipment will be according to intenational standards
for maximum safety and allowable levels of noise and vibration. Further, the EIA report will analyze
alternatives, including the effect of various pipeline routings on natural biological resources such as
coral reefs. Proposed measures will ensure that the environmental impact, if any, will be kept within
limits prescribed by Bank guidelines. During negotiations, agreement was reached with PIT that it will
take all measures required on its part to ensure full implementation of the action plan contained in the
Environmental Assessment Report (pam. 3.9).
3.11       The entire project design will be in accord with international safety codes and standards.
Natural gas condensates will be separated from gas on the production platforms, before the gas is
introduced into the pipeline. However, small quantities of liquids will be present in the gas as the
result of condensation of hydrocarbon gases; thus, the condensed gases will be periodically removed
from the pipeline by a "pig." The pipeline route will be adequately demarcated, especially in shipping
lanes and fishing areas, to avoid potential damage to the pipeline (e.g., by a ship's anchor).



-18-
3.12       Offshore facilities are being constructed by Unocal and the operator (Total) of the Bongkot
gas field (for upstream facilities), . nd by PTT's construction contractor (for downstreatn facilities).
Unocal and Total have extensive e perience in similar operations elsewhere in the world. The
construction of the downstream facilities will be supervised by Bechtel International, which also has vast
experience in this area. These companies use high standrds of safety and environmental protection,
and they require the same from their sub-contractors.
3.13       Further, a study for Development of Environmental Standards and Regulations for
Hydrocarbon Exploration and Exploitation in the Gulf of Thailand was initiated by the Bank as part of
the Bongkot Gas Transmission Project. The objectives were to assess present environmental legislation
and regulatory provisions, as well as current concessionaires' practices, and drft regulations and
guidelines for environmental control with respect to hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation in the
Gulf of Thailand. It recomnends (a) strengthening the Thai environmental institutional processes,
including reporting, review and approval procedures; (b) providing standards and guidelines for
environmental impact assessments and for environmental management and monitoring by DMR; (c)
establishing concessionaires' requirements for environmental compliance and (d) notifying authorities
about oil spills or other releases. In addition, the study recommends various operational standards and
guidelines for the construction process and management activities for both onshore and offshore
facilities. During negotiations, assurances were given by PTT that it would use its offices to encourage
DMR to implement the recommendations contained in this study. Furthermore, during negotiations, it
was also understood that PTT would assist in persuading DMR to conduct a base-line environmental
data survey for the Gulf of Thailand.
3.14       PTT's operational safety record has been excellent, and it is expected that it will operate
new facilities according to the same high standards. Notwithstanding PTT's excellent operational safety
record and its commitment to sustaining the environment, the oil and gas industry in Thailand is still
relatively new and the industry has not yet produced the standards and regulations needed for safety and
environmental protection. P'IT currently has no well-defined safety engineering standards and
environmental regulations, nor does it have an adequate institutional framework with which it can
properly administer this aspect of its operation. As part of the loan 3508-TH, agreement was reached
that US$200,000 would be included for consultancy services to help PIT adequately prepare safety
engineering and environental standards for its entire operation; also, that PIT would implement the
study's recommendations. The study is currently being prepared and its implementation should begin
by September 1994. During negotiations, agreement was reached with PfIT that it will implement the
recommendations of the study. Regarding the institutional framework, PIT'S new organization,
effective January 1, 1992, includes a safety and environmental committee chaired by P'IT's Governor
as well as a safety and environmental standards divisions in each of four business units. The heads of
these divisions report directly to the presidents of the respective business units. Further, each division
has one or more sub-divisions (e.g., for pipeline and gas plants within the natural gas business unit) to
enforce the standards and regulations at the operational level. While PlT's environmental arrangement
is satisfactory, the staff will need more skills and experience to properly apply and execute the safety
and environmental regulations resulting from the above study. Therefore, the proposed project includes
about US$150,000 to train PTT's environmental and safety staff. During the negotiations, agreement
was re: ched with PTT that it will carry out the training program for its staff by March 31, 1995.
3.15       The number of people expected to be resettled within the five meter right-of-way is about
40. During the negotiations, PTT and the Bank agreed on "Principles for Payment of Compensation
and Relocation" of the affected persons under the project. A field survey conducted by the Bank's



-19-
Resetlement Specialist after negotiations has confirmed that the number of affected people will be
approximately 40. Furthermore, some structures such as shacks and animal sheds would also need to
be acquired. For most of the route, the pipeline will be built in the existing EGAT right-of-way, which
is well protected and maintained. However, if, on the basis of subsequent detailed surveys, it is found
that the number of affected people is substantially more than the numbers indicated in the information
currently available, the same principles of payment of compensation and resettlement would be applied
for them. It was agreed that in that case, PTT and the Bank would, however, need to revisit the issue
of compensation and resettlement.
F. Project lmplementation and Schedule
3.16       PTT will assume overall responsibility and control of project implementation (see Annex
5, Project Implementation Organization). In the past, it has implemented several similar projects
including the construction of the existing 34-inch offshore pipeline and the Bongkot Gas Transmission
projects, both financed by the Bank. PIT has appointed Bechtel International Inc. to assist in carrying
out all stages of the project implementation cycle. PTT personnel will also be assigned to the project
for on-the-job training and other selected tasks.
3.17       The critical-path master schedule prepared by PTT and Bechtel calls for completing the
physical works by March 1996 (Annex 4). This schedule may be somewhat optimistic, although the
work has progressed according to this timetable until now. However, to allow for the possibility of
delays during testing and commnssioning, the project completion date is assumed to be June 30, 1997.
G. Projet Cos
3.18       The project is estimated to cost the equivalent of US$674.5 million, including taxes and
duties (US$22.2 million) and interest during construction (US$75.1 million). Foreign exchange costs
total US$565.6 million or 84% of total costs. Table 3.1 gives a breakdown of project costs by major
components. The estinate is based on 1993 prices and many items reflect the acal prices or those
provided through informal but firm quotations. A 10% physical contingency has been added to the base
cost estimate and price contingencies of 3.2% and 6% have been applied to the foreign and local cost
components of the base cost plus physical contingenr v. respectively. The physical contingency is
adequate considering the advanced stage of project desil. .. 4 the fact that pipeline engineering and
material involve few uncertainties. While the physical contiugency allowance for the construction
contract may need to be higher than 10%, the allowance could be lower for pipeline material; therefore,
an average of 10% is considered adequate. The price contingencies are based on Bank guidelines for
intemational price increases (for foreign exchange costs) and the Bank's projection for price increases in
Thailand (for local costs). Taxes and duties were based on an average rate of 40% on all goods subject
to such rbarges. The interest during construction is calculated based on PIT's financing plan, applying
appropriate interest rates and the grace period of each lender, and assuming that interest will be accrued
only after funds are disbursed.

H. Project fTh Cindg Plan
3.19         Total fmnaning required, including interest during construction (estimated at US$75.1
million based on the 4-year implementation period), would be US$674.5 million (see Table 3.2). The
finacing plan has been developed on the basis of discussions with PIT, the Export-Import Bank of
Japan (JEXIM), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The
procurement packages were designed to take into account the various co-lenders' internal requirement3,
the project implementation schedule, and IT's concern regarding its large exposure to non-dollar hard
curren-y, particularly the Japanese yen.

3.20        The Bank loan would fnance the construction of the offshore pipeline as well as
engineering and project management consultancy contracts, studies and training (US$155.0 million).
ADB and JEXIM would joiindy finance about 72% of the cost of the pipeline materials (linepipe) and
coating contract, and the EIB would finance the construction of the onshore pipeline. The proposed
Bank loan of US$155.0 million would be made directly to PIT at the Bank's standard terms for
Thailand. PIyT would bear the foreign exchange and variable interest rate risks, which would be
guaranteed by the Government. The Bank loan would be for 17 years, including four years of grace at
the Bank's variable interest rate. The loan would finance 23% of the total project financing required
and 27% of its foreign expenditures.
3.21        Since the Bank loan will become effective after the ADB/JEXIM and BIB loans, it was
agreed that PIT would promptly notify the Bank when the respective loan become effective (the EIB
Loan Agreement stipulates cross-effectivuiess with the Bank loan).
I. Procurement and Disbursement

3.23          The following four major contacts comprise the bulk of the procuremen:
(a)    Supply and delivery of pipeline material and coating contract (with a total estmated cost
of US$275.3 million, US$200 million of which is being financed by ADB-JEXIM and the
balance by PMT), which is being awarded under international competitive bidding ([CB)
according to the ADB's procurement guidelines;



-23-
(b)   Engineering consultancy and project management contract (US$33.5 million), a Bank-
financed component, which has already been awarded by PTT according to the Bank's
procurement guidelines for the use of consultants;
(c)   Construction of the onshore pipeline contract (US$47 million, financed by EIB), which
will be awarded according to ElB's procurement procedures; and
(d)   Construction of the offshore pipeline contract (US$149.6 million, of which US$119.7
million is financed by IBRD), which will be procured through ICB according to the
Bank's procurement guidelines and using the Bank's standard bidding documents.
3.24       Various equipment and miscellaneous items, including compressors, are also needed for
the project. These items would be supplied and installed by PIf's contractors. PTT would also
procure land, civil works and buildings in accordance with its own procurement procedures, which are
satisfactory to the Bank. The remaining consultancies included in the project would be selected and
appointed according to the Bank's guidelines for use of consultants.
3.25       All civil works and engineering-management consultant services contracts would be subject
to Bank's prior review except studies and training conts for the employment of consulting firms
estmated to cost less than US$100,000 or for the employment of individuals estimated to cost less than
US$50,000.
3.26       Disbursement. Loan disbursement is based on the assumption that the loan will become
effective in the first quarter of the Bank's fiscal year 1995. The estimated disbursement of the Bank
loan is smmized in Table 3.4 below. It is expected that it will be fully disbursed by June 30, 1997
(para. 3.17), the scheduled completion date of the project. On this basis, the closing date is set for
December 31, 1997. The scheduled disbursements are faster than the standard profiles for the region
and the subsector, reflecting the advanced stage of project preparation. Phasing of the estimated
disbursements and the Bank's standard disbursement profile for the subsector are shown in Annex 7.

3.27       Due to a tight project implementation schedule and the critica nature of the engineering
consultancy and management services, PTT had to advance its contract with Bechtel. Furthermore,
advanced procurement action for offshore pipeline construction contracts would also be needed.
Therefore, retroactive financing equal to US$15 million is recommended for expenses incurred after
September 1, 1993, to partially reimburse amounts of the consultancy and offshore construction
contracts, already paid by PIT through advanced contracting approved by the Bank.
3.28       The Bank loan would be disbursed against the categories outlined in Table 3.5 below:

3.29         All disbursements would be made against full documentation.  To the extent possible,
withdrawal applications should be consolidated into amounts of US$1.0 million equivalent or more,
prior to submission to the Bank.
J. Monitoring, Reportng and Supervision
3.30        The Bank will monitor the progress of the proposed project in terms of physical execution
and financial reportng to ensure that all conditions of the proposed loan are satisfied. For this purpose,
the Bank would, on average, conduct two supervision missions per year during the active project phase
to review project implementation, inspect job-site activities and discuss, as required, any related matters
with Government and PTT officials. In addition, PIT would be required to forward periodic progress
reports. During negotiations, agreement was reached with PITT regarding the format, content and
frequency of these reports.  The basic requirement would be quarterly progress reports for each
applicable project component and PIT's semi-anmual and anmnal financial and auditors' reports as
defined in para. 4.18.
3.31        Project supervision by the Bank would be coordinated through a supervision plan
presented in Annex 8, and confirmed during loan negotations. Bank field supervision would require
about 44 staff-weeks during the life of the project, of which about 28 would be needed during the first
two years of implementation. Supervision would be carried out mainly by Bank technical and financial
staff, which would include an enviromental specialist.



THE BORROWER
A. Background
4.1          The borrower of the proposed loan will be the Petroleum  Authority of Thailand (PTT)
which was incorporated as a State Enterprise under Petroleum Act of Thailand (BE 2521) in 1978 for
the purposes of developing the oil and gas sector and enhancing Thailand's fuel security.-' It is wholly
owned by the Kingdom of Thailand and falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry. It
became operational in July of 1979.
4.2          The role of PTT has been critical in developing Thailand's oil and gas sector which has
grown substantially through private and public sector initiatives. PTT's man area of activity is in the
transportation of oil and gas and distribution of petroleum. It is involved in (a) upstream operations
through PTT Exploration and Production Co., LTD (PTTEP), a wholly-owned subsidiary which was
established to handle petroleum exploration and production activities and (b) downstream activities
through various joint ventures.Y Table 4.1 provides a list of PTT's joint ventures and the percentage
of PfT's share in each entity.

B. Organization
4.3        PTT reorganized in January of 1992. Its current structure consists of four business units
and a head office. The organizational chart of PTT is available in the anmex. The business units are:
(a) Oil Marketing (including logistics and transportation, trading, refming and marketing); (b) Natural
Gas; (c) Petrochemicals; and (d) Central Services. Petrochemicals is a fairly small operations and
Central Services provides technical and construction support to other operations. One of the purposes
of the restructuring of PTr was to create separate profit centers as an interim step to PTT's eventual
corporatization or privatization of the various business units. Each unit operates on a commercial basis
and is responsible for PTT's interaction with the joint ventures in the respective fields. The head office
is responsible for the overall corporate planning, project preparation and corporate finance.
4.4        In October 1993, PTT's Board expanded from 11 to 15 members, increasing the number
of appointees by the cabinet from five to nine. As such, this may potentially reduce PTT's autonomy,
which had gradually increased in the last few years.
4.5        The Governor and the Chairman of the Board of Pff are appointed by the Council of
Ministers, upon the recommendation of the line Ministry. With the exception of the current Govemnor,
who has risen through the ranks of PTT, previous governors were from outside of PMT. Board
members are generally high level civil servants and include representatives from the Ministries of
Finance, Industry, Transport and Communications and the Juridical Council. The Directors act in a
part-time capacity. PMT also has an executive committee, consisting of the Chainnan of the Board and
five Directors. The Executive Committee meets frequendy and is empowered to make decisions on
investments, contracts, staffing and other operational matters.
4.6        The management team within PIT consists of the Governor and three deputy governors in
charge of Finance, Corporate Policy & Planning, and Human Resources. Below the deputy Governors
are vice presidents responsible for the day-to-day operations in finance, planning, and human resources.
The Vice Presidents of each business unit report directly to the Governor. In addition to the permaent
Executive Committee of the Board, PTT also uses ad hoc anl standing committees to analyze specific
issues. Vertical communication between top management and line managers is adequate though some of
the policy and operational procedures, especially since the reorganization, have not yet been fully
formulated and communicated to staff in writing. This has caused some overlap of activities,
particularly between the business units and the head office. This issue will be reviewed and addressed
as part of the proposed corporatization study.
4.7        Overall, PIT is a well-run entity. Because of its strong financial performance and
efficient operation, PTT has met Ministry of Finance's criteria for a "good state enterprise" and,
therefore, freed from some common requirements of the public sector, such as pay scales, bonumses and
reward systems, recruitment, and promotion and procurement procedures. Also, PIT has ioduced
commercial practices in many areas of its operations and is currently experimenting with such initiatives
as cost management program, introduction of business performance measures, etc. Despite these, PIT
still has to meet a number of conditions that are required of all state enterprises but which at times
conflict with a fully commercial approach. For instance, stringent and time-consuming budgetary,
financial and accounting requirements of the Ministry of Finance still absorb a large proportion of



-27-
management time. In addition, decisions concerning the investment plan and financing venues continue
to be frequently determined by the Government. These still limit PTr's autonomy and independence.
C. Staffimg and Training
4.8        PTT's staff totaled 3,600 at the end of fiscal year 1993 and this number has been steadily
declining since 1989 (Table 4.2). The skills mix has also undergone a significant change. The number
of university graduates has risen from 1,239 in 1988 to 1,700 in 1993, while the number of low skilled
staff has declined from 1,573 to 1,000. This underlies PIT's attention to improving the quality and the
productivity of its staff. Given PTT's expansion in assets and lines of operations, this decline indicates
a de facto downsizing. PTT has also an active training program. In addition to in-house courses and
programs within Thailand, in 1992 and 1993, 120 and 160 of PTT's staff attended various training
programs overseas, among them executive management programs at reputable universities in the United
States. However, the Bank and PTT have agreed to strengthen the areas of project analysis, planning,
investment programming, corporate finance and financial systems, which are incorporated into the

4.9        For several years, with Thailand's economic boom, PIT encountered a high level of turn-
over of experienced staff. Under the system in place through FY91, PTr was bound by the
government salary scale which remained out of pace with opportunites offered in the private sector.
After attaining the 'efficient enterprise" status, PTT has changed its salary structure. In 1992 and
1993, PTT increased staff salaries by an average of 29.7% and 37%, respectively. The overall
objective is to keep salaries within 80% of private sector levels, which, combined with benefits
generally in the purview of the public sector, such as job security and generous pensions, should
maintin PIT's competitiveness.
D. Operations and Mnagement
4.10       Accounting System. P7T's accounting system is adequate and conforms with general
modern oil and gas industry practices. The natural gas fnancial accounts are modelled after US gas
industry principles. PIT maintains separate accounts for the Oil, Gas, Central Services and Head
Office. The accounts for the business units are prepared by the accounting and finance division of the
respective organization and aggregated at the head office. Accounting applications such as general



-28-
ledger, payroll, inventory transactions, accounts payable, and accounts receivable have been fully
computerized. PITT prepares annual budgets for its capital and operating expenditures; it also prepares
five-year forecasts for facial planning purposes.  Periodic reports are also prepared, enabling
management to compare actual results against budgeted amounts. The budget process has been
operating satisfactorily. Nevertheless, with the expansion of its own operations as well as its growing
involvement in joint ventures, PTT may have already outgrown its current accounting and financial
system. These could be enhanced and expanded to incorporate more on-line linkages to the various
subaccounts to allow for a substantially faster and more accurate means of consolidating various
operations and to provide management with the flexibility to retrieve critical information on a timely
basis. This will be addressed under the assessment of ?TT's organizational setting which will be
carried out under the proposed corporatization study (see paras. 4.23-4.28).
4.11       PITT has a good record in project cost control, implementation and management. It has
been borrowing from the Bank since its inception and is very familiar with the Bank's procurement and
disbursement guidelines. In the past, processing of bid docments, bid evaluations and award of
contracts have been carried out efficientl' and on time.
4.12       Accounting Practices and Principles. PITT prepares its accounts in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles of Thailand which are in concurrence with the range of
accounting principles recognized by the international accounting standards (LAS) for reporting
tiansaction. In general, PTT recognizes assets, liability, equity, revemnes and expenses on accrual
basis. Inventories are valued on a first-in, first-out method. The straight-line method is used for
depreciation of property, plant and equipment over 30,000 Baht. Those below this amount are
expensed in the acquisition year.
4.13       Like many other countries, the Thai accounting principles differ in several instances from
the LAS, as the LAS principles are not compulsory for countries to adopt.9' The main differences
between IAS and Thai accountng principles that would have an impact on PIT's accounts are (i)
accounting for retirement benefits, and (ii) accounting for investments in joint ventures and subsidiaries.
Regarding the former, PTT has a defined benefit plan for employees but is not required to calculate a
periodic pension cost based on accrued benefit valuation method. Concerning the latter, LAS
recommends different accounting methods for holdings below 20%, between 20%-50% and above 50%,
in consolidating a parent company's financial statements. Again, PIT's consolidated statements include
PTT's own operations and not its holdings in the various joint ventures and subsidiaries listed in Table
4.1 in accordance with the LAS recommended methods. Both of these practices, pension accounting and
consolidated statements, are likely to present a substantially different asset/liability picture for PIT
wiich cannot be assessed at the moment. In preparation for an evenual adaptation of these principles
by the Thai accounting standards board, these areas will be addressed in the design and enhancement of
the financial and accounting system that has been proposed under the proposed project (paras. 4.25 and
4.27).
4.14       PITT's accounting for foreign exchange losses is in accordance with LAS. PiTT's foreign
exchange exposure results from its operating (oil trading) and its borrowing activities. IAS and the
Thai accounting principle concur (for the period under review) that exchange differences arising from
operating activities be taken into income of the respective period. Exchange differences resulting from

balance sheet transactions, mainly long term debt, are recorded as deferred items and are amortized
over the remaining life of the respective itemA.2
4.15       Intenual Audit. PIT  has an office of internal audit with a staff of approximately 43
auditors of engineering, economic and finance background. It is an effective management tool and it
reports directly to the Governor. Its main activity has been to carry out post-implementation reviews of
PTT's major projects. As such, it has been functioning more as an operations evaluation unit than
internal audit, though it is technically responsible for audits of all of PTIT's operational work, including
accounting and financial functions, and compliance with various company policies and procedures. The
unit should further carry out routine compliance and performance audit of PITs policies and other
operations to highlight to management where further gains in efficiency can be made. These factors
will be incorporated into the corporatization study that has been proposed under the project.
4.16       Under the previous loan, PITT agrctx; to recruit 3 additional engineers. However, the
resources of the unit may need to be further increased to allow for hiring of specialized consultants in
areas where PTT's in-house expertise in the internal audit unit may not be sufficient nor economically
viable to employ on a permanent basis (PTT has agreed to this). Furthermore, PTT may want to
consider rotation of staff into and out of the unit to bolster the units image as well as staff moral.
4.17       Extera Audit. PTIT's external audit has in the past been performed by the Office of the
Auditor General (AG) which is responsible for auditing all state enterprises. The audit is performed in
accordance with accepted accounting and auditing standards in Thailand (see para. 4.12). The AG will
continue to carry out PIT's formal audit which is acceptable to the Bank.
4.18       PIT is attempting to become a world class oil and gas company and is continuing to
improve its organization to fulfill its role as a modem and competitive energy company of international
standing. As part of this process, PTY has recognized the usefulness of preparing also financial
statements that conform to international accounting standards so that a meaningful comparison can be
made between its finacial position and performance and those of its comparators. While the Auditor
General will continue to carry out the official audit, PfI has agreed that its accounts be reviewed by an
international accounting firm experienced in oil and gas sector and prepare a long form report that will
highlight the differences and restate the financial statements in conformity with IAS. The preparation of
the long form report will commence with the 1993 fiscal year (but for some accounts, it may be
necessary to go back several years). During the negotiations, it was agreed that PFIT will submit to the
Bank the audit report of the Auditor General within six months of the close of each fiscal year. The
supplemented long-forms report will be submitted within three months after that date.
4.19       Insurance.  PIT carries adequate insurance against loss or damage of property and
subsequent business interruptions which could cause serious financial risk. It also carries insurance
against third party legal liabilities, protection of cargoes and against delays or damage in transportation,
and coverage against catastrophic losses. Under the previous Bank project, PTT obtained insurance for
the constuction of the projects through the contractor. However, PTT is now able to obtain the same
level of coverage at substantal savings if it directly accesses the market. PT" will ensure that the

coverage against various risks and the amounts are consistent with appropriate practice in the sector and
acceptable to the Bank.
4.20       Taxes. PTT is required to retnit a portion of its net income to the Government as
determined by the Ministry of Finance. The average tax rate in the past has been between 30-35 %. In
order for PTT to comply with the "efficient enterprise" classification of the Ministry of Finance, PTT
will have to remit 30% of it net revenues.
4.21       Also in the past, the Government  las reimbursed PTT for custom duties of imported
equipment and materials in the form of equity contributions. This practice will not continue as the
Government does not plan to provide PTr with such a concession nor contribute to PTT's equity. PTT
will in the future cover these costs from its own resources.
4.22       Management Information System.  Prior to reorganization, PTT's Management
Information System (MIS) consisted of six separate systems, some of which were inherited from PTT's
parent organization. These systems included a SCADA system which monitors the operations of the
gas separation plant and pipeline systems, a finance and accounting system, a management information
system, a marketing system, and two data systems - one for oil and one for gas. As the need arose to
integrate the systems to facilitate the transfer of information within the head office and between the head
office and the business units, the last Bank project provided a technical assistance component to assist
PTT in carrying out a thorough study to assess its hardware and software needs. For the first phase of
the MIS project, PMT was able to obtain grant funds. The study was finalized in November and is
being reviewed by PIT. PTT plans to secure additional grant funds for the implementation of the
second phase as well.
4.23       Corporate Retudctng  and Insfituional St            ng  Study.  The issue of
privatizimg PTT has played center stage in many Bank lending operations and its sector work. As
discussed in para. 2.12, nearly all the upstream and many downstream activities in Thailand's
hydrocarbon sector are privately held. In the upstream sector, exploration and pr4duction is dominated
by private foreign companies, such as TOTAL, UNOCAL, etc. PTTEP, a subsidiary of PTT in the
upstream sector, is a newcomer and fairly small. Similarly, the downstream sector is controlled by a
large number of private companies. While PTT's role has definitely been critical in developing the
sector, it has done so through joint ventures and under separate legal and operational structures, often
with minimal interference in the activities of the entitiesAl' With the exception of three companies,
PTT is a minority owner in most of its joint ventures. PTT has also taken steps to gradually divest of
some of its interest in the subsidiaries and joint ventures. In May 1993, PfT sold 15% of PTTEP's
shares which met with success. PTT has further obtained permission from the Govemment to divest of
51% of Thai Aromatics. What today remains in sole state ownership is the oil and gas transportation
activity. In the oil marketing operation, PTT competes with a number of international oil marketing
companies, such as Shell, Esso, etc.
4.24       Internally, PIT has been undergoing significant transformations to develop a more
conducive institutional setting for an eventual corporatization/privatization. PIT's reorganization in
1992 was one such step intended to create separate business units which could in time be divested.
1I/ In fact, one of the findins of the recently completed report (pam. 4.24) is t hM  has taken a much too passive posture
vis-a-vis its joint ventures.



-31-
Other measures include introduction of a wide range of commercial practices common in similar
companies world wide. While the need for and the speed of privatization of various state enterprises is
being considered and discussed at the cabinet level, as privatization of state enterprises in the end is a
political decision,A PIT initiated a 'diagnostic' study to evaluate its medium to long term role and
options within Thailand's oil and gas sector, and to propose appropriate proactive (internal and extemal)
institutional measures and ownership arrangements that can best support these objectives.'   The
report concludes that further commercialization of PIT within the existing structure of the sector would
only achieve improvements at the margin and is unlikely to bring about any significant changes.
Neither is privatization of PTT a viable option for the near term due to the fact that a large portion of
PIT's investments are at mid-stream for which the Government will not be able to obtain an optimal
return if sold prior to completion. The lack of an appropriate regulatory body in the hydrocarbon
sector may be a further contributing factor which may limit private sector interest. Corporatization of
PTT, however, is the most practical and feasible option which could create not only a more autonomous
institution but also help pave the way for an eventual full or partial privatization if and when such a
decision is taken by the cabinet. These steps would facilitate the inflow of private resources into the
sector and help finance the substantial investment program of the coming years.
4.25        The study further tables a number of issues such as the need for PTT to take a value
maximzing approach to its investments and clearly separate between its commercial and developmetl
roles; delegate further autonomy to the business units; identify PT's core competencies and long-
term core business objectives and develop appropriate strategies for the various business lines; review
PIT's relationship to and interaction with its joint ventures and the Government, etc. While the thrust
of the study's argument and the issues raised are sound, given the limited resources which were
available for the diagnostic phase of the study (US$ 300,000 of grant funds from ADB), there is need
for considerably more in-depth analysis of the issues, development of concrete measures and action
plans, and the necessary means for the implementation of the recommendations. Therefore, the
proposed project includes a US$1.5 milPon component to build on the findings of the diagnostic study
to (a) systematically evaluate PIT's options and prepare an action plan for its future corporatization and
investment strategy at the corporate and business unit levels; (b) assess the effectiveness of PIT's
organizational setting including a more detailed assessment of PIT's core business activities and the
ensuing strategy; (c) study the most appropriate means of potential di esdture of PIT through either an
initial public offerings in the domestic and foreign equity market, strategic sale, or gradual dilution of
public shares; (d) evaluate PTT's financing and financial structure, and preparation of PIT to access
independently international credit markets without Government guarantee; and (e) explore the potental
of converting PTT into a common carrier for transportation of gas.
4.26       The above represents a preliminary identification of issues that wil be covered in the
proposed conponent. However, detailed terms of reference for the study are now being developed
jointly by the Bank and PTT. During negotiations, the Bank and PIT agreed on the main areas to be
included in the final terms of reference of the study. It was agreed that the detailed terms of reference
of the study will be finalized by November 1, 1994, after the planned discussion with the Government
(on the result of the diagnostic study already completed). It was further agreed that appointment of

consultants will be finalized by Decenber 1, 1994, and tha the findings and     ions of
Corporate Restructuring and Institutional Strengthening Study will be submitted to the Bank for its
review and comments by July 31, 1995. Furthermore, an understanding was reached with PIT that it
will cooperate with and encourage the Government to implemen the actions recommended in the stdy.
4.27       Another component under the proposed project provides about US$350,000 to upgrade the
skills of PIT staff in project analysis, investment programming, corporate fimance and finacial
systems. While PTT's planning and finance depatuents have highly motivated and competent staff,
key individuals would benefit from additional training. At present, economic and financial analyses are
based on input variables such as international price estimation that are based on i-house data rather
than on more systematic and interationally recognized data and methodologies. SimlDarly, PlT's
finance department staff can benefit from upgrading their skills in corporate finance and from studying
various options for developing more appropriate financing systems. During negotiations, it was agreed
with PIr to finance, under this component, training expenses of PIT staff, as well as short-term
consultant services which may be necessary to assess PIT's existing planning and financial systems and
modifying them to PfIT's growing needs.
4.28       The project would also include US$150,000 for training PTT staff in the application of
safety and environmental standards, which are now being developed through a study funded under Loa
3508-TH. The need for this training is discussed in para. 3.14.

5.2             During the 1988-1993 period, PITT's revenue nearly doubled from Baht 41 billion to Baht
86 billion, translating in a real growth of around 10 percent per year, largely due to the increase in
revenues from the oil marketing operation. Oil sales volume increased from 4,770 million liters in 1989
to about 13,779 million liters in 1993, a 23.6% real growth per annum. Nominal sales rose from Baht
30 million in 1988 to Baht 64 million in 1993. Although oil sales constitute about 75 % of gross revenue
and gas sales for about 23%, PTT derives much of its profit from the gas business. Net profit of the gas
business as percentage of gross gas sales has averaged around 19-20% since 1990 while that of the oil
marketing business has been at most 3-5 %.
5.3             Operating ratio (defined as total operating expenses excluding interest, taxes and foreign
exchange losses to total revenue) fell from 91.8%  in 1990 to 89%  in 1992 but climbed up to 90.1%  in
the fiscal year of 1993. Administrative expenses have remained at a reasonable level even though its ratio
to sales has increased from 2.7% in 1988 to 3.6% in 1993. However, revenue generated per employee
has doubled during the same period, which is a more significant indicator. The change in staff profile
(see para. 4.8) is one of the main factors for the increase in productivity.
5.4             During the past five years, PTT's financial performance has been solid. Assets (on book
value basis) grew from Baht 32.4 billion ($1.3 billion) in 1988 to 59.3 billion Baht ($2.4 billion) in 1993.
Equity increased from Baht 8.5 billion ($300 million) to 26 billion Baht ($1 bi11ion). The growth of
equity has been achieved solely through retained earnings and without any new equity contributions frm
the Government. In fact, the share of accumulated contributions from the Government declined
drastically from 28.7% to 12.6%. Return on average assets in operation for 1992 and 1993 has been
19.1% and 26.6% respectively. Retumn on average equity increased from 18.7% in 1988 to 19.6% in
1990 bu; declined sligthtly to 18.9% in 1993A'
5.5             PTT's financial stucture is appropriate.  The current ratio rose to 1.9 in 1991 but
declined to 1.5 in 1993 primarily due to an increase in the current portion of long-term loans. Days
receivables (total receivables/average daily sales) and days inventory (total inventories/average daily cost
of goods sold) showed improvements and declined from 50 and 17, respectively, in 1988, to 30 and 14
in 1992, but climbed to 39 and 19 in 1993. Long term liabilities over equity has been below 60:40 ratio
on revalued asset basis. In 1993, this ratio was 32:68. On a book value basis, the ratio is 56:44.1

achieved throuh internal efficiency, namely higher margin and better utilization of asset, even with a more conservative leveage
ratio. Over the 1988-93 period, net margin rose from 3% to 6% anm h-et utilization (measuring sales per unit of assets) increased
inWally from 1.3 in 1988 to 1.8 in 1990 and declined to 1.45 in 1993. PrT's financial leverage during the same period became
more conservative, declining from 3.8 in 1988 to 2.4 in 1993. HIad PTT maintained a sinilar leverage ratio in 1993 as in 1988,
the retan on equity would have been as high as 30%.

5.6          PTT has been recipient of several Bank loans and has complied with Bank financial
covenants. As stipulated under the latest Bank loan (Loan No. 3508-TH), PTT was to maintain a self-
financing ratio (SFR) of 25%, a debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.3, a current ratio (CR) of 1.1,
and a debt:equity ratio (DER) of 60:40 on revalued asset basis. PIT has complied with the required
financial covenants. Calculation of the self-financing ratio based on audited statements places this ratio
around 72%, which is in excess of the 25% stipulated under the project. Unaudited 1993 data places SFR
around 48%. Several explanations can be given as to why this ratio has been rather erratic in the past.
First, until 1990, PTT did not break down its long term loans as received and repaid. Secondly, PTT's
investments are lumpy and implementation cannot be "smoothed" over several years to present a better
self-financing ratio. Third, small delays or shifts in the implementation schedule can substantially swing
the ratio.
5.7          During the 1988-93 period, PTT's investment plan amounted to about Baht 27 billion
($1.08 billion). At a higher than projected rate, PTT financed this investment by contributing around
70% of the cost from its internal cash generation during the period, which is one other reason for the
substantially conservative leverage (Table 5.2).

5.8          PTT's total net long term borrowing increased only modestly over this period by about
$300 million. At the end of 1993, nearly one third of total outstanding debt was denominated in Yen.
Since the Baht floats against the US Dollar, in the past, PTT has experiencmd foreign exchange losses on
its Yen operations and liabilities. In accordance with Thai accounting practices, PTT defers losses on
the revaluation of loans for completed projects and amortizes these throughout the life of the loans (see
para. 4.14). At the end of 1993, accumulated deferred currency losses amounted to Baht 3 billion and
are offset against shareholder's equity. PTT has taken measures to manage its currency risk exposure
to Yen by financing its projects through more dollar-denominated loans and through currency swaps.
Despite some foreign exchange losses, PTT's debt service ratio has been satisfactory and has ranged from
between 2.4-3.2.
5.9          PTT has also accessed the local credit markets. Table 5.3 below, demonstrates the issues,
maturity, coupon and terms of PTT's bond issues. In 1992 and 1993, it accessed the local bond market
and floated four issues which are listed below.

PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benerts
6.1        As discussed in para. 2.7, Thailand will face a continuous gas deficit for the foreseeable
future (including through the life of the proposed project). To cope with this situation, the Government
is adjusting the allotment to EGAT, which uses over 90% of the country's total gas supply, while
providing industrial consumers (which use the balance) with their full gas requirements. The economics
of the proposed project is a function of the economic value of the gas to EGAT in its power expansion
plans. EGAT's fuel choices are limited. Large hydro-power projects are not viable because they
present major environmental and resetdement problems. Domestic coal (lignite), even if developed to
its full potential, would not be able to supply the fuel needed for the projected power demand.
Moreover, its economic ranking, even without any pollution control equipment, at US$4. 1,er kWh,
ranks this fuel lower than natural gas (at US$3.994per kWh). When the costs of such equipment are
included, the cost of lignite-based power, at US$5.06iper kWh, makes it uncompetitive, regardless of
its availability. Power that is produced with imported coal, at a cost of US$5.16iper kWh (assuming
no pollution control equipment is included), is more costly than that produced with lignite; however,
where lignite or gas are not available, imported coal becomes the long-term "replacement" fuel because
it is readily available in the international market, relatively low cost, and its future price is not expected
to rise significantly. Finally, power produced with low-sulphur fuel oil, at a cost of US$5.7tper kWh
(without pollution control equipment), rns lower than both the lignite and imported coal.
6.2        Therefore, domestic naural gas utilized in the combined-cycle power plant represents the
least-cost fuel for power generation, primarily because the use of gas in such plants enhances thermal
efficiency.
6.3        Economic Benefits. The project's internal economic rate of return (IERR) is based on its
incremental costs and benefits. The former include: (a) capital and operation and maince (O&M)
costs associated with gas development and production and (b) capital and O&M costs of gas gathering
and transmission system. The estimated capital costs for gas development and production are based on
plans and the definitve cost estimate prepared by each producer and approved by PTT, which includes
the cost of various drilling activities and of the installation of surface facilities to develop and produce
the quantity of gas required over the life of the project (20 years). The O&M costs for gas
development and production are based on the estimate submitted by the producers, reflecting their 12
years of experience in Thailand's fields. The basis for the pipeline's capital costs is discussed in para.
3.18, and its O&M costs are assumed to be 3% of the capital costs.
6.4        The incremental benefits of the proposed project are based on the econonic value of
mnarginal gas supply. The economic value consists of the netback value of gas used in EGAT's
combined-cycle power plants, when it is assumed that gas would substitute for a low-sulphur coal (and
adjusted for the differential in thermal efficiency, see Annex 11).-A'fl
I6/ In Tailand's power sector, impoed coal is assumed to be the long-term energy source and, thus, the replacement fuel for
gas.
17/ See Annex 12 for the economic value of gas used in the indusgy.



-38-
6.5        For the base case, the IERR calculated is 36%. Details, including the assumptions used,
are given in Annex 11. This high rate of return is largely due to the high efficiency of natural gas in
combined-cycle power plants.
6.6        The analysis of the sensitivity of the IERR to the underlying assumptions indicates that if
capital and O&M costs increase by 20%, the IERR will decrease to only 31%. Hence, the project
would have to incur exceptionally high development and production costs (together, these two constitute
the main project risks due to complex reservoir geology), in order to render the project uneconomic.
The sensitivity of EERR to other assumptions is the following:
IERR (%)
(a) Capital and O&M costs rise by 20%;              31%
(b) Gas supply drops by 10%;                        28%
(c) Capital and O&M costs increase by 20% and       24%
gas supply decreases by 10%,
6.7        The financial rate of return is calculated at 16% (see Annex 11). This calculation is based
on the capital and operating costs estimated in the project cost table, including taxes and duties. The
purchasing costs (of gas) are based on the ij _.vidual sales-purchase agreement contracts (between PTT
and the gas producers) and the Bank assumption regarding the future values of different indices used in
the agreements. PTT's revenue estimates are based on the price of gas sold to EGAT, which ensures it
a rate of return of at least 12%.
6.8        Environmental Benefits. An added benefit (although not quantified here) of the proposed
infirastructure investment is d<rived from the impact natural gas will have on the environment. Without
the proposed project, EGAT would use either lignite or fuel oil to generate power. Natural gas is a
cleaner and less polluting fuel; as it will be increasingly available, partieularly in the Bangkok area (and
progressively in other parts of the country), air quality will significantly improv- s emissions of, inter
alia, SO2 and particulates will be reduced. The new gas-fired power plants will substitute for fuel oil or
coal-fired stations.
B. Risks
6.9        Project risks involve three areas: (a) the availability of sufficient gas reserves and the
costs of producing them; (b) potential disputes in various contractual arrangements between PIT and
gas producers; and (c) the safety and enviromnental problems. The gas reserves have been assessed and
certified by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a company well respected in this area; thus, the risk of
insufficient reserves is low. The potential increase in production costs stems from the complex nature
of the reservoirs (para. 2.3). However, this risk was mitigated because contingencies were included in
the cost parameters and because Unocal has substantial experience producing gas (since 1981). The
potential for disputes is minimal because contracts among the various parties are governed by industry
norms that prevail in international markets; also, due to the great demand for gas, the parties involved
in buying and selling gas have little reason to abrogate the contracts. With regard to safety and
environmental risks, these have been mitigated through contingency plans prepared and agreed with
PIT in the EIA report.



RECOMMENDATION
7.1        With the above agreements and assurances, the proposed project constitutes a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$155.0 million equivalent to PTT, with the guarantee of the Kingdom of
Thailand, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate for a 17-year term including a four-year grace
period.

SECOND GAS    SMISSION PROJECT
Geology and Petroleum Potential of Thailand
and Adjoining Basins
Thailand's Basins
1.           Offshore. Trwo areas offshore Tbailand have potential for gas and possibly oil in
commercially viable quantities. By far the more significant at this time is the Gulf of Thailand. The
Thai portion includes several present day sedimentary basins (as contrasted to areas which may have
been basins in the geologic past but which have been diminished by regional uplift and subsequent
erosion). These basins are: Chumpon (West Kra) Basin; Songkhla (East Kra) Basin; Pattani Trough;
and the northern end of the Malay Basin. These basins are similar in most respects. They were formed
as extensional rift basins along h;ghly active lateral fault systems. They are filled with Cenozoic Age
elastic sediments (sends, silts, and shales) during the Paleocene to Pleistocene Epochs, i.e., the last 60
million years. The sedimentary environment was principally non-marine with near shore fluvial,
swamr, and lacustrine (lake and lagoon) deposits dominant. Thin coal seams are common. The basins
in thf Gulf of Thailand are separated by intervening highs or ridges where Cenozoic sediments are thin
due o non-deposition and/or erosion and unconformably overlie older sediments of Mesozoic and/or
PlWeozoic age and in some areas volcanic terrain or crystalline basement.
2.           The fault movement which formed these basins has persisted through the Cenozoic but
has diminished over time with the Pleistocene and Recent deposition showing little effects of the fault
movement. During most of the Cenozoic, movement continued on the lateral faults and the stucral
forces within each basin alternated between compression (uplift and folding) and extension (subsidence
and sag). As each of these forces occurred, in turn the preceding structure was overprinted with the
later movement. At present each basin is paradoxically characterized by low relief features (both highs
and lows) which are highly faulted (normally extensive faulting is associated with high relief). Various
aspects of the stuctural geometry suggest that the latest movements were primarily extensional.
3.           With respect to hydrocarbons prospects, the basins in the Gulf of Thailand are all gas
prone. The only significant oil discovered thus far is in the southeastern portion of the Malay Basin
(offshore peninsular Malaysia) and even in this area gas remains a major component. Isolated oil
discoveries have been made in the Chumpon Basin (from pre-Cenozoic carbonates), the Songkhla Basin
(in Cenozoic clastic which appears to be non-commercial) and in the Pattani trough notably in reservoirs
in the shallower part of the Cenozoic section. A recent oil discovery, by Maersk et al, in the northern
Pattani trough (Tantawan-1) has the potential for becoming significant. High crustal heat flows,
associated with lateral fault tectonics, appears to have placed the bulk of the most prospective Cenozoic
interval in the over mature gas/condensate realm. The high heat flow regime interacting with the pre-
Cenozoic limestones (Ca C03) also appears to have generated significant quantities of carbon-dioxide
gas (CO2) which is associated with the hydrocarbon gas.
4.           The ten gas fields (Erawan in Unocal I; Baanpot, Satun, Platong, and Kaphong in
Unocal II; Funan, Jakrawan, Trat, and Surat in Unocal IH; and Bongkot), and six unevaluated
discoveries (Pladang in Unocal Il; Pakarang and Gomin in Unocal m; Pailin and Moragot in Unocal



-42-
Annex 2
Page 2 of 4
12/27; and Tantawan), as well as the approximately thirteen fields and unappraised discoveries in the
northwestern portion of the Malay Basin offshore peninsular Malaysia have strikingly similar
characternstics. The gas is reservoired in sandstones of the several types associated with river and river
mouth, lacustrine and shallow marine systems, i.e. fluvial-deltaic. Reservoirs in this depositional realm
(predominantly channel fill and bais) are limited in extent and are further subdivided by faulting. In
any given area scores to hundreds of individual reservoirs are productive. These may vary from just a
few acres to 2000 acres or more in areal extent but most are relatively small. Traps are formed by
fault closures, sand lenses, and anticlinal trap, with high side of fault closures being predominant. The
small size and complexity of traps requires a concentrated three-dimensional seismic survey to assist in
the drilling of optimally located wells, i.e. the most reserves tapped with the fewest penetrations.
5.           The salient points, given these geologic parameters, are that individual fields contain an
abundance of individual reservoirs of varying size, shape, and thickness, and that most individual
reservoirs are small. When placed on production, each reservoir depletes rather quickly. Since each
production well may penetrate from three to twenty plus reservoirs, workover recompletions are
commonly frequent. This, when coupled with the large number of platfonns and wells required, makes
both the cost of development and the cost of production relatively high (considerably more than is
normal for comparative field reserves).
6.           Elsewhere, the Thai portion of the Andaman Sea shelf containing perhaps several basins
has been lightly explored and potential for hydrocarbons in commercial quantities may exist but carries
a high degree of geologic risk. A recent discovery offshore Myanmar about 250 Km north of the Thai
border has upgraded the outlook for the offshore area west of the southern Thai peninsula. Details of
this discovery, made by Texaco in early 1992, are sparse but it appears that a substantial gas reservoir
was found in an Oligo-Miocene (mid Cenozoic) turbidite sand, i.e. submarine fan deposit, with a
thickness reputed to be in excess of 100 m (330 feet). Further exploration and development will be
required to determine its significance as well as any effect it may have regarding Thai potential in the
Andaman Sea.
7.           Onshore. The petroleum geology of onshore Thailand falls into two distinct categories.
These are a series of north/south trending Cenozoic Basins in the westem half of mainland Thailand,
which became present day inter-montane basins in the north, and the large Khorat Basin in the northeast
which is filled with older Mesozoic and Paleozoic strata. The Cenozoic basins in the west include the
North Bangkok area (Suphan Buri and Kamphaeng Basins), the Petchabun Basin, the Phitsanulok Basin,
and the Lampang, Chingmai, Phrae, and Fang intermontane basins. While these Cenozoic basins are
similar in most respects to those in the Gulf of Thailand, they appear to be oil prone. A major oil
field, Sirikit, plus seven minor fields which have been found in the Phitsanulok Basin, to date are the
most prolific of the onshore basins in Thailand. Small and relatively insignificant oil fields have been
found in the Supl"an Buri, Kanphaeng, Petchabun, and Fang Basins. All of these produce from Oligo-
Miocene sand reservoirs deposited in a non-marine, predominantdy lacustrine environment. Individual
reservoirs are small. The large field, Sirikit, is typified by a large number of stacked reservoirs and a
relatively thick and extensive source rock of Oligo Miocene lacustrine shales. Additional potential for
hydrocarbons in the onshore Cenozoic Basins is obvious but the bulk is likely to be found as small oil
fields with marginal commerciality due to the limited area and thickness of the Cenozoic section.
Several more moderate size accumulations approaching the Sirikit level are possible but not likely.
8.           The Khorat Basin covers a large portion of northeast Thailand. The basin sediments are
comprised of a thick section of Mesozic Cretaceous red beds (oxidized sandstone and shale) with



-43-
Annex 2
Page 3 of 4
relatively thin interbedded evaporites (anhydrite, gypsum, and salt). This interval has minimal
petroleum potential unless sourced by non-oxidized beds from below. The Cretaceous red beds
unconformably overlie early Mesozoic and Paleozoic strata, in particular an extensive and thick blanket
of upper Paleozoic Permo-Carboniferous limestone and dolomite. It is this deep pre-Cretaceous section
that appears to be the most petroliferous. This section will likely be subdivided into several predecessor
basins as exploratory activity progresses. The pre-Cretaceous section appears to be structured by fault
blocks, with high blocks prospective and hydrocarbons sourced from the low blocks, with Triassic
shales, best developed in the lows providing the source. The Permo-Carboniferous limestone is the
only reservoir found to date. It is apparendy highly fractured, as noted in surface outcrop and in the
performance of the only field developed to date, i.e. Namphong gas field. Due to depth of burial and
generally elevated heat regime, the Khorat Basin is likely to be gas prone. Prospecting is difficult due
to the overprint of Cenozoic structuring by compressive forces obscuring the structure of the underlying
fault blocks. Reserves and field performance are difficult to evaluate due to the fractured reservoirs in
,which the bulk of the void space (porosity) consists of fractures. Gas recovery may be lowered by
active water drives resulting in vertical water coning near the producing wells. Because of its size, the
Khorat Basin has a large gas potential but it will take many years to fully evaluate.
9.           Three gas discoveries have been made in the Khorat Basin. The Namphong field is the
only commercial development. The two other fields are not currently considered commercial.
Exploration at relatively low levels is being conducted over a sizeable portion of the basin. It is
ineresting to note that te Nang Nuan oil discovery in the Chumpon Basin in the Gulf of Thailand is
productive from a similar fractured pre-Cenozoic limestorne. The Nang Nuan field evaluation is fraught
with the same problems of evaluation, i.e. water coning near the well bore.

10.          Malaysia. Most of the Malay Basin is located off the east cost of peninsula Malaysi.
As noted in para. 1, the northern end of this basin extends into Thai waters which includes the Bongkot
field and two unevaluated discoveries in the Thai/Malay Joint Development Area (IDA). Some 13 gas
fields with reputed reserves of approximately 20,000 bcf have been found to date in that portion of the
Malay Basin immediately south of the JDA. Only one of these, Jerneh field, has been developed to
date. The general geology is similar to that in the several basins further north in the Gulf of Thailand.
Apparently the individual sand reservoirs are somewhat more extensive and the structures somewhat
less faulted that in Thailand. This may be due to the greater marine influence on deposition and the
greater basin area (principally width) resulting in less intense structuring. Thus rapid depletion of
individual wells is expected to be less severe than in the basins to the north. However, these
observations are based largely on geologic perceptions since there has been no gas field production in
this part of the Malay Basin prior to 1992.
11.          Viet Nam and Cambodia. Viet Nam territory, both undisputed and disputed, covers
the northeastern portion of the Malay Basin, immediately to the east and southeast of Thai waters.
While discoveries in Malaysia and well-defined prospects in Thailand adjoin areas of Viet Nam claim,
essentially no exploration activity has yet taken place in this part of offshore Viet Nam. Similarly
Cambodia claims extend into the eastern flank of the productive Pattani Trough and the northernmost
portion of the Malay Basin. In Thailand Unocal's Kaphong (producing) and Trat (not yet on
production) fields adjoin Cambodia claims in the Pattani Tough and well-defined prospects in the
Bongkot area adjoin Cambodia claims in the Malay Basin. This latter area is also claimed by Viet Nam
and overlap Thai claims in both basins. No significant variation in the geology and potential of the

Pattani Trough or Malaya Basin is expected in either the disputed or undisputed territory claimed by
Viet Nam or Cambodia. Due to lack of exploration activities in this portion of these countries it is
difficult to ascertain precisely the basin limits east and southeast of Thailand.
12.          Myaiua.  The principal potential source for import gas from Myanmar is the
Martaban gas field in the Andaman Sea offshore south west Myamnar (originally called the "D"
structure). This field contains gas in an Upper Cenozoic Miocene limestone reef (or bank) situated on
and confined to an underlying high block. Three wells capable of producing gas at high rates have
been drilled on the Martaban feature which is delineated by a seismic survey. Further evaluation is
currently taking place and barring unforeseen results, development should begin by late 1994. The
structure of the field is a build-up organically derived limestone on an underlying high block (probably
a subsea topographic high at the time of deposition). The limestone reservoir is high quality with 25-
30% matrix porosity and up to 95% gas saturation. Due to the lack of strctural stress, fiacturing is
expected to be inconsequential.  Given the excellent reservoir characteristics, the development
investment (in terms of numbers of platforms and wells) should be relatively low, in contast to the
Gulf of Thailand. The main possible drawback is the likelihood of an active bottom water drive which
should not be serious in terms of water coning but would maintain formation pressures and limit
utimate recovery vs. that possible from pressure depletion.
13.          The recent Texaco discove.- described in para. 6 may also lead to potial gas
imports. This discovery is located offshore almost due west of Bangkok.

PIT's Finaal Projections -Apons
1.    PTT's projections are prepared at each Business Unit level based on demand and supply estimation for
each line of business and product and consolidated at the Head Office. They are based on the Base Case
Scenario for Gas production and are in current prices.
2.    Property. plant and equipment are recorded at cost on the purchasing or acquisition date.  Cost of
construction work in progress included gains or losses from foreign exchange fluctuations and interest during
constructic.   Demreciation is calculated by using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of
the asset      e following rates:
Asset                                                            Rate
Product extraction plant                                       6.678
Transmission plant                                              4.002
Gas Plant                                                       6.67X
General plant and other property                         3.332-20.00X
Computers and other                                           158-12X
Items costing more than Baht 30,000 per unit are treated as expense In
the acquisition year.
3.    Domestic inflation during this period has been assumed to be 52 per annum.
4.    Taxes and remittances to the Government are expected to remain between 30-352 of net Income
throughout the projected period. Though projections were prepared on revalued asset basis. for purposes
of supervision of the project, all indicators will be based on book value basis.
5.    Gains or losses from exoected foreicn exchanae fluctuation arising from operations and repayment
of loans during each year are incorporated in the income for that accounting period. Foreign Exchange
gains or losses relating to balance sheet items not payable within that accounting period are amortized
over the life of the item and accumulated In deferred foreign exchange losses/gains item.  As of
September 30. 1993, total deferred foreign exchange losses amounted to Baht 2.9 billion.
6.    kcounts receivables are projected to range around 40 days of sales throughout the projected
period. Acounts pavable are projected to range around   of cost oi goods sold.

SECOND GAS    SMISSION PROJCT
Economic Analyses and Underlying Assumptions
1.           This annex discusses the methodology and assumptions used in the economic analyses of
the proposed project. They involve (a) the value of natural gas to the Thai economy and (b) the costs
of delivering it. The latter include assumptions about the level of reserves, future production rate,
division of the flow between the existing and proposed pipeline as well as between the Bongkot field
and Unocal fields (with respect to conrtuaul take-or-pay commitments).
2.           Regarding the value of gas, as discussed in paragraph 6.1 of the text, Thailand's fuel
choices are becoming increasingly limited and the fuel available to Thailand on a long-term basis is
assumed to be low-sulphur imported coal. Given that gas in Thailand attains its highest economic value
when used in a combined cycle power plant, the maximmn value of the gas to the Thai economy is
threfore equal to the cost of the next-best alternative fuel in the power sector (which is low-sulphur
imported coal), when adjusted for differential capital, operating and maintenance costs and fuel
efficiency. This value - the "netback value" of gas in the power sector - is defined as the cost saving
for the power system that would accrue if gas were substituted for other fuels (such as low-sulphur
coal). Given that this netback value is calculated at the point of delivery to the power plant - and does
not include the gas supply costs - it also represents the "break-even" price at which the costs and
benefits of using gas in power generation are equalized over the life of the project (compared to the
next-best alternative fuel). If the cost of delivered gas would go higher than its netback value, then the
consumer (the power sector) would switch out of gas to low-sulphur coal. This netback value is
calculated to be US$4.14 per mmbtu and results from the net benefits in the power cost generated using
low-sulphur coal (US5.16& per kWh) and domestic gas (US3.99t per kWh). Tables 12.6 and 12.7 of
the annex provide the various assumptions in calculating the above costs.
3.           The economic cost of delivered gas (to the power plant gate), includes the gas
development, production, gathering and transmission costs (the capital costs as well as the operating,
maitenance and fuel costs), involved in delivering the quantity of the reserves over the life of the
project (20 years). The bases of these costs are discussed in paragraph 6.3 of the text.
4.           As discussed in para. 3.12 of the text, the level of reserves used in these analyses is
about 7,850 bcf. This amount was assumed to be distnbuted between the existing and the proposed
pipeline in proportion to the remaining economic life of the existing pipeline (12 years), and the full
economic life of the new pipeline. The economic rate of return is about 36%.
5.           Since the new inspection of the existing pipeline indicated that its condition is sound and
that it could operate well beyond its original economic life (which was 20 years), it could be argued that
the existing pipeline could transport the reserves over the next 20 years and that the constuction of a
new pipeline would represent a misallocation of resources. Therefore, a subsequent analysis was
carried out to determine that, if the existing pipeline transported gas at its maximum safe operating
capacity of 850 mmcfd over the next 20 years, a full 12 years more than originally calculated (which
was 20 years), what would be the minimum level of flow required in the new pipeline to attain an
economic rate of retun of 12%. The analysis shows that the minimum flow is 175 nmcfd.
