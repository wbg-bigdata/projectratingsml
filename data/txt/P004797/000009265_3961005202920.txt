MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE PETROLEUM AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
FOR A SECOND GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT) with the guarantee of the Kingdom ef
Thailand for the equivalent of US$155.0 million to ha-lp finance a project for the transmission of
natural gas. The loan would be at the Bank's standare -riable interest rate, with a maturity of 17
years, including four years of grace.
Backgound
2.         Over the last decade, energy consumption in Thailand has been strongly affected by
rapid economic growth and fundamental changes in the structure of the economy. During this
period, the Government and the Bank cooperated to devise appropriate policies for investment
planning, price formulation and institutional structuring in order to meet the country's future
energy requirements and avoid infrastructure bottlenecks that could hamper economic performance.
In this effort, the Bank helped Thailand construct several major energy projects and conducted a
major study to identify the optimum fuel supply options for the next decade or two, while the
Gover.nent introduced organizational reforms that should lead to a corporatized, arid, eventually,
privatized structure of the energy entities. The proposed project represents another step towards
this end.
3.         The total supply of commercial energy in Thailand was about 33 million tons of oil
equivalent (toe) in 1991 - a two-and-a-balf fold increase over 1980 - and was growing at an
average rate of 11 percent per year. Petroleum represented 62 percent of total consumption,
natural gas 21 percent, lignite 13 percent, hydre power 3 percent, and coal 1 percent.
Approximately 60 percent of the energy supply (virtalaly the entire petroleum consumption) was
imported. In addition, Thailand consumed about 10 million toe of renewable energy in 1991,
mainly in the form of wood-fuels.
4.         The country is modestly endowed with commercial energy resources, mainly natural
gas and lignite. However, demand for commercial energy continues to far exceed domestic
supplies, and this gap is likely to increase. Meeting the fuel needs in the power sector is a
particularly critical issue, since electricity demand has grown by about 14 percent a year over the
last five years. The problem is that EGAT's choices are becoming increasingly limited. First,
remaining hydro potential is difficult to develop because of enviromental and resettlement
problems. With regard to lignite, the country's reserves are insufficient to meet the increased
power generation requirements and its use creates environmental problems, as well. . FLrther,
although the proven reserves of indigenous natural gas are increasing, resources are also limited in
the long-run.
5.         One of the principle conclusions of the Fuel Option study was that natural gas is the
most economic (and environmentally least polluting) fuel for power generation. Therefore, given
the rapidly increasing demand for power, development and utilization of domestic gas reserves
have become essential.
6.         At the end of 1992, the remaining reserves of natural gas in Thailand were about 8.3
tcf. Gas production in 1992 was 850 numcfd, of which 750 mmcfd were produced from the



- 2 -
offshore fields. The national energy development policy under the seventh Plan calls for increased
domestic gas production and sets a target of 1,250 mmcfd by 1996. Given the substantial demand
for natural gas and the economics of gas utilization in Thailand, the proposed target for production
is justifiable, subject to availability of reserves. However, the existing transmission system does
not have the capacity to transport the targeted production. Thus, in 1992, PIT completed a gas
utilization master plan study, which identified several priority projects; one was the last Bank-
financed project (the Bongkot project) and the other is the proposed project, which will expand gas
transport capacity with a second pipeline parallel to the existing offshore pipeline in the Gulf of
Thailand.
7.         Thailand's hydrocarbon resources are produced either totally by the private sector or
through joint ventures between the private sector and public entities. In the latter case, the
international oil and gas companies, such a-s Unocal, Shell, Esso, Total and British Gas, have been
the major shareholders. In the oil sector, Thailand's three existing refineries are either privately
owned (by Esso), or owned through joint ventures between the private sector and PIT, with PTT
being the minority shareholder. In distributing and marketing oil, PTT competes with international
oil companies, having one-third of the market. The other two-thirds are shared among Caltex,
Shell and smaller firms. The only area in which PTT has sole responsibility is the transmission of
gas, the bulk of which is sold to EGAT.
8.         The most likely investors in gas transmission would be the two private gas producers
currently active in the Gulf of Thailand. However, both have told the Bank they are not interested
in participating, each claiming corporate strategic reasons. In fact, not only are the gas producers
disinterested, but no other private party has approached PIT or the Government to invest in the
project. ADB, JEXIM and E1B, which are cofinancing it, have also found this same lack of
interest.
Project Objectives
9.         The project's objectives are to promote greater efficiency in sector operation and
increase the utilization of domestic natural gas resources. They involve helping PIT to: (a) move
towards a fully commercial operation (corporatization) under the new reorganizaion, as well as to
continue previous efforts to strengthen its institutional capacity, to apply safety and environmental
standards, and conduct project analyses including investment programming and (b) construct a
pipeline for transporting domestic gas, which is the least-cost option to meet Thailand's growing
power-generation requirements.
Project Description
10.         The proposed project consists of the following components: (a) a comprehensive
study regarding PTT's corporate strategy, organizational effectiveness and ownership structure, as
well as institutional building and training of PTT's staff; (b) a 36-inch diameter, 425-km long
offshore gas transmission pipeline that extends from an existing platform at the Erawan fields in
the Gulf of Thailand to onshore receiving facilities at Rayong; (c) a 28-inch diameter, 110-km
onshore pipeline that extends from Rayong to a point near the EGAT power plant at Bang Pakong;
(d) related facilities, including compressor stations and gas processing facilities; (e)
telecommunication and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems; and (f) project
engineering and management consultancy services.

Project Implementation
11.        The government approved the project in August 1992, and the National Debt Policy
Committee and the Cabinet subsequently approved the proposed financing arrangements. PTT will
be responsible for implemeniting the project. PTT has implemented similar projects in the past,
including the existing 34-inch offshore pipeline from the Erawan platform to Rayong financed by
the Bank as well as the Bongkot offshore pipeline, currently under construction, also financed by
the Bank. An engineering-management consulting firm has been appointed to carry out the basic
design, detailed engineering, preparation of technical specifications and bid documents, bid
evaluation and contract negotiations, supervision during construction, environmental impact study
and the testing and commissioning of the facilities. The project is scheduled to be commissioned
by mid-1996. The construction of the 28-inch diameter onshore pipeline and the 36-inch diameter
offshore pipeline are to be completed by December 1995 and March 1996, respectively.
Project Costs and Financing Plan
12.          The total cost of the project is estimnated at US$674.5 million (including interest
during construction, which is estimated at US$75.1 million). The proposed Bank loan of US$155
million would provide 23% of the total financing required and 27% of foreign expenditures. ADB
and JEXIM funds will finance 60% of the pipeline materials and coating; EIB funds will finance
the construction of the onshore pipeline; PTT's commercial borrowing will finance the 40% of the
linepipe and coating and its internal cash will fmance land acquisition, taxes, duties and other
expenses. The proposed Bank loan will be used to finance the engineering-managtment
covisultancy contract (US$33 million), the offshort *ipeline construction contract (US$119.7
million), and the costs of a corporatization study a  training program (US$2.3 million). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Thailand are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps showing the project location are attached. The
borrower has requested, and the Bank has agreed, to remove from the Staff Appraisal Report
certain sensitive information, such as the level of gas reserves and production, the borrower's
future financial performance, and the agreements reached between the borrower and the Bank.
This information is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12700-TH dated June 1994, is
being circulated separately.
Procurement
13.        To meet the project completion date, the Government and PTT have requested
advance procurement action for both the engineering consultancy and for offshore pipeline
construction contracts. Tle terms of reference for the engineering consultancy contract were
approved by the Bank and the consultant selection process, including the evaluation of the
proposals, was carried out according to Bank guidelines. Regarding the pipeline construction,
sMIce the schedule calls for construction to start by October 1994, related procurement activities
began in February 1994, before the scheduled Board presentation date.  Hence, advance
procurement action was also needed for offshore construction contract, which has followed Bank
procurement guidelines. Retroactive financing equal to US$15 million is recommended for
expenses incurred after September 1. 1993, as partial payment for the offshore construction and
engineering consultancy contracts, for amounts which have already been paid by PTr. The



- 4 -
procurement procedures used for non-Bank financed items are based on the respective co-
financiers' guidelines and PTT's procurement procedures, which are satisfactory to the Bank.
Project Sustainability
14.         The project is ex"ected to be financially, institutionally, and operationally
sustainable. The provisions for cost recovery are adequate since the take-or-pay agreements
(between the gas producers and PTT, and between PTT and the gas user, EGAT), ensure at least
a 12% rate of return to PTT, an ample margin to provide for various operating costs.
Institutionally, PTT is a well-run state enterprise that functions as a modern organization, enjoys a
considerable degree of autonomy, and will soon be restructured as a corporation. Operationally, it
implemented several similar projects in the past and has operated the existing gas transmission
facilities since the early 1980s.
Lessons Learned bom Previous Bank Involvement
15.        Until now, the Bank has made four loans to Thailand's oil and gas sector. These
projects, implemented over the past 11 years, have been completed on schedule and within the
budget, ana have realized their main objectives. Three lessons are particularly relevant to the
design of the proposed project. First, given that the region's geology is complex, the hydrocarbon
reserves must be evaluated comprehensively and the high cost of developing the fields should be
addressed;  the proposed project has considered these factors.  Second, given Thailand's
procurement practices and import tax laws, the Bank has learned to prepare the procurement
packages in a way that minimizes their numbers, yet conforms with Bank guidelines, hence
avoiding potential delays resulting from procurement-related issues. As a result, the proposed
project consists of only about eight main single-responsibility contracts, of which the Bank loan
will fund two. Third, the Bank learned that coordination at two levels was problematic: within
PTT, between the Departments of Engineering and Finance, and outside, between PT? and EGAT,
regarding the timing, load requirements, capacity and type of power plants that rely on the PIT
gas supply. During pi ect preparation, the Bank team promoted interactions between PT? and
EGAT, as well as withir± the agenzy, and coordination was greatly improved.
Ratonale for Bank Involvement
16.       The overriding rationale for Bank involvement is to continue helping the country
build a policy ftamework within which it can operate the sector more efficiently. For the many
years that the Bank has been involved in Thailand's oil and gas industry, the Govemrnent and
energy-affiliated agencies have sought and implemeted Bank advice on how to build such a
framework. These interactions have resulted in implementation of major energy projects based on
rational justifications, deregulation of all but one of the petroleum product prices, rigorous analyses
of environmental impacts (of the energy projects), reformulation of refinery products to enhance
air quality, implementing a pilot program for deiand side management (DSM), and the initial
reforms to ultimately create completely commercial entities. Further, the Bank helped identify the
optimum fuel choice (see the Fuel Option Study) and prepare a master plan for utilization of
domestic and imported gas. These activities have significantly enhanced the sector's efficiency and
its profitability; however, several issues remain. The most important are corporatizing/privatizing
the energy entities, establishing an independent regulatory body, creating an acceptable set of
environmental and safety standards (to exploit hydrocarbon resources in the Gulf of Thailand) and
providing an environment that would attract gretr private sector participation. The proposed



-5 -
project addresses the issues of corporatization, environmental regulations and capacity building,
which, once implemented, will enable PTT to benefit more fully from a market-based operation.
17.        The proposed project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy presented to
the Board on September 20, 1994, because the physical infrastructure and institutional weaknesses
will be the main issues for the next decade or two. The project includes components relevant to
both constraints: First, it helps finance the construction of a pipeline, which will ease the
bottleneck in transporting the domestic gas. Second, it will train staff to carry out project analytes
and to apply safety and environmental standards, as well as help the borrowing entity reorganize
towards a corporatized structure, which would reduce the public sector's financial liability.
Moreover, the project is consistent with the sector strategy because it promotes the use of naturdl
gas, which the recently completed Fuel Option Study concluded was the least-polluting and least-
cost fuel with which to generate power.
18.        The design of the financing plan shows that the IBRD share of PMT's financing in
FY94-98 is expected to be only 4.7 percent, with the bulk of PM's funds commng from borrowings
in the local market. Without Bank involvement, key sectoral issues may not receive proper
attention, and the development of an enabling environment for greater private sector participation
may be deferred.
Agreed Actions
19.        The main areas in which agreement were reached are that PIT shall: (a) as condition
of loan effectiveness, provide the Bank with satisfactory certification of the latest gas reserve level
of the Bongkot field; (b) no later than December 31, 1994, submit to the Bank copies of the
executed amendments that extend the provisions of the existing gas-sale agreements to cover future
gas development, production and sale from the Bongkot and Unocal fields, as well as an
amendment that extends the provisions of the existing gas-sale agreement between PU and EGAT
to cover gas supply to EGAT; (c) take all measures required to ensure full implementation of the
environmental action plan and associated monitoring activities contained in the Environmental
Impact Assessment (ELA) report as well as implement the recommendatons resulting from the
study on PTT's safety and enviromental standards; (d) provide, for Bank review, its five-year
investment program and take into account the Bank's comments; (e) not later than December 1,
1994 appoint consultants to carry out the study on its corporatization and (e) meet certain financial
covenants, including maintaining a debt-service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 times, a debt/equity
ratio of not higher than 70:30, and a self-financing ratio of 25%.
Environmental Aspects
20.         The proposed project has received a category "A" environmental classification and
a full EIA has been prepared by the borrower (a summary was distributed to the Executive
Directors on September 1, 1993). The project is not expected to adversely affect the environment,
either during construction or operations. Indeed, the impact will be relatively positive, because
naural gas is significantly less harmful than either fuel oil, lignite or coal. There are, however,
several potential environmental concerns (such as oil leaks, accidents, disruption of marine life,
noise and vibrations), but these have been addressed in the enviromental impact study, which
includes appropriately designed mitigation measures. Given that PUT recenly evaluated the
environmental aspects of the Bank-financed Bongkot Gas Transmission project, it is familiar with
the Bank's enviromnental requirements.



-6 -
Project Benefits
21.         The proposed project would substantially enhance the sector's efficiency and would
have significant economic and environmental benefits. The comprehensive study leading to the
preparation of an action plan for PTT's future corporatization, and the subsequent implementation
of the action plan, would contribute to improved efficiency in the sector. Gas transported under
the proposed project will be used for power generation in combined-cycle plants, a scheme that has
been shown to be part of Thailand's least-cost solution to power generation (the economic benefits
of the project are derived from more costly fuels being replaced by gas and the greater thermal
efficiency gained through the use of gas). In addition, natural gas is a clean and low-polluting fuel
when compared to alternative sources of energy.
Risks
22.         Risks entail the following three concerns: (a) the availability of sufficient gas
reserves and the cost of producing such reserves; (b) safety and environmental risks associated with
the construction and operation of the project facilities and (c) potential disputes in various
contractual arrangements. However, the gas reserves have been assessed and certified by qualified
consultants to be sufficient. The risks associated with a potential increase in production costs have
been minimized because appropriate contingencies have been included in the cost parameters.
Environmental concerns have been addressed in the environmental impact study and through the
design of appropriate mitigation measures. The gas sales-purchase agreements are structured
according to international industry norms.
Recommendation
23.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

A. Gas Reserves and Production
1.            Reserves. It was originally assumed that the entire gas supply for the proposed project
would come from reserves located in various concession blocks held by the Union Oil Company
(Unocal)Y   At the time of the pre-appraisal mission, Unocal estimated its reserves were about 6,400
billion cubic feet (bcf), which represented the total gas remaining in its four contract areas as of January
1, 1993. The figure included about 3,420 bcf in the "proven" reserve category, 1,150 bcf in the
"risked probable," 580 bcf in the "risked possible," and 50% of the estimated 2,500 bcf reserves in
"potential" category, the latter all situated in contract area IVY Although Unocal is competent in
assessing hydrocarbon reserves - particularly in the Gulf of Thailand where they have a 12-year
history of gas field development and production - the Bank asked PTT for an independent reserve
assessment from experienced consultants who could also issue the certification required by the Bank.
PTT agreed to engage DeGolyer & MacNaughton (D&M), an expert in the field, and the Bank agreed
to finance the cost of the study under the existing loan 3508-TH.
2.            As a result of the re-evaluation, D&M  estimated that Unocal's reserves totaled 5,800 bcf,
about 600 bcf less than the amount calculated by Unocal. D&M's estimate entails less proven and
risked probable reserves and allocates a higher share to those considered possible. Therefore, according
to D&M's estimate, the Unocal fields had 3,022 bcf of proven reserves, 470 bcf of risked probable and
2,308 bcf of risked possible. This quantity (5,800 bcf) was not sufficient to justify the proposed project
because it is assumed that the existing pipeline could transport up to 5,840 bcf of gas over the next 20
yearsY.' Further, the quantity of gas to be transported by the 24" segment of pipeline under
construction to Khanom (for use in the Khanom power plant) is 778 bcf, for a total of 6,618 bcf.
Therefore, given that D&M's estimate of Unocal's reserves is 5,800 bcf and that its last (1989) estinate
of the proven reserves of the Bongkot field was 1,494 bcf (para. 3), for a total of 7,294 bcf, the
remaining quantity to be transported by the new pipeline would have been only 676 bcf over the next
20 years, or about 93 nmncfd (while the minimum required to justify the economics of the new pipeline
is 175 mmcfd; see Annex 11 of SAR).
1/ Unocal's concession blocks are divided into four different contracts areas with respect to gas sales-purchase agreements
between Unocal and PIT. Conta  I (signed in Sepember 1978) is for the original Brawan field. Contract 1! (signed in May
1982), includes the Baanpot, Satun, Platong, Kaphong and Pladang fields. There Is no Contract m, but several amenents to
Contrc    are collectively known as Contract HI, and consists of Gomin, Jakrawan, Funan, Pakrang, Trat, Surat and Dara
fields; and, the draft Contract IV is intnded to cover the recently acquired Block 12/27, which includes the Pailin and Moragot
gas fields.
2/ The word "risked" applies to the percetage of probable and possible reserves used to calculate the total expected reserves;
namely, using DMR's methodology, a risked probable rerve of 1,150 bcf implies 1,915 bcf of reserves in the "probable"
category (hence reduced or risked by 40 %), and a risked possible reserve of 580 bcf implies 1,935 bcf of reserves in the
"possible" category (hence reduced or risked by 70 %). The reason that pontial reserves in area IV was risked by 50%, was
that, as indicated by PTf, the area IV includes block 12/27, which at least 1,000 bcf of its reserves are most likely to exist.
3/ The 5,840 bcf figure is based on the assumption that the existing pipeline could transport gas at its maxhmun safe operating
capacity of 850 mmcfd over the next 20 years (based on 343 operating days per year), a full 12 years more than that originally
calculated (which was 20 years). This was decided because, as explained in para. 3.1, the recent inspection of the pipeline
indicated that its condition is sound. Therefore, it was concluded that under these ccmstnces, the constuction of a new
pipeline could represent a misallocation of resources (see Annex 12).

3.         As a result of D&M's assessment of Unocal's reserves, the Bank informed PTT that in
order to ensure the financability of the proposed project, it should try to prove additional reserves. In
turn, PTT asked D&M to expedite the re-assessment of the Bongkot gas fields, a concession held by the
French company, Total, in a joint venture with PTTEP (the exploration arm of PTT), British Gas and
Statoil of Norway. The Bongkot gas field, located about 180 km southeast of Unocal's Erawan field, is
the source of supply for the Bongkot Gas Transmission Project (financed under Bank loan 3508-TH).4y
Gas reserves of this field were originally certified by D&M in 1989, estimnated to be 2,168 bcf (1,494
bcf in the proven and 674 in the probable category). These reserves formed the contractual basis for
supplying 250 mmcfd of gas (about 120 mmcfd to be supplied to the Khanom area and the balance to
join, at the Erawan platform, the gas from Unocal's fields for transmission through the existing pipeline
to Rayong). The gas sales-purchase agreement for this field was signed between PTT and the gas
producers on March 1990. The agreement provided for an increase in the gas supply (up to 500
mmcfd), subject to the availability of additional reserves. The agreement speculated that the additional
reserve availability would be confirmed through periodic re-assessment and re-certification. The next
reassessment and re-certification was originally scheduled for April 1994. However, in light of the
Unocal fields' reserve status and recent successful drilling in Bongkot field, PTT agreed to advance the
re-assessment date to Febnay 1994. D&M has now nearly completed its re-assessment of the Bongkot
field and results show that the remaining proven reserves of the field are at least 2,100 bcf, the risked
probable reserves are about 2,970 bcf, and the risked possible reserves are about 220 bcf; hence, the
total risk adjusted reserves of the Bongkot field are about 5,290 bcf. The Bank and PTT agreed during
the negotiations that the submission of the formal certification of gas reserves for the Bongkot field
would be a condit.on of the loan effectivenessY
4.         Thus, the total risk-adjusted remaining reserves from both the Unocal and Bongkot fields
are 11,090 bcf. The gas reserves of Unocal and Bongkot fields, as estimated by D&M, are given in
Tables l(a) and l(b), below. Such reserves are sufficient to justify the economics of the proposed
project because the balance to be transported by the new pipeline would be about 4,472 bcf or about
610 mmcfd. This level of the flow rate (610 mmcfd) would be 435 mmcfd per day higher than the
minimum flow rate required (175 mmcfd).
S.         It must be remembered that these reserves represent the likely estimate of the gas available
in these two producers' fields; however, the potential could be higher. Also, the flow rates assumed for
the new pipeline represent a levelized daily flow over the 20-year life of the project. In reality, the
flow rate of the proposed pipeline would be significantly higher during the first 8-10 years, since the
producers have incentives to pipe more gas, and, at the same time, explore for more gas and develop
and put on stream additional fields. Nonetheless, the project analysis has calculated only the proven
reserves (5,122 bef) and 40% of the probable reserves (2,754 bcf): 7,876 bcf has been used from a
total of 11,090 bef risked reserves. Further, the risked reserves of 11,090 bcf have already been risk-
adjusted by the consultants from a reserve level of 26,991 bcf. Therefore, the possibility of insufficient
reserves to justify the proposed project is almost non-existent.
4/ This project is to be completed by mid-1994.
_/ Certificate of gas reserves of the Bongkot field was received by the Bank after negotiaton, on May 24, 1994, certifyig a
proved sales gas reserves of 2,875 bcf and probable reserves of 6,575 bcf, remaining in the field as of May 16, 1994.

6.           Production. The present gas supply from the Unocal fields is about 750 mmcfd, which is
transported to Rayong through the existing pipeline. The production forecast for the Unocal fields
assumes that the fields under Contracts I, I and m  would continue producing 700-750 mmcfd until
mid-1996, because the capacity of the existing pipeline is limited to 850 mmcfd (120 mmcfd will come
from the Bongkot field). After 1996, Unocal would begin producing from the fields in Jakrawan,
Funan and Gomin (JFG) area and other new accumulations in Contract I, II and III areas to achieve the
base case production rate of 900 mmcfd. Further, it is highly possible that Unocal will begin producing
from Contract IV area, increasing the supply to 1,200 numcfd by 2000, a production level which Unocal
intends to maintain until 2004, after which production would gradually decline. The Bongkot gas field,
which came on stream in early 1994, initially adding about 150-250 mmcfd to the country's gas supply,
will reach a production plateau (between 1997 and 2010) of 300-600 nncfd, depending on the
availability of reserves. About 100-120 mmcfd of this gas will be transported to Khanom for use in
power generation, and the balance will be transported to Rayong. Table 2 provides a summary of the
gas supply forecast for the Unocal and Bongkot fields. Given the current estimate, the Bongkot "high"
case is emerging as the most likely scenario.



- 4-
7.           Given the present level of reserves, future production will come mostly from the offshore
fields of Unocal and Bongkot. Unocal fields have a long history of production (12 years), and
projections can, therefore, be made with reasonable accuracy. The Bongkot field, although in early
stage of development-production, has been subject to extensive appraisal drilling (23 wells); thus, the
information available is sufficient to establish a reasonable forecast for this field as well. In addition, as
indicated above, a detailed evaluation of potential reserves and production of Unocal and Bongkot fields
has been conducted by qualified consultants in connection with their certifying reserves. Considering
the ample demand for gas (para. 2.7 of SAR), the producers will have an incentive to develop the gas
fields and produce the reserves. Therefore, reserves and production data for these two fields, which
together represent over 80% of total future supply, are considered highly reliable. A production
forecast of Unocal and Bongkot fields is given in Annex 3 of SAR, and paras. 12 and 13 discuss the
associated development plan and estimated expenditures of producers to supply the forecasted daily
quantity.

B. Contractual Arrangements
8.           The various agreements governing the development, production, sale and purchase of gas
for the proposed project have either already been signed or are being discussed in negotiations.



-5 -
9.         The Bongkot gas field (formerly called "B" structure) is currently being developed and
will be operated by a joint-venture consisting of PTTEP (40%), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
PTT, Total (30%), British Gas Thailand (20%) and Statoil (10%). The gas produced will be sold by
the joint-venture to PTT, in accordance with the Gas Sales Agreement signed in March 1990 (para. 14).
PTT will transport the gas and sell it to EGAT, under the gas purchase agreement signed in December
1991 (para. 17).
10.        The joint-venture partners have entered into a participation and operating agreement
among themselves. Total was elected the "operator", and will thus be responsible for preparing annual
budgets, managing procurement, expenditures and day-to-day operations and supervising employees
seconded by other parties. It will also prepare the development plan and definitive cost estimate, which
must be adopted unanimously.
11.       The original development plan for the Bongkot field (currently under implementation as
part of the Bongkot Gas Transmission project), envisaged producing a minimum of 1,500 bcf of gas and
24 million barrels of condensate over the life of the Gas Sales Agreement. The original plan required
central production and processing facilities, 13 well-platforms and 123 development wells, estimated to
cost US$897 million. When added to related exploration costs of US$55 million, the total investment
estimated under the original plan (to produce 1,500 bcf of gas and 24 million barrels of condensate) was
US$952 million. The Bank reviewed this amount (as part of loan 3508-TH) and verified the size of the
investment, which was also consistent with the cost estimate prepared by D&M.
12.       A new development plan has now been prepared which intends to cover the recently
discovered gas and present both a base-case and high-case scenario. Under the first, production is
expected to reach a plateau of about 350 mmcfd between 1997-2005, with total proven reserves of about
2,100 bcf. Under the second, production should reach a plateau of 500 mmcfd betwen 1998-2004,
with reserves of about 3,100 bcf. Given the latest reserve estimates (about 4,000 1,000 bcf), the
development plan would likely be based on the high-case scenario. However, for the purpose of this
project, the analysis is based on the base-case scenario, which would include six exploration wells, 16
delineation wells, 215 development wells, and 24 well platforms. The development plan's total cost for
the base-cwase scenario is estimated at US$1,625 million, and the operating cost is estimated at
US$1,316 million over the life of the project.
13.        The situation with the Unocal field is somewhat different in that Unocal is virtually the
only concession holder (PTT has 10% share in Contract Area E) and therefore the operator of its own
fields, from which it has produced gas for over 12 years. Periodically, Unocal presents a short-term
and a 5-year development plan to PIT and agreements are reached with respect to production levels and
capital and operating costs. Unocal's last development plan (approved by PIT on October 1993) called
for capital expenditures of about US$4,000 million (US$486, US$717, US$1,705, and US$1031 million
for contracts I, II, Im, and IV respectively). The operating expenses over the development period for
the four contracts are estimated at US$2,800 million (to produce about 5,670 bcf of gas).
14.        Gas Sales Agreements between  PIf  and Gas Producers. The gas sales agreements
between PTT and the gas producers follow the princip;e outlined in para. 2.9 of SAR. For the Bongkot
field, the initial transfer price is calculated on the long-run economic cost of supply which is linked to
the price of fuel oil. The initial base price for the Bongkot Gas Transmission project is set at Baht
56.14 per mmbtu. Price adjustments are determined on a set of indices, each of which carry a different
weight and include the intenational price of fuel oil, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and changes



-6 -
in the domestic and international rates of inflation. The formula also includes stable floor and ceiling
prices that serve to lessen the inpact of short-term fluctuations in international markets, as well as a
take-or-pay covenant. The projected discounted (at 12%) transfer price of the gas over the life of the
field contractual reserve (1.5 tcf) ranges from US$1.98-US$2.25 per mdf, depending on the range
assumed for the future price of fuel oil (which varies from 73%-85% of the price of crude oil). To
fulfil the condition of negotiations for the proposed loan, during the negotiations PTT submitted the
draft amendment to the Gas Sales Agreement (between PITT and the gas producers of the Bongkot
field). to cover the sale-purchase of additional gas reserves (above 1.5 tcf) recently found in the
Bongkot field. Furthermore, it was agreed during the negotiations that amendment satisfactory to the
Bank will be duly executed and submitted to the Bank by December 31, 1994.
15.       Two gas sales agreements have already been signed for the Unocal fields for contracts I
and II. Also, several amendments have been issued to cover gas sales agreement for fields commonly
referred to as Contract m1. Furthermore, a draft contract for area IV has been prepared, as well.
However, given the additional reserves which have recently become available from the Bongkot fields
(para. 3), the gas reserves of Unocal Contract Area IV are not needed to justify the econoniics of the
project. The three gas sale agreements are basically similar: The energy index used (its weight varies
from 40% for the first contract to 15% for the third) is the international price of the fuel oil, and the
international inflation index corresponds to US export prces (whose weight varies from 15% to 30%
depending on the contract).  The latter index is different from Bongkot's contract, where the
international inflation is related to the US Field Machinery index. The initial transfer price in Unocal
contracts ranges from Baht 13.68 to Baht 58 per mmbtu, depending on the tranche of supply and the
tine which the contracts were signed. To fulfil the condition of negotiations for the proposed loan,
during the negotiations PTT submitted the draft amendment to the gas sales agreements (between PIT
and Unocal), to cover the sale-purchase of the latest and total gas reserves certified by D&M for
Contract areas I, II and m. Furthermore, it was agreed during the negotiations that amendment
satisfactory to the Bank will be duly executed and submitted to the Bank by December 31, 1994.
16.       The gas-sales-agreement formula between PIT and the gas producers ensures economic
efficiency as it charges the full economic costs (including a depletion premium) of gas supply. Also, it
allows producers to cover the cost of exploratior, development and production, and the Government to
absorb the economic rent in the form of royalties and taxes.
17.        Gas Purchase Agreement Between Pf1T and EGAT. The current average price of gas
sold by PIT to EGAT is Baht per 78 per mmbtu (see para. 2.10 of SAR, the gas purchase agreement
between PTT and EGAT).
18.        During negotiations, agreement was reached with PTT that prior to amending existing gas
sale/purchase agreements (between PTT and EGAT, and between PIT and the gas producers), PIT
shall exchange views with the Bank and shall take the Bank's views and recommendations into
consideratioii. It was agreed that amendments for this purpose are those that could affect PTT's ability
to perforn, such as those dealing with: (a) the quantity of gas to be purchased by or sold to PTT; (b)
the price of gas so!d to or purchased by PTT and (c) the duration of the agreements.

C. Projected inandal Performance
19.        PTT's satisfactory financial performance is projected to continue throughout the next five
years. The test for PTT, in the 1994-98 period, will be to carry out its extensive investment program
of Baht 83 million (three times as large as its investment program over the last five years) without being
financially and operationally overstretched. PTT's current financial strength should allow it to do so
albeit with caution in the interim years, and the fiscal year of 1995 will be the most difficult year for
PTT. Key indicators of PTT's projected financial performance for the period of FY94-98 are presented
in Table 3. The detailed projections and the underlying assumptions are available in Annex 10 of SAR
and in project files. This period covers the completion of investment programs in PTT's pipeline which
have been agreed upon with the Government and to which PTT is committed.
20.        Sales revenue is expected to double from Baht 85 billion (US$ 3.4 billion) in 1993 to Baht
170 billion ($ 6.8 billion) in 1998. Between 1994-96, the increase in sales will be driven mostly by the
oil marketing operation. Oil sales are to climb from 13.7 million liters in 1993 to 18.8 million liters in
1996 and remain at that level until 1998. In contrast, gas sales will increase slightly, from 852 mmcfd
in 1993 to about 1000 mmcfd in 1995. After 1996, gas sales will reach 1400-1500 mmcfd. The
relative share of the oil business will decline from 75% in 1994 to about 62% in 1998. The main
reasons for the plateau in the volume of oil beyond 1996 are (a) substitution of gas in the supply of fuel
to EGAT, and (b) greater competition in the oil marketing sector, where PTT at the moment controls
between 25-28% of the market share. In 1993, the Government introduced further competition into the
sector by liberalizing oil procurement for the public sector, which until then had been reserved for
PTT. On a phased basis, the public entities will be freed to purchase oil from any supplier, which may

21.          PTT's net income is projected to decline in 1994 and 1995 from its level in 1993 mainly
due to higher interest payments required to finance PTT's expanding capital investment plan. Interest
payments as a percentage of total sales, will jump from 1.1%  in 1993 to 1.9%  and 2.3%  respectively in
1994 and 1995. PTT's operating ratio will be satisfactory but will increase to 91-92% in 1994-95, due
to higher depreciation expenses. Toward the outer years, it will once again decline to around 88%.
Due to the higher interest payment, the rate of return on net fixed assets in operation will dip in 1995
to about 10.4% but climb up to about 15% in 1998. Similarly, return on equity will fall to 13.7%, its
lowest level between 1988 and 1998, but rise to 18.6% (close to the 1993 level) at the end of this
period. This rate of return remains adequate for a utility company, which is by and large the nature of



-9 -
business that PTT is in.  Equity will nearly triple during the 1994-98 period without any contributions
or tax breaks from the Government.
22.          PTT's financial indicators are expected to meet benchmarks set under previous Bank loans.
The self-financing ratio over the medium term is expected to remain above 25%. Due to the massive
projected investments in 1995, the ratio for this year and 1996 will be achieved through the refinancing
of a portion of PIT's long term debt service. In 1995, the amount is expected to be Baht 1.5 billion,
and in 1996, Baht 500 million. However, due to the lumpy nature of the investments, the ratio will
continue to behave erratically over the forecast period. PTT's capital structure is projected to remain
satisfactory throughout the 1994-98 period. Total long term liability (liabilities over one year of
maturity) to total capitalization is expected to be adequate. Under the previous Bank loan, the debt
equity ratio was calculated on revalued asset basis. While this is appropriate for analyzing past
statements, as PTT is required to revalue its assets by a factor determined by the Ministry of Finance,
for projection purposes (and monitoring during supervision), it will more expedient to calculate this
ratio on book value basis.Y For this purposes, PTT will be asked to maintain a 70:30 debt equity ratio
on book value basis. During negotiations, agreement was reached for PTY to maintain the financial
covenants at levels agreed under the previous loan. As such, the self financing ratio will not be less
than 25%, a minimumn debt service coverage ratio of 1.3 and a current ratio of 1.1 will be maintained,
and a long term debt to equity ratio of 70:30 will not be exceeded. Debt refinancing would not be
included as repayment of debt for debt service ratio calculation and self-financing ratio. PTT may
deem it appropriate to refinance some of its debt to reduce its cross-currency exposure.
23.          One area of concern will be the average days receivables.  The projections assume an
average collection period (receivables/average daily sales) of 40 days. It is crucial for PIT to monitor
this indicator carefully. Though PTT made great progress in reducing receivables from 52 days in 1990
to 30 days in 1993, days receivables has been showing an increase in 1993 to 39 days. A significant
increase above the assumed 40 days will substantially affect PfT's cash position.
§/ A similar analysis of the subcompnet of return on equity (as in footnote 18) reveals that the decline in ROE is mainly due
to a lower asset utlization ratio despite a higher margin and higher leverage. In fact, while the net margin will increase from 5%
in 1993 to 6% In 1998 and leverage from 2.29 to 2.63, sales generated by assets will decline fromn 1.45 in 1993 to 1.05 by 1998.
One reason for this decline is that Pff is investing substanially in long term investments and joint ventures whose income stream
is not captured on an ex-ante basis in the projections. A second factor, which would need to be monitored more carefully, is to
ensure that Pff's future investments contmue to contribute positive value to the bottom line.

covenants.

D. Investment Program and Financing Plan
24.         The Bank was provided PTT's FY94-98 investment program. This investment program
has been substantially revised since the appraisal mission. Table 4 below, summarizes PTT's projected
investment and financing plan for the period of 1994-1998. PTT's own operations in the oil and gas
sector require Baht 64 billion (US$ 2.5 billion) in investments. In addition, PTT is mandated by the
Government to carry out investments in various joint ventures and other long term investments which
comprise Baht 18.5 billion (US$ 740 million).Y' The proposed project constitutes about 20% of PTT's
investment plan and the proposed Bank loan of US$155.0 million is expected to meet 4.7% of total
financing requirements for the period. PfT expected to finance an average of 45% of its total funding
requirements during this period from internally generated funds. Other sources of finance will be the
European Investment Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and bonds issued in the domestic markAet.

25.         Investments in the subsidiary and joint venture pose a potential risk to PIT's finances,
since it is not directly managing these companies nor implementing the proposed projects. Though its
fnancial structure would still leave sufficient room for additional short term or long term debt financing
(should there be any overruns), PMT's investment strategy and interaction with its subsidiaries, joint
ventures and other "mandated" investments, which PTT carries out on behalf of the Government, will
be a focal element of the proposed corporatization study (see para. 4.23 of SAR). In addition, during
negotiations, the Bank and PTT agreed hat the Bank will continue to be consulted about revisions and
