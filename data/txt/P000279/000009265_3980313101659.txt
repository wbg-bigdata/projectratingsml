IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BURKINA FASO
SECOND URBAN PROJECT
Credit 2067-BUR
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report for the Second Urban Project in Burkina
Faso, for which Credit 2067-BUR in the amount of SDR 18 million (equivalent to US$22.2
million) was approved on October 24, 1989, signed on December 22, 1989, and made effective on
September 6, 1990. An additional credit, Credit 2067-1-BUR in the amount of SDR 6.9 million
(equivalent to US$10 million) was approved on November 10, 1994, signed on December 21,
1994, and made effective on September 28, 1995.
The two credits, i.e., 2067-0-BUR and 2067-1-BUR, were closed on March 31, 1997,
whereas the original closing date was June 30, 1996. The last disbursement took place on July 23,
1997.
The completion report was drawn up by Christian Diou, senior municipal engineer, AFTU2,
and project manager, with the assistance of Gerard Tenaille, consultant, and was reviewed by Hasan
Tuluy, Director of Operations for Burkina Faso. Preparation of this report was begun during a
mission to Burkina Faso in February 1997, and the aide-memoire of that mission is attached. The
Implementation Report is based on project documents, correspondence, the appraisal report, and the
credit agreement. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by drawing up its own
project implementation report in February 1997, which was updated in September 1997, and by
submitting comments on the draft completion report.



EVALUATION SUMMARY
BURKINA FASO
SECOND URBAN PROJECT
Credit 2067-BUR
Introduction
1.    This report evaluates the outcomes of the Second Urban Project in Burkina Faso, which was
implemented by the Urban Project Office established in the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
Project Objectives
2.    The main project objectives were to: (a) gradually build the organizational, technical and
financial capacities of the municipalities of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso to enable them to
assume responsibility for contracting the maintenance of urban infrastructure and the supply of
urban services, and cope with a rapidly growing urban population; and (b) improve the
infrastructure of these two cities to an acceptable level so that effective routine maintenance can be
provided.
Achievement of Objectives
3.    The project achieved, and in some cases exceeded, its objectives, both in terms of
institutional aspects and physical objectives. Far-reaching sectoral reforms were designed and
gradually implemented, and responsibility and funding for urban development and maintenance
was successfully transferred to local authorities. Physical objectives were largely achieved, and
estimated economic rates of return on project investments were exceeded. Targeted levels of
resource mobilization were attained, even though these resources are still inadequate. The original
project objectives remain valid and are incorporated in the Government's urban sector policy.
(a) Municipal management. The communes' accounting systems were put in order and
computerized, in accordance with new accounting guidelines approved in 1994. Municipal
accountants were trained. A new Municipal Code and a set of laws on decentralization were
drafted and are expected to be approved by the National Assembly before mid-1998.
(b) Mobilization of financial resources. Laws and regulations to reform the business
license tax were adopted and implemented. This resulted in increased numbers of businesses that
were assessed, improved the rate of business tax collection approximately three-fold and
significantly increased municipal revenues. To support this effort, the project strengthened the
operation of the municipal tax offices (Hotels des Finances) in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso
by providing them with new offices and equipment.



*2
(c) Urban information system. The project successfully implemented an extensive
address assignment program that helped improve the operation of municipal services. Almost
22,000 street signs and 143,000 house numbers were put up and the management of lots or parcels
of land was computerized.
(d) Strengthening technical services.  The project strengthened the municipalities'
capacity to deliver urban services through technical assistance, staff training, and the provision of
equipment. Systematic recourse to private enterprise helped with the implementation of road
maintenance programs. Road maintenance crews were set up in each municipality.
(e) Improvement of urban infrastructure. This component was a success. It benefited
from the additional credit of SDR 6.9 million made available after the CFAF devaluation in 1994.
As a result, the work performed considerably exceeded appraisal targets. The only infrastructure
component that was not achieved was the Zogona Canal in Ouagadougou, since the Italian loan that
was expected to finance it, did not materialize.
(f) Household garbage collection service. The project supplied the equipment as planned
and the service is fully operational. However, it would be better if garbage collection were
privatized. This action is pursued in a follow-up operation.
(g) Housing policy. The Borrower has complied with the terms of the housing policy letter
approved during negotiations. However, it has not made any decisions to reform its housing policy.
4.    Economic analysis. The economic analysis of the rehabilitation of the urban streets and
drainage system financed under the project shows that the internal rates of return are higher than
estimated at appraisal. A technical and socio-economic evaluation of the Colma-Yeguere sanitation
system shows that the cost of the system with the drainage basin, as implemented under the project,
was 50% less than the previously estimated cost based on a traditional approach.
5.    Important factors affecting the project. The main factor that affected the project was the
devaluation of the CFAF in January 1994. It triggered an additional IDA credit for US$ 10 million
and required the project office to recalculate the costs of all contracts. It also resulted in a
postponement of the original closing date by one year.
Sustainability of the Project
6.    It is likely that the institutional reforrns and physical investments supported by the project
are sustainable and that the Government will continue to apply the reforms and processes that have
been initiated. The project had a positive impact on municipal institutions and their finances. It
improved local tax collection which should provide the municipalities with the resources needed to
ensure better maintenance of urban infrastructure.



3
Bank Performance
7.    The Bank's performance was satisfactory. Project preparation, however, was needlessly
drawn out because of disagreements between the Bank and the Borrower over the issue of
ONASENE. Staff continuity during supervision was satisfactory. The disbursement categories
under the credit agreement could, however, have been simplified. The requirement that the original
credit and the supplemental one be handled as two separate financial operations created
administrative difficulties for both the Bank and the Borrower.
Borrower Performance
8.    The Borrower's performance was satisfactory overall, although deficient during project
start-up, when the Government established a National Office of Maintenance, Cleaning and
Beautification Services (ONASENE), in conflict with agreed project objectives. The Government
also failed to obtain the support of the Ministry of Infrastructure, Housing, and Urban Affairs
(MIHU) for this new project office established in the Ministry of Finance.  However, the
performance of the project office was highly satisfactory, in large part because the project director
remained in office for the duration of the project. Project implementation ran nine months past the
original deadline which was primarily due to delays in submitting the legal opinion for the
supplemental credit.
Conclusions, Future Operations, and Major Lessons Learned
9.    The outcomes of the project are satisfactory.
10.   The need to pursue the reforms initiated under this project led to a third urban project
(PACVU, Credit 2728-BUR) which became effective in May 1996, and to a Public Works and
Decentralization Project which is being prepared.
11.   The key lesson to be drawn from this project is that for an urban investment program to be
successful it must have the support of its principal partners, namely the municipalities. Other
lessons learned are: (i) coordination between local partners is essential to implement institutional
reforms in the urban sector; (ii) the Government must develop cooperation with and among donors,
especially for the decentralization of urban services and infrastructure; (iii) continuity of projects
must be ensured to secure sector reforms; (iv) overly complex operational arrangements, involving
several implementing agencies, and potential conflicts in jurisdiction, should be avoided; and (v)
simple disbursement procedures should be adopted.

INTRODUCTION
1.    Since the country's independence, the Government of Burkina Faso has had to cope with a
sharp rise in urban growth rates, averaging 8.5% a year from 1970 to 1980. Although the country is
one of the least urbanized in the region, with just one-fourth of its population living in cities as
compared to 40% for West Africa as a whole, the state of virtually all urban infrastructure left a
great deal to be desired in the 1980s. Its poor condition required excessive spending on
maintenance considering the very limited resources of municipalities and the national government.
2.    A first urban project (Credit 766-BUR for US$8.2 million) was approved in March 1978
and completed in December 1985. This project financed the improvement of 438 hectares by
building over 7,000 housing units, and developing 4,500 serviced housing sites covering 250
hectares. The project's cost recovery and institution building objectives in the urban affairs and
housing sector were achieved. This project had a considerable impact on urban development in
Burkina Faso, specifically by creating large-scale sites for individual housing construction. This
type of program has subsequently become the key method by which the Government has sought to
implement its housing policy.
3.   In September 1984, the Government of Burkina Faso asked IDA to finance a second urban
project. This project was designed to assist the Government's urban sector reform program,
rationalize urban management, and review the distribution of responsibilities and resources between
central and local levels of government.



2
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Al.  Description of Objectives
4.    Project objectives were as follows: (a) Gradually build the organizational, technical, and
financial capacity of the municipalities of Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso so that they could
fully take on their responsibilities as contracting authorities for maintenance of urban infrastructure
and supply of urban services, so as to cope with the increasingly rapid population growth of those
cities; and (b) Improve the infrastructure of these two cities by bringing it up to an acceptable
general level so that effective, routine maintenance could be assured.
5.    The municipal institutions would be strengthened in the following ways:
(a)   In-depth reform of municipal institutions and finance. This would include a
complete review of the roles of national and municipal agencies, as well as the private
sector, and resulting in a series of laws defining an operational distribution of functions,
along with a corresponding tax base; and
(b)   Improvements in the technical and financial services offered in Ouagadougou and
Bobo Dioulasso. As far as technical services are concerned, responsibility for maintaining
street and drainage systems, and for household garbage collection would be assigned to
local governments. As for financial services, tax collection operations would be made more
efficient and changes would be made in the structure and collection of the business license
tax.
6.    The maintenance work financed by the project would accomplish the following:
(a)   Establish the basis for a well-maintained infrastructure, as a key factor in improving
living conditions and economic activity, and ensure effective maintenance by the technical
services, as a result of adequate financing; and
(b)   Test specific arrangements to maintain the infrastructure rehabilitated under the
project so that infrastructure maintenance, engineering and construction work, and services
would increasingly be subcontracted to private businesses.
A2.  Evaluation of Objectives and Risks
7.    Project objectives were ambitious. They were, however, based on a good knowledge of the
urban sector in Burkina Faso at the end of the 1980s. They were confirmed as valid at the time of
the midterm review in February 1994. Further support for the objectives was given at the time of
preparation for and then implementation of decentralization in Burkina Faso.  Although
decentralization was not planned during project preparation, the mayoral elections in the most
important cities in the country, beginning in 1995, stressed the importance of these objectives at a
local level. In addition, the gradual application of the laws and regulations required for



3
decentralization provided a framework to ensure the sustainability of the results achieved. Finally,
the objectives were consistent with the World Bank's guidelines in the area of urban development.
8.    The main risks identified at the time of project appraisal (indecisiveness of the Government
on its municipal policy) never materialized.  The country's shift to democracy and then
decentralization, strengthened the role of local governments and enabled the national government to
define its municipal policy. The risk however, that the ministry in charge of infrastructure would
fail to provide support to the Project Office, was not identified. This slowed down implementation
of the project's physical components during the start-up period.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
9.    The project achieved and in some cases exceeded its objectives, in terms of both the
institutional aspects and the physical objectives. The impact of the project was greater than
expected in areas with an increased demand for services and facilities. The overall quality of life
improved in both cities, with regard to access to education, employment and health services.
Improvements were also seen in road network maintenance as well as drainage and solid waste
management services. Important sectoral reforms transferring authority and resources to local
governments were designed and gradually implemented.  The targeted level of resource
mobilization was attained, even though these resources are still inadequate. The project's physical
objectives were achieved for the most part, and the estimated economic rate of return was
surpassed. The original project objectives remain valid and are part of the Government's sectoral
policy.
B1.  Degree of Achievement of Objectives
10.   Municipal management was improved satisfactorily and adapted to the changing
institutional environment. The accounts of the two cities were computerized, equipment was
supplied, and government workers were trained. The accounts were put in order in a two-step
process: first for the period 1986-90 and then for 1991-96. The accounting guidelines for
municipalities, which dated back to 1979 but had never been officially approved, were replaced by
new accounting guidelines approved by the Minister of Economy, Finance, and Planning (MEFP)
on December 20, 1994 (No. 66/MEFP/MAT/DG) and put into effect on January 1, 1996. Seminars
were organized in Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso to train 322 municipal accountants. Based on
a municipal sector study, a new distribution of functions between the local and central governments
was proposed and a Municipal Code was drawn up, in coordination with an ad-hoc interministerial
committee. This study was delayed on purpose so that it could take the basic laws on
decentralization into account, and was completed in December 1994 with the presentation of a bill
on communes and a draft Municipal Code. A number of points from those laws have been
incorporated into the Law to Guide Decentralization being prepared by the National
Decentralization Committee (CND). This law, and the Municipal Code, are expected to be
introduced in the National Assembly before mid-1998. The Project to Improve Urban Living
Conditions (Credit 2728-BUR, approved on May 23, 1995) follows up on those operations.

11.   The mobilization of financial resources surpassed objectives. The Borrower was
supposed to increase the volume of business tax assessments by 30% over 1985 figures, and obtain
a minimum tax collection rate of 75% four years after the effective date, or by September 1994.
These targets were reached. The laws and regulations needed to reform the business license tax
were adopted. Assessment and billing of business taxes increased by a factor of 2.35 in
Ouagadougou and 2.75 in Bobo Dioulasso from 1985 to 1996. During the period 1990-96, the
average collection rate was 95% percent for Ouagadougou, as compared to 28% in 1985, and 90%
in Bobo Dioulasso, as compared to 50% in 1985. The business tax earmings represent the main
source of local revenues, accounting for about 50% of total local government revenues. The new
system was complemented by the construction of five Hotels des Finances grouping together the
tax, land, and treasury offices--three in Ouagadougou and two in Bobo Dioulasso. These
government offices moved into their new premises in 1996, and were outfitted with furniture and
computer equipment.
12.   An urban information system was set up satisfactorily. The project made it possible for
the two municipalities to adopt a complete addressing system and to put in place an identification
system, including street signs and numbering of lots, which was more extensive than anticipated:
16,625 street signs, 4,787 signposts, and 108,700 residence numbers were installed in
Ouagadougou, while 5,300 street signs, 1,505 signposts, and 43,000 residence numbers were
installed in Bobo Dioulasso, as compared to the projected total of 8,000 street signs. Maps and
addressing plans were produced, and a guide-map for the two cities was prepared. The guide-maps
have been used by the National Water and Sanitation Office (ONEA) since May 1997 to improve
distribution of invoices. These measures were completed by surveying over 75,000 parcels of land
in Ouagadougou and 21,000 parcels in Bobo Dioulasso, with a view to making it easier for national
and local authorities to collect taxes and fees. A land management computer program was also
developed for the MEFP. It is scheduled to be updated regularly under the PACVU.
13.   The objectives of strengthening technical services were achieved. Technical assistance
and training were provided in a satisfactory manner, to the end of the project, resulting in the
reorganization of communal technical offices, government procurement procedures, and the
programming of road maintenance services using the Urbavia software program. To enhance the
impact of technical assistance, services were rendered over short time periods throughout the
project. Systematic recourse to private enterprise made it possible to limit repairs of existing
equipment, as well as the provision of new equipment for the creation of a road maintenance crew
in each municipality.
14.   The infrastructure rehabilitation objectives were exceeded.  A  description of
achievements, as compared to the projections contained in the appraisal report, is given in Table 5
of Part II. Overall, the quantities achieved greatly exceeded the estimates, but this is to be expected
since the amount of the credit was increased from SDR 18 to SDR 24.9 million (see paragraph 19).
Routine maintenance of the sections of national highways within the city limits was transferred to
the MIHU. The routine maintenance work on national highways was performed well by private
companies, and they covered longer road segments than estimated, without entailing an increase in
the amount of the credit earmarked for this operation. The cleaning of gutters along city streets fell
below forecasts, as part of this work was done under the Public Works for Employment Project



5
(Credit 2282-BUR, approved on June 27, 1991). The program to collect runoff water in the Colma
and Yeguere districts in Bobo Dioulasso was implemented adequately. As a result, it was possible
to test the technical and socio-economic impact of the construction of drainage basins, a technique
that allows capital costs to be reduced. This program was monitored closely to make sure that this
technique would be viable in the long run, and that it could be used on a larger scale. Construction
of the Zogona Canal in Ouagadougou, however, which was supposed to be financed by the Italian
Government, was abandoned, as the credit for that project never materialized. Instead, construction
of the canal was incorporated into the PACVU project (paragraph 20). With the exception of the
canal, the work that was performed under this project easily met objectives.
15.   The improvement in household garbage collection was consistent with forecasts. The
project financed household garbage collection equipment for the municipalities of Ouagadougou
and Bobo Dioulasso, as scheduled, and the operation of municipal services is satisfactory. The
gradual privatization of household garbage collection service, a requirement for sustainability, was
not implemented because of Government's decision to dissolve the National Office of
Maintenance, Cleaning, and Embellishment Services (ONASENE) and was moved to the PACVU
(Paragraph 22).
16.   The Govermnent observed the terms of the housing policy letter approved during
negotiations. It was impossible, however, to include support for reform of housing financing
arrangements in the project, and the Government has not set up a satisfactory housing financing
system on its own.
B2.   Economic Analysis
17.   The economic analysis for rehabilitation of the urban streets and sanitation system in the
SAR shows an internal rate of return (IRR) of 34% for the Ouagadougou street and sanitation
system and a 31% rate for Bobo Dioulasso's system. A similar analysis was done to identify the
segments to be upgraded at the time of preparation for the supplementary credit (paragraph 19),
with similar results: 32% for the Ouagadougou system and 30% for the Bobo Dioulasso system.
In early 1997, after the work was finished, the traffic count taken on a significant sample of the
rehabilitated street and sanitation system turned out to be much higher than estimated in earlier
economic studies. The revised IRRs are on average one-third higher than the initial IRRs. These
outcomes are not unusual in the case of rehabilitation. The primary reason why the IRR was
underestimated is that the volume of traffic attracted by the rehabilitated system was greater than
expected by 30%. The work to rehabilitate the street and drainage system as a whole accounted for
45% of the total amount of the credit.
18.   A technical and socio-economic evaluation of the Cohna-Yegu&e  sanitation system was
also carried out once the project had been implemented, since there was no economic analysis in
the appraisal report. It showed that the cost of the system with drainage basins, as implemented by
the project, is 50% less than the originally estimated cost for a tradlitional system with sewers,
which appeared in the master plan. The amount of work involved here accounted for 5% of the
credit.

C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
19.   Factors not attributable to the Government. The primary factor that affected the project
was the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994. This led to a supplemental credit of US$10
million when IDA and the Government agreed to counter the negative impact of the devaluation on
the low-income population by increasing job opportunities and hence the volume of work under the
ongoing project. With this supplemental credit, the closing date of the original Credit was
postponed from June 30, 1996 to March 31, 1997. The CFA devaluation considerably increased
the local counterpart funds to be provided by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the municipalities
for routine maintenance work and led to a reduction in the portion not financed by IDA under
categories 1, 2, and 3 of the Credit.
20.   Another factor that could have had serious adverse effects if an alternative solution had not
been identified was the failure of the Italian Govenmient to secure the $5.5 million package to
finance the master plan for sanitation and drainage in Ouagadougou, and the work on the Zogona
Canal. On August 28, 1989, the UNDP provided $300,000 through the Regional Water and
Sanitation Group (GREA) in Abidjan to prepare the strategic sanitation plan for Ouagadougou.
The master plan for drainage and the work on the Zogona Canal were finally made a part of the
PACVU, at the request of the Government.
21.   Factors attributable to the Government. An important factor that contributed to the
achievement of project objectives was the Government's decision to embark on a democratic
process in 1991, with a new constitution, national assembly elections, and presidential elections,
and then to initiate a gradual decentralization process. The elections of mayors and city council
members in early 1995 highlighted the importance of the project as a technical and financial tool to
help in the decentralization process, which had a pronounced political dimension in Burkina Faso.
The strengthening of the political role of municipalities made people more aware of the need to
reinforce management tools at the local level.
22.  It is also important to note that project preparation was relatively slow, primarily because
the Government did away with municipal technical services in 1986, when it gave the responsibility
for collecting household garbage to ONASENE, under the authority of the Ministry for the
Environment. This move ran counter to project objectives, since it removed collection services
from the authority of the municipalities. The Government was well aware of this, as on November
4, 1986, it took the initiative of suspending the second stage of the feasibility studies. It took two
years of talks before the Government agreed to give the responsibility for providing these services
back to the municipalities, leaving only the task of beautification of urban areas to ONASENE. As
a result, the appraisal mission finally took place in February 1989.
23.   Factors attributable to the Project Office. The First Urban Project (Credit 766-BUR)
was run by a project office that reported to the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs in the
Ministry of Infrastructure. Although the project was implemented satisfactorily, the second project
was placed under the authority of the Ministry of Finance, in view of the significance of the
project's administrative and financial components. A new project office was set up for that
purpose. However, because an adequately trained engineer was not available from the outset, the



7
infrastructure component of the project got off to a slow start, and this affected not only the actual
construction work, but also the studies involved. This in turn had an adverse effect on
disbursement during the first two years. The Project Office corrected this problem by hiring a
Burkina Faso engineer on a contract basis, and implementation of the work was speeded up as a
result.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
24.   It is likely that the institutional reforms are sustainable. Although decentralization was not
considered during project preparation, it has been under way in Burkina Faso since the early 1990s.
This has helped the central and local governments set up new institutional, technical, and financial
arrangements that will eventually lead to autonomous municipalities. Sustainability greatly
benefits from this ongoing reform process. The National Decentralization Committee, under the
Office of the Prime Minister, has played an important role in drafting laws and implementing
decrees on decentralization which should eventually give municipalities more responsibility over
their financial resources. The existence since 1995 of elected city officials has made local
govemments more dynamic and is an important measure of the central government's policy of
handing over responsibilities to municipal governments, especially in Ouagadougou and Bobo
Dioulasso.
25.   It is likely that physical investments are sustainable provided that local revenues are
increased and financial management of the municipalities is improved. The reform of the business
license tax has brought a sharp rise in local government revenue, and the addressing and street sign
program has improved collection of all the local taxes and assessments. The new accounting
guidelines drawn up under the project have been circulated and users have been trained in their use.
The financial management of the local governments should therefore improve so that they will be
in a position to handle the increased municipal budgets. These municipalities have very little room
for maneuver at present, however, and so further progress in the area of resource mobilization and
sharing between local and central levels of government will have to be pursued.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
26.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory. There were five project managers over a period
of 12 years, which is too many, but there were only two during the supervision period, which is
reasonable. Continuity of supervision was assured because there was a period of more than a year
when the work of two successive project managers overlapped, and this had a positive impact on
project implementation. There were a total of 15 supervision missions, an average of two a year.
Project preparation was needlessly long, lasting from June 1984 to February 1989, primarily due to
disagreements between the Bank and the Borrower over ONASENE.
27.   During implementation, it became apparent that disbursement categories 1, 2 and 3 of the
Credit were particularly complicated, with diminishing financing, i.e., 100%, 80%, 50%, and 20%.
The thresholds varied from one category to another, making the practical application very difficult.



8
This led to cost allocation enrors at the beginning of the project. The requirement that the initial
credit and the supplemental one be handled as two separate financial operations also created
administrative difficulties for both the Bank and the Borrower.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
28.   Government performance. The Borrower's performance was satisfactory, although it fell
short of the mark at the outset of the project. The Government disrupted project preparation when
it decided on September 5, 1986, i.e. one month before the appraisal mission, to abolish the
municipal street and sanitation services and create ONASENE (paragraph 22). MIHU delayed
project start-up by failing to make competent technical personnel available.  Cooperative
arrangements between MIHU and the project office were very difficult when implementation
started, but they gradually improved over time. Finally, the Government was able to take the
opportunity provided by the project to conduct an in-depth review of its future housing policy. The
Government never failed to take the steps needed to make sure that the counterpart funds were
available according to the agreed conditions, and it gave its clear support for the planned reforms.
29.   Performance of the Project Office. The performance of the project office, the executing
agency, is regarded as highly satisfactory. The project director was appointed on March 21, 1988
and remained on the job until the credit closed. This continuity was beneficial to the project. The
absence of an engineer in the project office up to March 1992 was subsequently compensated for by
contracting the services of an engineer, and then using consultants as needed. Adoption of the
Bank's standard documents simplified and accelerated procurement procedures. Quarterly progress
reports were forwarded regularly to the Bank. Project accounts were audited every year by
independent auditors approved by IDA. Audit reports were submitted routinely to IDA, though
sometimes a bit late. They always certified that the accounts accurately depicted the financial
situation of the project.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
30.   The project achieved, and at times surpassed, its objectives. It was rated as satisfactory
throughout the supervision period. The outcome of the project is therefore considered satisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
31.   The good results obtained with the second urban project and the need to further increase
financial resources going to local governments argued in favor of continuing these efforts with the
Urban Environment Project (UEP - Cr. n° 2728-BUR, effective May 1996). This new project aims
to improve urban living conditions in the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso and follows
up on the urban management reforms launched during the Second Urban Project. The VEP focuses
on urban environmental problems and targets primarily the main infiastructure in the poor districts



9
on the outskirts of both cities. The project will also continue support for the decentralization
program. Specific mechanisms have been set up in this project to help monitor the share of the
municipal budget dedicated to infrastructure maintenance in both cities.
32.   The continued implementation of reforms linked to decentralization and its impact on
medium-sized cities has led the Bank to grant a request from the Government to prepare a Public
Works and Decentralization Project. A project preparation facility was made available in March
1997. Project appraisal is scheduled to take place during fiscal 1998. It is aimed at: (i) developing
the project identification, planning, and investment programming capacities in medium-sized cities;
and (ii) helping them delegate the contracting authority. This project should help to define the role
of the Faso Baara Agency, which was established as part of the public works for employment
project.
33.   The tools needed to implement the housing policy, including the financing mechanisms, are
currently unsatisfactory and housing sector performance is very poor. The development of small
loans for housing upgrading through the Caisses Populaires within the UEP will not be sufficient
to provide an answer to the urban population, especially newcomers. It is likely that a specific
effort will be needed from the Government, with help from the Bank, to design and implement a
sound policy framework that would alleviate constraints and allow market forces to work.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
34.   The key lesson learned from the project is that in order for an urban project to be successful,
it must support and be supported by its principal partners, the municipalities. Even though the
mayors were appointed by the Government, and not elected at the time the project was being
prepared, the project took into account the urban dynamics of the two cities. This had the following
results: (i) it accelerated preparation of the planned reforms and implementation of the physical
components; (ii) it mobilized the local human, technical, and financial capacity to maintain the
investments; and (iii) it facilitated the adjustment to the decentralization process.
35.   Other lessons learned are:
(a)   The Government must enhance communication and coordination between sectors to
better implement institutional reforms. These reforms, especially in the urban sector, are
precarious, take time to implement and need follow-up. It is essential that the objectives be
clearly identified and supported by all the local partners;
(b)   Effective cooperative arrangements between the Government and lenders, as well as
among lenders, need to be implemented. Special efforts, along with a system for
exchanging information to enhance donor coordination is required in order to better support
the decentralization process. Decentralization in Burkina Faso has already mobilized a
large number of lenders through various operations, but it is a particularly complex task;



10
(c)   Urban sector reform needs to take place over a period of time commensurate with
the importance of the reforms. Reform implementation cannot be dealt within the time span
of a single project, but may require several projects;
(d)   Overly complex operational arrangements involving several different implementing
agencies should be avoided, as they are likely to entail conflict of powers and jurisdiction,
and special measures should be taken to mitigate the lack of coordination among ministries;
and finally
(e)   Disbursement procedures should be kept simple. For example, the introduction of
diminishing percentages of expenses to be charged against the various Credit categories is
difficult to manage and unnecessarily complicates the mobilization of counterpart funds.

DEUXIEME PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT URBAIN
Mission d'Achevement de I'Association Internationale de Developpement (IDA)
Christian Diou - AFTU2 - 2 au 8 fevrier 1997
AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.    La mission IDA effectuee par Christian Diou (AFTU2) et Gerard Tenaille (Consultant) du 2 au 8
fevrier 1997 etait la derniere mission de supervision du projet. Elle avait pour objectifs principaux: (i) de
lancer un processus d'evaluation aussi complet que possible des performances du projet, de son impact et
des difficultes rencontrees dans sa mise en oeuvre, tant par 1'emprunteur que par la Banque; et (ii) de
revoir, avec le bureau du projet, les demi6res operations en cours ou a lancer avant la clture. Elle a
ben6ficie du soutien de Sophie Revillion (Specialiste Audit et Comptabilit6 a la Mission Residente).
2.    La mission remercie P'ensemble des personnalites rencontr6es (liste en Annexe 1) pour leur
accueil et leur disponibilite et tout particulierement Monsieur Tertius Zongo, Ministre D6legue aupres du
Premier Ministre, Charg6 des Finances et du Developpement Economique et Madame Denise
Belemsagha, Directrice du Bureau du Projet Urbain.
3.    La mission a pu disposer du rapport d'achevement prepare par le Gouvernement. Ce rapport
figure en Annexe 2 au present Aide-Memoire. Les diverses composantes du projet ont pu etre examindes
en d6tail avec 1'ensemble des partenaires locaux a Ouagadougou et a l'occasion d'un deplacement
effectue a Bobo-Dioulasso. De maniere generale, les beneficiaires ont exprime leur satisfaction quant
aux resultats obtenus, tout en soulignant qu'il s'agissait desormais d'en consolider les acquis dans les
deux communes et au niveau central, en matiere de gestion et d'entretien des infrastructures et de
poursuite du programme des reformes institutionnelles. Les programmes d'execution pr6vus au projet
sont decrits en d6tail par composante dans le tableau en Annexe 3. La mission tient a saisir cette occasion
pour souligner 1'excellent climat de cooperation qui a pr6valu, tant au sein du bureau du projet, dont
l'equipe est restee particulierement stable, qu'avec les interlocuteurs au sein des divers ministeres et des
municipalites de Ouagadougou et Bobo-Dioulasso.
4.    Les observations de la mission, expos6es dans le present Aide-Memoire et ses annexes, devront
8tre confirmees apres son retour au siege.
Validite des hypotheses initiales
5.    Les objectifs principaux retenus par le Gouvernement du Burkina Faso et la Banque pendant la
phase preparatoire du projet etaient les suivants:
(a) developper progressivement la capacite des municipalites de Ouagadougou et Bobo-Dioulasso
a assurer pleinement leur role de maitre d'ouvrage; et
(b) amnliorer l'infrastructure de ces deux villes pour l'amener A un niveau gen6ral satisfaisant,
permettant ensuite un entretien regulier et efficace.

6.    Le programme d'actions qui en decoulait s'articulait sur six composantes: I'amelioration de la
gestion municipale; la mobilisation des ressources financieres; la mise en place d'un systeme
d'information urbain; le renforcement des services techniques municipaux et la rehabilitation des
infrastructures urbaines; la gestion des ordures m6nageres; et la mise en awuvre de la politique de
l'habitat.
7.    D'une maniere g6nerale, la p6riode de mise en oeuvre du projet n'a pas connu de remise en cause
fondamentale des hypotheses initiales, bien que des 6volutions importantes aient eu lieu, notamment en
matiere de reformes institutionnelles dont toutes n'etaient pas prevues A l'origine dans le cadre du projet.
II s'agit essentiellement de la d6centralisation, un des chantiers majeurs du Burkina Faso des ann&es 90.
De maniere g6n6rale, cette evolution a ete plut6t favorable au projet, dans la mesure oi elle a mobilise de
nombreux partenaires locaux et internationaux sur des objectifs voisins dont la coherence etait assur6e
par une forte volonte politique locale de mener A bien cette r6forme importante. Cette p6riode a vu
I'arrivee d'6quipes municipales 6lues et responsabilisees, notamment dans les deux villes-cibles du projet.
Le bureau du projet a ete suffisamment flexible pour s'adapter A cet environnement nouveau, et il semble
que les realisations effectives, en cours ou pr6vues, en matiere de r6forme fondamentale des institutions
et des fmances, marquent un progres sensible sur la situation au debut du projet. II s'agit cependant d'un
processus long, oui les acquis restent a conforter en permanence, et qui reste soumis a des aleas
importants, notamment en matiere de capacite fmanciere reelle des municipalites. Le bon achevement du
processus reste donc conditionne par la continuite du r6alisme prudent qui a marqu6 le debut de la
d6centralisation.
8.    Lors de la revue du projet A mi-parcours, effectuee en janvier 1994, la conformnite des objectifs
initiaux avec les priorites du Gouvernement du Burkina Faso avaient ete confirmees. Les analyses qui
avaient prevalu lors de l'evaluation initiale du projet restaient ainsi valables, a rexception de celles portant
sur un renforcement, jug6 excessif, de l'equipement en materiel lourd des services techniques de
Ouagadougou et de Bobo-Dioulasso. La revue du projet A mi-parcours avait constate que les capacites
financieres des municipalites et les orientations pr6visibles des interventions dans le secteur urbain
militaient d6sormais davantage pour un recours accru au secteur prive, A la sous-traitance et a la
delegation de maitrise d'ouvrage et ne devraient pas entrainer un developpement excessif des travaux en
regie. Les recommandations, alors faites, de mieux evaluer la future capacite technique d'intervention
directe des services techniques des deux municipalites et notamment l'impact sur I'acquisition ou la
rehabilitation des moyens materiels, avaient ainsi renforce la tendance deja existante a la sous-traitance
des travaux et services a des entreprises privees. Ce diagnostic a e confirm6 pendant la deuxieme partie
de la mise en oeuvre du projet qui n'a donc pas subi de redefinition majeure.
Composantes institutionnelles
9.    Les diverses composantes du projet ont donc pu 8tre mises en oeuvre conformement au
programme initial, a l'exception de l'informatisation de la comptabilit6 municipale de Ouagadougou et
Bobo-Dioulasso (enveloppe estim6e en 1996 a 100 millions de FCFA). Le demarrage effectifde cette
composante a ete retarde par la ndcessaire mise en place des equipes municipales 6lues; son deroulement
a dte ralenti par le manque de cadres municipaux qualifies; I'acquisition de materiel micro-informatique a
et retardee, puis relancee recemment par le bureau du projet. Les principales operations prevues pour
l'amelioration de la gestion municipale (remise a niveau des comptes et revision de l'instruction
comptable) ont neanmoins et6 menees a bien et il semble que l'acquisition de materiel micro-
informnatique en quantite minimale telle que desormais prevu soit plus adaptee aux capacites de
l'administration municipale. L'internalisation des reformes deja introduites au sein des municipalites est
en effet une condition prealable essentielle au succes de la poursuite des
DEUXIEME PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT URBAIN - Mission d'Achevement- F6vrier 1997         Page 2



op6rations. Force est de constater, par exemple, que les balances d'entree, pourtant validees par la
DGTCP, ne sont toujours pas prises en compte dans les comptabilites municipales. Seule une implication
tres forte des plus hautes autorites municipales dlues sera de nature A perenniser ces acquis. Par ailleurs,
la baisse continue du prix des materiels infornatiques depuis 1989 devrait faciliter la recherche des
financements necessaires a la poursuite des programmes engages.
10.   L'ampleur des rdformes lides a la decentralisation est tel que la mise en place de la totalite d'un
processus qui a commence en mai 1993 (lois 003 a 007/93/ADP des 7 et 12 mai 1993) devrait prendre
une quinzaine d'annees selon la Commission Nationale de Decentralisation. La mise en place de
nouvelles institutions (municipalites 6lues) et la definition de la politique de decentralisation ont
nettement confortd le r6le des collectivites territoriales dans 1'effort de developpement national et leur
importance dans le projet. Bien que ces profondes mutations aient eu des consequences importantes sur
le rythme d'avancement des reformes au niveau municipal, elles contribuent visiblement a la mise en
place progressive d'un cadre institutionnel homogene. Les actions pr6vues dans le cadre du projet ont pu
8tre mises en place en parfaite coherence avec la reconnaissance de cette dynamique nationale et locale.
II.   Les compdtences et les ressources des collectivites locales ont ete dtudiees par un comitd
interministeriel mis en place en 1992 et 1993, puis dans le cadre de la politique de decentralisation par la
CND. L'etude sectorielle produite par un consultant international dans le cadre du projet a alimentd les
travaux de la CND. Ses conclusions ont ete discutees au cours de l'annee 1996, notamment A l'occasion
d'un "atelier national de capitalisation" qui s'est tenu du 9 au 12 decembre 1996 A Ouagadougou. Depuis
janvier 1997, les avant-projets des textes d'orientation sur la decentralisation, prepares sous la
responsabilit6 de la Commission Nationale de Decentralisation ont ete soumis a 1'examen du
Gouvernement et leur approbation est prevue dans les prochains mois: (i) loi portant orientation de la
decentralisation; (ii) loi portant organisation de l'administration du territoire; (iii) loi portant organisation
et fonctionnement des collectivites locales; (iv) loi portant regime dlectoral des conseillers des
collectivites locales; et (v) loi portant programmation de la mise en oeuvre de la decentralisation. Ces
projets de loi sont accompagnes des projets de textes d'application. Selon les informations transmises par
la CND, certaines dispositions du code communal sont deja inclues dans les projets de textes.
L'approbation du Code des Communes est prdvue au cours de l'annee 1997, apres finalisation puis
approbation du cadre institutionnel de la decentralisation et ajustements eventuels du projet de Code des
Communes. Compte tenu de l'importance de la rdforme et de son impact sur le secteur urbain en
particulier, la mission a souhaite recevoir les projets de textes dans les meilleurs delais.
12.   Les informations communiquees a la mission concernant ces projets de lois semblent cependant
confirmer un changement important dans la nature du processus de ddcentralisation, par l'introduction de
la notion de communes rurales. La totalit6 du territoire burkinabe devrait donc, A terme, etre decoup6e en
communes (urbaines ou rurales. Cela devrait entrainer la creation de 350 a 500 communes sur l'ensemble
du territoire, sans commune mesure avec le dispositif d'assistance qui avait et6 mis en place par le
Gouvernement en 1995 et 1996 (Fodecom et Sagedecom). II semble donc indispensable qu'un d6bat
puisse etre engage afin d'adapter le rythme de la rdforme avec les capacites financieres et humaines du
pays et faciliter la mise en place d'un dispositif de soutien addquat. L'articulation des relations villes-
campagnes et l'impact des dchanges generes devraient en particulier etre soigneusement examines,
notamment du point de vue de leur impact sur le d6veloppement du pays.
Mobilisation des ressources locales
13.    Sur le plan financier, et en depit des efforts fournis, la capacite des deux principales villes du
Burkina Faso est restee faible. Le constat realis6 A la mi-parcours est reste
DEUXIEME PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT URBAIN - Mission d'Achevement- Fevrier 1997         Page 3



valable: bien que les engagements contractuels aient et6 largement remplis (voir Annexe 4), les
ressources mobilisees par ces municipalites ne permettent pas d'envisager un accroissement significatif
de la fourniture de services urbains. Dans ces conditions, I'articulation entre le 2eme PDU et le PACVU
apparait encore plus n6cessaire. La mission a attir6 l'attention des autorites sur le besoin de poursuivre
les actions en cours. Elle a rappel6 en particulier les conclusions de la mission effectuee en avril 1996
par un consultant international (Groupe Huit) et qui figurent en annexe de l'Aide-Memoire de la mission
de supervision de juillet 1996. Les actions a entreprendre pour que les acquis du 20PDU puissent 8tre
appropri6s par les administrations concernes et les gestionnaires du PACVU y 6taient d6taillees ainsi que
les actions en faveur d'une coordination renforcee entre le 20PDU et le PACVU.
Programmes d'investissements
14.   Les r6alisations techniques et les programmes d'investissement mis en oeuvre constituent un
6l6ment tres largement positif a mettre au credit du bureau du projet et de ses partenaires locaux. Le
dispositif de soutien au bureau du projet, mis en place au d6but de I'annee 1992, a permis d'achever les
programmes prevus, souvent en allant au-dela des previsions.
15.   Les derniers contrats sont en cours d'achevement et, selon les informations communiquees par
l'unit6 de projet, devraient tous 8tre acheves avant le 31 mars prochain, date de cl6ture du Credit. Le
bureau du projet a procede A une verification detaill6e des engagements en cours pour identifier le solde
r6ellement disponible sur le Credit. Le montant du contrat en cours pour la rehabilitation des voiries a
Ouagadougou et Bobo-Dioulasso sera ajuste pour utiliser ce solde. La mission a souligne qu'avant de
pr6senter le projet d'avenant, le bureau du projet devait effectivement s'assurer que la totalit6 des
engagements n'excederait en aucun cas le montant mis A disposition dans le cadre du Credit.
Modalites de gestion du projet
16.   Le suivi financier a fait beaucoup de progres et semble desormais fait avec s6rieux, malgr6 les
difficult6s rencontr6es lors de la mise en place du Credit supplementaire. L'ouverture de deux comptes
speciaux paralleles et des difficult6s de communication entre les services financiers du bureau du projet et
le service des decaissements de la Banque ont conduit a reduire en fin de p6riode les engagements de
depenses et les disponibilites de tresorerie du projet. Les risques de blocages ont cependant pu 8tre
anticip6s et le service des decaissements a pu mettre en place les mesures n6cessaires au d6but du mois de
frvrier.
17.   La mission a 6galement proc6de, avec l'assistance de Sophie R6villion, A une verification des
Demandes de Remboursement 6tablies par le bureau du projet sur le Compte Sp6cial de novembre 1996 A
fin janvier 1997. Les demandes semblent etablies et suivies avec serieux. Toutefois, certains ajustements
devront 8tre effectu6s par le bureau du projet, conformement aux procedures de la Banque. Une lettre
particuliere sera adress6e par la Mission Residente de la Banque aux fins de regularisation.
9.    Le groupement SOFIDEC-Ernst & Young, pressenti pour realiser l'audit des comptes du projet,
s'est dissout. Apres consultation avec ses nouveaux partenaires, SOFIDEC a propose de recomposer un
groupement avec Calan-Ramolino, sans incidence sur les couts du contrat en cours. La mission a donn6
son avis de non-objection. II a ete confirme que l'audit des comptes du premier semestre 1996, dejA
r6alis6 par SOFIDEC, serait valid6 et cosign6 par Calan-Ramolino. Le nouveau groupement a commenc6
son travail pour une p6riode de deux semaines pour la r6alisation de l'audit des comptes du second
semestre 1996. Conform6ment a l'Accord de Credit, ce rapport d'audit aurait du parvenir a la Banque
avant la fin f6vrier 1997. Compte tenu de la situation particuliere, il sera

cependant transmis avant la fin mars 1997. La periode 1 erjanvier 1997-31 mars 1997 ainsi que les
dernieres op6rations sur le Credit, feront l'objet d'un autre rapport d'audit qui sera realise apres la cloture
des operations sur le Credit, soit en juillet 1997 au plus tard.

Annex B
BURKINA FASO - SECOND URBAN PROJECT (Cr. 2067-BUR)
Summary of Borrower Contribution
Achievement of objectives
1.    The project achieved its objectives. The initial objectives were confirmed at Mid-
Term Review in 1994. Ambitious sectoral reforms were started regarding the
reinforcement of the role of municipalities; some of them are now effective. The physical
objectives were for the most part, surpassed, despite a difficult start of the project
implementation. It is likely that the institutional reforms and the physical investments
will prove to be sustainable. The Government's commitment to decentralization and a
good coordination with the follow-up project (Urban Environment Project) will help
ascertain these good results. Continuous improvement in local tax collection should be
the basis for real sustainability of the investments.
Project financing and management
2.    The initial Credit Agreement financed all the components identified during
project preparation. Nevertheless, a planned cofmancing from the Italian Government
never materialized. As a result of the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994, a
supplemental Credit was added by IDA (US$10 million). It increased the impact of the
project in the field. This operation was made possible by the good performance of the
project. The counterpart financing, estimated to about US$10.8 million was mobilized
on tine by the Government and the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. All
contractual commitments were fulfilled before the closing date of march 31, 1997.
Performance of the Bank
3.    The Bank's performed well in project supervision and by making possible the
post-devaluation supplemental Credit. Bank performance could have been better in the
design of disbursement categories (too complex) and the management of the
supplemental Credit as a separate Credit.
Performance of the borrower
4.    A borrower's decision delayed the appraisal of the project. Then, the project unit
performed very well in implementation after the recruitment of an engineer. The same
team was in place from 1988 to the closing of the project in 1997.



BURKNA FASO
RAPPORT D'ACHEVEMENT DE I'EMPRUNTEUR
DEUXIEME PROJET DE DEVELOPPEMENT URBAIN (Cr. 2067-BUR)
Le 2e Projet de Ddveloppement Urbain a vise la mobilisation des ressources financi6res et le
renforcement des infrastructures municipales afin de permettre aux municipalit6s de Ouagadougou et de
Bobo-Dioulasso d'assurer pleinement leur r6le de maitres d'ouvrages sur le plan organisationnel,
technique, administratif et financier pour l'entretien des infrastructures et la fourniture des services
urbains face a une croissance de plus en plus rapide de la population. Ce projet a permis d'am6liorer et
renforcer les infiastructures de ces deux villes pour les amener a un niveau gen6ral satisfaisant,
permettant ensuite un entretien regulier et efficace.
Ce projet avait pour objectifs principaux:
- L'am6lioration de la gestion municipale
- La mobilisation des ressources financieres
- La mise en place d'un systeme d'informations urbaines
- La r6habilitation des infrastructures communales
- Le renforcement des services techniques municipaux
- La collecte et la gestion des ordures menageres.
L'objectif essentiel de l'IDA 6tait de permettre d'am6liorer la gestion des deux (2) villes
contribuant ainsi a cr6er un environnement physique et institutionnel plus favorable aux investissements
priv6s, essentiel & la croissance economique ainsi qu'a la creation de nouveaux emplois. Les objectifs
secondaires visaient la creation de conditions plus favorables et a l'amelioration de la gestion des
ressources publiques et la suppression des obstacles materiels et institutionnels.
Sur le plan institutionnel, le 2e Projet de D6veloppement Urbain avait pour objectif de d6finir et
de clarifier les competences respectives de l'Etat et des Municipalit6s a travers son projet de code des
communes.
Les principaux r6sultats attendus de ce projet 6taient les suivants:
- Un meilleur fonctionnement des services urbains
- Un meilleur taux de recouvrement des imnp6ts locaux
- L'etablissement d'un niveau de service optimal des voies et la desserte des
quartiers urbains
- L'amelioration du reseau d'assainissement des eaux pluviales
- La collecte et la gestion des ordures menageres
- La formation des agents municipaux
- La sensibilisation de la population sur certaines actions de developpement.
I - LES REALISATIONS DU PROJET
Les objectifs du Projet etaient tres ambitieux au depart, mais leur validite a e confirmee lors de
la revue a mi-parcours du projet en Fevrier 1994. Des reformes sectorielles tres importantes ont ete



2
pr6par6es et pour certaines d'entre elles d6ja mises en place, visant le transfert effectif des responsabilit6s
aux collectivit6s locales.
A - Gestion communale
Les comptes des deux communes Ouagadougou et Bobo-Dioulasso ont e  remis a niveau pour
les exercices 1985 A 1995. Une nouvelle instruction comptable applicable aux communes du Burkina a
ete 6labor6e et mise en vigueur a compter de Janvier 1996. Trois cent vingt deux (322) comptables
communaux ont et6 fornms A l'utilisation de cette nouvelle instruction comptable.Elle doit aboutir A
retablir la production r6guliere des comptes administratifs et de gestion traduisant ainsi la situation
financiere reelle des communes.
Un code des communes a ete redige depuis 1994 et soumis a la Commission Nationale de
D6centralisation. En fait, cette 6tude a ete retard6e volontairement pour attendre l'adoption des textes
d'orientation sur la Decentralisation.
B - Mobilisation des ressources financieres
La reforme de la patente et de la contribution mobiliere est intervenue par les ordonnances n's
92-016/PRES et 92-0171PRES du 19 Mars 1992 portant modification du code des Impots. Ces
ordonnances sont entrees en vigueur a compter du ler janvier 1992. La contribution mobiliere est
devenue la taxe de residence. La refonne de la patente a permis de multiplier les emissions par 2,35 A
Ouagadougou et 2,75 A Bobo-Dioulasso. Le taux moyen de recouvrement de la patente a 6te de 96 % A
Ouagadougou et 91 % a Bobo-Dioulasso pendant la p6riode visee de 1992 a 1996 (cf Annexe 2).
En ce qui concerne la taxe de residence, les resultats sont plus mitiges. Son taux moyen de
recouvrement est de 58 % A Ouagadougou et 27 % a Bobo-Dioulasso. Ainsi la taxe de residence a fait
l'objet a nouveau d'une reforme adoptde par l'Assemblee des Deputes du Peuple en Decembre 1995 et
prend effet a compter de Janvier 1996. Pour ameliorer le fonctionnement des services fiscaux et par
consequent le recouvrement des impots cinq (5) hotels des Finances ont e  construits, trois (3) a
Ouagadougou et deux (2) a Bobo-Dioulasso. La construction de ces hotels des Finances avait pour objet
de regrouper en un seul endroit les services du Tr6sor, des Impots et des Domaines en vue de faciliter la
coordination, la coop6ration et les echanges d'informations entre les differents services jusqu'ici separes
afm d'obtenir une mobilisation optimale des ressources financieres. Chaque batiment comprend 63
bureaux sur 1 432m2 en rez-de-chaussee (cf Annexe 3).
C - Systeme d'information urbaine
Adressage
Pour ameliorer le recouvrement des impots et taxes aussi bien pour le budget de l'Etat que pour
celui des communes, le projet a realise un programme d'adressage. L'adressage a ete initie du fait d'un
ensemble de raisons dont la principale est le d6sir des autorites municipales de disposer d'un systeme
d'informations dans nos deux plus grandes villes qui sont en pleine expansion urbaine afin de contribuer
A l'amnlioration de la gestion des services urbains et a un meilleur recouvrement des impots locaux.
L'adressage permet surtout de localiser avec precision l'emplacement des habitations et les activites
exercees.



3
Les r6alisations sont all6es au-delA des previsions de l'6tude de factibilite: au lieu de 8t000
plaques initialement pr6vues on a pose 16 625 plaques de rues, 4 787 poteaux et 108 700 numeros de
portes A Ouagadougou, 5 300, 1 505 et 43 000 respectivement A Bobo-Dioulasso. Les travaux de
cartographie ont ete confies a l'Institut G6ographique du Burkina. Enfin, un plan - guide pour chacune
des villes a ete r6alise avec une agence tunisienne en collaboration avec le bureau du projet. Ce plan -
guide est un complement des r6alisations sur le terrain.
Enfin un fichier d'adressage a ete mont6 pour un meilleur suivi de l'evolution des donn6es
urbaines. L'experience de l'adressage dans les deux villes devra 8tre poursuivie et 6tendue A d'autres
villes moyennes du Burkina afin que les municipalit6s integrent desormais I'adressage comme une
activit6 habituelle et traditionnelle qu'elles se doivent d'assumer. Aussi doivent-elles cr6er une structure
au sein de leurs services techniques municipaux charg6e de l'adressage.
Gestion informatis6e des parcelles
L'informatisation de cette gestion devait permettre d'am6liorer le recouvrement de la taxe de
jouissance. C'est ainsi que par ce systeme de gestion, 75 319 parcelles sont gerees automatiquement A
Ouagadougou et 21 585 A Bobo-Dioulasso. De 1991 A 1996 le taux de recouvrement s'est
consid6rablement amelior6 comme I'atteste le tableau ci-joint en annexe. Ce systeme peut 8tre repliqu6
dans d'autres communes sans couit excessif (cf Annexe 4).
D - La rehabilitation des infrastructures communales
Renforcement des services techniques
Tl a consist6 en une assistance technique pour la formation du personnel communal et en la
foumiture de materiel et de nouveaux equipements. II a permis une r6organisation des services techniques
municipaux, une formation en procedures de passation de contrats et la programmation des operations
d'entretien courant de voiries au moyen du logiciel Urbavia.
La p6rennite de ces acquisitions et la realisation des objectifs supposent un meilleur
recouvrement des imp6ts locaux pour supporter les besoins de financement pour la maintenance et les
acquisitions nouvelles. Elles impliquent aussi une organisation efficiente du travail afm de garantir une
exploitation optimale.
Rehabilitation des infrastructures
Cette composante visait a restaurer le r6seau de voiries des communes urbaines de
Ouagadougou et de Bobo-Dioulasso et A instituer un systeme d'entretien preventif au cours d'un
programme quinquennal. Elle implique:
- le r6tablissement du niveau de service origine des voies non entretenues pendant
plusieurs d6cennies,
- la construction de quelques voies nouvelles de liaison ou de penetration dont la
r6alisation s'avere urgente pour la desserte de nouveaux lotissements A la p6ripherie,
- I'am6lioration du reseau d'assainissement d'eaux pluviales soit pour proteger les voies
urbaines soit pour 6viter les inondations dans certains quartiers.

Dans l'ensemble, les quantites realisees en matiere de travaux de voirie depassent de beaucoup
les estimations initiales. Les appels a la concurrence ont permis d'avoir des prix tres int6ressants surtout
avant la devaluation. Cette situation de concurrence systematique a fait chuter les co&ts et a permis de
programmer deux ou trois phases A la suite suivant les composantes.
Les travaux d'entretien courant des routes nationales ont bien e  executes, sur des longueurs
plus de deux fois superieures aux estimations sans que le montant du credit affecte a cette operation ait
6te augmente.
Par contre, le curage des caniveaux le long de la voirie urbaine a ete inferieur aux previsions, la
plus grande partie de ce travail ayant et effectuee par Faso Baara.
L'assainissement des quartiers Colma et Yeguere a Bobo-Dioulasso a e  bien execute et a
permis de tester l'impact technique et socio-6conomique de la realisation des six (6) bassins de
retention,solution qui a permis d'abaisser le couit des investissements et de reduire le surdimensionnement
des caniveaux en pleine ville.
Le taux de rentabilite economique de la rehabilitation des voiries urbaines a ete largement
superieur aux previsions des etudes economiques pr6alables aussi bien a Ouagadougou qu'a Bobo.
Le lineaire des rues r6habilit6es se pr6sente comme suit:
Ouagadougou          Bobo-Dioulasso        Total
Rues rehabilit&es                 22 rues         15 rues              35 rues
Lin6aires des rues rehabilitees   18 687 ML       16 544 ML            35 231 ML
par ville
Lin6aires des rues bitumees       17 854 ML       10 537 ML            28 391 ML
par ville
Lineaires des rues en terre       833 ML           6 007 ML             6 840 ML
par ville
Caniveaux lateraux par ville      41 100 ML      36 400 ML             77 500 ML
Plantation d'arbres               350 arbres     350 arbres            700 arbres.
Pour cette composante, seule la construction du canal de Zogona, a Ouagadougou, qui devait
6tre financee par le Gouvernement Italien n'a pu 8tre realisee. La convention de Financement entre
l'Italie et le Burkina Faso qui devait 8tre sign&e depuis le 30 Juin 1990 n'a jamais vu le jour. De m8me,
une 6tude portant sch6ma directeur d'assainissement de la ville de Ouagadougou devait 8tre financee par
la meme convention.
A l'exception de ce canal et de cette etude les travaux sur cette composante ont largement
satisfait les objectifs du projet, car la voirie urbaine, a part l'amenagement de la zone commerciale,
n'avait eu aucun entretien ou r6habilitation significative depuis les ann6es 1960. Neanmoins ces deux
volets ont et6 transferes sur demande du bureau du Projet au Projet d'Amelioration des conditions de vie
urbaine (PACVU).

E. Collecte des ordures minag6res
Ce volet avait pour objectif d'ameliorer les prestations de ces deux (2)villes en matiere de
collecte des ordures menageres, devenues aleatoires par manque de materiel et de moyens financiers. La
creation de l'ONASENE avait aggrave la situation puisque l'ONASENE avait recup6re en 1988 le peu de
materiel roulant dont disposait la ville de Ouagadougou pour demarrer ses activites. Le projet a finance
le materiel prevu et le service est pleinement fonctionnel. C'est ainsi que le projet a finance le materiel
suivant pour chacune des deux villes:
Ouagadougou                              Bobo-Dioulasso
- 7 camions porte-conteneurs de 14 T     - 7 camions porte-conteneurs de 14 T
- 115 bacs a ordures de 7 m3             - 103 bacs a ordures de 7 m3
- 3 camions bennes de 19 T               - 1 camion benne de 19 T
- 2 camionnettes pick-up                 - 2 camionnettes pick-up
- 45 filets de protection                - 45 filets de protection.
Les resultats de l'exploitation actuelle sont satisfaisants mais, il faudra une volonte politique des
maires et leurs conseils pour une contribution financiere cons6quente des populations des deux villes afin
que le materiel puisse etre entretenu et renouvele pour des services aussi quotidiens que la collecte des
ordures menageres. A moyen et long terme, il faudra peut-etre tenter une privatisation progressive du
service de collecte des ordures menageres si le Prive y porte un quelconque int6ret.
F. Nouvelle Politique de l'Habitat
Cette composante qui n'en est pas une, etait en fait une des conditions de negociation de
l'Accord de Credit et non une clause legale. Les termes de la lettre engageant le gouvernement a suivre
une nouvelle politique de l'habitat ont e  respectes mais aucune mesure concrete n'a pu etre mise en
place jusqu'a la fin du projet pour le financement de l'habitat au Burkina Faso.
II - EXECUTION FINANCIERE DU PROJET
L'Accord de credit 2067 - BUR portant financement du 26 Projet de Developpement Urbain
d'un montant initial de 18 Millions de DTS est entre en vigueur le 6 Septembre 1990. Un cr6dit
supplementaire 2067-1 Bur a l'Accord initial d'un montant de 6,9 Millions de DTS est entr6 en vigueur le
28 Septembre 1995. Soit un credit d'un montant total de 24,9 Millions de DTS de la part de l'IDA. L'Etat
Burkinabe a financ6 en contrepartie 10,8 Millions de Dollars et la Caisse Francaise de D6veloppement 9
Millions de FF d'aide budg6taire soit un total equivalent a 16 215 352 608 de F CFA.
Le credit IDA a couvert l'ensemble des prestations qui etaient programmees dans le cadre du
projet. Les appels a la concurrence ont permis d'avoir des prix tres interessants dans les offres de
soumission des entreprises. Par cons6quent on a pu programmer deux ou trois phases a la suite suivant les
composantes.
Pour le credit IDA sur les 24 900 000,00 DTS les paiements effectues au 31 juillet 1997 6taient
de 24 277 448,30 DTS degageant un reliquat de 622 551,70 DTS que l'IDA va annuler. Une partie de
cette somme: 10 710 000 DTS et 5 470 000 DTS a e retroced6e respectivement aux municipalites de



6
Ouagadougou et de Bobo-Dioulasso dans les memes conditions de remboursement que celles accordees
par 1'IDA A l'Etat Burkinabe.
La contribution de I'Etat, estimee a pres de 10,8 Millions de Dollars se pr6sente sous forme de
salaires des fonctionnaires mis a la disposition du projet, de contreparties budgetaires pour l'entretien
courant de la voirie urbaine et des routes nationales traversant les deux Municipalit6s, d'exon6rations
fiscales et douanieres et la mise a disposition de batiments pour le Bureau du projet.
Quant a l'aide budgetaire de la Caisse Francaise de Developpement de 9 000 000 FF, elle a servi
A la construction des deux hotels des Finances a Ouagadougou et a la r6alisation du volet "gestion
informatisee des parcelles" avec la Direction des Domaines pour les deux villes.
L'evaluation finale du projet par une mission de la Banque Mondiale a eu lieu du 2 au 9
Fevrier 1997. Toutes les activit6s qui avaient ete programm6es au titre du projet ont ete completement
executees a la date de cl6ture le 31 Mars 1997. Tous les engagements contractuels du gouvernement au
titre des contreparties financieres tant sur le budget national que sur ceux des deux (2) communes de
Ouagadougou et de Bobo-Dioulasso ont 6t6 entierement r6alises et meme depasses a certains niveaux.
III - FAITS PRINCIPAUX DE LA MISE EN OEUVRE DU PROJET
Principaux eIements ayant eu de P'influence sur le projet
La preparation du 26 Projet de developpement urbain a d6marr6 en juin 1985 et une mission
d'evaluation etait programmee en Octobre 1986. Mais en Septembre 1986, le gouvernement decida la
dissolution des Services Techniques Municipaux et confia leurs attributions a la DINASENE puis a
l'ONASENE sous la tutelle du Ministere de l'Environnement. Ce qui allait A l'encontre des objectifs du
projet qui justement voulait renforcer les Services Techniques Municipaux. Le 4 Novembre 1986, le
gouvernement fit suspendre la seconde phase des etudes de faisabilit6 du projet. Les 6tudes de cette
deuxieme phase ne furent reprises qu'a partir de Mars 1988 soit quelques 18 mois plus tard et la mission
d'evaluation efit fmalement lieu en Fevrier 1989. Les negociations de l'Accord de Credit se sont tenues A
Washington du 17 au 19 Juillet 1989. L'Accord de Cr6dit fiit approuv6 le 24 Octobre 1989 par le Conseil
d'Administration de la Banque, le credit fut sign6 le 22 d6cembre 1989 et la mise en vigueur n'a pu
intervenir que le 6 Septembre 1990.
- Faute de disposer des le debut du projet d'un Ing6nieur en Genie Civil de niveau suffisant du
cote du Burkina Faso et aussi du c6t6 de la Banque a partir d'Octobre 1990, le demarrage de la partie
infrastructure du projet a et6 tres lent. L'Ingenieur du bureau du Projet n'a pu 8tre recrute qu'en mars
1992 et celui de la Banque en Avril 1992. Cette absence d'ingenieur a beaucoup retarde le lancement des
etudes et des travaux.
Du c6t6 de la Banque, l'incorporation d'un ing6nieur dans l'equipe de supervision a permis des
ce moment la mise en place des mesures correctives pour le volet infrastructure et le d6marrage
significatif des d6caissements.
Lors de l'eude de factibilite du projet, le couit de r6alisation de chaque h6tel des Finances 6tait
estime a 80 Millions de FCFA. Mais devant les besoins incompressibles presentes par les services
ben6ficiaires pour 63 bureaux chacun, le cofit unitaire de chaque h6tel est passe A 160 Millions de FCFA
avant la devaluation. Le credit IDA ne pouvait pas faire face a cette hausse. Aussi, un cr6dit d' un



7
montant de 9 Millions de FF (soit 450 Millions de FCFA) a ete affecte au projet par le gouvernement a
partir d'une aide budgetaire foumie par la Caisse Fran9aise de Developpement (CFD).
Lors de l'approbation de l'Accord de Cr6dit 5,5 Millions de Dollars devraient etre fmance par le
gouvernement Italien au plus tard le 30 Juin 1990 pour r6aliser le plan directeur d'assainissement de
Ouagadougou et l'am6nagement du canal de Zogona. Malgre de nombreuses demarches, ce fmancement
italien ne s'est jamais concretise. Le plan directeur d'assainissement et les travaux d'amenagement du
canal seront repris sur demande du bureau du projet par le Projet d'Am6lioration des conditions de Vie
urbaine (PACVU) sur financement de l'IDA.
Un des facteurs majeurs ayant affecte le projet d'une fa$on significative a et6 la d6valuation du
FCFA le 12 Janvier 1994. Apres cette ddvaluation il a fallu reviser tous les contrats en cours d'execution
en affectant un coefficient de correction. Cela a pris plus de six (6) mois si bien que certains d6lais
d'execution n'ont pas pu etre respect6s. Pour combattre les effets ndgatifs de la d6valuation sur les
populations A faible revenu, la Banque et le gouvernement sont convenus de la n6cessite de multiplier les
opportunites d'emplois et donc d'augmenter le volume des travaux de certains volets du projet. Une
mission de la Banque a discute avec le gouvemement de la possibilit6 d'un cr6dit suppl6mentaire de 10
Millions de Dollars A I'Accord de Credit initial.
Les bonnes performances en matiere de composantes physiques constatees A partir de fin 1992
ont permnis au 2e Projet de developpement urbain d'etre un des sept projets s6lectionn6s par la Banque
dans la zone CFA pour un cr6dit supplementaire visant a att6nuer les impacts sociaux negatifs de la
devaluation.
Finanlement ce credit supplementaire a ete signe le 21 Decembre 1994, mais la consultation
juridique n'ayant pas pu etre pr6sentee a temps le credit n'est entre en vigueur qu'en Septembre 1995.
Pirennit6 du projet
Le projet a eu un impact positif sur les institutions et les finances municipales, cles de la
p6rennit6 du projet.
L'6tude sectorielle a propos6 un code des communes et un projet de loi portant r6partition de
competence entre l'Etat et les communes. Ces textes donneront aux communes plus de responsabilit6s sur
leurs ressources financieres.
La nouvelle instruction comptable applicable aux communes du Burkina est entr6e en vigueur
depuis Janvier 1995 apres plusieurs seminaires de formation des principaux utilisateurs tant du c6te de
l'ordonnateur que du cote du receveur municipal. La gestion financi6re devrait 8tre consid6rablement
amelioree dans les prochaines annees.
L'adressage A terme permettra aussi un meilleur recouvrement des imp6ts. Une bonne situation
financiere des communes dtant la condition de perennit6 des ouvrages finances par le projet, on peut
conclure que la perennitd du projet sera probable si cette condition est remplie.

IV - PERFORMANCE DE LA BANQUE ET DE L'EMPRUNTEUR
A.  Performance de la Banque
Entre l'identification du projet et son execution finale cinq responsables du projet se sont
succedes sur une periode de douze ans au niveau de la Banque.
La pr6paration du projet a ete longue et mouvementee de 1984 A 1989. Le debut des etudes de
factibilit6 du projet avait demarre tres vite et puis entre temps le gouvernement a pris l'option de cr6er
l'ONASENE vidant ainsi les services techniques municipaux de leur vocation traditionnelle, alors que
justement un des volets du projet portait sur le renforcement des services techniques municipaux.
Ainsi le 9 Septembre 1986 le comite de pret de la Banque a refuse d'approuver le projet de
rapport et a annule son evaluation qui etait prevue en Octobre 1986. Ensuite, il s'en est suivi une periode
de flottement qui dura presque 18 mois.Ce n'est qu'en Mars1988 que les etudes furent reprises apres de
longues discussions avec le gouvernement.
Les categories de decaissements etaient tres complexes et inutilement compliquees avec des
financements d6gressifs. Les seuils variaient d'une categorie a l'autre ce qui rendait l'application plus
difficile encore et a entraine de nombreuses erreurs d'imputation meme par le service de Deboursement.
L'octroi d'un credit supplementaire a l'Accord de Crddit initial d'un montant de 10 millions de
Dollars US suite aux performances du bureau du Projet, surtout en 1993 et suite a la devaluation du
FCFA intervenue le 12 Janvier 1994 a e  tres bien accueilli par les differentes parties ben6ficiaires et a
cte salu6 comme une bonne performance de la Banque. Cela a ete note avec grande satisfaction par les
autorit6s politiques et administratives. Cela traduisait aussi une certaine satisfaction du c6te de la banque
quant a 1'execution positive de ce projet. Ce credit supplementaire a permis de realiser beaucoup de
travaux complementaires et de consolider certains volets du projet.
Cependant cette idWe de credit suppl6mentaire, tres gen6reuse au depart, a pourtant connu des
difficultes d'entree en vigueur et d'application. En effet, le service de Ddboursement a voulu gerer
separement les deux credits au lieu de les consolider en un seul credit. Cela a cree beaucoup de
perturbations dans la gestion financiere a partir de Fevrier 1996, bien que tous les comptes soient justes et
la comptabilit6 bien tenue du c6te du bureau du projet.
Performance de I'Emprunteur
Le gouvernement a bouleverse la pr6paration du projet en 1986 en decidant la cr6ation de
l'ONASENE a un mois de la premiere mission d'evaluation. Ensuite il a fallu presque deux annees de
discussions pour arriver A reprendre les etudes de factibilite de ce projet en 1988.
A part quelques difficultes au debut du projet dues a l'absence d'un ingdnieur genie civil aussi
bien du c6t6 de la Banque que du c6te de l'emprunteur, ce projet s'est bien execute dans son ensemble.
DMs que ces deux ingenieurs ont ete recrut6s en 1992 tout le retard constate dans la composante
travaux a ete rattrape en quelques mois.
Cependant, la performnance du bureau du projet, agence d'execution, a ete jugee tres
satisfaisante. Presque la meme equipe est restee en place de 1988 jusqu'a la cl6ture du projet



9
en 1997. Cette continuit6 a et6 benefique pour l'execution des differents volets du projet. Les estimations
prevues dans le cadre de l'6tude de factibilite ont ete largement depass6es.
L'emprunteur a honore tous ses engagements contractuels A part la definition d'une nouvelle
politique de l'habitat qui n'a pas pu etre men6e jusqu'a terme. II a pu payer toutes les contreparties
locales.
Eventuelle nouvelle operation
Pour perenniser les acquis de ce projet, des plans d'actions peuvent etre proposes pour le
developpement des initiatives mises en oeuvre a cette occasion.
La bonne performance obtenue avec ce projet, mais aussi la necessite de continuer a developper
des ressources financieres devant beneficier aux collectivites locales, ont justifie de poursuivre
l'exp6rience du d6veloppement urbain avec le Projet d'Amelioration des conditions de vie urbaines
(PACVU). Ce dernier projet est axe sur les problemes d'environnement urbain et va reprendre la
realisation du schema directeur d'assainissement de Ouagadougou et du canal de Zogona. II contribuera a
perenniser les acquis du 26 Projet de Developpement urbain en poursuivant le developpement des
ressources foncieres locales (taxe de residence, taxe de jouissance) et en ameliorant la collecte des
ordures menageres.
Pour se faire les villes de Ouagadougou et de Bobo-Dioulasso doivent tenir a jour le fichier
d'adressage afin de recueillir les meilleures donnees urbaines pour les recettes fiscales. Le programme
d'entretien courant et p6riodique doit se poursuivre sur Urbavia. Les campagnes de sensibilisation des
populations sur la proprete de la ville doivent se maintenir. Enfm, il faudra degager des profils de
gestionnaires urbains et municipaux dans les grandes 6coles pour une meilleure action sur le terrain.
Conclusion
Le 26 Projet s'acheve sur une note d'optimisme. II a atteint ses objectifs en ce qui conceme les
aspects institutionnels et financiers et les objectifs physiques ont ete largement d6pass6s.
Les resultats techniques et les programmes d'investissement mis en oeuvre ont eu des r6sultats
tres largement positifs. N6anmoins, si ce projet a permis de franchir une 6tape, les actions et les acquis de
ce projet restent A etre consolider et perenniser.
Dans un premier temps, une poursuite des reformes engagees dans le cadre de la
d6centralisation et le d6veloppement municipal serait necessaire. Au niveau du developpement municipal
des dispositions importantes et urgentes restent A etre prises pour la mobilisation des ressources
financieres des communes. A cet effet, une remise en ordre de la comptabilite municipale, la formation
des agents communaux surtout du c6te de l'ordonnateur seront un pr6alable A toute reforme si nous
voulons que la nouvelle instruction comptable soit efficiente. Aussi, il serait necessaire que des modules
de formation et des stages de recyclages sur la nouvelle instruction comptable soient mont6s au niveau de
l'ENAREF et de l'ENAM  afn de vulgariser cet important outil de gestion. Un 6norme travail
d'organisation et de gestion reste A faire. Le niveau de qualification du personnel communal reste a etre
red6fni pour une action administrative efficace au niveau local.
Cependant, le developpement municipal est un long processus ofi les acquis doivent etre
confort6s en permnanence, car soumis a des aleas tres importants, surtout en matiere de capacite financiere



10
reelle des municipalites de notre pays. Car, en demiere analyse, tout cela reste bien fragile si les
municipalites ne disposent pas de moyens financiers pour faire fonctionner leurs services.
En conclusion, la principale lecon a tirer de l'ex6cution de ce projet est qu'un projet urbain est
par nature complexe et ne peut reussir que si on evite des montages operationnels trop compliqu6s
impliquant plusieurs agences d'execution afin d'6viter les conflits de competence entre plusieurs
ministeres evoluant dans le m8me secteur d'activite comme l'urbanisation d'une ville.
Les reformes institutionnelles du secteur urbain sont tout aussi complexes et longues a mettre en
oeuvre. Ces reformes ne peuvent donc pas etre entierement realisees dans le cadre d'un seul projet de
developpement urbain. Aussi il est necessaire qu'il y ait un suivi du secteur par le biais de plusieurs
projets complementaires pendant de longues annees.
