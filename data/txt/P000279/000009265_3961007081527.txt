MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL CREDIT TO B1URKINA FASO
FOR THE SECOND URBAN PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
supplemental credit to Burkina Faso for SDR 6.9 million, the equivalent of US$10 million, on standard
IDA terms, to complement the Second Urban Project (Cr. 2067-BUR). The proposed supplemental
credit would finance resource mobilization and infrastructure rehabilitation components for which
cofinancing did not materialize. It complements the Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2590-BF) that
was approved by the Board on March 29, 1994.
2.    One of the main objectives of the original project was aimed at helping the local governments
of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso to cope with increasingly high growth levels of urban
populations. The uevaluation of the CFA Franc resulted in a substantial short term increase in urban
-,overty that can be expected to persist until the supply response to the devaluation nmaterializes (see
para. 8). Thus there is an urgent need to create more short-term employment to alleviate the
transitional effects of the devaluation. Fortunately, a reserve set of economically justified projects with
significant part of labor costs (see para. 11) had already been identified in the context of the above-
mentioned Project. The Government has shown strong commitment to the project which the executing
agency is implementing with remarkable diligence and efficiency (see paras. 3-4). However, due to
short-term budget constraints, the Government is unable to mobilize the resources required to fund the
proposed expansion. Nor has it been possible to mobilize external financing from other donors in a
timely manner. Hence, it was decided to pursue the proposed supplemental credit as the most
appropriate vehicle for the Bank to respond to the Government's request for assistance.
Background: the Second Urban Project
3.    Project Objectives and Description. The Second Urban Project was approved on October 24,
1989 and becaine effective on September 6, 1990. Its objectives are: (a) to develop the organizational,
technical and financial capacity of the local governments of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso to
assume full responsibility, as contracting authorities, for the maintenance of urban infrastructure and
the provision of urban services in the face of increasingly high growth levels for urban population; and
(b) to upgrade infrastructure in these two cities to a satisfactory overall standard, enabling effective,
regular maintenance to be continued. The mid-term review, carried out in January 1994, confirmed the
validity of these objectives. The Second Urban Project has five components focusing on: (a) municipal
management and reform; (b) financial resource mobilization; (c) urban information; (d) technical
department strengthening and infrastructure rehabilitation; and (e) solid waste management.
5.    Implementation Experience. Although the project had rather a long start-up period,
substantial improvements were noted towards the end of 1992. Project execution has been fully
satisfactory since then and the overall status of the project is currently rated 2, with project
management performance rated 1. This judgment is confirmed by the disbursement performance: out
of a total of US$22.2 million, the project disbursed $3.2 million up to December 1992, US$10.1
million in 1993 and US$2.0 million in the first semester of 1994, in spite of the devaluation. Nearly all
of the initial credit amount has been committed and the project is expected to be fully disbursed by the
closing date of June 30, 1996. When the mid-term review took place, all contractual obligations had
been met and the Borrower was in compliance with all covenants in the Development Credit



2
Agreement. No problems in counterpart funding have been encountered. The last Audit was received
early and was unqualified.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
5.    Changing Country Economic Background/Rationale for Project Expansion. In 1991, the
Government of Burkina Faso (GOBF) launched, with the support of donors, a structural adjustment
program aimed at building the foundations for sustainable economic and social development.
Structural reforms were undertaken to liberalize the economy and reform public finance management,
in order to increase efficiency in using public and private resources. At the same time, Burkina Faso
introduced a democratic political system by adopting a constitution and organizing presidential and
legislative elections resulting in the re-establishment of a state under the rule of law in 1992. Economic
performance in 1993 fell short of expectations, with the results achieved failing to meet the
Government's targets: the growth rate of GDP was below 1%; inflation slightly exceeded projections;
and the Government experienced a resource shortfall estimated at 3% of GDP, caused by poor tax
revenue and overall program performance and consequent delays in external aid disbursements.
6.    Taking into account changes in the external environment as well as economic and financial
development in Burkina Faso, the authorities recognized both the limitation of a purely internal
adjustment and the need to strengthen the ongoing reform program. Therefore, GOBF decided,
together with the other countries of the CPA franc zone, to devalue the CFA franc by 50% in foreign
currency terms, effective January 12, 1994. In addition, the authorities have set the following
objectives for 1994-96: (a) to accelerate real GDP growth to more than 5% a year by 1996 (real per
capita GDP growth of over 2%); (b) to limit inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, to
approximately 6% by 1996 after a rapid increase in 1994 as a result of the currency adjustment; and
(c) to reduce the extemal primary current account deficit from 15% of GDP in 1993 to 13.5% in 1996.
7.    For years, the CFA zone has suffered a massive loss of competitiveness leading its countries to
fmancial crisis and economic depression. Inappropriate domestic policies and major external shocks
exacerbated this difficult situation, which an improvement in their exchange parity alone could help
reverse. The devaluation of the CFA franc will create an environment in which competitiveness can be
re-established. Nevertheless, monetary, fiscal and wage discipline, as well as other structural reforms
aimed at liberalizing the labor and production markets should accompany this courageous measure to
fully ensure its benefits. However, the supply response to the shift of relative prices will take some
time and the associated benefits will be fully visible only in the medium term.
8.    In the first six months following the devaluation, food producers have particularly benefited as
witnessed by an increased demand for rice, certain vegetables and livestock products in neighboring
countries. However, the supply response to the shift of relative prices will take some time and the
associated benefits will be fully visible only in the medium term. Meanwhile, some of the visible
impacts are negative, as indicated by an inflation rate of 28 % from December 93 to June 94 (as
compared to 2 % to 3 % per year in past years), with a local products index increase of 25 %. Food
prices in urban areas have been particularly affected (+ 26 %). In addition the cost of imported
medicine has practically doubled, increasing the cost of hygiene and health products for households by
43 %. The transportation and communication index has risen by 35% and the housing and
construction index by 30 %. These higher costs have further reduced the purchasing power of the poor
thus threatening their food security situation and malnutrition levels. In an environment of increased
poverty and unemployment caused by previous economic depression and unsuccessful internal



3
adjustment, it may be politically and socially difficult to sustain the implementation of the new reform
prograw. Unless a serious deterioration of the povert levels is prevented, the benefits of the initial
sacrifice will be at risk.
9.    Therefcre, the major challenge for IDA is to provide a rapid and visible response to the
perceived negative social impacts of the reforms, without jeopardizing the longer term objectives of
effective and efficient use of scarce resources. Analysis of IDA's policy and lending instruments in
Burkina Faso revealed that the proposed supplemental credit is one of the best tools to ensure the two
objectives of quick disbursing and visibility through rehabilitation of urban infrastructure. This will
allow a greater portion of the population to benefit from basic services and, simultaneously, will
generate employment and income--thus working directly on the twin pillars that support IDA's poverty
alleviation strategy for the Sahel. The proposed supplemental credit would: (a) increase access to basic
urban infrastructure services; and (b) expand employment opportunities and increase incomes in urban
areas. In so doing, it will ease the main and most immediate negative impact of the devaluation on the
urban poor--notably a higher priced food basket. In concrete terms, the supplemental credit would put
approximately 3000 people to work over the eighteen month execution period (4500 person-years of
work). In addition, it would contribute to the creation of a facilitating environment for GOBF's efforts
to proceed with external adjustments and to continue with internal adjustment measures.
10.   Consistency with the Country Assistance Strategy The current CAS 1994-98 staternent was
reviewed by the Board with the Population/AIDS Project on May 31, 1994. It contains a full
discussion of recent economic developments and IDA's assistance program. The proposed
supplemental credit is fully consistent with IDA strategy, which stresses the need to focus on key
actions requirel to alleviate long-term constraints on economic and social development, to help GOBF
to improve public resource management and ensure adequate support for sustained development and to
alleviate poverty. The proposed supplemental credit is an important element of the program designed
to support the strategv. Along with the Economic Recovery Credit (Cr. 2590-BUR), efforts to increase
the implementation rate for the existing portfolio and the proposed supplemental credit will alleviate the
impact of the devaluation on the urban poor.
Description of the Proposed Supplemental Credit
11.   During the mid-tern review of the Second Urban Project (which was carried out in January
1994 concurrently with the appraisal of the supplemental credit), it was noted that the construction of
one building and the remainder of the road rehabilitation program that were identified and appraised as
part of the Second Urban Project had not been implemented, due to a lack of financing. Final designs
and bidding documents prepared and financed by the initial credit are available, so th.se sub-
components can be executed immediately. The savings generated by the devaluation, although very
limited due to an increase in the amounts of the main contracts ranging from 60 to 70%, were directed
during the mid-term review to fulfilling a street signing program in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso
and expanding an ongoing operation on Bobo-Dioulasso's drainage network. The proposed
supplemental credit would complete the works started under the Second Urban Project and the Public
Works and Employment Project (Cr. 2282-BUR) by financing the following sub-components:
a)    the construction of a third h6tel des finances in Ouagadougou to house the local
branches of the tax, land registry and treasury authorities in order to facilitate
coordination, cooperation and exchange of information among these otherwise separate
entities. The supplemental credit would finance the construction and equipment



4
contracts and the related consultant services to supervise the works (US$1.0 million);
and
b)    the rehabilitation of 11.1 kilometers of road and drainage infrastructure (7.7 km in
Ouagadougou and 3.4 km in Bobo-Dioulasso) in order to bring the road and drainage
networks of the two cities up to an acceptable level. The supplementai credit would
finance the construction contracts and the related consultant services to supervise the
works (US$9.0 million).
The proposed supp!emental credit of US$10 million would finance 100% of project costs, net of duties
and taxes, exactly as was the case in the relevant disbursement categories of the initial credit.
12.   Project Benefits. The economic rate of return (ERR) for the road and drainage rehabilitation
program is 32% for Ouagadougou and 30% for Bobo-Dioulasso, representing 83% of the supplemental
credit costs. The additional construction of an h6tel des finances would ease the tax collection of local
resources and improve the management of municipal finance. This construction, as well as the
infrastructure rehabilitation would be undertaken through medium-sized contracts similar to those
financed by the initial credit, and 20 to 26% of the total amount would be directed toward income
creation.
13.   Program Objective Categories. The supplemental credit will enhance the contribution of the
Second Urban Project to improving access to urban senrices by urban poor and will contribute to
immediate as well as longer term employment creation.
14.   Environmental Aspects. The project's ultimnate objective is to create a sustained improvement
of the living and working environment of the two main cities of Burkina Faso, and there are no
activities in the proposed supplemental project which could create adverse environmental effects. Such
improvements in the urban environment were identified as a high priority item in Burkina Faso's
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP). Indeed, the twin pillars of the NEAP are improving
natural resource management and improving the urban environment. An analysis of the urban
environment was carried out as part of the ongoing preparation of the proposed urban environment
project FY95 for similar investments and did not identify any specific constraints in terms of respecting
the presenrt ecological equilibrium for this kind of investment. Finally, the project is expected to have a
positive impact by repairing and cleaning part of the drainage system.
15.   Risks. The main risk foreseen is the possibility of a lack of sufficient commitment from GOBF
and the municipalities to carry out the resource mobilization program. This risk was identified and
addressed in the Staff Appraisal Report of the Second Urban Project but has not materialized.
Implementation of the Supplemental Credit
16.   Institutional Arrangements. Arrangements for implementation of the supplemental credit
make use of existing institutions and technical staff. The proposed supplement would be implemented
by a specific division within the existing project unit in charge of the Second Urban Project, whose
management capabilities were carefully checked during the mid-term review. This division would
benefit from the experience gained since the effectiveness of the initial credit, including adequate
training and regular use of standard IDA bidding procedures. Its main responsibility would be the
preparation of the investments financed by the supplemental credit and their implementation. In order



5
to ensure a smooth and quick implementation and to avoid the bottlenecks identified during the initial
credit, especially regarding procurement procedures, it has been agreed that this division would
function as a delegated contract manager, based on the successful experience with specialized contract
management in urban projects in the Sahel. All mandatory documents and a specific manual of
procedures have been approved by GOBF and IDA. In addition to the annual audit of the initial credit,
a semi-annual technical and financial audit will monitor the strict compliance of the division with
agreed procedures and performance contracts for all operations financed by the supplnmental credit.
Procurement and disbursement procedures would follow the procedures of the original Credit.
17.   Given recent experience under the Second Urban Project, it is expected that the supplemental
credit will be executed in about 12 months and fully disbursed in 18 months, not requiring an extension
of the initial closing date.
Agreed Actions/Changes in the DCA
18.   Conditions of effectiveness are: (a) appointment of a public works engineer and a financial
analyst acceptable to IDA; (b) signing of a contract amendment with an external auditor acceptable to
IDA for the additional work; and (c ,. he Bobo-Dioulasso Subsidiary Loan Agreement and the Kadiogo
Subsidiary Loan Agreement have been amended in a manner satisfactory to the Association.
19.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed supplemental credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
