                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The Development Objective of the proposed operation is to support the Government of Pernambuco to strengthen the design, implementation, monitoring and
                         evaluation of policies and programs aimed at promoting sustained growth and improved economic opportunities for the poor, consolidating public sector management
                         innovations, preventing crime and violence, and reducing the burden associated with chronic disease.

                         The Program is fully aligned with the priorities of the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy 2012-2015 (Report #63731-BR), discussed by the Executive
                         Directors on November 1, 2011. In accordance with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), the proposed operation aims at promoting a more equitable, sustainable
                         and competitive Pernambuco, including through a strong gender focus. The program also facilitates the Bank’s strategic engagement in key areas of the state’s
                         development plan.

                         The operation is a Single tranche Development Policy Loan to be disbursed upon loan effectiveness.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?
