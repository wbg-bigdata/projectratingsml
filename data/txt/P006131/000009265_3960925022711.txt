EVALUATION SWB4A1'.
*          Objectives
1. .,  ,The Highway Maintenance Pr,qect (Loan 1587-BO) parttally achieved
its objectives of 1applementing a wide maintenance program in three
distrits, out of ten' in which the country il divided for road maintenance
purposes.
2.       The pr-zjec1..consisted\*of:  (a), acquisition of equipment atd spare
parts to support the maintenance programs, (b) construction Qf warehouses
and workshops, (c) implementatioa in three districts of'a four year (1979-
3) maintenance program, (d) \technical assistance to Servicio Nac tns  de
Caminos (SNC), nd (e) personhel training.                                e
Implementation Experience
*  -3.   The implementation of th4i projvct -coincided wth a period of a
deep decline in the Bolivian economy and\considorable p6litical and
economic Instability.  Between October 1981 and April 1985 SNC's Executive
Director changed five timif.  Staftf changes at senior mai#gement leve, \
turnov~es of skilled personnel and-strikes were also frequent.  These
problems resulted in inadequate attention to the institutional aspects of
the project and seriously affected its programs.
4.       The project experienced some implementation delays from the
outset.  Start-up of the-project was postponed for six months due to SNC's
finaneial constraints, repeated p9liticse upheavals and contradicting
measures applied by successive at-Anistritions. Equipment and consultant
services procutement delayed  or    t 22 months.
5.       The project wes also delayed due to complex bureaucratic
procedures and legal tuichnaipalities required for procurement of goods.
This determined the lack of availability of equipment and materials for
timely I Ilomentaton of the maintenance planned.
6.       The difficult ´ener4 economic situatioa of the country caused a
drastic reduction of funds allocated to SNC and therefore to the
maintenance budget, affecting lmplem ntation of routine  aititenance
activittes.                                                   -
7.       The required extensive reconstruction of the road network, which
was heavily damaged by storms of unusual Intensity in 1980, diverted SNC's
efforts and priorities.



8.    -  Execution of the project also experience4 substantial delay due to
the general suspension of Bank disbursements on all Bolivia projects, from
November 1983 to July 1984 and from Jujy to December 1985, because of
mismanagement and macroeconomic policies of the Government. This paralyzed
all project activities.
9.       All these problems, delay in equipment, Frocurement and technical
assistance at the beginning, lack of materials later and finally, shortage
of financial resources, had irreparable consequences on the maintenance
programs and therefore, on the road conditions.
10.      The major benefits of the project were the new equipment provided
under the loan, the design of the Maintenance Management System (SAM) by
the consultant and the maintenance of the high-volume roads in acceptable
conditions.
11.      However, these benefits were substantially reduced because the SAM
was not really implomented and the maintenance of low-volume roads was
practically nonexistent and their deterioration was globally higher than
before the project.
12.      Neither the design and implementation of the Equipment Management
System (SAE) nor Personnel Training  Program were successful, mainly
because of the difficulties of the consultants to engage suitable experts
acceptable to SNC in the critical situation of the country.
13.      As a result of delays and postponement of planned maintenance
activities, the economic rate of return for the project, estimated at over
10% sat appraisal, was reevaluated as explained in paragraph 6.04,
considering the part of the network where some maintenance activities were
performed. The Borrower has pointed out that an evaWuation by ITVC drew a
more negative conclusion (i.e. a much lowet rate of return) on the grounds
that maintenance attention was concentrated on paved roads and practically
neglected earth roads. We find fault with ITVC's methodology, in that it
assesses the impact of the project delays and the economic crisis combined.
However, we accept that the delays were indeed costly, since they allowed
substantial lengths of pavement to break up.
14.      The following are the main lessons that can be derived from this
project:
a) Social and economic stability are essential for the success of
the projects Xn the country where they are developed.
-     b) Permanent and qualified staff are necessary in the inEtitutions
during project implementations, specially in the case of sophisticated
management systems.
c) Road maintenance projects must be prepared and implemented
guaranteeing continuity in maintenance activities and gradually
establis ing the necessary improvements and requirements.
\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~X



\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
d)  Procuk4ment procedures.must be agile and flexible in the
country of th project, to avoid delays in acquisition of equipment and \
materials and in awarding consulting services that are,basic to the good
performance of the project.  Frequently, acquisition of equipment and
goods, considere4 in isolation, is the most successful part of the
.projects, but, si\nce this a means and not an end, it should not be
considered a success, unless it :s accompanied by good performance in the
maintenance program.
e) .Maintenance and equipment management systems must be designed
in close collaboration with the institutions that wi4l use them in the
*           future.  Furthermore,;these system  must be adapted to the capacity and
real needs of the institution. These conditions would make the subsequent
implementation easier. Well designed systeps that can not,be implemented
during th. project can not be considered a success.
f) Detailed and well studied maintenance programs, considering
All types of\activities and affecting the entire network, are absolutely
necessary. 
g)  Maintenance programs must contain activities and standord
parameters that allow them to be monitored and supervised, in a clear and
simpile manner.
h)  Suspension and delays of disbursement; can have very negative
.effects on xoad maintenance, with costly consequences, if much of the
network is in or approaching the critical condition when pavement break-up
begins.  In such circumstances, any decision to suspend or otherwise delay
disbursements for such operations must be weighed very carefully against
the benefits sought from the suspension.

ROJECTCOPLETIqMRP
- ~~I. IElgQEgGlIPS
1.01     The economy of Bolivia, landlocked, mountainous and sparsely
populated, is very vulnerable to deficiencies in its road and rail
networks. The road network has developed to serve mostly domestic
transport and communication. The exceptionally difficult topography and
the long distances between scattered population centers account for the
relatively high cost of transport services and infrastructure.
1.02     The road system in Bolivia is still in an early state of
development. Most of the 40,000 km of the network do not have adequate
road surfaces for efficient services to the traffic and scarcely 1,500 km
are paved. About 14Z are primary roads, 102 are secondary roads and 761
are tertiary roads. A great part of the network links the more populated
regions, located in the mountainous western part of the country.
1.03     Planning, construction and maintenance of highways is the
responsibility of the National Road Authority (Servicia Nacional de
Caminos-SNC) a decentralized institution financed by government funds. In
the past twenty years SNC has built new highways with international
financing, but, before this project, maintenance had always been financed
by the government.
1.04     SNC was set up in the 1960s with substantirl assistance from the
US Federal Bureau of Roads and was considered to have sufficient capacity
to carry out its commitments in the Project.
1.05     When the Government formulated the Development Program for
1976-1980, it considered that its ambitious goals to improve and expand the
road network had to be accompanied by a quantitative and qualitative
improvement in maintenance, which until then had been neglected in favor of
new construction, and agreed upon this priority with a Bank mission that
visited '3olivia.  Consequently, the Government asked the Bank for
assistance.
1.06     Improvement of maintenance operations was the issue that motivated
this project and continues to be a critical requirement to meet growing
traffic volumes. This waq the Bank's first involvement in the sub-sector
in Bolivia.
1.07     As a whole, the Project was designed to improve the capability of
SNC for road maintenance.   For administrative purposes SNC divides Bolivia
into 13 districts.  The Project aimied to establish a gradual process
starting from a Pilot Program in the three more trafficked and, at the same
time, very representative dis- acts of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz,
to be expanded to the rest of the districts by a national program.
1.08     This completion report is based upon information obtained from LAC
Information Center, project appraisal and supervision reports, the
Borrower's periodic progress reports and a final report prepared by the
Transport and Roads Institute (Instituto de Trahisportcs y Vias de
Comunicacion-ITVC), an arm of the University of San Andres in La Paz.

II.  PROJECT IDENTIFICATIO?4, PREPARATION AMI APPRAISAL
2.01     At the time it ptepared the 1976-1980 Plan for Economic and Social
Development, the Government recognized the heed for improvement in the
overall quality of road maintenance to accompany the ambitious program for
upgrading and expansion of the road network included in the Plan.  The Bank
considered it the most effective area for in4tiating activities in the road
subsector in Bolivia and accepted to participate.
2.02     Since this constituted the Bank's first participation in the sub-
sector, pilot maintenance programs were proposed in only three districts of
the $NC, which represent approximately 402 of the Bolivian road network and
carried about 752 of the country's total traffic.  The project provided for
technical assistance at he&aquarters and districts levels, for improvement
of maintenance planning and execution; technical assistance for upgrading
and expanding the SNC training programj f6ands for additional maintenance
and shop equipment; and funds for preparation of a country-wide .aintenance
and rehabilitation program to be derived from the findings of the project.
2.03     Durin' preparation (1977), SNC was res\onsible' ftr data collection
on road network inventory, traffic counts, vehicle operating costs, vehicle
fleets, and traffic growth factors. The task experienced some delays
because of change in administration and shortage of qualified staff. A
road roughness measurements study was satisfactorily carried out by an
American consultant firm.
e.04     The proJect' main objectives, as described in the Appraieal
Report, There: p 
(a)    to carry out the maintenance required in the three SNC districts
of La Paz, Cochabamba and Santa Cruz, and to eliminate the backlog
of deferred maintenance over the period 1979-1983; 
(b)    to strengthen'the road maintenance organization at headquarters
and in the project districts and to improve and rationalize
maintenance planning,'\procedures and standards;
(c)    to complete the fleet of maintenance equipment and vhicles in the
three project districts and to improve its availabil ty and
utilization for maintenance activities;
(d)    to aVrove, through training, the capability of maintenance
personnel at all levels at headquarters and in the three
districts; and
(e)    to prepare a country-wide highway maintenance, rehabilitation and
upgrading program.
2.05     To athieve its objectives, the project had the followiag

(a)    implementation, in the three project districts, of the agreed
four-year programs (mid-1979/mid-1983) on about 15,000 km of
roads, including deferred maintenance of about 2,000 km;
(b)    acquisition of maintebance equipment and vehicles to complete and
expand the maintenance fleet in the project districts, to be used
in implementing the maintenance programs;
(c)    build-up of spare parts stock for preventive maintenance of
existing and new equipment and vehiclqs, and acquisition of spare
parts for major overhauls of salvageable equipment and vehicles;
(d)    acquisition of workshop tools and equipment, and construction or
expansion of workshops and warehouses;
le)    acquisition of training equipment and tools, traffic counters and
specialized equipment for the SNC soil laboratory;
(f)    acquisition of hand tools for labor-intensive road maintenance
operations;
(g)    technical assistance at SNC headquarters and in the project
districts (i) to implement all phases of the project; (ii) to
devflop and carry out training programs; and (iii) to assist in
the preparation of a nationwide maintenance program; and
(h)    etvgineering and economic studies to prepare the program for
tupgrading and rehabi;itation of earth, gravel and paved roads.
2.06     The project was appraised in November 1977 and negotiations were
held in Washington May 2 to 18, 1978. A loan of US$25.0 million was
approved by the Board of Excutive Directors on June 1, 1978. The loan
agreement was signed on July 10, 1978. The approved project elements and
their estimated costs, as given in the appraisal report, are shown on the
following page.
2 07     As a part of the Project evaluation, four-year programs for.
routine and deferred maintenance were prepared.  Estimated indicators for
maintenance quantities and equipment utilization were established, in
accordance with the results of the HDM model.
2.08     Technical assistaice was divided into two phases.  The first was
financed by other sources and was used to prepare a maintenance program and
the second phase provided for its implkmentatiin under the loan. The\loan
also financed other technical assistances under-the Project.

'III. IMPLEMENTATION
A.  Acquisition of maintenance equipment, sDare parts and materials
3.01   Preparation of specifications and biddingxdocuments for
procurement of road maintenance equipment, financed under the project,
started on time and most of the bids were called for by the end of 1979.
However, because the procedures for international bidditg were not in
compliance with Bank's guidelines, a new call for bids wks necessary
regarding procurement of about 160 trucks. Repetitive delays were also
encountered in Government processing for procurement of goods financed
under the project. For instance, since complex bureaucratic procedures
required Cabinet approval of all contract awards, purchasing of spare
parts, workshop tools and materials were inhibited.
3.02     Late in 1984, the Goveroment of Bolivia reqtiested that US$ 1.5
million from the loan be assigned for purchase of asphalt. The Bank
approved an Amendment of the Loan in July 1983 to perilt the purchase of
lubricants and asphalt, costing about US$ 1.5 million and increased the
amount of loan funds allocated for spare parts from USS 3.0 million to US$
3.5 million, to help meet the critical shortage of these items.  After two
unsuccessful attempts to purchase the asphalt, a Chilean and a Brazilian
firm veve finally awarded contracts, signed by the end of 1986.
3.03     Other equipment acquired with the loan were'a Perkin-Elmer
computer, traffic counters and roughness meters now used by SNC.
B. Construction of warehouses and workshops
3.04     Construction of workihops an4 warehouses in La Paz, Cocabamba and' 
Santa Cruz started 30 months be4ind schedule.  Three local firms were
awarded the contracts.  W orks in. La Paz and Santa Cruz were conclude4
satisfattorily but works in Cochabamba were abandoned by the firm
contracted.  SNC directly took over completion of the works through its,
Cochabamba District Office.
C.  Techn ical Assistance
3.05     Technical assistance was awarded by public coipetition following
proposals, received from a short list of international consultants. After,
some delayi in awarding the contkact, a joitRt venture of a US firm and a
Bolivian firm was selected to carry out this"component of the project.
After long legalization procedures, work started 21 months behind schedule.
3.06     The Consultants' role was critical to efficient project'
performance, because they had to strengthen SNC's capatity to formulate and
\xecute advanced maintenance programs. To achieve this bbjective they had
tot a) establish a maintenance management system, b) establish an
equipment management systetu, and c) develop maintenance programs and
support carrying\but and moni orin% of their implementation.
.3.07    Delays in beginning the project cau ed mo$ilization problems to
the consultants because the initially proposed personnel werA no longer
V~ ~~ ,.       .\  V 
V~~~ '                     -\- 



-6-
available.  The low official exchange rate for thq US dollar that
influenced the lper diem' expenses, the, political instabili'ty and the
country economic problems made it difficult for the consultants to engage
suitable experts and this contributed to deficiencies in programming their
work.  Later, some expatriate advisors and specialists had to be laid off,
due tq performance thit SNC found unsatisfactory.   Finally, cooperat4on
between the consultants and the local counterpxrt staff was deficient.
3.08     The main product left by the consultants was the SAM, that was not
completely implemented by SNC. We will refer to this point later oi.
p. Maintenance Program
3.09     The Project began to make progress in 1980, with equipment
purchase and workshops construction, but the comprehensive road maintenance
program did not start until May 1, 1981 instead of July 1, 1979 as
originally planned.  The major reasons for this delay were the
unavailability of the necessary equipment and the delay in awarding the
technical assistance contract. The consultants had to prepare the
maintenance programs and assist SNC to put them into effect. Without this
postponement the Project would have begun at a time when the country still
enjoyed better social and economic conditions.
3.10     Equipment started being used as soon as it was delivered and the
quality of road maintenance improved remarkably in the three project,
districts during the first years of implementation of the program,
Maintenance cost increases due to inflation were partially offsetWby SNC's
increased maintenance budget during 1981 and 1982. However, due to the
increasingly deteriorating financial situation,of the country after mid-
1982. execution oF the maintenance program and"'disbursement of the loan
proceeds wete delayed.
3.11     The situation was aggravated in 1983 after the peso was
drastically devalued and SNC budget was not adjusted. Systematic road
maintenancei management was not possible and all maintenance activities came
to a standstill.  About 60S of the asphalt roas. (approx. 600 km)
deteriorated badly, requiring intensive rehabilitation. Therefore, the
Project's objettives of c6ptinous and reguiar maintenance activities were
not met.
3.12     Because of the mismAnagement and macroeconomic policies pf\the
Government, the Bank suspended disbursements on all Bolivia projects from
November 1983 to July 184 and from July to December 1985, while political
and economic instability\continued. All thete factors contributed to
paralyze all project activities., 
3.A3     The Project somewhat recovereo a more normal implementation pace
in 1986, with some budgetary support provided by the Government an4 the
acquisition of asphalt, but the commitment to achieve the go4ls of the
maintenance programs weakened.
3.14     The final results of the Program were not completely satisfactory,
since regular maintenance activities covered only some 8,000 kms out c6 the
15,000 kas orginally envisaged, with the remaining sectors receiving only
sporadic maintenance in response to emergency situations.
.                                       ,                      .~~~~N



3.15     Another constraint, additional to the above, waS tlhe  shortcoming
in operation of the crushed stone production plants.  Production of
aggregates was of highest importance to the success of the road maintenance
program, sinc-e regravelling was the main activitity performed by SNC in'the
three pilot districts. Due to financial constraints, SNC could not provide
for overtime or second shift operation of the crushing plants. Additional
difficulties were ..encountered by poor machinery performance, since the
equipment was not appropriate for production of material for regravelling.
Purchase of additional screening plants was approved by the Bank, but
suspension of disbursements delayed their procurement.
3.16     Other factors that were important in the deficient performance of
the project were the delay in the asphalt supply and the diversion of the
equipment to repair the damages produced by the storms of unusual
Intensity.  These were maintenance works, but they were'not foreseen by the
project.
3.17     In summary, the maintenance programs werelonly partially executed.
The degree of execution is very difficult to determine, because of the lack
of information abo4t the evolution of the performance indicators and the
very scarce references about the maintenance progrwms in the progress
reports.\ There are very few iidicators about the performance of the
Project in the progress reports of the consultants and SNC between 1981 and
1984 and they are, generally, tables with global data that do not give
enough information.
3.18     In any case, the most important reasons for the deficXent
performance of maintenance programs were the economic crisis an'd the
political and economic instability in Bolivia during the most crucial years
of the Projeqt.
E. Maintenance Management System (SAM)
3.19     As said in paragraph 3.08, the most important result from the
technical assistance program was the design of the Maintenance Management
System (SAM) for the planning, programming and controlling of maintenance
activities. However,.the system was only partially implemented.
3.20     The consultants drew up a maintenance program for 1981 that it was
not possible to execute, mainly because the GoveEnment could not provide
the necessary funds. KIn the following years, similar programs could not be
prepared because the' maintenance inventories were not updated.
3.21     At the consultants' termination, SNC established a maintenanie
advisory group (GAM), staffed with the SNC former consultant's counterpart
specialists, to continue with the impleihentation of the SAM.The GAM did not
have the necessary prof'ssionals,continously available to\run the computer
programs and, on the otheriside, the management personnel of SNC were
changed when they were familiarized with the system and the new managers
had to l'arn the goals and the advantages of the SAM.
3.22     The maintenance levels are an input for the SAM, to be established
during the troject execution, \using the HDM model,version III, but this
version was not available and the coiXultants could not implement it, with



-8-
consequent repercussions on programming, monitoring and supervAsing of
maintenance activities.
3.23     The consultants spent much time and effort on desi8ning the SAM
but little on supporting the actual execution of the maintenance programs.
Op the other hand, they asked SNC to provide a permanent team of
professional counterparts assigned to SAM, but this was not possible.
.hen the first team left, it could not be adequately replaced.
3.24     Since the expected technology transfer and institutional
improvements were not entirely satisfactory, SNC agreed with the Bank to
scale down the scope of the component to a level more in accordance with
the local institutional needs.  The situation worsened after the
devaluation of ~983 and a decision to terminate the contract in December
1983 was mutually agreed by the Government and the consultants. By then,
-only 612 of the originally planned effort had been completed.         I
Consequently, the final cost of the program was reduced frogt the estimated
US$2.73 million to US$1.65 million.
3.25     The most damaging consequence was that the consultants did not
check the appXicability of the maintenance management system th∂t they had
designed and this \lack of validation influenced SNC not to implement the
system completely.\ Prom December 1983, SNC took direct charge of the
system until the end of the Project, which was delayed to December 1985
and, finally, to December 1986.  However, the shortage of maintenance funds
and the exodus of SNC's field engineers, in search of better,opportunities
in the private sector, hampered this effort.  In spite of the above
shortcomings, efforts were made to maintain the main highway network on an
ad hoc basis and to keep the roads open during the rainy seasons.
v.26     The Bank agreed to the Government's request to\allocate US$,
200,000 under the loan, to finance the continued activities of the
Comprehensive Transport Study Unit (Estidio Integral de Transporte-EIT),
set up in the 1970s. The purposes of the program weres ti) to provide
appropriate statistical information to permit the analysis of the needs and
resources a-ailable in the sector, (ii) to give a framework for sectoral
policy,design, and,(iii) to develop a permanent planning capacity. The
Government counterpart funds fqr the Study were US$ 36,000. The program
started five months behind schedule, due to lack of trained personnel\and
'slow contracting of the studies.  The studies were completed in March 1988.
3.27     At present, SNC is implementing the SAM in five southern districts
(Oruro, Chuqiisaca, Potosi, Tartja and Tupiza) financed by the Government
and the Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF).  The effort began in mid-1988
and is'due tq run during four years,\as a pilot project.  Technical
assistance to\extend this implementahion nationwide is included under the
Bank's Export Corridors Project (Loan 2012-BO) approved in May 1989.

F. ESuipment Management System (SAE)
3.28     The Consultant designed a system to manage maintenance equipment
but it was not accepted by SNC because, according to the tontract, the
consultants had to provide a specialist An equipment management responsible
for formulating and apply4ng the system. \The consultant designed the
system but did not provide anyone to oversee its implementation and so the
SAE was not implemented at the time. Only some recowmendations were
established.   Later, SNC prepared an  equipment management system, taking
Into account the c'onsultants' recommendations and the system is now
continuing its implementation process.
3,29     One of the conclusions of the consultants, accepted by SNC, was
the aeed to introduce changes in the Bolivian procurement legislation, to
avoid the slowness and complexity in Government processing for procurement
of goods.
\3.30    A computerized system proposed by the consultants to monitor the
equipment inventory was partly implemented, but not completely, because of
problems in setting up the computers.  These problems have now (1989) been
solved.     ,
0.  Personnel Trakinin,
3.31     Tra  uing was to have been important in the development of the
project, but was otely carried out at 72 of the planned effort.  The
ConsultatL was not able to provide training personnel ac'ep'table to SNC,
because of the circumstances described in pa*.- 3.07, and most of the
planned training courses zould not be carried out. Only materitls and
training equipment were purchased and one training center was established
in Suticollo, near Cochabamba.
3.32     Another task of the consultants was to review the SNC's person1el
recruit  -t procedures and to recommend ways to improve them.  The  AMH ill'
allow e -to foresee its needs for personnel, depending on the extension of
maintenance programs.  The impiementatibn of the system will allow
significant\improvements in this area.

IV.  XNSTITUTIONAL PERFORMAIIE
4.01     SNC demonvtrated firm commitment to the project from the start
'*nd, despite the general budget restrictions, it maintained counterpart
funding for execution of the project at a satisfactory level up to mid-
1982. The desperate financial situation of the country thereafter had a
paralyzing effect on project implementation and counterpart funds were
insufficient.  SNC gradually lost interest concerning the implementation oi
the technical assistance program, as qualified personnel became impossible
to attract.
\
4.02     Financial statements and informAtion required by the loan were
deficient and delivery was usually behind schedule, which impeded adequate
monitoring from the Rank.
4%.Q3    Achievements under the project in the area of institution-building
were few. Improvements in road mainteaance organization, as well as
rationilization of maintenance planning, procedures and standards,, were not
as expected. Lack of continuity in the central government and in the
executing agency prevented any serious commitment to the sector's goals.

V. COST ESTIMATES AND DIßBUMSEMENTS
5.01     It was estimated at appraisal that the Bank's contribuition would
'\be 801 of the total project cost. In 1984 an increase in the disbursement
percentage was approved for the remainder of the deferred maintenance
program (from 462 to 552), raising the Bank's final share to 81Z. The last
disbursement was made in July 1987 and a total of approximately US$14,000
was cancelled.
5.02     The actual total cost of the project W*9 US$31.6  million instead\
of the US$36.3 million estimatEd at appraisal.
5.03     Because of the extremely slow implementation process,
disbursements lagged well behind appraisal estimates. Table 1 compares
actual and planned disbursements of the project and Table 2 shows the
tlctual costs of the project.

VI. \ ECONOMIC gEVALUATION
6.01     At apptaisal benefits were assumed to occur on account of reduced
vehicle operating costs. On average, savings of 12% in vehicle operating
cost were expected.  The project was justified with an overall benefit/cost
ratio of about 12il and a net present value of US$ 160 million, when an 11l
opportunity cost of capital was used.  For the project as a whole,
estimates Zf the economic rate of return were well above 1002.
6.02     The\economic reevaluation results from the comparison of
maintenance costs plus user costs in both cases, with and without project,
considering the partial road network really covered by the Project. Table 3
shows the traffic levels and lengths of road covered, compared with
appraisal estimates, resulting in appreciable differences.  The cost and
benefit streais, with and without project, have been evaluated considering
an 11% discount rate.
6.03     The Borrowe4rs first reevaluation of the naintenance component
resulted in a negative economic rate of return. ,This was based on a
comparison between how\ things would have been without the Project, had the
economic situation remhined as it iwa during appraisal, versus how things
actually were with Project implementation." We rejected the main logic of
this reev4uation on the grounds that the snalysin had to take into account
that, #uring Project implementation, a very critical economic situation
prevailed in BolXivia, that would have seriously affeeted vehicle operating
costs of using the relevant links whether or rot the Project had been
implemented. Much of'the deterioration-lrs due, not to the projeet, but to
the eco6nomic crisis.  In response, the Borrower's reeyaluatlon was improved
and completed with an study by ITVC entitled 'Reeval acion econo4ca de la
Asistencia Tecnica pafa el Mantenimie~ito-de Carreteras (Prestamo 1$74O)"
fInanced\under the lo*n.  It reevaluates the -Project, using the HDM III
model on\the same basis ai in paragraph 6.02, but in the 'without project'.
case it assumes\ that SNC maintenance standards and funds during the Project
years would have been the'same as those prevailing in the preceding years
and neither the Project -nor the general eccomic crisis had exiited.  This
is an assumption substantially similar to that--of the first reevaluation
and, therefore, inappropriate.
6.-04       The'Bank reevaluated the maintenance compon*nt using-the
assumption, as in the apprfisal, that vehicle opera?ling costs with the
project were reduced by 122 -an amount considered reasonable for this type
of investment. Ott this basis, the weighed average for the component is
39Z, wvll below the original estimatea, althopgh considerably above the
opportinity cost- of cap1tal. Although the- uxact economic rate of return
can not be'masured because of lack of s4eciUJc data, the general 
assumption (the operating costs were reIuced ty 122) does not seem
excesive, given the experlence in,othei\slmilAr Projects.. Thetmfore, one
can deduct with a high degikee of confidence that\tho economic returnv 
acceptable -
=   ,   \            \ o               *.                    -V   t



13-                 . 
6.05     It is interesting to consider one conclusion of the ITVC's study,
that because the earth\roads were hardly maintained at all and the
corresponding user costs increased, and, likewise, the gravel roads'were
not sufficiently maintained, except in the district of La Paz, this off-set
the positive effect of the Project on all the paved roads that, considered
on their own, showed a very positive result. In other words. the project
focused mainly\on the paved roads, surpassing in some cases the recommended
standards, and'.practically neglected the earth roads, which deteriorated to
a condition below the minima established by the program and were worse
after than before the Project.
6.06     We accept that delays in procurement of suppliep and consultant
services and in disbursements, all due to project requirements, did have
negative consequences. The comprehOnsive road maintenance programs did not
start until May 1, 1981 Instead of July 1, 1979, as planned. Xn the
interim SNC diverted its efforts and resources from roa4 maintenance
activities to solve problems arising from exogenous causes. These causes
were mainly difficulties in procurement procedures requested by the
Project, and in awarding the consultant serviLces. Those difficulties are
not imputable to the crisis, that had scarcely begun, and were not foreseen
by the Project. Most of the road network in the three districts was in
such a precarious state that any delay in repairing ft allowed it to
deteriorate severely.  The pavements began-to break up, at which point
maintenance was no longer an economic solutioA.  What waa,'eeded instead
was intensive -and costly- rehabilitation or reconstruction.
6.07     What can be learned from' this?  With hindsight it is easy to see
the cost of such inaction. But bifore a pavement begins to break up it is
hard to Judge how much longer it can survive. How far '-_ese delays could
had been avoided'is also difficult to judge. Suffice it-so say that, if it
is known that substantial lengths of road are in or approaching this
critical.condition, it behoves those responsible to make e&pecial efforts
to contract quickly works that will stabilize the pavement structure.before' -
- it- breaks up.,.

VII.  CONCLUSIONS
7.01     At the beginning, the capacity of SNC was probably adequate to'
carry out the project.' Its organization and efficiency were also
satipfactory. Eventually, successive changes at senior management level,
turnover of\skilled persoinel, difficulties in replacing them adequatedly,
frequent strikes, and gradual loss of interest because of the
unsatisfactory'performance of the project, etc., affected seriously the
institution and, consequently, the Project. At present (1989), the
situation is distinctly better, but strengthening of SNC is still highly
recommended to achieve the proposed goals of improving maintenance
activities.  Future allocation of funds to maintenance purposes sh,uld be
made taking as a basis the programs drawn up by SNC, in accordance with the
SAM standards. \
7t02     The project was successful in procuring road maintenance
equipment, spares parts and vehicles.  However, because of the comlex
bureaucratic procedures for procurement of goods, the purchase of
equipment, spare-parts arwd materials such as asphalt, was delayed, which
affected negatively the maintenance programs.
7.03     Procurement proce4Iures and terms must be improved in the future.
So far, the Government has agreements with two international agencies to
handle all-public sector procurement for amounts over approximately US$
40,000. It is expected that this will result in significant improvement*
on procurement procedures and terms.
7.04'    Since the  'roject was successful in acquiring maintenance    \
equipment and,further acquisitions of thip type of equipment are foreseen
in the\near future (financed by JICA, RFW and IDA),  no new equipment
purchases should be envisaged. In addition, contracting out periodic
maintenance and rehabilitation should be encouraged. To this \end, the
implementation of a pilot program to carry-out maintenance works by        -
6,ontract is a task to be performed with the technical assistance that will
be financed by the Export CorridorsCP-roject.
7.05     Construction of workshops and warehouses and ascqisition of
specialized equipment for the SNC soil laboratory-were relatively
successful and can be considered one of the lasting benefits of the
project.
7.06\    The objective of strengthening the road maintenance organization
and implementing systematic maintenance procedures and standards was only
partially achieved.  The most important result from the technical
assistance program was the design of the Maintenance Managiment iystem
(SAM) for planning, programming and cqntrolling maintenance activities.
\But little time and'effort were spent by the consultant to support the
performance of the maintenance program.  This is an aspect to consider iW'
future projects, in order to achieve practical  results and not only
theoretical exercises.  On the other hand, prdbably SNC was not prepared to
receive the too-sophisticated program initially desi:ned and even after\ its
scope was reduced, inadequately qualified and insufficient persopnel



- 15 -
prevented its full implementation.  In any case, at present SNC is starting
to utilize the SAM, even though with some restrictions.
7.07     Implementation of the SAM and the SAE all over the country is an
objective to be achieved in the next years. To this end, financing of
technical assistance is included in the Export Corridors Project. It is
thought to stand a better chance of success in Bolivia's present more
stable conditions and with the experience obtained in the southern
districts by the pilot project now in process, financed by the Government
and CAF.
7.08     The development of the road maintenance program was repeatedly
delayed, owing to the chaotic political and economic con%litions prevailing
during the project's implementation period. Initial and consecutive delays
in the consultant's work and in the acquisition of equipment and spare
parts caused serious detriment to the program. The contracting of asphalt
suppliei was also delayed.   Whetn the inputs needed were finally all
available, the deterioration of the economic situation in the country
affected the allocation of funds to maintenance programs and the negative
effects could not be offset.
7.09     The initial delays, and their negative consequences could have
been reduced if the difficulties to\implement the Proje6ct had been foreseen
in its preparation. Road maintenance projects are very sensitive to delays
in their-implementation. Project improvements and requirements should be
carefully prepared and gradually implemented, taking into account the
capability and limitations not only of the beneficiary institution but
other Borrower's institutions.  Continuity ip maintenance activities, at
any time, is essential and should be guarante0d, while, gradually,
maintenance programs are improved, appropriate equipment is available and
procurement practices are modified.
7T.10    Furthermore, unforeseen restoration works on the network damaged
by unusual storms, mainly in 1980, also diverted SRc's'lefforts and changed
its priorities. On th! other hand, the project did not consider the fact
that most of the gravel,network lacked adequate drainage and probably
needed rehabilitation before itxcould be\efficiently maintained.  This
conclusion will be taken into account in the maintenance programs to be '
prepared under the Export Corridors Project (Loan 2012-BO.
7.11     Howe4er, the maintenance program did eventually yield some useful
results ind, even though substantially reduced with respect to that
designed, served to keep the high-traffic roads in acceptable condition,
with the consequent benefits to the most economically important areas and,
therefore, to the country.  But these benefits were achieved at the expense
~of neglecting the maintenance of barth roads What deteriorated badly.
7.12     Adequate, complete and well studied maintenance programs are -
necessary in the future. In 'the Export Corridors Project, as a condition
for effectiveness, SNC must submit to the Bank a dcetatled maintenance
'progvam for l090 and an outlined program for 1991-199X, both acceptable to
the Bank.
\  .            "a. ..  



-16-
-7.13     Ma*n~enance programs should include routine, periodic and deferred
maintenance and also some types of rehabilitation, like improvement of
drainage and small structures and should cover all maintenance works on the
entire network in the period considered, whether or not they are financed
undet a specific project. In addition, they should be prepared according
to the SAM standards and rules, including control parameters fqr physical
progress.
7.14     From 1984 to 1988, the Government and SNC made efforts to improve
road maintenance.  But the funds allocated are still barely sufficient.
The budget approved by the Congress in January 1989 indicates a positive
change from previous years, but it must be considered that they are
starting from a low level of maintenance. (Routine maintenance in 1988
still was concentrated on the third of the network that is paved or gravel-
surfaced,'forgetting the earth roads.  IDA estimated that in 1986, the
accumulated backlog of periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of paved
roads amounted to as much as 602 of the paved network and just over 50X of
gravel roads).  Therefore, additional funds will be neccessary to carry out
maintenance programs according to the SAM standards and the Export
Corridors Project requirUments.
7.15 '   To,help and encourage the Government to allocate funds for road
maintenance purposes,'the Bank is studying a new project (Second Road
Maintenance) but it is not expected to be effective before thr last quarter
of 1991.  However, the por state of the network warrants urgew. attention,
beyond that foreseen under the Export Corridors Project. Ther~fore, it is
recommendable to advance this new loan.
7.16     As for the improvement of the capability of maintenan6e personnel,
the maintenance advisory group (GAM) did not have the necessary resources
to support the maintenance'department, because of the shortage of
maintenance funds and the exodus of SNC's field engineers after the
consultant left and the objectives 9f the Project became very diluted.  In
future projects, the capability of the maintenance personnel should be
adequatedly designed and programmed and could be improved by me4ns of
interchanges 'of qualified experts, at differeAit leveels, with other \
\countries.
7.17     Suspension of Bank loan disbursements also contributed to
paralyzing all project activities, with serious consequences on the road
conditions and, therefore, withinegative results. While warranted in this
case by'the Government mismanagement and macroeconomic policiei, any future
decision to suspend disbursements for a maintenance operation will have to
weigh the consequences carefully.
7.18     In short,ithe critical situation of the country d&ring the years
of this',project, with its consequences in shortage of funds, changes in
staff, strikes, etc., was the main cause for the project's deficient
implementation av.4 results, though.not the only.

'Subject:  Bolivia -- High.*ay 4a'intensnce  rojeat:  Project Completion Report
DeaXr Sir:.
I am'pleased to acklnowledge your letter of January 8, 1990,
conveying the ProjectVCompletion' Report referred to above.  The report
analyzes in a cl'ar, concrete.and accurate way all the factors that impacted
the implementation of the road maintenance program, and'this timely eva.uation
is also correct in discussing events prior lto implementation as well as those
that subsequently affected its execution.        '
The SNC concurs with the report, especialy as regards the
conclusion that the program was not as successful as anticipated because of
the wide-ranging social and economic crisis prevailing in Bolivia at that
time, and the consequent instability within instttutions such as SNC, which
- wa\responsible for program execution.
It is also quite accurate that the Maintenance Support Group, once
tht contract with the consuXtant was concluded, was not given the
encouragement, reinforcement or much less the resources needed to enable it to
follow up the,progrqm from 1984 onward.
SNC provided the necessaty information for ITVC to make an
economic evaluation of the program; this did not produce the desired resuits
because the group of experts from the University was not.familiat with the
context of, and events occurring during, the early years of the program; in
other words, they did not take into account the pieriod of severe economic
crisis in !olivia.
Another inappropriate feature of the program was the arrangement
whereby advances for phased painteviance work\were dl\sbursed in Bolivian pesos,
with the Bank, at the time of disbdrsement to SNC, converting dolLar amounts
at the curreut official exchange rate.  In a c'ountry grappling.with a mounting'
crisis and experiencing constant devaluations, this procedure cause4 SNC
serious problems, basically as regards the amount of maiptenance work, since
in some cases-work quattities had to be doubled to absorb the amount of

brought to the attention of Bank staff during their supervision missions to
Bolivia.
On page (ii), Key Project Data, the figure for.the"c4nceled"....
portion of the loan should be $14,000, not $14,000,0OO.
One useful consequence of Loan 1587-.0 is that SNC cont$nued to
use tae SAM. SAE, ard Per8onnel Trai6ing and C!>mputerized Analysis Programs in
tne Southaern Districts Highway Maintenance Program, financad by.tbo Andean
Developpent Co-otat on (CAF). It is hoped that the reaults obined wfl
lead to the extetision. of the program to the rest of BoIl.Via, using furnd 
provided by the World Bank under Credit 2012-BO, which is a corstinuation of
Loan 1587-BO.    .
To this,end we hope to apply with greater consistency and succes(s
the lessons that Bolivia is learning, namely that major changes are required
in the area of highway maintenance; we shall as always-continue.-,tQ look to the
World Bank for firm support.
