Program Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The overall objective is to consolidate social and economic change and to prepare the
way to complete the transition. More specifically, the program supports: (i) improving
transparency and accountability in a visible way to respond to the aspirations of the
population and to signal to investors that Tunisia is creating a level playing field for
private sector-led growth; and (ii) taking immediate actions to relieve the plight of the
unemployed and the poorest and most vulnerable families.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Program context

1.       Before the revolution, against a background of rising corruption, a reasonably
strong growth performance had failed to meet rising expectations. Tunisia had made good
progress in economic and social indicators. Average growth rate was near to 5 percent over
1997-2007, and remained above 3 percent during 2008-2010 in the midst of the global financial
crisis, resulting in steady increase in per capita income and rapid poverty reduction. However,
unemployment remained at around 13-14 percent and spatial disparities persisted. While the
majority of unemployed individuals were young, low-skilled, male, urban workers, the increase in
unemployment in recent years affected mostly university graduates, notably women graduates (48
percent) and the interior regions of the country. Further, the information available after the
revolution also unveiled the fact that economic development had been heavily concentrated
geographically along the coast, with the interior increasingly lagging behind. Poverty rates in
2010 ranged from 8-9 percent in Grand Tunis and the Center East region to as much as 26 and 32
percent in the North West and Center West regions respectively.

2.      A good de jure business environment performance hid deep de facto governance
problems, especially in the domestic “onshore? sector. Tunisia fared fairly well in most
business environment indicators, in part because such indicators capture best the de jure
processes, and in part also because the information often comes mainly from foreign companies,
which in Tunisia usually operate in the offshore sector and therefore faced a better business
environment. In fact, substantial discretion in the application of laws and regulations, inefficient
procurement processes, rigged privatization, the declassification of public land assets, and the
improper use of public banks, hampered the Tunisian economy. Moreover, the highly centralized
decision making process undermined the system of checks and balances, resulting in low
transparency and accountability. More generally, substantial discretion was practiced in the
application of the laws. The lack of adequate participation, transparency, and accountability
exacerbated the population’s sense of unfairness.

3.       In January 2011, the wave of protests that ended the 23 year rule of President Zine
El Abidine Ben Ali ushered in a new political and economic era. The revolution was fueled
by widespread anger and frustration over lack of social and political inclusion, governance and
corruption problems, mounting unemployment and the rising cost of living. In the midst of the
ensuing political vacuum, the President of Parliament, Foued Mebazaa, was appointed Interim
President of the Republic and, following the dissolution of Parliament, was given powers to
legislate by decree-law. Two initial attempts at forming an Interim Government were rejected by
the people because they included senior figures of the old regime. The President then appointed
Mr. Béji Caid Essebs as Prime Minister and his Interim Government survived the test of public
opinion. The new Interim Government was given the task to stabilize the country and prepare the
elections of a Constituent Assembly within a few months.

Macroeconomic context

4.      The economic outlook for 2011 was revised markedly downwards following the
January 2011 revolution, and expected financing needs increased substantially. The severity
of the shock was substantial. Prior to the revolution GDP growth for 2011 had been expected at
approximately 5 percent, but projections were then revised downwards to between 0 to 2 percent,


                                                12
depending in part on the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus the government was introducing. A
supplementary budget was prepared in April which increased the fiscal deficit in 2011 to 4.8
percent of GDP (from 2.5 percent in the originally approved 2011 budget). External financing
needs for 2011 were already expected to be fairly large (at US$4.2 billion) due to the scheduled
repayment of two large debt maturities, 1 and were now projected to increase further to
approximately US$5.5 billion as a result of the lower tourism, exports, FDI and remittances.

5.       While Tunisia entered the transition with good macroeconomic fundamentals and
buffers were available to face the crisis, nevertheless it required significant financial
external financing.2 The prudent macroeconomic policies of the past resulted in a comfortable
level of forex reserves at 4.7 months of GNFS imports at end-2010 and a manageable level of
public debt at 40 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, the severity of the expected shock to tourism,
FDI and exports (resulting from the political and social instability associated with the revolution
and the ongoing war in neighboring Libya), as well as the need for a fiscal stimulus, required
substantial financial resources. Since the cost to access capital markets substantially increased in
2011 the authorities had to switch to rely mainly on external official financing and to draw down
their international reserves. Macro projections suggested that Tunisia would need approximately
US$3.5 billion in external financing.

Rationale for Bank assistance

6.       Within this turbulent context, the Bank acted swiftly to adjust and streamline its
development assistance to support the transition process. Immediately after the revolution, the
Bank temporarily suspended all its operations in order to reassess and align its work with the
priorities expressed by the population. A senior mission by the Country Director and Sector
Directors visited Tunisia in February 2011 and held discussion with the new authorities on how
best to support the country. The Interim Government needed to respond to the changes called for
by the revolution and set Tunisia on a new trajectory of greater shared prosperity. It was agreed
that a single multi-sector policy lending operation would be prepared to provide quick disbursing
financing and assist the interim Government in adopting a package of emblematic governance
reforms, aligned with the demands of the revolution.3 The Bank was also asked to lead the other
key donors to ensure maximum coordination and streamlined support.

7.      The interim government indicated they would not have the mandate to commit to a
medium-term package of reforms, but requested support to adopt a program of immediate
measures which would signal “a clear break with the past?, notably to increase equity,
transparency, voice and accountability. They emphasized they wanted to give priority to
measures in four key areas: governance, employment and addressing regional disparities,
financial sector, and social services policies.

  The country began to recover from the global economic crisis with a growth in the GDP of 3.7 percent in
2010, and inflation was subdued at 4.5 percent. As a result of the incipient recovery, the fiscal position also
improved markedly in 2010 (with a fiscal deficit reduced from 3 percent of the GDP in 2009 to 1.3 percent
in 2010), while the external current account widened (to 4.8 percent of the GDP in 2010 from 2.8 in 2009).
Gross official reserves decreased from US$11.1 billion at the end of 2009 to US$9.6 billion at the end of
December 2010, still a comfortable level at approximately 5 months of imports.

  In parallel the Bank decided to maintain and accelerate implementation of two recently approved
community-based rural development projects (approximately US$125 million) and to prepare an
investment loan to provide a US$50 million credit line for Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises
(MSME), jointly with the AFDB who also provided US$50 million.


                                                      13
8.      The Governance and Opportunity Development Policy Loan (GO DPL) and
associated technical assistance were therefore the main Bank instruments to support
Tunisia’s historic transition in the immediate post-revolution period. A multi-sector team
was swiftly assembled to prepare the GO DPL. Preparation started in mid-March and the
operation was approved at the Board in June 2011. The operation was prepared jointly with the
EU, the AFDB and the French Development Agency, and the three donors jointly supported a
program of twenty policy actions (including the nine prior actions directly supported by the GO
DPL) intended to signal a clear break with the past, notably to increase voice, transparency and
accountability. It was also intended to set the basis for faster growth and employment creation by
improving the enabling environment for greater investment and productivity. The joint multi-
donor operation provided a total financial support of US$1.3 billion (approximately 3 percent of
GDP), including the Bank’s US$500 million GO DPL. Macro projections suggested that in
addition to this US$1.3 billion in external financing, Tunisia would need to use approximately
US$1.9 billion of its forex reserves, which were therefore expected to decrease to approximately
3.5 months by end-2011.

9.       The overall cross-sectoral theme of the operation focused on improving
transparency, accountability, and public participation in policy making and service
provision, which were deemed to be at the core of private sector development. The GO DPL
took advantage of the transition phase to introduce pivotal reforms which directly tackled some of
the injustices and bottlenecks which had been a source of frustration for the Tunisian population.
The transition period provided a unique opportunity for the Bank to engage in governance
reforms, which had not previously been possible even though they were at the core of economic
development challenges in Tunisia. Indeed governance issues were arguably the single most
binding constraint to greater private domestic investment in Tunisia. The thrust of the program
supported by the DPL therefore was to underscore that greater voice, transparency, participation,
inclusion, all lead to increased investment and competition, and thereby ensure sustained
economic growth.

10.      The Program Document warned of the potential for a negative spiral in case of
recurrent political and social instability, and the GO DPL was intended to mitigate these
risks. International experience shows that approximately 40 percent of democratic transitions fail,
but those that succeed can lead to substantially improved development outcomes for the citizens,
especially if rapid reforms are pursued. 4 This evidence underscores the importance of early
significant international financial and technical support to these inherently difficult transition
experiences. The Program Document highlighted that substantial downward risks weighted on
the short-term economic outlook, notably due to the uncertainty surrounding the political process
and its possible impact on exports, tourism, and FDI. These risks were amplified by external
factors, such as the war in Libya, the uncertain regional economic outlook, and the slow recovery
of major trading partners (notably the EU accounts for approximately 80 percent of Tunisian
exports). Furthermore, the Program Document noted the risk that the fiscal stimulus package may
not be entirely implemented which would lower economic growth and put additional pressure on
the labor market. The Program Document also warned of the possible risks to the stability of the
financial sector.5 In this context the strong support of the international community through the

  While financial sector indicators had improved in the few years prior to the revolution, the banking sector
remained relatively weak and subject to vulnerabilities. In order to assess these risks, the authorities

multi-donor budget support operation, of which the GO DPL was part, was seen as a key response
to mitigate these risks.

11.     The key elements of the program supported by the GO DPL have since been further
elaborated and are at the core of the new FY13-14 Interim Strategy Note. At the time of the
GO DPL preparation, the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (FY2010-2013) was considered
not to fully reflect the post-revolution priorities.6 However it was decided to wait until after the
2011 elections to prepare an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) with the newly elected government. The
ISN was discussed by the Board in July 2012 and includes the following three pillars: (i) Laying
the foundation for renewed sustainable growth and job creation; (ii) Promoting social and
economic inclusion; and (iii) Strengthening governance: voice, transparency, and accountability.
The ISN is closely aligned with the reforms program supported by the GO DPL.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

12.      The Development Objective of the GO DPL was to consolidate social and economic
change and help the authorities to secure the transition. In the context of the historic
economic and political changes described above, the operation supported a program of immediate
measures emblematic of improved governance and opportunity and within the mandate of the
Interim Government. As discussed earlier, the program of measures focused on four key areas:
governance, employment and regional development, financial sector, and social policies. The
measures focus on: (i) improving transparency and accountability in a visible way to respond to
the aspirations of the population, and to signal to investors that Tunisia is creating a level playing
field for private sector-led growth; and (ii) taking immediate actions to relieve the plight of the
unemployed and the poorest and vulnerable families.

13.      The PDOs and indicators were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

14.      The Bank’s support focused on the four priority areas indicated by the Interim
Government’s which was appointed after the revolution: (i) governance; (ii) employment and
regional disparities; (iii) the financial sector; and (iv) social policies. The GO DPL supports a
specific subset of key policy reforms under each area.

  It had been prepared with the pre-revolution government and envisioned three strategic pillars: (i)
employment, growth, and competitiveness; (ii) sustainable development and climate change; and (iii)
improving the quality of service delivery. While the CPS’s core remained valid after the revolution to
address Tunisia’s structural problems, the Bank recognized that some of the elements of the 2009 CPS,
which was prepared with the pre-revolution government, were no longer relevant.


                                                     15
improve participation, transparency, and accountability in the future. These measures were: (i) to
support policy debate by allowing greater public access to government information (including
statistical data) and providing freedom of association; (ii) to establish a more liberal environment
for the registration of Internet domain names by reducing the administrative procedures and
increasing the competition among registrars of domain names; (iii) to improve the efficiency and
transparency of procurement procedures and shorten the decision process; and (iv) to improve
administrative services to citizens and strengthen private sector development by improving its
regulatory environment.

Policy area 2: Employment and Regional Disparities

16.     In the policy area of employment and regional disparities, the program prioritized
two immediate measures to enhance the governance and efficiency of employment programs to
support the unemployed and to improve labor intermediation of skilled and unskilled workers.
Specifically, the measures were: (i) to improve the accountability and governance of employment
programs financed by the National Employment Fund; and (ii) to enhance employability and
promote insertion of high-skilled youth into permanent employment (AMAL1) and provide a
safety net program (public works plus) targeted to low-skilled long-term unemployed that
promotes the local participation of NGOs and provides certain basic employment services aiming
to enhance the employability of participants (AMAL2).

Policy area 3: Financial Sector

17.       In the policy area of the financial sector, the reforms supported by the GO DPL
aimed to address corporate governance practices. Poor governance was a key factor
explaining the poor performance of the banking system. To start the process of reform the
Central Bank issued a circular to improve banks’ corporate governance practices and to introduce
criteria for selecting the officers, directors, and shareholders of banks.

Policy area 4: Social Policies

18.      The program supported two social policy measures to improve the accountability
and quality of public services and to expand provision of basic services in underserved
regions. In particular, the measures were: (i) to allow citizens to rate performance by introducing
mechanisms for regular monitoring and evaluation by third parties of selected social programs
and public services; and (ii) to introduce a national outreach services policy to expand free access
to care in underserved governorates for the provision of a basic package of health, education and
social protection services.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

19.     The policy areas were not revised.

1.6 Other significant changes

20.     While there were no significant changes in design, implementation arrangements, or
funding, de facto changes were made in the scope of some of the policy measures, in order to
adapt the program contents to the evolving situation. Specifically, the scope of the following
four policy measures was revised during the implementation: Firstly, the planned coverage of the
regulatory simplification reform (Prior Action #4) included customs, taxes, and tourism. However,
given the increasing political uncertainty that affected capacity of the government, it was agreed


                                                16
with the Bank that the regulatory simplification should focus on the Ministry of Finance. Tourism
was thus postponed and is now being undertaken as part of the follow-up DPL (which supports
the rolling out of the ‘guillotine-style’ regulatory simplification to nine additional ministries
which deal with private investment). Secondly, the safety net program (public works) for low-
skilled long-term unemployed individuals (initially envisaged as part of the unemployment
support programs introduced by Prior Action #6) has not yet been implemented, as the
government was facing increasing social tensions and did not have the institutional and financial
capacity to properly implement this measure. Thirdly, the Circular that mandated the creation of
an inter-ministerial and civil society working group and a civil society working group to develop
implementation guidelines for the participatory monitoring process at the local level (Prior Action
#8), was not implemented as originally intended. Persisting political tension limited the capacity
of the local administrations to roll out these reforms, and also it became apparent that NGOs
capacity at the local level was very limited (as a result of the repression of CSOs activity under
the former President). Hence with Bank support the Government changed the approach to start by
conducting citizens’ feedback online surveys without partnering with civil society organizations
at the local level as had initially been the intention. Finally, while the Government has made an
effort with regard to outreach by increasing its mobile staff in underserved regions, the inter-
ministerial coordination mechanism aiming to create outreach multi-sectoral social services at
local level (Social Affairs, Health, Education) as envisaged in the Circular has not yet been set up
(Prior Action #9).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

21.     Much progress has been achieved in Tunisia since the revolution, but the country
has yet to complete its political transition. On October 23, 2011, ninety percent of the 4.1
million registered voters participated in the elections of a Constituent Assembly. A new
government has been formed by a coalition of three main parties. While the adoption of the new
Constitution was initially planned for a year after the elections, a number of unsolved political
and technical issues have delayed the process. For instance, the role of religion and the status of
women in the new constitution have become a source of recurrent political tensions. The draft
constitution is currently being discussed at the Constituent Assembly and its approval is now
expected in early 2013. Once the new Constitution is adopted by the Assembly, there will be a
fresh round of elections, most likely in the second half of 2013.

22.      Actual economic performance was significantly worse than anticipated in 2011, as
continued social unrest and the Eurozone crisis negatively impacted economic activity,
resulting in a steep increase in unemployment and creating risks to the transition process.
The Interim Government sought to mitigate the revolution’s impact on the economy and to boost
recovery using a combination of fiscal and monetary policy measures. In spite of the sound policy
response, the combination of political uncertainty, social tensions and strikes, the European crisis
and the Libyan crisis significantly impaired economic activity. As a result, the economy
contracted by 2 percent in 2011 and the unemployment rate increased from 13 percent to almost
19 percent. The fiscal deficit in 2011 was lower than planned at 3.5 percent of GDP (instead of
4.8 percent envisaged in the supplementary budget), due to the limited absorption of fiscal
stimulus package, The reduction in exports and tourism receipts and the drop in FDI resulted in a
increase in the current account deficit to 7.3 percent of GDP (from 4.8 percent in 2010).
International reserves decreased from US$9.5 billion at end-2010 (or 4.7 months of GNFS
imports) to approximately US$7.5 billion at end-2011 (or 3.5 months of imports). The economy
has since started to recover, with GDP growth expected at approximately 3 percent in 2012 and


                                                17
the unemployment rate has stabilized at 17 percent as of September 2012. The continuation of
the expansionary fiscal policy is expected to result in a fiscal deficit of 6.6 percent of GDP in
2012, and the current account deficit is projected at 7.8 percent, as exports continue to suffer from
the weak performance in the EU. Growth is projected at 3.5 percent in 2013 and just above 4
percent in 2014, but significant downward risks exist to the 2013-2014 economic outlook.

23.      All nine prior actions were implemented as planned at appraisal, and expected
outcomes are generally beginning to materialize, although some times at a slower pace than
initially hoped for. The GO DPL was approved by the Board on June 21, 2011 and the single-
tranche was disbursed shortly after the loan became effective on July 27, 2011. Substantial
progress has been made in implementing the reforms supported by the operation. As described in
the table below, however, the achievement of the outcome indicators for several reforms is
lagging behind. As discussed in more detail in Section 2.2., the overall good progress made in
implementing the reforms in spite of the limited performance in terms of achieving the outcome
indicators, highlights weaknesses in the results framework as well as the fact that one-year is too
short period to assess the impact of the far reaching reforms introduced by this operation. In fact,
despite the limited timeframe allowed to evaluate the impact of this single-tranche DPL operation,
the program has succeeded in helping set the country on a new trajectory, in line the demands
expressed in the revolution.

                                    between April 19 to May 4, 2012. Approximately 8500 citizens provided
                                    feedback and the results have been published at this site
                                    (http://www.consultations-publiques.tn). A Second National Scorecard
                                    exercise was started in June focusing on the services/benefits from the
                                    National Health Insurance Fund, on the same website with results expected
                                    to be published by late 2012. Based on this Scorecard exercise, the
                                    Insurance Fund is increasing the number of offices and is establishing new
                                    customized services in order to improve its services. In addition the
                                    government launched an in-person Scorecard using a rapid household
                                    survey (800 households in various regions) which would be institutionalized

                                       citizens), with plans to continue to improve access further. As of May
                                       2011 there were 24 mobile teams, at 1 per governorate, that focus on
                                       addressing social exclusion, and 28 mobile teams that provide social

 In order to complement the government’s new approach, the Bank supported a local-level participatory
assessment of specific social services conducted by 3 NGOs in 4 governorates in the hinterlands. It is also
supporting the establishment of an instant feedback system by users in Tunisia’s biggest public hospital in
Tunis.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Adequacy of government’s commitment

24.      The Interim Government was highly committed to implementing a package of
reforms within their mandate to signal to the population a clear ‘break with the past’. The
areas covered by the program were politically sensitive and were not even open to discussion
prior to the revolution. As most of the civil servants stayed in their positions after the revolution,
implementing these reforms required the administration itself to break with the practices of the
past. Political uncertainty, including the elections and the change of the political leadership in the
administrations, affected the pace of reform implementation. In fact, the appropriation of the
reforms by the elected Government after the October 2011 elections took longer than expected,
due to political and social tensions and the debates related to the Constitution drafting.
Nevertheless, the Government remained committed to implementing the reforms, as they were
emblematic of the issues that emerged from the revolution. While some of the ambitious targets
were not fully achieved within the program period, the reforms triggered a deep change in the
administration’s practices and mentality. Inter alia this is also reflected in the ambitious reforms
envisaged under the new programmatic DPL series (Governance, Opportunities, and Jobs DPL,
covering 2012-2013).

Soundness of the background analysis

25.       The GO DPL was built on an impressive number of sound existing analytical studies
and rapid assessment missions completed during the program identification stage . While
some of the reforms benefited from existing analytical inputs undertaken in the past (ICT,
employment, social sectors), additional analyses of new issues that emerged from the revolution
were completed shortly after the revolution (notably, governance, procurement and financial
sector). Despite the limited time given to these rapid assessments, they quickly identified the most
critical reforms necessary to post-revolution Tunisia. The key reforms identified triggered a series
of deeper long-term reforms, mostly related to economic governance issues, which are being
further pursued under the follow-up programmatic DPL series.

Assessment of the operation’s design

26.     The choice of a single-tranche DPL operation was best suited to the unique post-
revolution transition situation in Tunisia, but the time frame for evaluation is short for such
far reaching reforms. The Bank was fully engaged to support the Tunisian transition by
providing financial resources and assisting in the adoption of key policy reforms, jointly with
other key development partners. The design of the single-tranche DPL operation responded to the
need for substantial quick-disbursing financial resources and to the limited policy reform mandate
of the Interim Government, mainly to address directly the issues pushed at the forefront by the
revolution. The design also allowed for flexibility to adjust the reforms program going forward as
required in such a volatile socio-political context. That said, while this operation faced an
exceptional context with the short-term perspective and limited mandate of the Interim
Government, a programmatic approach would have been more appropriate to support the type of
governance reforms which were at the core of the operation, as such reforms require changes in
the practices of the administration and therefore typically take several years to fully implement.
Indeed, the program had to be adapted in light of the evolving situation and additional
information which became available. Further, in the context of political instability, economic
uncertainty, and social tensions, the newly elected government after the October 2011 election
focused its attention on immediate priorities, thus relaxing the pace of the implementation of


                                                 23
these reforms. This shortcoming has been remedied through the preparation of the follow–up
DPL series, which builds on many of the same policy areas, and boosted the pace of the
implementation of reforms (and indeed most of the institutional outcomes have begun to
materialize after April 2012). In a sense, one could consider the 2011 GO DPL as de facto the
first operation of a programmatic series, which includes the two follow-up operations envisaged
under the Governance, Opportunity and Jobs DPL series (of which the first was approved in 2012
and the second is envisaged in 2013). Overall, these three operations mark a deep “break with the
past?, with economic governance reforms that have triggered deep changes in the Tunisian socio-
economic environment, and comprehensive economic reforms which set the country on a new
trajectory, as initially designed.

27.     The joint preparation of the DPL operation with other key donors leveraged
substantial additional resources and helped the government reduce transaction costs and
consolidate the policy dialogue and technical assistance by key development partners. The
Bank succeeded in fully engaging other key development partners in supporting the joint program,
focusing on a package of core reforms which signaled a “break with the past?. The strong support
was reflected in the large financial envelope provided by the GO DPL, which was a single-
tranche operation of US$500 million equivalent. Further the program was part of a multi-donor
operation jointly with the African Development Bank (US$500 million), the European Union
(Euro 90 million in two tranches, in the form of a grant), and the French Development Agency
(Euro 185 million in two tranches). This support was provided in the form of parallel financing,
but all of the cofinanciers participated in the design of the operation and in joint supervision
missions. In addition, this joint DPL was at the core of the donors’ coordination for technical
assistance and projects to support the transition process in Tunisia.

28.      The multi-sector nature of the GO DPL allowed the Government, supported by the
Bank and the other development partners, to focus on a core package of policy reforms in
the immediate post-revolution period. The design of the operation facilitated the coordination
and prioritization of tasks by the Interim Government at a time when it faced multiple priorities.
It is worth noting that Tunisia had traditionally preferred two-tranche DPLs with gradual reforms
in narrowly defined policy areas. The GO DPL was instead a first single-tranche multi-sector
DPL operation in Tunisia. This reflected the urgent challenges the Interim Government was
facing in terms of both financing and reforms, and also the efforts to assist the government
consolidate their policy reforms program.

29.      The reforms program supported by the GO DPL could perhaps have been further
streamlined, yet the level of ambition reflected the high expectations expressed by Tunisians
in the revolution. The reforms program may appear too ambitious when considering: (i) the
novelty of the reform areas that made difficult to assess at the design stage the Government’s
ability to implementing such reforms; (ii) the volatility of the post-revolution environment and
the various risks highlighted in the Program Document; (iii) the difficult economic and socio-
political situation following the revolution which naturally impaired the implementation of deep
reaching reforms in the short term; and (iv) the short time horizon for this operation. Nevertheless,
in the context of the revolution, the operation served to help the government adopt ambitious
goals in order to set the country on new trajectory. In other words, the level of ambition was the
result of an inherent tension between the wish to take advantage of the window of opportunity to
respond to the expectations of the population expressed in the revolution by laying out an
ambitious reform agenda to set in motion profound changes, while at the same time recognizing
the risks that the capacity to handle complex reforms was limited by the turmoil of the transition
period itself.



                                                24
30.      The Bank’s bold and strategic decision to focus its program in the immediate
aftermath of the revolution helped accomplish significant results in Tunisia in a very short
time. The decision by the Country Management Unit to consolidate the Bank’s support to
Tunisia in the immediate post-revolution period into a multi-sector policy lending operation
helped accomplish far reaching development results in a very short time by being focused. The
alternative scenario, to continue with a fragmented (and outdated) program would have diluted
and confused the Bank’s efforts. Hence while as discussed above the reforms program could
perhaps have been further streamlined, it should be emphasized that this operation was in fact the
result of an exceptional consolidation effort of the Bank’s engagement in immediate post-
revolution Tunisia. Further streamlining of the operation was therefore also difficult in light of
the tension to facilitate broader country team participation in the single operation (i.e. at a time
when all other Bank activities in Tunisia had been put on hold).

31.      The program appears to have been relatively well conceived and correctly identified
the critical reforms for post-revolution Tunisia. The team carried out rapid analytical work and
appears to have rightly identified critical reforms that emerged from the revolution. In fact, the
policy measures have remained highly relevant despite the fluid Tunisian political environment
and continue to be pursued by the newly elected government. The good program design is also
highlighted by the fact that the policy areas and specific reforms remained relevant in the Bank’s
new Interim Strategy Note, which was prepared after the October 2011 democratic elections, and
continue to be pursued in the follow-up programmatic DPL series approved in November 2012.

32.     However the results framework appears inadequate to monitor the progress in the
implementation of these reforms. As discussed further in Section 2.3, the Bank failed to
identify appropriate indicators and achievable targets at the design stage. At least in part the
weaknesses in the results framework can be attributed to the short time allowed to prepare the
operation and the novelty of the reform areas supported by the program.

Relevance of the risks identified

33.     Overall, the potential risks to the program were correctly identified, and the
mitigation measures were appropriate, as described in the table below. However, the novelty
of the reform areas in addition to the external uncertainty resulted in a number of difficulties in
implementing the reforms, which were not easily predictable at the design stage, in the following
risk areas: (i) political instability; (ii) economic uncertainty; and (iii) risks related to the design
and implementation of the program (slowness of the administration’s adaptability).

(i)   Political instability: Although political instability was taken into account as a major risk,
      political uncertainty affected the government’s capacity to sustain the reform
      implementation pace in the following areas due to the frequent change of government and
      ministers/managers. Regulatory reform (Prior Action #4) in particular suffered from the
      frequent change in ministers/managers (at the time of the ICR preparation, there was no
      Minister of Finance since his resignation in July 2012). Similarly, political and social
      instability impacted several reforms by slowing their implementation pace, such as for
      instance the reforms of corporate governance in the banking sector (Prior Action #7). Also
      the political uncertainty has had a severe impact on delaying the use of the new procurement
      procedures due to the concerns in adapting to less stringent procurement procedures (Prior
      Action #3). Moreover, in addition to the delay in the operationalization of electronic domain
      name registries, feedback from civil society and the private sector suggests that the
      population does not yet have full confidence in the freedom of the Tunisian Internet system
      (Prior Action #2). Similarly, the shortcomings of the high-skilled unemployed support


                                                  25
     program (AMAL1) have been exacerbated by the political uncertainty. In fact, while the
     comprehensive package to support high-skilled unemployed individuals was partially
     implemented, increasing social demand forced the government more prosaically to provide
     social allowances in order to relax social tensions. Hence AMAL program became de facto
     a non-conditional cash transfer program to high-skilled unemployed, with limited (or
     perhaps negative) impact on jobs creation. The safety net program for low-skilled
     unemployed (AMAL2) was dropped, as the government did not have the institutional and
     financial capacity to implement this measure alongside AMAL 1.

(ii) Economic uncertainty: The economic downturn was more severe than initially anticipated,
     mainly due to the political instability and the Eurozone crisis, and affected a number of
     performance indicators. The limited growth of the creation of “.tn? domain names compared
     to the initial target (Prior Action #2) and the lack of internship jobs which were envisaged as
     part of the AMAL program (Prior Action #6) can be partially explained by lower than
     anticipated economic activity during the period. Moreover, lower economic activities led to a
     higher unemployment rate and greater social tensions, which diverted the Government’s
     attention from the implementation of the economic governance reforms.

(iii) Design and implementation of the program: The revolution was expected to lead to a major
      change in the culture of both the administration and civil society. While changes have indeed
      been visible in most areas, certain behaviors have remained unchanged. Civil servants were
      reluctant to take over the greater authority and responsibility granted by the simplification of
      procurement procedures (Prior Action #3), especially as in the post-revolution context they
      face increasing contestability. As for the regulatory reform (Prior Action #4), the initial
      participatory approach sought to eliminate a substantial part of the existing formalities and
      procedures by only retaining those justified, also in the eyes of the private sector. However,
      the limited engagement of the private sector in the process was a key factor for the repeated
      delays. At least in part this is due to the lack of experience by the private sector in voicing
      its concerns and to critique the work of the administration. Similarly, while participatory
      monitoring (Prior Action #8) was intended to institutionalize citizen and civil society
      participation in assessing and monitoring public services at the local level, the government
      changed the approach with Bank support by conducting an online feedback survey from the
      population by itself (without the institutional involvement of civil society). Similarly, the
      government initially intended to expand social services to underserved regions by providing
      community-based multi-sectoral social services package (Prior Action #9). However each
      ministry attempted to remedy separately to the limited social coverage in the hinterlands. No
      inter-ministerial coordination mechanisms were set up either at the central or local level.

                                      opportunity.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E design

34.      The results framework proved inadequate to the task of monitoring the impact of
the operation. Despite their high numbers, many of the indicators imperfectly capture the
institutional achievements towards the PDO. The Bank failed to identify appropriate indicators
which went to the core of the changes envisaged by the reforms supported by the program. It also
failed to identify realistic targets for the indicators at the design stage. The results framework has
several shortcomings: (i) weak links between the objectives of the economic governance reforms
and the results indicators; (ii) too many indicators, making difficult to monitor and collect data;
(iii) overly ambitious targets given the unpredictability of the transition process and the limited
timeframe (one year). Arguably the main reason for these shortcomings reflects the difficulty in
finding suitable indicators to measure the progress and outcomes of reforms targeting deep
changes in the existing practices of the administration, and yet have to be monitored within one
year. This shortcoming was reinforced by the fact that the team had limited time to design this
complex operation, covering a broad range of critical reforms which had not previously been
discussed.

M&E implementation and utilization




                                                     28
35.     The policy matrix provided too large a number of quantitative indicators, and for
several of them it has not been possible to monitor progress. Given the unstable political and
economic environment, attention was focused on reform implementation rather than on collecting
and monitoring indicators. Indicators were collected only for access to information (Prior Action
#1), ICT reforms (Prior Action #2), unemployment programs (Prior Actions #5 and #6), and
corporate governance of banks (Prior Action #7). In the other reform areas the M&E system
remains to be put in place and/or the attention has been focused on the implementation of the
reform itself. In the regulatory simplification reform (Prior Action #4) the government was still
working on establishing the baseline at the time of the ICR. In several reform areas the indicators
were not collected by either the government or the Bank, including during the supervision
mission. In the area of employment and regulatory reform, the Bank is providing technical
assistance to help the government build an institutionalized M&E system.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

36.     The GO DPL has become de facto the first operation of a programmatic DPL series.
In November 2012, the new ‘Governance, Opportunities and Jobs’ DPL programmatic series
covering 2012 and 2013 was approved by the Board. The limited mandate of the Interim
Government (both in time and scope) did not allow a programmatic approach. However, the new
GOJ DPL series is pursuing further many of the same reform which were launched under the GO
DPL.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

37.      The GO DPL’s objectives and support were highly relevant to the country’s
circumstances and responded to Tunisia’s exceptional situation immediately after the
revolution. As articulated in the Program Document the operation constituted the core of the
Bank’s strategy to support Tunisia in the immediate post-revolution period. The operation
reflected the Bank’s global priorities and provided the coordination framework with Tunisia’s
major donors, in terms of policy dialogue, technical assistance and analytical work. Finally, the
GO DPL anticipated the potential risks well and reasonably identified appropriate mitigating
measures. Even though as anticipated in the Program Document not all the risks could be
mitigated (such that the economic recovery is taking longer than initially anticipated and social
tensions persist), the operation has made a significant contribution to stabilize the transition
process than would have otherwise been the case.

Program Design and Consistency with Government Priorities

38.      The measures supported by the DPL responded to the government’s immediate
priorities that emerged from the revolution. They were based on four main criteria: (i) being
implementable in the short-run; (ii) enhancing voice, accountability, citizen rights, and service
delivery, particularly in underserved regions and for underserved populations; (iii) preferably
having a medium-term/long-lasting impact, and /or setting the stage for needed reforms in the
medium run; and (iv) the assessment of the prior actions being able to be done easily, such as
verifying whether a law or a certain regulation has been approved. The GO DPL correctly
identified critical objectives based on these criteria and initiated key reforms that emerged from
the revolution. The design of a one-tranche operation, as well as the novelty of the reform areas
and the limited time in which to design and implement the reforms resulted in shortcomings in the
M&E system and an inability to achieve some of targets which in hindsight were too ambitious.


                                                29
Relationship with Bank Strategy

39.      The GO DPL reflected the Bank’s strategic decision to consolidate its priorities of
the immediate post-revolution Tunisia into one operation, and suspending preparation of all
other operations. The objectives of the GO DPL have subsequently been further elaborated and
remain at the core of the Bank’s new Interim Strategy Note (ISN), which was prepared after the
October 2011 elections. Hence although the GO DPL was prepared prior to the ISN, it addresses
key ISN objectives. The ISN merges the four GO DPL policy areas under the following three
pillars: (i) Laying the Foundation for Renewed Sustainable Growth and Job Creation; (ii)
Promoting Social and Economic Inclusion; and (iii) Strengthening Governance: Voice,
Transparency, and Accountability.

Complementarities with Other World Bank Activities

40.      Each of the GO DPL policy areas was accompanied by a dedicated Bank’s technical
assistance activity, as described in the table below. Given the novelty of reform areas, the
support of the Bank was critical to the successful implementation of the reforms, as the
government lacked the requisite expertise and experience in these areas. The Bank contributed to
sustaining the reforms through strong supervision and continuous ongoing activities, including by
associating various stakeholders, such as civil society and the private sector, to the reform process.
It also helped put the reforms onto a long-term path by broadening and deepening the scope and
making them sustainable and irreversible.

   underserved regions       participatory approach with CSO in Jendouba, Tataouine, and Medenine

Alignment with Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

41.      The GO DPL was explicitly aligned with the Bank’s five Good Practice Principles
on Conditionality. In accordance with these principles, the GO DPL reinforced ownership by
responding to the needs expressed by the Interim Government to carry out emblematic reforms
that signaled a rupture with past abuses. It was based on a coordinated policy matrix and
harmonized preparation and implementation with other cofinanciers. The Bank customized the
design (the first one-tranche operation in Tunisia), the loan amount, and the timing (fast track) of
the operation to the exceptional needs and context of the country. The operation was focused on
critical measures, which demonstrated the change in direction in line with the demands of the
revolution. These measures relied on a transparent monitoring process leading to predictable
performance-based financial support.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

42.      The PDOs of this program are being substantially achieved. Despite a more difficult
political, economic, and social environment than initially anticipated, overall the government has
gone considerably beyond satisfying the prior actions agreed upon at program appraisal. As
described in Section 2.3, in some cases the targets in the results framework were too ambitious
given the difficult context in Tunisia, and the short one-year horizon impedes a balanced
assessment of the progress made. Some reforms not yet fully implemented are at an advanced
stage and expected to be achieved shortly after the ICR, such as for instance the regulatory
simplification reform or the corporate governance reforms in the banking sector. More important
the M&E system does not capture well the broader progress with these reforms. For instance, the
procurement reforms have gone well beyond the first stage reforms supported by the GO DPL, as
the Government has also carried out in 2012 an in-depth assessment of its procurement system
(using the OECD/DAC methodology, and with technical assistance by the Bank) and has since
launched the implementation of a far reaching reform in line with its findings. Similarly, the
‘guillotine-style’ regulatory simplification ‘pilot’ in taxes and customs has now been extended to
an additional nine ministries dealing with private investment, which the Government is pursuing
with the support of an Advisory Project by the IFC. In addition, the evolving context for the


                                                 31
operation has resulted in changes in the scope of some reforms areas (as described in Section 1.6)
and the results are being achieved by different means than initially envisaged. For instance,
regarding social accountability mechanisms, substantial progress has been made in the monitoring
of social services by the public using a different approach than initially envisaged. Such
flexibility in pursuing the program objectives confirms the commitment of Government and
highlights the adaptability of the program to the changing context. Overall, most of the reforms
supported by the program are taking root, and in this regard, the program succeeded to engage
reforms that “break with the past? (as described in section 2.1 and section 3.5). The follow-up
programmatic DPL covering almost the same areas complements the short-term horizon the GO
DPL and will contribute to achieve its longer-term objectives. In other words, as elaborated
further below, it is expected that the rating on the PDO would be higher if it were assessed over a
longer test period (which is very short given the nature of the reforms undertaken).

43.      Governance has improved as a result of the reforms simultaneously undertaken on
several fronts. Basic governance standards are recognized and being promoted. Contrary to the
former dictatorship regime, the government is now more open and is progressively adopting a
participatory approach in key policy areas. Although governance constituted one of the program
pillars, it was also a transversal objective of the program. Most of the program components,
except for the financial sector and public procurement, promoted a consultative process in
designing reforms (ICT; regulatory simplification reform) or participative reform implementation
(access to information; employment reforms; and reforms in social sectors) by actively involving
citizens, civil society, and the private sector. As a result, the government is starting to
institutionalize a consultative process in the broader government agenda. For instance, the process
of preparation of the 2012 (and 2013) public investment budget adopted a bottom-up consultative
approach for the first time, taking into account input from local committees.

44.      The revision of the Law on Associations also brought fundamental changes to
Tunisia and a lively debate on economic policy and development issues is now the norm.
As discussed in the GO DPL Program Document, while not strictly a prior action for the GO DPL
(as politically too sensitive), as part of the DPL preparation the Bank strongly assisted the
revision of this important law to remove discretion in the registration procedures. As a result of
this reform, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks and other groups can now form
easily and participate in public life, including fostering a debate on economic and social policies.
Indeed, there has been a blossoming of such actors and a lively debate is now the norm across the
country: almost 1700 new NGOs have been registered between April 2011 and March 2012.

45.      Moreover, transparency is becoming a rule for the government. In particular, the
recognition and the promotion of the citizens’ right to access public information (Prior Action #1)
has paved the way for broad transparency and accountability - a stark contrast to the censorship
and oppression of the prior dictatorship. All of the targeted survey and data by this measure were
published, except for detailed national accounts at the 400-product level (a detailed report was
published with semi-disaggregate data), in addition to several key public finance related
documents (such as budget implementation reports, PEFA, and the annual reports of the Supreme
Audit Institution). The publication of bidding information has nearly been completed (Prior
Action #3). The government is now institutionalizing the publication of key public finance
information, including a citizen’s budget and is preparing an online open budget platform, giving
citizen’s direct access to detailed and timely public expenditure data (prior action of the next
DPL).

46.    The ICT sector, which used to be a strategic and symbolic sector of censorship and
oppression, is now being opened. The domain name reform under this program (Prior Action


                                                32
#2) has helped the growth of a lively internet space for consultation and debate at the national
level involving civil society and the private sector. Also with Bank’s assistance, the sector is
being exposed to greater competition under the next programmatic DPL. Nevertheless, as
governance is also a matter of shifting culture and behavior, some changes will require a longer
time, such as for instance restoring the citizens’ confidence in the Tunisian internet institutions
which has negatively affected the outcome of the domain name reform in the short term (Prior
Action #2).

47.     Although the simplification of formalities is yet to be finalized, the participatory
review of the procedures involving the private sector triggered more comprehensive
regulatory reforms. The Ministry of Finance completed a review of 446 formalities in the areas
of tax and customs, of which 86 percent are expected to be simplified and 7 percent are expected
to be eliminated (Prior Action #4). In parallel, a survey to assess the costs of formalities was
being launched with the assistance of the IFC. As mentioned above, the experience of this initial
reform exercise lead to broader reform efforts, as the ‘guillotine-style’ regulatory simplification
exercise been extended to an additional nine ministries dealing with private investment.

48.       The reforms in employment and regional disparities pillar suffered due to the
difficult economic and social situation. Given the severe economic downturn and social
instability, with the unemployment rate reaching 18.9 percent in 2011,8 the government’s priority
was to provide financial support to the unemployed in order to alleviate the social tensions. The
outcome indicators were affected by (a) the limited implementation of the training and coaching
components and the lack of job internships for graduate unemployed, and (b) the failure to
implement the safety net programs for low-skilled long-term unemployed. Hence, although the
program for graduate unemployed (AMAL 1) became operational, its scope became mainly
focused on the provision of cash allowances to the graduate unemployed. Due to limited
implementation of the coaching and training components, its effect on jobs creation remains
unclear. As a result, the government suspended this program, with the last beneficiaries registered
in December 2011 for one year. While its outcome in terms of training surpassed the initial target
(22,350 beneficiaries received 3 days of training, rather than the initial target of 10,000
beneficiaries receiving 2 days of training), the outcome for paid internships fell short of the initial
target (7,765 beneficiaries rather than an anticipated 50,000) because this component was not
well implemented and there were not enough internship jobs due to the slow economic recovery.
In 2012 the government has reformed the AMAL program to substantially tighten eligibility
criteria, with a view to reduce the number of beneficiaries to a more manageable level. This new
program will operate until December 2013. The safety net program for low-skilled, long-term
unemployed individuals, which was also to promote NGO participation in public works programs,
was postponed. The positive impact of this reform is the improved accountability of the National
Employment Fund. It is now effectively managed by the Ministry of Employment and Vocational
Training. A first assessment report was produced in June 2012 with the Bank’s technical
assistance, as well as the progress report of the AMAL program produced by ONEQ at the end of
2011.

49.    Reform in the financial sector made significant progress, although marginally
slower than initially planned. New rules of corporate governance in the banking sector are
being promoted. The Circular N°2011/06 of May 20, 2011, set clear rules in terms of: (i) the
appointment of board members, including the appointment of at least two independent board

 The unemployment rate has since reduced to 17.6 percent as of mid-2012, as the economic recovery takes
hold in 2012.


                                                  33
members and one minority board member for banks listed in the stock market; (ii) independence
of the internal audit committee and the creation of a risk committee, each of which to be chaired
by one of the independent board members, and with an independent reporting line to the board.
The majority of banks have already adapted their internal structure accordingly. While these rules
were initially planned to become effective by the end of June 2012, the Central Bank has since
granted banks an additional period of 6 months to conform to the Circular’s instructions and full
compliance is expected by end-2012. Furthermore, the authorities are envisaging a deeper reform
of the banking sector, in line with the 2012 FSAP recommendations. 9 In August 2012, the
government has commissioned strategic and financial audits of the three public banks in order to
consolidate their financial situation and improve their corporate governance. Similarly, the
Central Bank tightened relevant regulations in order to move towards best international practice
in banking regulation (reforms supported under the next programmatic DPL series).

50.      The accountability and transparency of social policies are improving, but the
integration of the participation of civil society and a community-based approach into
administration practices is taking longer than anticipated. The Prime Ministry conducted a
nationwide online survey regarding the general quality of 10 public services (“The Barometer of
Public Services?) in April-May 2012, through which they received feedback from approximately
9,000 citizens (Prior Action #8). The results of the survey have been published on the Prime
Ministry web-site in June 2012. It also completed a similar survey regarding the National Health
Insurance Fund (CNAM) and in-person scorecard (800 households) in June 2012. Based on the
survey results, the CNAM is increasing the number of offices and is establishing new customized
services in order to improve its services. The government is now moving to institutionalize these
participatory evaluations by mandating the internal audit body to carry these out as part of its
functions. The initial approach consisting of the institutionalization of participatory assessment
and monitoring of each public service by citizens at the local level has been transformed to a
centralized approach. The main reasons for this change are: (i) the difficulty of implementing this
reform in a decentralized way, including the weak capacity of local governments; and (ii) the
administration’s slow adaptation to citizen participation. It should be noted that in parallel to the
centralized participatory assessment, a local-level approach is also promoted, such as through the
establishment of a user feedback IT system in hospitals with the Bank’s technical assistance.
Similarly, various NGOs conducted small group participatory assessments on specific public
services deliveries (health, employment, social affairs, education) in 4 underserved governorates
that in coordination with the local governments. In order to achieve greater accountability in the
social services deliveries, the government established: (i) an auditing, evaluation, and certification
system of quality in the health sector using standards set by international accreditation bodies;
and (ii) the National Authority for the Evaluation, Quality Assurance, and Accreditation of
Higher Education (Prior Action of the next DPL). With regard to transparency, the Ministry of
Health published health indicators including expenditure and outcomes for each of the 24
governorates, whereas other social indicators (education, and social assistance) were not
published as initially planned.

51.     Outreach services to underserved regions have expanded (Prior Action #9),
although in a somewhat different manner than initially anticipated. The Ministry of Social
Affairs has recruited 100 additional social workers based in local communities, for a total of
approximately 1600 community-based social workers (a density of nearly 1 per 7000 citizens,
with plans to develop this further potentially in partnership with civil society). There are 24

 The Bank, jointly with the IMF, undertook the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in January
2012.


                                                 34
mobile teams, at 1 per governorate, that focus on addressing social exclusion, and 28 mobile
teams that provide social care including psychological, health and disability-related counseling. It
also slightly increased subsidies to NGOs that provide mobile services to disabled persons. As of
March 2012, the Ministry of Health had 89 mobile teams of personnel (medical and paramedical
workers) rotating throughout 900 primary health centers nationwide. There are 13 mobile clinics
that operate in poorer regions in 22 governorates, which include basic equipment, offer health
education at schools and universities to youth and provide selected health services free of charge,
covered by the National Social Security Fund and private health clinics. However, while each
ministry provided additional efforts to improve social services coverage to the hinterlands, there
was no institutionalization of a community-based local-level organization of a social services
package among several public services entities, as had initially been intended.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

52.      Despite wide range of reforms covered by this program, in areas that had never
been open to discussion prior to the revolution, the reforms supported by this program have
achieved tangible results. The program objectives were and remain highly relevant overall (as
described in Section 3.1). Most of the components substantially achieved their development
objectives (as described in Section 3.2), although shortcomings in the results framework suggest
that program performance has been less than satisfactory (as described in Section 2.3). The pace
of implementation of the reforms was slower than anticipated mainly due to political instability,
economic uncertainty and the difficulties in changing the practices of the administration. In this
sense, some of the reforms were overly ambitious in that they underestimated the volatile context
and short time horizon for the operation (as explained in Section 2.2). The Bank’s decision to
continue to support Tunisia through a follow-up programmatic DPL series which pursues and
deepens most of the same policy areas is sustaining the reforms program beyond the scope of the
GO DPL. This approach is expected to complete ongoing reform process and enable achievement
of higher level objective over a longer time period. It is expected that the rating on the PDO
would be improved if the assessment were to be carried out over a longer time horizon, which
would be more appropriate given the nature of the reforms undertaken. A longer time horizon
would also allow the use of higher level outcome indicators, instead of the short term indicators
used in the results framework given the short time horizon of the operation.

53.     In addition, the GO DPL has helped the transition process by helping to mobilize
the international community and to focus its support on the highest priorities of the day.
The GO DPL was the first operation in support to the “Arab Spring? and this operation sent a
clear signal to Tunisians and the international community that the Bank strongly supported
Tunisia’s transition process. The key role the Bank played in this critical immediate post-
revolution period leveraged substantial quick-disbursing resources from other development
partners to help Tunisia during the transition period and to mitigate increasing external pressures.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

54.     The poverty and social impacts of the program are positive but are limited in the
short-run. The employment program for high-skilled unemployed (AMAL) distributed cash
benefits and provided job insertion support, such as training and internships, to over 140,000
beneficiaries, of which approximately 70 percent were women, 63 percent were under 30 years


                                                35
old, and most of them had been unemployed for over 3 years. While the AMAL program is
expected to have had an insignificant impact on job insertion, the (small) cash transfer provided
(TND 200/month) contributed to alleviate poverty and social tensions. Increasing the coverage of
social services in the underserved regions will also contribute to improving social indicators, as
the hinterlands suffer from the unbalanced provision of such services.

55.      Over the medium to long term, greater accountability and transparency of public
services and administration is expected to result into improved public services efficiency,
with positive social impacts and positive effects on poverty. The reform of the National
Employment Fund is expected to improve the job insertion rate of the unemployed, including in
remote regions. The impact of the measures on social accountability in the delivery of social
services and in expanding outreach in social services should lead to the improved quality and
coverage of social services. Similarly, only in the long term, access to information is expected to
have positive social impacts by fostering a better-informed public debate on the efficiency and
effectiveness of public services. The measures on regulatory simplification, public procurement,
and banks’ corporate governance have had a limited impact thus far, but are expected to have an
indirect medium-term economic impact on households if the reforms are sustained.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

56.     This operation supported an historical change in Tunisia’s institutions. As described
in Section 3.2, the most significant changes supported were in the cross-cutting area of
governance, and most of the program components (aside from the employment pillar) helped
break away from past practices. The reforms introduced a deep change into the administration’s
practices. However in order to take root the implementation of these reforms will need to be
sustained over some time. The Bank has provided substantial support in the form of technical
assistance in each of the reform areas, as described in Section 3.1. The complementarity of the
technical assistance, and the follow-up new programmatic DPL series, should help sustain and
deepen the reforms.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative, if any)

57.      The Bank’s leadership in putting in place an excellent donors’ coordination behind
a common policy reforms matrix and following a harmonized approach helped consolidate
the government policy reforms effort. The consolidated policy reforms dialogue could be
considered an unintended benefit of the GO DPL, in terms of supporting the Tunisian government
prioritize and tackle difficult reforms. As a result, the Bank has become the leading development
partner, providing financing and policy advice based on international experience, and
coordinating the assistance of key development partners in Tunisia. These efforts also resulted in
coordinated technical assistance and projects in the areas covered by the program.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

58.     Not applicable

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Significant

59.    This rating results from the persistent uncertainty surrounding developments in
Tunisia following the January 2011 revolution. Tunisia is still transitioning to democracy. It is


                                                36
finalizing its draft Constitution, and new elections are expected to take place by mid-2013.
Tunisian perspectives remain fluid with regard to political and social instability. Concerns have
increased about violent extremist minorities and this has been associated with increasing tensions
across different groups in Tunisian society. Combined with such political tension, the economic
downturn since the revolution has created increasing social malaise. The reforms should be
regarded as an initial step towards a new more inclusive and transparent Tunisia. Their
implementation needs to be sustained in order to ensure they are irreversible. For instance, the
freedom of the media remains incomplete.10 It is therefore critical for the Bank to remain engaged
to help ensure that these important reforms are fully implemented, including through the adoption
of the required further regulatory and institutional measures to ensure their effective application.
In this regard, the adoption of a programmatic approach by the Bank for the next DPL is suited to
accompanying these reforms with longer-term perspectives by broadening and deepening their
scope. In addition, sustained technical assistance in these reforms areas will also help build the
government’s capacity to implement these sensitive reforms in the current volatile context.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

60.     The selection of the single-tranche multi-sector and multi-donor DPL instrument
and the content of the reforms program appear to have been sound. The instrument was
used to provide quick-disbursing financing and support the Interim Government in prioritizing the
adoption of a core package of emblematic reforms within its mandate and to give an immediate
response to the aspirations expressed in the January 2011 revolution. In parallel, the Bank
suspended the preparation of all new operations and decided to consolidate the key reforms into
the GO DPL operation in order to minimize the transaction costs and ensure that the efforts were
focused on the critical areas, both for the authorities and the Bank. The GO DPL operation,
therefore, reflected the Bank’s strategic engagement in supporting the transition process in
Tunisia, and it was also the first operation supporting the “Arab Spring?.

61.      Despite the short time available to prepare this operation, the task team succeeded
in identifying a package of emblematic reforms necessary to set Tunisia on a new
development trajectory. The program was designed in close cooperation with the authorities and
other development partners, taking into account both technical and political aspects to ensure the
adequacy of operation. The Bank initiated the policy dialogue in the middle of the revolution, just
a few weeks after the January 14, 2011. It carried-out various assessment missions and carried out
rapid analytical work while political demonstrations were still taking place all over the capital. As
a result of these rapidly deployed efforts, the team rightly identified critical reforms that emerged
from the revolution. In fact the policy measures have remained highly relevant despite the fluid
Tunisian political environment and continue to be pursued by the newly elected government. The


10
   Although independence of the media was not part of the reforms program supported under the GO DPL,
it provides a striking example of an incomplete governance reform. On October 17, 2012, Tunisian
journalists demonstrated and were on strike to denounce censorship and pressures from the government and
to demand the application of two decrees on the freedom of media, which were signed in November 2011
but have not yet been applied.


                                                  37
good quality of the program design is also highlighted by the fact that the policy areas and
specific reforms remained relevant in the Bank’s new Interim Strategy Note, which was prepared
after the October 2011 democratic elections, and are complemented by a follow-up programmatic
DPL adopted in November 2012.

62.     In addition to challenging aspects of the program design (such as the very rapid
preparation and the novelty of the reforms), the Bank led the large multi-donor team,
which included the key development partners of Tunisia. Due to the wide range of reforms,
each donor had multi-sectoral teams that were to be closely coordinated during the whole
preparation process, from identification to the joint appraisal mission. The Bank team was
considered to be both highly competent and constructive in their engagement with the donors (as
described in Annex 5). Despite the fact that preparing a multi-donor DPL operation is inherently
more complicated than preparing a stand-alone Bank operation, most of the measures were
common and thus jointly prepared with other donors which facilitated the task of the Interim
Government. In addition, working with other development partners meant that the overall
reforms program supported by the operation was broader than the reforms supported by the GO
DPL. By providing the overall coordination of the development partners the Bank also enabled
the accomplishment of additional reforms supported by other donors still within the framework of
the same policy dialogue (and as shown in the joint policy reforms matrix presented in Annex 3
of the GO DPL Program Document).

63.      Yet the results framework presents clear shortcomings in design and reflects
expectations that, although not unrealistic per se, were always going to be hard to meet in
full in the short timeframe for evaluation. The results framework appears inadequate to
monitor the progress achieved in the implementation of the reforms program. While this can be
attributed to the limited time available to prepare the operation, it reflects a shortcoming in the
design of the operation. It can be also argued that the program supported by the GO DPL could
have perhaps been further streamlined. Notably, the program appears too ambitious when
considering the difficult economic and socio-political situation following the revolution which
naturally impaired the implementation of deep reaching reforms in the short term. Nevertheless,
the ambition o the operation also reflects the high expectations of the immediate post-revolution
period in Tunisia. In fact in the context of the revolution the operation also served to consolidate
on the expectations raised by the population in the revolution in order to set in motion far
reaching changes in Tunisia. Also, it should be emphasized that this operation constituted almost
the entire Bank’s activities in the immediate post-revolution period in Tunisia.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

64.     The Bank carried out ongoing supervision and accompanied the implementation of
the reforms. A formal joint multi-donor supervision mission was held just three months after the
Board approval, and a follow up stocktaking exercise was carried out nine months after approval.
However, supervision focused primarily on assessing the progress in implementing reforms in
terms of the institutional and operation implementation, and failed to collect information on the
indicators and to help build the M&E system (except for the employment and regulatory reforms,
for which the Bank is providing technical assistance, including the set up of the M&E systems).
The Bank, along with other donors, reminded the government of potential problems and delays in
reform implementation (such as in access to information, the creation of an electronic registry for
domain name creation, regulatory simplification reforms, unemployment support programs, and
social policies).


                                                38
65.     In addition to the formal supervision mission, each of the reforms was accompanied
by the Bank’s technical assistance and projects. The Bank program was aligned to support the
measures introduced by the GO DPL through a series of TA activities (as described in the table in
Section 3.1), which allowed the reform implementation to be closely monitored and supported.
Hence, the Bank team was de facto involved on a continuous basis in accompanying the
implementation of these reforms. In fact, as part of their technical assistance the Bank team also
worked with government in adjusting to the orientation of some of the reform, for instance in the
areas of access to information, employment program reforms, and in introducing social
accountability tools. Coordination also proved efficient in various realms of technical assistance
and projects in several areas (including access to information, procurement, employment, the
financial sector, and social policies) provided by co-financiers of the program. The presence of
the majority of the Bank and donor teams in the field (including the TTL) facilitated close and
real time supervision of the implementation of reforms as well as donor coordination.

66.     The team has also been working on the demand side by working directly with CSOs
to inform them and sensitize them on some of the key governance reforms. As part of the
supervision missions lack of CSOs capacity was identified as one of the constraints to rapid
implementation of some of the governance reforms, notably access to information and social
accountability mechanisms. Hence the Bank DPL team sponsored and helped organize the
National CSOs Forum in May 2012, which brought together more than 200 NGOs from across
the country and included discussion / briefing sessions on Access to Information and on new
Social Accountability mechanisms in Tunisia.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

67.      The design of the GO DPL operation was satisfactory and supervision was also
satisfactory. Correspondingly, the overall Bank performance is rated as Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

68.     Despite political uncertainty and inter-ministerial coordination challenges inherent
in the change of political system, the government was actively engaged in the design of the
operation, but relaxed its efforts after the Board approval. The government was aware of the
need to demonstrate to the population that the administration practices have changed since the
revolution. However the many challenges facing the government resulted into a limited focus on
the implementation of the reforms, despite the donors repeated efforts to raise these challenges to
the government’s attention. In a few areas, particularly in regulatory reform, the changes in
leadership due to a change of government/ministers affected the pace of reform implementation.
During the 6 months following the approval in June 2011, the Interim Government and then the
new government after the October 2011 elections, relaxed the efforts in the implementation of the
reforms and the progress has been mainly the result of the persistent efforts by the Bank and
donors to accompany the implementation on the ground. The focus on the reforms program
increased back during the preparation of the new programmatic DPL series, which pursues and
deepens many of the same policy areas. Overall, the program successfully initiated reforms that
the government would not have been able to undertake alone in such a context. The appropriation


                                                39
of the reforms by the newly elected government took longer than initially anticipated, as
described in Section 2.2, but given the difficult circumstances, the Government provided
remarkable efforts to implement the reforms program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.      While an initial good inter-ministerial coordination allowed efforts in designing and
implementing reforms to be made, the irregular follow–up since the Board approval
delayed the pace of reform implementation. There is still a lack of a centralized coordination
and monitoring mechanism, even under the new DPL series, and this poses a risk for the
successful implementation of the reforms. While in part this can be attributed to the difficult
domestic situation and the multiplicity of challenges facing the government, nevertheless it
impaired the achievement of the objectives under the program. Further, the institutional changes
in the structure of government exacerbated the lack of clear responsibility for coordinating the
program. The implementing agency at the time of the program appraisal and during the initial
implementation phase was the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation. The Planning
Department was initially in charge of the reform contents, and the institutional counterpart was
International Cooperation. After the elections of October 2011, that Ministry was divided into
two ministries: the Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation and the Ministry of
Regional Development and Planning. The Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation
became the official counterpart of the program, but the final responsibility of reform monitoring
and coordination remained unclear, since this would normally be attended by the Ministry of
Planning. In fact prior to the revolution, the Planning Department (within the Ministry of
Planning) was in charge of preparing the government’s five-year plan, which was a translation of
the Presidential program, and thus had the authority to oversee the government’s development
agenda, including the reforms. As a result, at the time of the ICR, no single structure was able to
provide a complete picture of the progress and outcomes of the GO DPL reform implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

70.    The government performed moderately satisfactorily, and the implementing agencies
performed moderately satisfactorily. Correspondingly, the overall Borrower performance is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

71.      Multi-sector multi-donor DPLs are an effective instrument to consolidate the policy
dialogue, which is especially valuable in a transition environment. The positive experience of
the 2011 GO DPL reflects to a large extent the fact that the operation facilitated a process to
consolidate and prioritize the policy dialogue, which brought together the various ministries into a
single dialogue with the main development partners. The operation also facilitated a centralized
coordination of the reform program on the government side. This feature is especially valuable in
a situation of transition, where the government has limited capacity to implement reforms and has
to focus on a core set of priorities.

72.    The Bank’s bold and strategic decision to focus its program in the immediate
aftermath of the revolution has helped accomplish significant results in Tunisia in a very


                                                40
short time. The decision by the Country Management Unit to consolidate the Bank’s support to
Tunisia in the immediate post-revolution period into a single multi-sector DPL operation has been
very successful. The Bank helped accomplish far reaching development results in a very short
time by being focused. This worked in several ways which reinforced each other. First,
consolidating the Bank’s financing support into a single high profile operation helped signal the
Bank’s strong engagement in the immediate post-revolution phase, and helped mobilize the
international community in supporting the country. This resulted in preparation of a joint budget
support program by Tunisia’s main development partners and close coordination of technical
assistance and analytical activities, thereby maximizing synergies, consolidating the policy
dialogue and reducing transaction costs for the government. Secondly, it also cemented the
Bank’s leadership in supporting the transition process. Further, this privileged relationship in
supporting the new Tunisian authorities has been cemented following the October 2011 elections,
with great benefit to the Bank’s development effectiveness. Thirdly, the multi-sector DPL
consolidated the country team around a core set of reforms, which subsequently also enabled
technical assistance activities to be fully aligned with the DPL supported policy dialogue and help
achieve development outcomes.

73.      That said, the reforms program supported by the GO DPL was perhaps overly
ambitious, given institutional capacity constraints. The underlying objective of the reforms
supported by the GO DPL was to set in motion profound changes in society to respond to the
aspirations expressed in the revolution. Therefore a trade-off existed at the design stage between
the risks of not fully implementing the reforms within the program period and the need to lay out
an ambitious reform program to respond to the exceptional circumstances. Such a tradeoff should
have been recognized and made explicit at the design stage.

74.     Single-tranche DPL operations are not well suited for ambitious institutional
reforms. While this operation faced an exceptional context with the short-term perspective and
limited mandate of the Interim Government at the appraisal stage, a programmatic approach is
more appropriate to support long-term reform with a sustained pace. Also the novelty of the
reforms made it difficult to reach certain overambitious targets in such a short time (one year).
This problem has been addressed by the fact that the Bank program has been adjusted to support
the implementation of these reforms and also that the CMU decided to pursue the preparation of a
follow-up programmatic DPL series covering most of the same policy areas.

75.     An efficient government coordination mechanism with strong leadership and clear
responsibility is critical to monitor and sustain the implementation of an ambitious reforms
program. Particularly for a complex multi-sectoral operation, good inter-ministerial coordination
is necessary to monitor and solve implementation issues in a timely manner. The top-down
management of the pre-revolution government had indeed been able to efficiently manage the
reforms process, as the structure in charge had had enough power to coordinate and, if necessary,
bring certain issues to the Cabinet level. The Government and development partners should seek
to establish a stronger institutional mechanism to effectively monitor future reforms
implementation.

76.     Technical assistance is critical, especially in new policy areas where the government
does not have expertise/experience and where an innovative approach is required to change
administrative practices. The Bank’s technical assistance to each of the reform measure helped
(i) implement the reforms by providing necessary expertise; (ii) sustain the reforms through
continuous support to materialize institutional reforms; and (iii) broaden and deepen the reforms
through complementary activities, including consultation and involvement of stakeholders (civil



                                                41
society, private sector) and by helping to build a long-term reform path. The combined efforts
between the GO DPL and technical assistance led to the more ambitious next programmatic DPL.

77.     A quality M&E framework is needed to effectively assess the progress and outcomes
of reforms. Arguably the main shortcoming of the GO DPL was the low quality of several of the
outcome indicators identified at the design stage. This highlights the importance to ensure that (i)
all baseline data is collected prior to project effectiveness; and (ii) updated information is
collected for all indicators, no matter how successful the reform is. Spending enough time upfront
on the development of the monitoring system, including the selection of indicators, will help
build an effective reform monitoring mechanism. Indicators should be selected based on their
relevance and measurability, and in as much as possible should anticipate possible risks
/adjustments required in the implementation of the reforms.

78.      The location of the TTL and most of the team in the field, particularly for a complex
operation involving other co-financiers based in the field, is essential to efficiently and
continuously interact with the authorities and donors. Most of the team members for this
operation, including the TTL, were based in Tunis, which allowed for real-time contact with both
the government and development partners. The TTL’s and team members’ physical presence and
interaction were a key factor in the success of the operation and cooperation with the other co-
financiers.

Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders


The following is based on interviews with staff involved in the operation as co-
financiers in the field.

The operation was co-financed by the African Development Bank (US$500 million), the
European Union (Euro 90 million in two tranches, in the form of a grant) and the French
Development Agency (Euro 185 million in two tranches). All of the parties used the same
matrix, with each agency disbursing against its own choice of actions in the matrix.
Disbursement decisions were made individually, but there was a joint assessment of
progress against the actions in the matrix. The supervision mission as well as the
completion mission was undertaken jointly. 11 Staff from each of the co-financing
agencies participated in the design of the over-arching matrix, which defined the program.
Donors felt that the matrix appropriately reflected their priorities, most of, but not all of
which, were shared by the Bank. The resulting matrix appropriately summarized the
collective priorities of the group.

All cofinanciers unanimously highly appreciated the Bank’s ability to lead the donor
group. In particular, the quality and rapidity of technical analysis undertaken prior to the
program design were regarded as a critical base from which to begin the policy dialogue
during the identification stage. One donor regretted that the other donors were not
involved at this stage, during which technical analysis was undertaken and discussed with
the authorities. It felt that this situation left little room for other donors to share in
leadership of the operation. Nevertheless, it also recognized that the Bank’s strong
leadership was necessary to complete the preparation of ambitious reforms on such a fast
track. All cofinanciers unanimously appreciated the Bank’s lead in coordinating donors’
technical assistance in the reform areas. One donor regretted that this coordination, which
was strongly in place during the initial phase, has gradually faded.

The co-financiers regarded the World Bank’s involvement as positive and felt that the
engagement by the team was constructive and collaborative. The Aide Memoires
detailing the conclusions of the appraisal and supervision missions were joint Aide
Memoires, involving all of the co-financiers, testifying to the close cooperation and
ensuring a common assessment of outstanding issues and progress. There was one formal
supervision of the program in September 2011, but with co-financiers based in the field
and the Bank’s TTL also based in the field, supervision was essentially continuous.
