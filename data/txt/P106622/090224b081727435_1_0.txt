                         prevention interventions targeted at high risk groups and for the general population (ii) increasing of access to treatment, care and support services for infected and

                         1. The National AIDS Program continues to make progress in treatment and prevention with three out of four indicators under the Treatment Component already achieved. With one
                         indicator “Number of men, women & children with advanced HIV receiving antiretroviral combination therapy according to national guidelines? surpassing the target. A total of 9167
                         people are currently under ARV treatment, surpassing the target of 9,000. As a result of the expansion of the treatment program, mortality due to AIDS has continued to decline.

                         Outreach programs to Most at Risk Populations (MARPs) have expanded and have shown some positive results. The Project has increased outreach programs to MARPs,
                         particularly to sex workers (SWs). HIV prevalence among female SWs declined from 9 % to 4.1 % in 2011. The number of SWs and Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) reached
                         through prevention activities increased to 34,510 and 19,922 respectively. The percent of SWs reporting condom use with their most recent client reached 88 % in 2011, and 76 % of
                         SWs who received HIV testing in the last 12 months know their results, surpassing the 50 % target.

                         2. The Project has mixed results on Performance Indicators: 11 of the 19 indicators were achieved, of which 9 surpassed the original targets. However, 5 indicators have not reached
                         targets, 2 are in progress; and 1 is under review. Among the 5 indicators not reaching their targets, 2 are Project Development Objective indicators (young people using condom last
                         time had sex, people expressing accepting attitudes towards people living with HIV).

                         3. New evidence from the 2012 Knowledge, Attitudes, Practices and Beliefs (KAPB) Survey indicates that the prevention programs have not produced intended results. Risk
                         behavior appears to be increasing. Compared with the 2008 baseline data, condom use among young people aged 15-24 decreased. Only 45 percent of young women report
                         condom use with a non-regular partner in 2012 versus 66.3 % in 2008, though the MoH is still verifying the survey methodology and its compatibility with the previous survey.
