                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The project development objectives are to assist in the implementation of the Government➢? s national HIV/AIDS program through support to: (i) deepening of
                         prevention interventions targeted at high risk groups and for the general population (ii) increasing of access to treatment, care and support services for infected and
                         affected individuals; (iii) strengthening of program management and analysis to identify priorities for strengthening the health sector capacity to respond to the HIV/
                         AIDS epidemic and other priority health problems.

                         Increased access to HIV testing and expansion of ART treatment has resulted in a reduction of mother to child transmission of HIV from 10 percent in 2006 to less than 5 percent in
                         2010 and the mortality due to AIDS decreased from 24.69 deaths/100,000 population to 12.34 deaths/100,000 population. The number of infants receiving Prevention of Mother to
                         Child Transmission (PMTCT) has also increased from 87 percent in 2005 to 98 percent in 2008- 2010. The NSP has increasingly focused on the most at risk populations (MARPs)
                         and interventions are refined based on evidence and information obtained from the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system. The National HIV program has made significant

                         progress in reaching commercial sex workers (CSWs). The percent of CSWs reporting condom use with their most recent client has reached 97 percent and 75 percent of CSWs
                         who received HIV testing in the last 12 months know their results, surpassing the 50 percent target.

                         However, stigma and discrimination against men having sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica poses a major challenge in bringing prevention and treatment services to this group. The
                         HIV prevalence rate among MSM remains at around 32 percent from 2007 to 2011. The recent survey on MSM indicates that the HIV incidence rate among MSM was 6 percent.
                         This information provides evidence to support the NHP to prioritize the prevention and treatment effort to target MSM. More effective prevention interventions need to be identified to
                         reach MSM.

                         Furthermore, the 2008 National Knowledge, Attitudes, Behavior and Practices (KABP) Survey shows that high awareness and knowledge about HIV have not translated into behavior
                         change. Multiple sexual partnerships are widespread among adult men and women, transactional sex is quite common among young women, and condom use is inconsistent. The
                         age at the initiation of sexual activities for females is getting younger.

                         The 22nd Annual Review concluded that the NHP needs to assess past efforts in prevention including behavior change communication and identify effective prevention measures
                         that have worked. To expand prevention efforts in reaching MARPs, the National Program has to engage more civil society organizations.

                         Another major challenge faced by the Jamaica HIV Program is how to sustain the National Response to HIV. The 2007-2012 NSP has largely depended on donor financing. The
                         Bank loan is scheduled to close on November 30, 2012; the Global Fund grant will close by July 31, 2013 and the USAID/PEPFAR program will end by September 30, 2014. Future
                         donor financing is likely to decline. The Bank team and other development partners are working with the Government to develop strategies on how to sustain the national response on
                         HIV/AIDS.
