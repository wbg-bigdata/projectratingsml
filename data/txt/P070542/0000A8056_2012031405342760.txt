                         The objective of this project is to contribute to the improvement of the health status of the population by: (a) increasing the accessibility and the quality of health
                         services; and (b) assisting the Kingdom of Cambodia to implement its Health Sector Strategic Plan and strengthen the sector's capacity to manage resources efficiently.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is the final ISR. Health Sector Support Project (HSSP1) closed on December 31, 2011, following a one-year extension to allow completion of remaining civil works, all other
                         activities that were financed by HSSP1 were transferred to Second Health Sector Support Program (HSSP2) since April1, 2009. As noted below, most civil works were completed by
                         the closing date, but completion of remaining construction for Preah Vihear Referral Hospital, the National Drug Quality Control Laboratory, and 12 Health Centers will be financed by
                         HSSP2 Pooled Fund from January 1, 2012. The MOH commissioned an independent evaluation of HSSP1 in 2010, which concluded that the Project had substantially met its

                         The overall progress toward the development objective is rated moderately satisfactory, based on substantial progress toward reaching most of PDO indicators and implementation
                         result indicators, which contributed to substantial progress on improving accessibility, coverage and quality of services; substantial progress toward assisting RGC in implementing its
                         HSP1 and HSP2, and modest progress toward strengthening sector capacity to manage resources efficiently. At the sector level, progress has been substantial in terms of improved

                         health outcomes and MDGs. The country already has met the Cambodia MDG 4 (CMDG 4) and the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) targets for child mortality reduction
                         for 2015. Between 2000 and 2010, under-5 and infant mortality rate declined from 124 and 95 per 1,000 live births to 54 and 45 per 1,000 live births, respectively. Between 2005 and
                         2010, the maternal mortality ratio declined from 472 deaths per 100,000 live births to an estimated 206 deaths per 100,000 live births (CDHS 2010) due in part to dramatic increase in
                         skilled birth attendance and facility-based deliveries. In addition, fertility rates declined from 4.0 in 2000 to 3.0 in 2010, while modern contraceptive prevalence increased to 35% in
                         2010, although short of the CMDG target of 44% for 2010. Despite this impressive progress, Cambodia remains off track for nutrition-related targets of the CMDG 1 and the NSDP.
                         Cambodia has the 13th highest prevalence of stunted children in the world, and the highest in the region. The 2010 CDHS found that 28% of children are underweight, with no
                         improvement since 2005. Moreover, the percentage of wasted children has increased slightly since 2005. The rate of stunting in children from the poorest households is 51.1%
                         compared to 23.1% for children from the richest households. Food insecurity for the poor; inadequate child feeding (76% of children do not receive appropriate feeding), hygiene and
                         sanitation practices, and inadequate access/utilization of health services for childhood diseases and acute malnutrition contribute to the significant proportion of under nutrition in
                         young children.

                         Despite impressive results achieved in the area of HIV/AIDS, Cambodia is among the countries hardest hit by the epidemic in the region, with 0.7% of adults affected in 2010,
                         compared to 1.8% in 2003. HSSP1 was the primary source of financing for dengue during the implementation period. The case fatality rate for dengue has declined significantly
                         during Project implementation from 1.2% between 2002-2007 to 0.3% in 2009 and 2010.

                         Throughout the project lifespan, the World Bank credit financed the construction and renovation of 44 health centers and health posts, mostly in remote areas, (of which 32 had been
                         completed and other 12 are expected to be completed by the end of quarter one 2012); 7 referral hospitals (6 of them had been completed); the construction of the training center for
                         the National Malaria Control Program and the Information Center for the National Center for HIV/AIDS and Dermatology and STD (had been completed), and the construction of the
                         National Laboratory for Drug Quality Control (under progress). The contract for construction supervision was amended on June 13, 2011 to expand the supervision to cover the
                         construction of 12 health centers in six provinces after contracts for the construction signed in early June 2011. Medical equipment have been supplied and installed at Referral
                         Hospital Ochrov, Stung Treng and Kampot, and these three hospitals are fully operational.
