1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
In 2002, Cambodia had the second highest poverty level (36%) in South-East Asia. Health
indicators from 1997 were among the worst in the region, with a maternal mortality ratio of 900
per 100,000 live-births, under-five mortality rate of 115 per 1,000 live-births , and a stunting rate
of 53% among children under five. Cambodia was assessed as not being on track to achieve
most of the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Health Sector Support
Project (HSSP) appraisal team identified communicable diseases (particularly tuberculosis,
malaria and HIV/AIDS), malnutrition, and maternal and reproductive health issues as the main
contributors to the burden of disease in Cambodia.

Key sectoral issues identified at appraisal were: low levels of public spending on health, with 82-
84% of total health expenditure coming from out-of-pocket payments; high dependence on
donors and non-government organizations (NGOs); low quality of services by both public and
private providers; insufficient access to health services for the poor; 88% of public spending
being allocated to administrative and training costs; severe capacity constraints; distortions in
geographic distribution of health personnel and facilities; inequitable utilization of services; and
problems with drug quality, prescription and dispensing practices.

From the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Health (MOH) with donor support had piloted various
models to improve service delivery and quality, increase salaries and protect the poor from the
burden of health care costs. While some models were considered successful, their sustainability
remained in doubt.

HSSP was designed and financed by the International Development Association (IDA), the
Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the UK
Department for International Development (DFID). After inception they were joined by the
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The project had joint review mechanisms and a
number of common management arrangements. MOH dubbed this a Sector Wide Management
(SWiM) approach, the first step towards a sector-wide approach (SWAp) in Cambodia.

In 2002, MOH had prepared the Health Sector Strategic Plan 2003-2007 (HSP1). This was its
first attempt to prepare an overall sector strategy and provided a clear framework for HSSP.
HSP1 called for implementing Sector Wide Management (SWiM) to establish a common vision
and effective partnership among all stakeholders.. HSSP adopted this policy direction of SWiM
throughout its implementation process. Under the HSSP design, the World Bank supported
activities in 12 provinces, while the ADB project supported the remaining nine largest provinces.
Activity design was the same in all provinces. Both the WB and ADB provided support to MOH
at national level.
1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) (as approved)
The objective of HSSP was to contribute to the improvement of the health status of the
Cambodian population, particularly the poor and rural population through: (a) increasing the
accessibility, quality and affordability of health services; and (b) assisting the Kingdom of


                                                 1
Cambodia to implement its Health Sector Strategic Plan 2003-2007 and strengthen the sector's
capacity to carry out the health sector reform and to manage health sector resources efficiently. 1

The project’s specific objectives were to:
     (i) develop affordable quality health services with emphasis on primary health care and
           first referral services in rural areas;
    (ii) increase the utilization of health services by the poor;
   (iii) mitigate the effects of infectious disease epidemics and of malnutrition; and
   (iv) improve the health sector’s capacity and performance.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The PDO was not revised during the implementation of this project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
HSSP aimed to benefit all residents in the 12 provinces where it provided support. The rural poor,
including ethnic minorities, were expected to benefit especially from activities in primary health
care, infectious disease control, preventive health, and the treatment and prevention of
malnutrition. Affordability of health services for the poor would be improved. The PAD did not
indicate the expected numbers of beneficiaries in the 12 provinces, however.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
Improved Delivery of Health Services – focused on access, quality and affordability. Support
included development of primary health care facilities and referral hospitals (at district and
provincial levels) by financing civil works, equipment and maintenance. Project design also
planned support for training to improve service quality, establishment of a Quality
Improvement/Standards Unit in MOH, and quality assurance activities in three districts of
Kampong Thom province. Other activities to be supported were: performance-based contracting
for district health services, activities to increase user participation in decision-making, health
equity funds (HEFs) to pay for services provided to the poor, and improvement of drug quality
and availability.

Improved Programs Addressing Public Health Priorities – focused on infectious disease control,
(mainly malaria, tuberculosis, dengue and STI/HIV/AIDS) and nutrition. For malaria, support
included the provision of insecticide treated bed-nets, training for better case management,
improved surveillance, and information, education and communication (IEC) activities. TB
control activities included integration of TB activities at the HC and district hospital levels,
increasing case detection and reducing default rates, improving laboratory capacity and
strengthening IEC. For dengue control, the activities included strengthening early diagnosis,
appropriate treatment and vector control. For STI/HIV/AIDS, the project supported procurement

                                                      2
of drugs and 100% condom use among high risk groups. For nutrition, financing included
training, information campaigns, and community outreach to support an essential package of
preventive and curative services, e.g. exclusive breast-feeding up to 6 months, timely and
adequate complementary feeding from 6 to 24 months, appropriate care of sick and malnourished
children, micro-nutrient supplementation for women and children, and increased availability of
iodized salt.

Strengthened Institutional Capacity – provided support to key functions at central, provincial
and district levels. This included oversight of policy, improving the legislative and regulatory
framework, better sector planning and program coordination (specifically improving MOH
analytical capacity for health financing, planning capacity at provincial and district levels and
coordination and monitoring of plan implementation). The component planned to improve
sectoral management, including human resource planning and management, improvement of
skills and performance, strengthening financial management systems and capacity, and
recruitment of procurement consultants. The component sought to improve monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) capacity, including surveillance of health service delivery outside the public
sector, and the use of data to inform health sector governance and planning (see Annex 1 for
component costs).

1.6 Revised Components
Project components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes
The original closing date of the IDA credit financing was June 30, 2007. The project was
extended to June 30, 2008, and then to December 31, 2010. Most activities, other than civil
works, were completed by early 2009, when the Second Health Sector Support Project (HSSP2)
began. In December 2010, the Bank approved a third and final one-year extension of the closing
date for HSSP to December 31, 2011, and a reallocation of unspent IDA funds from categories of
goods, training and incremental operating costs to the category of civil works. These changes
enabled the project to complete construction activities that had been subject to delays.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Background analysis – Preparation of HSSP took account of both the prior experience of the
World Bank and other donors in the health sector. Analytic work undertaken during project
preparation included analyses of poverty and health; review of mechanisms to improve equity of
access to health services; beneficiary and social assessments, including for indigenous peoples.
MOH prepared a number of strategic documents, including HSP1, a medium term expenditure
framework, and various disease control strategies. The design correctly identified the major
disease burdens in the country, weaknesses in health system management and monitoring, issues
of accessibility and coverage, and the problem of access for the poor following the introduction
of user fees in 1996. Prior donor support was fragmented, and individual projects implemented
without regard to overlap or duplication. There was limited cooperation between donors. HSP1

                                               3
provided a sector framework for donors to support and HSSP closely aligned with this. At the
time donor support to the sector was modest, so HSSP enabled significant expansion of health
services and geographic coverage.

Project design – HSSP was prepared in parallel with the preparation of HSP1, which facilitated
alignment of project design with MOH strategic priorities. In keeping with the SWIM approach
adopted by HSP1, donor partners financing HSSP harmonized among themselves (ADB, DFID,
UNFPA and, WB) by joining common management arrangements and agreed to rely on the
MOH systems for planning, program implementation, monitoring and reporting. While funds
were not pooled among HSSP donor partners, the World Bank managed DfID contributions
through a Trust Fund arrangement. The HSP1 monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework
was not finalized when the project was negotiated, however, and some indicators included in the
PAD did not have clearly defined baselines, targets, or means to collect data. A clearer hierarchy
of objectives and more logical linkage to the components would have led to a better monitoring
framework.
The project was not expected to have a PMU, but instead to strengthen MOH implementation
capacity prior to Credit and Grant effectiveness and during the implementation, with the
Planning Department in the MOH responsible for coordinating project activities. The MOH
subsequently decided to establish a PMU (HSSP Secretariat) as a transition arrangement, with a
team of consultants working under the management of the Project Director (an MOH Under
Secretary of State), and a Project Coordinator (a Deputy Director General for Health).

Government commitment – MOH prepared the HSP1 through a participatory process with
donors and NGOs, following a sector review to identify key problems. A number of planning
and policy documents to support it had been prepared, as well as a health coverage plan for
infrastructure development and a health workforce plan. MOH also committed to developing
comprehensive annual plans and budgets, linked to three-year rolling plans (3YRPs). Thus the
signals in favor of HSSP were strong. The Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) had also
shown strong support for the SWiM approach, through the HSP1 and subsequently through
endorsing the 2003 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.

Risk assessment – the HSSP design identified risks to implementation and to longer term
sustainability. The overall risk rating was ‘substantial’. Major risk areas were financial
management capacity, political will for reform, planning capacity, commitment to human
resource development, low government salaries, slow release of government funds, and weak
lateral cooperation within MOH. Specific and overall risk assessments were sound and
mitigation strategies were both feasible and appropriate.

Quality at Entry Assessment. In June 2003, the World Bank’s Quality Assurance Group
undertook an independent Quality at Entry assessment of HSSP. Quality at Entry was rated as
fully satisfactory with respect to strategic relevance and approach; technical, financial, and
economic aspects; poverty and social aspects; but rated marginally satisfactory for environment,
fiduciary, implementation arrangements, and risk assessment. The overall Quality at Entry
rating was marginally satisfactory. The panel praised the relevance and technical quality of the
design, but noted that a number of key issues were left to be address during initial
implementation (e.g., project staffing and incentive issues; arrangements for DfID cofinancing;

                                                4
arrangements for routine monitoring; and an excessive number of project legal covenants), which
contributed to delays in project effectiveness. 2

2.2 Implementation
External factors – two major external factors affected implementation. From 2004, the Global
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) began supporting programs in
Cambodia, with high levels of funding going to combating TB, malaria and HIV/AIDS. These
were three of the four key diseases being addressed by HSSP (dengue being the fourth). The
large volume of GFATM money reduced the importance of HSSP support, especially for malaria
and HIV. MOH therefore agreed to re-focus HSSP financing on gaps in GFATM support rather
than pursue its original scope. HSSP remained the major source of funding for dengue.

In 2006-07, there was a rapid escalation of costs for materials used in civil works, especially
cement and steel used for reinforcement. Most construction contracts were fixed price. While
some contractors were able to absorb the price increases, others faced losses. Construction of the
provincial hospital in Preah Vihear province was most affected, with construction stopping and
the contractor taking legal action against MOH. Several other contracts (mostly for HCs) were
cancelled prior to contract award, because the proposed contract costs were substantially higher
than estimated costs. The contract for this hospital and the canceled contracts had to be
repackaged and re-tendered.

Government policy issues – After the detection of irregularities in procurement in ministries
other than MOH, the government mandated the use of an Independent Procurement Agent (IPA)
for all ministries in WB-funded projects. The first IPA proved unsatisfactory and slow
recruitment of a second IPA contributed to further delays in the procurement of goods and civil
works. The implementation of the government’s public financial management reform, including
procurement reform, has been subject to persistent delays, which undermined efforts to build
national capacity to shift toward country systems.

The Ministry of Economics and Finance (MEF) had prepared standard operating procedures for
financial management and procurement at the start of HSSP and revised these in 2007. These
had a positive impact on project implementation by providing clear guidance and delineating
procedures that had previously not been formalized. Release of government funds from the
national budget by MEF was sometimes slow, especially in the first quarter of the financial year,
causing the timeframe for some activities to shift.

MOH policy support – The preparation of HSP1 and the subsequent Health Strategic Plan 2008-
2015 were crucial in providing a strong and clear framework for donor support and were keys to



2
  The QAG panel commented, “…despite an important amount of good work on the project, the project was in many
ways not ready for implementation at the time it was taken to the Board….Given the long delay in effectiveness, the
critical staffing and incentive issues, and the project development activities still to be undertaken, the panel believes
that it will be difficult to implement the project on the timetable that was planned.? With respect to M&E, the panel
noted that “…the baseline survey was excellent and the outcome indicators are best practice, although some of the
important details of M&E are still to be worked out.? The overall subrating for M&E was satisfactory, however.

                                                           5
the success of HSSP. MOH’s decision to establish a Project Management Unit to directly
manage project activities, however, meant that HSSP’s aim of integration into MOH systems
was only partly successful. MOH’s facilitation of the joint review missions with the WB, ADB,
DFID and UNFPA, and development of integrated Annual Operational Plans, helped to
strengthen the SWiM approach and to lay the groundwork for the pooled funding and
harmonized implementation approach in HSSP2.

Mid-term review – a mid-term review was conducted in October 2006, with participation of
MOH, the World Bank, ADB, DFID and UNFPA, and AusAID staff joined the mission as
observers. HSSP M&E framework was updated during this MTR to align to the extent possible
with the M&E framework of HSP1. The MTR acknowledged weaknesses in the original M&E
framework for the project, and updated the key Project indicators, which were aligned with
HSP2 indicators and targets and tracked in subsequent ISRs (see Annex 2). The review endorsed
a one-year extension of the project to June 2008, but did not recommend formal restructuring:
Bank policy at that time did not require restructuring when updating project monitoring
frameworks, if key indicators were not included in the legal agreement.

Actions in response to problems – From 2005, the World Bank deployed a Senior Health
Specialist and a national staff to work on the Project at country level. This was supported by two
more positions (one national, one international) in the transition to HSSP2. This increased
country presence had a positive impact on the speed and quality of problem solving and
strengthened relationships with both MOH and the partners. In response to procurement
challenges across the portfolio, the Bank arranged for a senior procurement specialist to work
half-time in Cambodia, supported by a procurement analyst based in Bangkok. This contributed
to progress in resolving the procurement difficulties facing the project. Issues of financial
management and disbursement of funds were addressed directly and promptly by MEF, MOH
and the PMU, but sometimes wider government policies and processes contributed to
implementation bottlenecks (e.g. government-wide restrictions on payment of per diems). HSSP
linked well to wider World Bank support for public sector financial reform, providing
information on specific issues encountered by the project.

Delays in civil works were due to a number of factors, including: price escalation of
construction materials, resulting in re-bidding of contracts when contractors abandoned a site or
when proposed award prices were substantially higher than estimates; MOH’s decision to move
the site of the national drug quality control laboratory to a new location; and a lack of market
interest in small value contracts. These issues took time to resolve, leading to three project
extensions and the eventual transfer of some civil works to HSSP2.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The M&E design was based on a strong foundation of analytic work and household surveys, but
finalization of the framework for routine monitoring was left for initial implementation. The
PAD proposed 23 core performance indicators to monitor project performance, of which nine
key performance indicators were to be collected annually. Because the overall HSP1 sector
monitoring framework still was not finalized, the PAD did not specify baselines or targets for



                                                6
these indicators, and the 23 Core Performance Indicators were not thoroughly checked for
matches with available data sources 3. Among the nine key performance indicators, two required
special surveys (malnutrition and patient satisfaction), and one was difficult to measure (% of
population with access to minimum package of activities at health center level – although the
number of HCs providing the minimum package of activities was monitored). The classification
of the Core Performance Indicators into ‘sector indicators’, ‘outcomes’, ‘outputs’ and ‘inputs’
did not always follow accepted definitions of these terms. The expectation that data could be
disaggregated by ethnicity was not based on government policy or available data sources.

M&E implementation – The project monitoring framework was updated periodically, initially
following finalization of the results framework for the Health Strategic Plan, and subsequently
based on f data from Cambodia DHS 2005; and the Project midterm review and sectorwide Joint
Annual Performance Review in 2006. Following the MTR, a consistent set of 16 indicators, four
development outcome indicators and other 12 intermediate outcome indicators, were used and
updated routinely in ISRs. The Annual updates of Health Strategic Plan 2008-2015 monitoring
indicators led to changes of definition of some indicators and adoption of new indicators, but the
team sought to maintain consistency in reporting on key Project indicators agreed at MTR. The
joint annual sector performance reviews provided an opportunity to review progress on all HSP1
indicators, however.

With respect to evaluation, a range of reviews, evaluations, and surveys were commissioned by
the government, WB and by other partners. These included the Cambodia Demographic and
Health Surveys (2005 and 2010) and the Cambodia Socioeconomic Survey (2004, 2007, 2009);
independent midterm reviews of HSP1, including a SWiM review; a Health Public Expenditure
Tracking Survey (2008), impact evaluation and reviews of performance contracting; several
evaluations of health equity funds; and various program evaluation (e.g., comprehensive
midwifery review). In addition, the MOH commissioned in 2010 an independent final evaluation
of HSSP1 (AGEG-Domrei 2010).

M&E utilization –HSSP support to strengthen the Health Management Information System
(HMIS) in MOH improved data quality and timeliness, which continued under HSSP2. HMIS
data were regularly used in annual planning workshops and annual joint reviews of progress by
MOH, donors and NGOs. Use of data by provinces, operational districts and health facilities
improved during implementation – for example, health facilities now post monthly progress on
key indicators near the entrance of the facility. Data from the CDHS and the Cambodia
Socioeconomic Survey were used to assess progress towards the MDGs; analyze health spending
and service utilization by the poor, as well as for broader policy development and decision
making. The various program reviews and evaluations informed policy decisions and follow up
actions by government and partners.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
HSSP1 design triggered safeguards related to environment, pest management, indigenous
peoples, and involuntary resettlement. With respect to environmental safeguards, the MOH
adopted a medical waste management plan, which was monitored by a Bank environmental


3
    See Annex 2 for data tables covering the KPIs, Core Performance Indicators, and additional indicators tracked in the ISRs.

                                                                  7
specialist on at least an annual basis. National guidelines on infection control were developed,
trainings were conducted for health staff at all levels of health care system, medical waste were
properly segregated before disposal, safety boxes were used for collecting sharp waste; and
incinerators were constructed as part of facility construction or upgrading. All insecticides
financed by the Project were prequalified by WHO. An assessment of environmental and health
impact was undertaken prior to the construction of the National Laboratory Quality Control
Laboratory. With respect to social safeguards, an indigenous people consultation was done as
required by the Project. The Bank and MOH collaborated on a sample verification of compliance
with resettlement safeguards, which were found to be satisfactory. Overall safeguards ratings
varied between ‘moderately satisfactory’ and ‘satisfactory’. The final overall rating was
‘moderately satisfactory’, with 3 of the 4 safeguards being rated ‘satisfactory’ and one
(indigenous peoples) rated ‘moderately satisfactory’ due to modest progress in strengthening the
overall MOH indigenous peoples policy framework.

Financial management monitoring was discussed at every Project Joint Review Mission and
recorded in aide memoires and ISRs. The financial management rating up to 2004 was
‘satisfactory’ but was downgraded in June 2005 to ‘moderately satisfactory,’ and where it
remained to the end of the project. The procurement rating was reduced to ‘moderately
satisfactory’ from ‘satisfactory’ in June 2005, then fell to ‘moderately unsatisfactory’ in 2009. It
was rated ‘unsatisfactory’ in March 2011 but restored to ‘moderately satisfactory’ in the final
ISR, based on successful rebidding of civil works contracts and improved procurement
implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
In 2007-08, preparations began for HSSP2. This incorporated a number of lessons from HSSP.
ADB decided to withdraw from the health sector in Cambodia (except for some regional support).
The Bank built a partnership with a number of other donors (including AusAID, DFID,
AfD/France, Belgian Technical Cooperation, UNICEF, and UNFPA) to form a stronger sector-
wide partnership for the new project. Most HSSP activities ended in December 2008, with the
exception of civil works, HEFs, and support for performance-based contracting with district
health services. Malaria, TB, and HIV/AIDS programs were subsequently financed by GFATM
and other partners, but HSSP2 continued financing for dengue and some neglected tropical
diseases. HEFs were transferred to HSSP2 in April 2009. Performance-based service delivery
contracts with NGOs ended in March 2009 and NGOs shifted to a capacity building support role
under HSSP2, with selected health districts and hospitals performance-based Service Delivery
Grants. After two further extensions to complete unfinished civil works, HSSP closed on
December 31, 2011. At that point, a small number of civil works remained incomplete and these
were all transferred to HSSP2. There was a smooth transition between the two projects.

All of the successful initiatives in HSSP were continued in HSSP2, apart from the Merit Based
Pay Initiate scheme, which was designed with support from HSSP1 and other partners, but
implemented for only 6 months before being cancelled by government at the end of 2009. Skills
and capacities built in MOH and the PMU during HSSP have been used in the implementation of
HSSP2, and financial management and operational management systems further improved. The
M&E framework has been revised and now closely aligns with MOH’s Second Health Strategic
Plan.
                                                 8
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The objectives of HSSP were highly relevant to the country context, sector priorities and the
World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy. The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (2000)
called for helping to reduce poverty by increasing affordability of health services through HEFs
and making services more accessible by providing new facilities and resources; building built
human capital through training and provision of equipment; and promoted good governance by
improving the quality and integration of planning and budgeting, including participatory
planning involving key stakeholders. The Project objectives remained highly relevant to the
priorities of HSP 2008-2015, in term of enhancement sustainable development of the health
sector for better health and well-being of all Cambodians, especially of the poor, women and
children. The project design was substantially relevant: it addressed the most important health
priorities, both in terms of disease burden and health system strengthening; and was well aligned
with HSP1 and the subsequent Health Strategic Plan 2008-2015, promoting country ownership
and sustainability. The SWiM approach was appropriate to existing capacity and experience in
country, and contributed to further alignment of donor financing. Project design relevance had
some modest shortcoming, including inadequate specification of the results framework, and the
need for a clearer strategy to sequence institutional reforms, in light of experience from other
SWAps. Overall relevance is judged to be Substantial.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
While IDA financed focused on 12 of 24 provinces, the overall HSSP program provided support
across the whole of the public health sector and at all levels (with ADB financing similar
activities in the other nine largest provinces). The combined funding of HSSP provided a
substantial share of public health sector expenditure (over two-thirds in the first two years), even
after the entry of GFATM into the country in 2004. Given the size and reach of HSSP alone, it
can be plausibly assumed that HSSP contributed to sector-wide outcomes. In a sectorwide
framework, however, comparing performance among “project? and “nonproject? provinces is of
limited use in assessing project effectiveness 4, and rigorous attribution between Project financing
and specific sector indicators is not possible. Instead, achievement of specific Project
Development Objectives is assessed below against overall progress on sector outcomes and
service indicators, followed by a review of evidence regarding plausible linkages between
project outputs and progress on intermediate sector indicators.

High-level objective: Contribute to the improvement of the health status of the Cambodian
population, particularly the poor and rural population: This objective was substantially
achieved – reflecting outstanding progress on maternal and child, but modest progress on
nutrition. Cambodia DHS 2010 reported substantial improvement of health status of Cambodian
population. Among all four PDO indicators, three (maternal mortality, infant mortality, and
under 5 mortality) surpassed 2010 Cambodia MDG targets. After stagnating from 2000 to 2005,

 A comparison of changes in key outcome indicators in HSSP and non-HSSP provinces is included at the end of
Annex 3, using CDHS data. While there are variations among provinces, the average differences between HSSP and
non-HSSP provinces are not statistically significant.

                                                      9
maternal mortality was reduced by half from 2005 to 2010 (from 472 to 206 per 100,000 live
births). Reductions in child mortality have been remarkable, declining at an average annual rate
of 8 percent per year in the past decade – among the fastest reductions in the world. Child
mortality declined sharply among the poorest, although at a similar rate to the richest quintile. 5
With respect to MDG 1 (child nutrition), stunting showed a modest decline (from 50% in 2000 to
40% in 2010), but wasting increased (from 8% in 2005 to 11% in 2010) and underweight showed
no change (28.1 in 2005 vs 28.3 in 2010). 6 HIV/AIDS prevalence among 15-29 years olds
declined from 2 percent in 1998 to 0.8 percent in 2010.

Increasing the accessibility, quality, and affordability of health services. This objective was
also substantially achieved. Among 12 intermediate result indicators reported routinely in ISRs,
nine either exceeded or achieved national targets set by various government monitoring
frameworks. Indicators exceeding targets included percentage of children under one year fully
immunized, and percentage of deliveries attended by trained staff. Indicators achieving targets
included: malaria case fatality rate in public facilities per 100 patients, incidence of malaria per
1,000 inhabitants, per capita consultation in public facilities; and percentage of pregnant women
received at least 2 ANC consultations. The percentage of women using modern contraceptives
doubled during project implementation, but fell short of national targets. No mechanism was
established to measure client satisfaction on an annual basis, however, but various client surveys
show an overall improvement in satisfaction with public services. Similarly, no methodology
was established to estimate the percentage of population with access to minimum package of
activities (MPA) at health center level, but the number of health centers reaching full MPA
capacity increased from 294 in 2003 to 469 (out of 1,010) in 2010. In addition, household
surveys showed increased utilization of public health services by the poor and rural population,
and declines in catastrophic spending (see Annex 2). Annex 2 provides a detailed summary of
project outputs by component, as well as available data on progress against performance
indicators from the PAD and ISRs. Progress on key indicators and project contributions are
summarized below according to specific sub-objectives:
    •    Develop affordable quality health services with emphasis on primary healthcare and first
         referral services in rural areas: Progress on this sub-objective is rated as substantial
         overall. Key HSSP outputs in the 12 provinces included: renovation of six health centers,
         and construction of 21 new health centers, five health posts, and five new district referral
         hospitals; provision of essential medical equipment to 366 health centers, 17 district

  The child mortality rate the poorest quintile declined from 127 per 1000 in 2005 to 90 per 1000 births in 2010,
compared to a decline from 43 to 30 per thousand among the richest quintile. The CDHS reports on average child
mortality for the five years preceding the survey; as such, improvements between the 2005 and 2010 survey reflect
progress during HSSP implementation.
6
  A detailed analysis of these trends goes beyond scope of the ICR, but evidence suggests that rapid declines in child
and maternal health have been driven by overall improvements in socioeconomic status; improved access to health
services through facility constructions/rehabilitation and improved road networks; high coverage of preventive
interventions (immunization, vitamin A); increased utilization and quality of health services, including by the poor;
and a dramatic increase in antenatal care and facility deliveries (see details below and in Annex 2). The persistence
of child malnutrition appears to be driven by various factors, including inappropriate child feeding practices (despite
significant increases in exclusive breastfeeding); limited progress in sanitation and hygiene; and food insecurity for
the poorest.

                                                          10
        hospitals, and eight provincial hospitals; training in child health and integrated
        management of child illness for nearly 1000 health staff, covering 78% of health centers
        in target provinces. Assessments of clinical quality (for IMCI, maternal services) showed
        improvements due to HSSP financing training and supervision, although further
        improvements in clinical quality are needed. Health center and health post construction
        was targeted to remote areas, including those with large indigenous populations. The end
        of project survey concluded that the combination of improved infrastructure, staff
        training, and staff motivation (through HEFs, contracting, and other incentive programs)
        contributed to increased utilization, quality improvements, and overall high satisfaction
        with public services (AGEG/Domrei 2010). A Quality Assurance Office was established
        in MOH, and various service quality assessment tools were developed and implemented
        with support from HSSP and other partners. The project supported performance
        contracting through an NGO to improve services in one remote operational district (Preah
        Vihear), with ADB and Belgian Technical Cooperation supporting various forms of
        contracting elsewhere. Impact evaluations of NGO contracting showed significant
        improvements in utilization of key services, and reduced spending by the poor (Bhushan
        and others 2007). Monitoring data show that these gains have been maintained with the
        transition to internal contracting under HSSP2. Planned activities to strengthen
        community social accountability mechanisms were implemented, however, but have been
        initiated under HSSP2.

    •   Increase utilization of health services by the poor. The project targeted investments to
        underserved rural areas; supported outreach activities; expanded health equity funds
        (HEFs), which finance user fees for the poor at public health facilities. By 2008, HEF
        coverage expanded to 50 of 76 operational districts (covering two-thirds of the poor
        geographically), of which HSSP financed 13. The total number of households for which
        costs were paid by HEFs increased from 18,500 in 2003 to 227,000 in 2008. HEFs

                                                  11
        initially focused on coverage of inpatient services at hospitals. A number of evaluations
        and academic studies have been carried out on HEFs, and the independent HSSP
        evaluation commissioned by MOH undertook a household survey and beneficiary
        assessments on HEFs (AGEG/Domrei 2010) These concluded that HEFs reduced (but
        did not eliminate) out-of-pocket and catastrophic spending by the poor on health (Flores
        and others 2011), increased use of public health service use by the poor. HEF oversight
        through local NGOs improved responsiveness of public providers to the poor (Annear
        2010). While not all the poor yet have access to HEFs, catastrophic spending on health
        by the poorest quintile declined from 3.6 percent in 2004 to 2.3 percent in 2009. 7
    •   Mitigate the effect of infectious disease epidemics and of malnutrition. In the early
        years of the Project, HSSP was the major source of financing for malaria, TB, and
        HIV/AIDs, and remained the major funding source for dengue throughout. Outputs
        included support to national programs, including for strategy development and program
        monitoring; training of health workers; distribution of bednets in malaria endemic areas;
        distribution of condoms and targeted campaigns for groups at high risk for HIV; and
        support for community case detection and prevention programs (for TB, malaria, etc.).
        The project contributed to improved case detection and treatment success rates for all
        these programs, including significant declines in case fatality rates for malaria and
        dengue (see Annex 2). With respect to nutrition, HSSP and other partners supported a
        highly successful breastfeeding campaign, which increased exclusive breastfeeding from
        11% in 2000 to 68% in 2008. The Project also financed training in child health and
        nutrition for over 3000 staff. The number of hospitals able to treat severe malnutrition
        reached 15 (out of 78) in 2008, and increased further to 33 by 2011. The Project
        supported outreach costs for micronutrient distribution. Coverage of iron folate for
        pregnant women increased from 18% in 2005 to 40% in 2008; vitamin A coverage for
        children aged 6-59 months increased from 11% in 2000 to 68% in 2009. Efforts to
        promote complementary feeding and improve nutrition counseling have been less
        successful, however, and remain a priority under HSSP2.
Assist the Kingdom of Cambodia to implement its Health Sector Strategic Plan 2003-2007 and
strengthen the sector’s capacity to carry out health sector reform and to manage health sector
resources efficiently. The first part of this objective (support implementation of HSP1) was
substantially achieved, but progress on the second part was modest, particularly with respect to
improved sector efficiency. Overall efficacy is rated as modest.
    •   As discussed above, the project design and annual review process supported the overall
        objectives of the HSP1, as well as the specific objective to implement a SWiM approach.
        The Project aligned financing with priorities articulated in the strategic plan, and made
        substantial contributions to strengthening of planning and monitoring capacity at central
        and provincial level. As a result, all provinces now prepare annual operating plans that
        increasingly integrate government, partners, and NGO financing (but the AOP formats
        still differ from the MEF requirements budget submissions at province level). Various
        national programs received support to develop and implement programs, and the policy

expenditures exceeding 40% of non-subsistence income (e.g., after subtracting expenditure on food consumption).

                                                      12
        dialogue and evaluation studies by HSSP and partners contributed to progress on key
        policy reforms (including HEFs, service contracting, etc.).
    •   The project’s contributions to strengthening the sector’s capacity to manage health
        resources efficiently was modest, however. HSSP provided substantial training in
        financial management to MOH staff, but continued reliance on the PMU for project
        implementation, and slow overall progress in public financial management reform
        reduced the impact of this training on government capacity. The RGC budgetary
        contribution to health increased substantially in the past decade (exceeding 11% of
        national budget in 2009), and budget execution rates have been high, but progress in
        fiscal decentralization and procurement reform was limited. Drug availability improved
        at facility level (stockout rates of essential drugs are now less than 5%), but planned
        support for improving efficiency of pharmaceutical procurement and the supply chain
        was not implemented. Construction of a new National Drug Quality Control Laboratory
        was initiated under HSSP1, but construction experienced a number of delays, including to
        ensure that the design was fully compliant with international certification standards.
        Completion is expected in late 2012, with HSSP2 financing.
Overall efficacy in achieving development objectives is rated as substantial. This overall rating
reflects a balance between the ratings of specific objectives, weighted by importance: substantial
progress toward increasing the accessibility, quality, and affordability of health services (high
importance); substantial progress in supporting HSP1 implementation, but modest progress in
improving capacity to manage sector efficiently (substantial important); and substantial progress
toward improved sector-wide indicators for maternal and child health and nutrition (modest
importance). 8
3.3 Efficiency
The ICR has not attempted to calculate a final rate of return for the project. 9 Efficiency is
therefore assessed based on available evidence on the project’s contribution to allocative
efficiency in the sector; technical efficiency of health services; and “value for money? from
project investments. HSSP support for strengthening the annual planning and performance
monitoring process improved resource allocation, particularly for donor financing. Mid-year
reviews of the AOPs and quarterly expenditures also contributed to improving efficiency.
Limited progress was made in improving the overall efficiency of the national drug procurement
and logistics system, and delays in implementing public sector management reforms undermined
progress in improving efficiency of RGC budget allocations to the sector (World Bank 2011).
The overall contribution to allocative efficiency is rated as modest. With regard to technical


8
  When a project has multiple objectives and sub-objectives, the ICR should indicate the relative importance of each
objective to arrive at an overall rating (see ICR Guidelines). There is no standard methodology to assign weights to
among sub-objectives, so the following was used: (i) progress toward higher-level sector outcomes is given a 20%
weight, since in context of SWiM approach, HSSP was represented only a portion of sector financing; (ii) increasing
the accessibility, quality, and affordability of health services is assigned 45%, because of the importance of
improving services for the poor, and because it represented the major portion of HSSP financing; (iii) the objective
to support HSP implementation and improve sector capacity and efficiency is given a weighting of 35%.
9
  Annex 4 of the PAD provided a detailed economic analysis of the project including an estimated internal rate of
return of 17% and a net present value (minus costs) of US$45 million. However, these figures were highly sensitive
to a number of assumptions, so the potential result ranges were very broad. No follow up analysis was conducted by
the project, MOH or MEF.

                                                        13
efficiency, several sector-wide efficiency indicators improved during project implementation,
including bed occupancy rates and the number of consultations per health staff. The project
contributed to technical efficiency of health services through provision of infrastructure and
equipment, training of staff, and various performance incentive schemes through HEFs and
contracting. Independent evaluations studies concluded that support for HEFs and for
performance-based contracting with health districts increased service utilization, which in turn
contributed to improved equity and technical efficiency of services (Mathonnat and others 2012;
Bhushan and others 2007; Annear 2010). Contribution to technical efficiency is therefore rated
as substantial. The efficiency of project investments (input/output efficiency) is rated as modest:
project delays reduced efficiency, including the rebidding of civil works contracts that
necessitated further two-year extension. The rebidding process resulted in 30 percent lower
contract prices, however. Overall efficiency is rated as modest.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The overall outcome rating of the project is Moderately Satisfactory, based on substantial
relevance of project objectives and design, substantial efficacy in achieving development
objectives, but only modest efficiency.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Catastrophic health spending by the poorest 20% of the population dropped by 36.7% between
2004 and 2009 10. From 2007, there was a substantial increase in the number of HEFs covering
health service costs for the poor, and those HEFs were largely funded by HSSP. An impact
evaluation concluded that HEFs contributed to a significant reduction in out-of-pocket payments,
catastrophic expenditures, and debt by the poor (Flores and others 2011). Expansion of the
number of health facilities also meant that people in more remote areas, often the poorest and
those with indigenous populations, had increased availability of health care (AGEG-Domrei
2010). There were significant improvements in women’s health, with a dramatic reduction in the
maternal mortality ratio, a substantial increase in the number of women attending antenatal care
visits, and a doubling of the number of women with access to modern contraceptives. Though
men are the majority of MOH employees, of the 6,328 staff trained under HSSP, half were
women 11.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
HSSP used and strengthened MOH’s systems for planning, coordination, and monitoring of
sector financing. The introduction of AOPs and 3YRPs gave MOH the capacity to allocate
sectoral resources more effectively. Training under HSSP covered all categories of staff and all
levels of the system, helping to build overall capacity. JAPR of the sector involved MOH, donors

and NGOs. The reviews examined available data, promoting evidence-based decisions, and
ensured greater participation in planning and policy making. While HSSP retained a PMU for its
full duration, MOH staff managed this unit and increased their capacity in contracting,
monitoring and the preparation of standard procedures and guidelines.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None.
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Beneficiary surveys or stakeholder workshops were not conducted for this ICR. Qualitative and
quantitative surveys were undertaken, however, for an independent evaluation of HSSP1
contracted by MOH, which included household surveys and focus groups, as well as quality of
care surveys (AGEG-Domrei 2010). Beneficiaries reported substantial improvements in the
perceived quality and availability of public health services in the previous five years, as a result
of construction/upgrading of health facilities, outreach and preventive services, improved
motivation and behavior of health staff, improved roads/transport, introduction of HEFs, and
reduced unofficial payments to health providers.
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
Over the course of HSSP, improved capacity in planning and management, increased service
coverage and the training of staff have helped to ensure that MOH has the capacity to prepare
and implement effective strategies. The good progress on HSP1 and the preparation of the Health
Strategic Plan 2008-2015 bear this out. The planning process is now well embedded and
continues to be improved. The quality and timeliness of HMIS data is also making solid progress.
The main risks remaining are the ability to finance initiatives such as HEFs and performance-
based contracts in the long term, the need to better regulate private sector health providers,
respond to challenges of drug resistant TB and malaria, and the rapidly increasing burden of non-
communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Strategic relevance and approach –Implementation experience in the earlier Disease Control
and Health Development Project revealed weaknesses in MOH planning and management
systems, poor staff motivation and low coverage of health services. HSSP focused on addressing
these. The prior ADB-funded Basic Health Services Project had tested different approaches to
performance-based management, and HSSP also drew lessons from this. While HSSP was in
preparation, MOH drafted HSP1, providing for the first time an overarching policy framework
for the sector within which donors could structure their support. HSSP explicitly aligned with
this framework, and design was fully aligned with World Bank and RGC strategies.
Poverty, gender and social development – Before HSSP began, Cambodia faced widespread
poverty, poor infrastructure and major health problems. HIV prevalence was high and diseases
like TB, dengue and malaria were endemic. Ill health kept households in poverty or pushed

                                                15
marginal households back below the poverty line. Coverage of health facilities was limited.
People in remote areas, mainly the poor and ethnic minorities, often had no access to public
health services. The introduction of user fees had helped to finance health services, but raised a
barrier to access for the poor. Exemptions were granted in an ad hoc manner. Maternal and
child mortality rates were some of the highest in the region and pregnancy was high risk for
many women, especially the poor, with insufficient health facilities offering safe deliveries. The
planning for HSSP took account of all these issues and included support to improve access,
affordability, and quality of health services for women and children.
Environmental aspects – Because civil works and insecticide spraying would have an
environmental impact, appropriate safeguards for both were established.
Fiduciary aspects – HSSP used standard operating procedures for externally financed projects
developed by MEF. Financial management risks were clearly identified, but the willingness of
MOH to integrate project financial management into its systems was over-estimated. HSSP
provided sound capacity building support to financial staff in MOH and the PMU. Both internal
and independent external financial audits were conducted.
Policy, institutional aspects and implementation – HSSP was designed to use MOH systems.
While MOH endorsed this approach at the design stage, it resisted full integration during
implementation. Policy alignment with MOH’s HSP1 and harmonization with the support of
other donors in the sector were strong. Support for the four key national programs and various
departments in MOH were consistent with project objectives and MOH priorities. Support for
decentralization of planning was consistent with wider government policy.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) – The M&E framework and indicators did not fully match
those in HSP1, nor the framework used by ADB, and targets and means of measurement for
some indicators not adequately defined. The feasibility of collecting data on a number of
indicators was not sufficiently assessed.
Risk assessment – the PAD identified 13 critical risks, one (financial management) which was
rated high, and 6 were rated substantial. The risk assessment covered all major problem areas in
the health sector and clear mitigation measures for all of these were laid out.
World Bank inputs and processes – The World Bank previously provided technical assistance to
develop financial management and procurement guidelines. External advisers were recruited in
MOH. The Development Credit Agreement was signed on 27 February 2003 and became
effective on 14 August 2003, allowing time for MOH to comply with effectiveness conditions.
Despite this time lag, most activities got under way quickly from August 2003.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Project objectives and design were based on solid analysis of sector issues and constraints, and
relevant to RGC and World Bank strategies. Project design both supported and aligned with
development of the first Strategic Health Plan. The Bank played a key role in encouraging
development partners to organize their support around a common framework led by MOH. The
major weaknesses in project design were inadequate definition of the M&E framework, and that
no provision were made during design to locate national or international staff in the country
office to support implementation. This slowed down the startup and initial implementation of the
project. Although the PAD called for using country systems for managing the Project, the Bank


                                               16
subsequently agreed to MOH’s request to establish a PMU, which may have facilitated
implementation but mitigated contributions to capacity building.
(b) Quality of Supervision (Implementation Support)
Focus on development impact – World Bank oversight maintained a clear focus on accessibility,
affordability, coverage and quality of health services and tackling key diseases. The last of these
was overshadowed after 2004 by the inflow of GFATM support for TB, malaria and AIDS, but
the World Bank responded well by focusing on specific areas in these fields that were
overlooked or weakly supported by GFATM. World Bank staff maintained a strong emphasis on
maternal and child health and on improving access for the poor. This was bolstered by
development of a common position on many of these issues with ADB, DFID and UNFPA in the
joint review process. ISRs tracked key issues, with quality improving over the course of the
project. The JRMs produced detailed aides memoires with clear recommendations and action
plans for all partners and MOH. Participation in annual planning workshops helped to maintain
a focus in MOH on using evidence to identify and address priorities.

Fiduciary aspects and safeguards – internal and external audits were regularly conducted and
results discussed with MOH in conjunction with other donors. Compliance with safeguards was
tracked and assessed regularly in ISRs, specifically those for environmental assessment, pest
management, indigenous peoples and involuntary resettlement.

Adequacy of supervision inputs and processes – There were some delays in release and acquittal
of funds, procurement, and in resolving issues in the PMU. Much of this was because World
Bank supervision up to 2005 was done from headquarters. The placement of a senior health
specialist in the country office and recruitment of a local staff helped to reduce delays and solve
problems more quickly. Frequent meetings with MOH and the PMU meant issues were
identified earlier and mitigation measures agreed in a more timely way. World Bank cooperation
with other donors was strong, and promoted a growing harmonization between donors that has
continued since. The heavy workload in procurement, complicated by changes in government
policy, contributed to delays, however. World Bank procedures were clear and well understood
by PMU and key MOH staff and records have been well maintained.

Candor and quality of performance reporting – ISRs and aides memoires from the JRMs
clearly identified major issues, with detailed and often critical appraisals of activities, and from
2004, included recommendations and action plans to address problems identified. ISRs routinely
rated the project as “satisfactory? for the first three years, until it was downgraded to
“moderately satisfactory? in June 2005 after the team-leader moved to Cambodia. More realistic
ISR ratings earlier on might have led to more prompt identification and resolution of issues.

Ensuring adequate transition arrangements – Most activities in HSSP ended in December 2008.
This overlapped with preparation of HSSP2, which commenced in early 2009. World Bank staff
coordinated well with MOH and other donors in the design of HSSP2, which built on lessons
from HSSP and aimed for a stronger SWAp, including the pooling of funds. The new project
began on schedule. Three extensions for HSSP meant it ran to the end of December 2011, in
order to complete delayed civil works. A small number of these were transferred to HSSP2 at
the start of 2012, and this transfer was smooth.


                                                17
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
While World Bank supervision and support, including policy dialogue and partner coordination
were generally satisfactory, a lower rating of “moderately satisfactory? is given due to the
absence of in-country management staff in the early years and the slow identification of
problems, which if addressed earlier, could have avoided implementation delays.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
World Bank performance is rated “moderately satisfactory? both during preparation and during
implementation, so the overall rating is also moderately satisfactory.
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government performance
Ownership and commitment – Government showed commitment to reforms in public sector
financial management, decentralization and localized planning in the lead-up to HSSP. The
World Bank provided technical assistance to MEF to develop guidelines for management of
donor funds and procurement. MEF was supportive of the internal and external audit process for
HSSP.
Enabling environment – Government remains strongly committed to the MDGs. Reducing HIV
prevalence, maternal and child mortality, and reducing poverty have been given strong emphasis
in government policies, and clear interim and final targets were set in these areas. The
government established 19 Technical Working Groups across a range of sectors to facilitate
dialogue between government and donors, and the Technical Working Group for Health was
paralleled by working groups in the provinces. Government supported MOH in the preparation
of HSP1, as well as policies on quality improvement and health financing. Government had
approved the introduction of user fees and exemptions for the poor.
Beneficiary/stakeholder consultations – Government undertook consultations with MOH, WHO
and health sector donors in the preparation and implementation of HSSP. It supported the SWiM
approach and has increasingly shown interest in SWAps in order to improve donor
harmonization and alignment with government systems. More needed to be done in terms of
consultations with local government and civil society in the context of decentralization and
linkage to other social protection measures.
Readiness for implementation – Government had prior experience with World Bank projects,
including in the health sector and was familiar with its systems. MEF assigned staff to liaise
with and monitor the project. It also oversaw use of the guidelines on financial management and
procurement.
Timely resolution of implementation issues – MEF staff assigned to cooperate with HSSP were
open to discussions and constructive about dealing with issues. MEF took part in joint quarterly
portfolio reviews with the World Bank, ADB and JICA and this was useful to identify and
address issues quickly. Issues affecting wider government policy were dealt with more slowly.
Good relationships between staff in MEF and MOH and the PMU enabled solutions to be found
cooperatively, though this process could sometimes be protracted. MEF trained MOH and PMU
staff when there were changes in government policies.

Fiduciary issues – As mentioned above, after the detection of irregularities in procurement in
ministries other than MOH, the government took decision to mandate all WB-financed Projects
to use services of IPA for procurement. This mandated decision may have helped reduce
fiduciary risks related to procurement, but contributed to delays for procurement of civil work of
HSSP due to the performance of the first IPA. The use of the IPA meant it was not possible to
transfer the procurement function from PMU to the Government system, which was the aim of
the Project. In addition, government showed limited commitment to strengthening the national
procurement system, and overall public financial management reform implementation was slow.
There were delays in release of the national budget, especially in the first quarter of each
financial year. This was due to the government budget process and was outside the control of
MEF staff.
M&E – MEF monitored financial management and procurement issues. It took part in reviews
of audits of HSSP and was active in trying to resolve procurement problems. MEF did not
conduct any economic evaluation of efficiency or effectiveness in HSSP, but this was consistent
with its general policy on donor-funded projects.
Relationships and coordination of donors – For HSSP, donor coordination was managed in the
joint quarterly portfolio reviews involving MEF, the World Bank, ADB and JICA; and through
the Technical Working Group for Health.
Transition arrangements – MEF worked closely with the WB and other donors in the
preparation of, and transition to, HSSP2, which commenced on schedule. MEF also helped to
ensure the two extensions of HSSP were implemented smoothly.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
For all project-related issues within its control, government responded effectively and quickly,
and was pro-active in negotiating solutions. While there were delays in disbursement of the
national budget , these were due to government system that were to be improved through public
financial management reform. Implementation of these reforms have been slow, however, which
undermined the project objective to increase overall efficiency of health expenditure.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Commitment to development objectives – The health sector was given a high profile with respect
to the MDGs, especially maternal and child health and HIV prevalence. MOH was strongly
committed to HSSP in part because it offered a way to make progress on these issues. MOH was
also keen to extend health service coverage and to improve the quality of services, two core
elements in HSSP. While user fees were essential to health financing, MOH was aware of the
barrier this posed for the poor and the ad hoc nature of exemptions. MOH saw that HSSP
support for HEFs would allow this problem to be confronted in a systematic and sustainable way.
Beneficiary/stakeholder consultations – MOH’s most regular interaction with donors and NGOs
was through the Technical Working Group for Health, which convened monthly. Consultation
and discussion with provincial and OD levels, and NGOs working at these levels, was most
active in the annual planning process and mid-year reviews. MOH commissioned client
satisfaction surveys in 2007 and 2008, and then introduced consultation on client satisfaction
with community representatives through the process of integrated supervision from to HCs.



                                               19
More could have been done in terms of consulting with local government in the context of
decentralization.
Readiness for implementation – MOH set up a steering committee and financial management
group, with a Project Director at a sufficiently high level for decision making and political
advocacy. Management, procurement and financial management manuals were prepared.
Meeting effectiveness conditions took longer than expected, but once HSSP became effective
activities began quickly across all components.
Timely resolution of implementation issues – The health sector Joint Annual Performance
Reviews (JAPRs) provided a regular forum for MOH to interact with HSSP partners, other
donors and NGOs to identify issues and to map ways forward. The JRMs produced joint
recommendations and action points more regularly to help resolve issues. Performance of the
PMU often had room for improvement, with slow disbursement of funds, delays in procurement
and regular complaints from provincial and OD levels about the complexity of procedures and
the slow responsiveness of PMU staff.
Fiduciary issues – regular audits provided monitoring of financial management. While no
serious issues were identified, MOH and PMU personnel were often slow to respond to findings,
with problems often carrying over from one audit to another. Procurement, especially of goods
and civil works, experienced delays. In the case of civil works, delays led to the necessity of
three project closing date extensions, and the transfer of unfinished works to HSSP2 at the end of
2011.
Adequacy of M&E – A clear M&E framework with indicators and targets was set out in HSP1
and items were monitored regularly by MOH. HMIS data was used in monitoring sector annual
progress and annual planning process; data quality and timeliness improved during
implementation. HMIS data was supplemented by CDHS and other survey data for some key
indicators. HSSP monitoring indicators were updated upon annually from HMIS through JAPR
and from CDHS 2005 and 2010.
Relationships and coordination with partners – The JAPRs and Technical Working Group for
Health were the main forums for discussion and coordination between MOH, donors and NGOs.
The Project Director and PMU personnel were readily accessible and willing to discuss issues, as
was the Minister of Health.
Transition arrangements – MOH was closely involved in the preparation of HSSP2 and in
taking further steps towards sector-wide planning. Transition was aided by a new framework in
the Health Strategic Plan 2008-2015, strongly focused on the MDGs. Extensions of HSSP from
the end of 2008 to accommodate unfinished civil works were adequately managed by MOH, as
was the transfer of remaining items to HSSP2.
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The SWiM approach was a new direction for Cambodia, but MOH adapted well for applying to
HSSP. Planning was a key strength. However, delays in procurement, disbursements and civil
works, mixed progress toward achieving sector efficiency objectives, and the need for three
project extensions means that MOH performance is rated moderately satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

                                               20
Borrower performance and implementing agency performance eare both rated moderately
satisfactory, so the overall rating is ‘moderately satisfactory’.
6. Lessons Learned
Establishing clear objectives and M&E frameworks for sector wide programs – Reviews of the
SWiM experience concluded that the overall objective of Sector Wide Management
encompassed a range of specific objectives, which were not always clearly defined or adequately
understood by MOH and donors. In addition, the M&E framework for HSSP1 and the HSP1
were not fully aligned initially, and the results chain among sector and project outputs,
intermediate indicators, and outcome indicators could have been better define. In addition –
although not a new lesson -- it is important to select indicators that are available, allow timely
monitoring of progress, and enable mid-term and final reviews to make meaningful statements
about impact.

Political economy analysis – While HSSP preparation focused on health sector issues and
addressed them well, problems and delays in implementation often arose because of systemic
issues in the partner government that were not fully appreciated or taken into account during the
design. It is important that a technical sectoral analysis is matched with a political economy
analysis of government systems and structures in order to help clarify risks and select appropriate
implementation arrangements and strategies.

Adaptation and innovation – The project introduced direct disbursements from the PMU to
provincial accounts, speeding up the process, and also revised financial arrangements to permit
second generation accounts. Innovative solutions such as this are often needed, especially in
sector-wide operations, to remove bureaucratic bottlenecks. The challenge then is how to
convince government to adopt these more efficient methods into existing systems.

In-country management – implementation of HSSP improved markedly when the WB switched
to in-country management. Regular meetings to discuss strategy, to resolve problems and to
build relationships with government and other stakeholders became feasible and convenient.
Assessments of progress were also more realistic because of the day to day involvement. HSSP
is a clear example of the benefits of in-country management.
7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
MOH issues
Cost overruns and delays in civil works – MOH acknowledges these were partly due to changes
in MOH designs and equipment lists for referral hospitals, but also due to increased costs of
materials during the project. All of these were unforeseen at project inception and are good
examples of the risk of detailed activity planning and budgeting over an extended timeframe, and
the fixation on targets for both outputs and expenditure rates that such planning entails. Good
flexibility was shown by the World Bank and MOH in addressing this problem.
No formal linkage of HEFs to other demand and supply side strategies – MOH noted that
HEFs would have been more effective if better linked to strategies such as community based
health insurance or staff incentive schemes. This is true, but was not a known lesson at inception.
It only became clear as the rate of HEF expansion rose in the later part of HSSP. The lesson was
                                                21
incorporated into HSSP2, though the development of effective linking strategies remains a
challenge. The lack of harmonization between HEFs was also noted as an issue in HSSP, but
again this was a later lesson that has informed HSSP2, where standardization is under way.
Support for dengue prevention program – MOH felt this program could have benefited from a
stronger community-based approach, as in the malaria program, and greater funding. These two
issues are linked. HSSP funding for dengue was modest, but at the same time the National
Program Dengue Prevention and Control never responded to requests for a clear strategy
implementation plan and budget that HSSP could consider for funding. A community-based
approach needed to fit into a larger strategy, and the cost (and cost-effectiveness) of this needed
to be clear. Given that the positive impact on dengue under HSSP was quite dramatic, especially
in case fatality and hospitalization rates, the very high overall budget estimate of $5 million
annually appeared disproportionate.
Project management unit – MOH saw HSSP project management as ‘integrated into the existing
MOH structures’. Its ICR gives little attention to the PMU and the perception of HSSP partners
and other donors that retention of the PMU was a barrier to strengthening MOH systems. It is
clear that there were continuing difference in perception between MOH and donors regarding the
importance and desirability of integrating the PMU into line departments.
Private sector linkages and decentralization – the MOH ICR notes that more efforts could have
been made in both these areas under HSSP. This is true, but MOH does not provide any reasons
or analysis for this. Central government support for decentralization in particular is strong, but
MOH has been slow to act on this, and its capacity and willingness to monitor and regulate the
private sector remain weak.
(b) Cofinanciers
ADB issues
Civil works – ADB noted that delays and problems in civil works construction could have been
addressed more quickly if there had been better planning and oversight by MOH. The quality of
construction would have benefited from closer supervision and monitoring by MOH. This
reflects the need for a dedicated civil works supervision unit in MOH. Both the World Bank and
ADB could perhaps have advocated for this more strongly during HSSP.
Reporting – while seeing the SWiM approach as positive, the ADB ICR notes that each donor
still retained different reporting requirements and each prepared separate ICRs, despite having
conducted JRMs during implementation. While this is true, the ability of any donor, including
the WB, to move to common reporting is limited by internal organizational requirements and is
not within the control of any individual project to address. Greater harmonization between
donors would certainly reduce the reporting burden on MOH.
DFID issues
In-country presence – Although DFID’s contributions were smaller than either the World Bank
or ADB, it found itself playing a significant role in day to day management and coordination of
HSSP because the World Bank initially had no strong in-country presence. The World Bank
addressed this after late 2005 with the deployment of a Senior Health Specialist and later
additional staff, but the size and complexity of HSSP justified such deployment from the outset.



                                                22
Policy reversal – DFID put substantial time and resources into developing the MBPI scheme
under HSSP. It was cancelled by the government in 2009. While this was a concern in terms of
commitment to reform, the decision was taken at a senior government level and took MOH
unawares. There was little that either MOH or donors could have done to avoid this outcome.
Insufficient donor response to assessments of slow progress – DFID saw this as perhaps the
most important issue in HSSP. The identification of issues and setting out actions in response
were both well covered by the JRMs and the action plan contained in each aide memoire. But it
is true that issues tended to accumulate rather than be resolved. This was due in large part to the
fact that the PMU was normally the unit responsible for dealing with problems rather than
specific MOH departments. In this sense the PMU was a barrier to MOH ownership of both
problems and solutions.
(c) Other partners and stakeholders
Donor partner issues
Delays in procurement – most donors noted the delays in procurement in HSSP. This is a valid
observation. While a number of factors were at play, WB responsiveness could have been more
timely and resourcing of support in country could have been greater from project inception.
UNICEF issues
Nutrition – UNICEF felt that support for nutrition needed to be stronger and that there was poor
linkage to other sectors involved in nutrition. Both comments are valid. There is a need to
heighten the institutional status of the National Nutrition Program in MOH and to build stronger
links to NGOs. HSSP2 partners need to advocate on these issues. Weak links between MOH
and other ministries relevant to nutrition remains an operating constraint. The government has
made some efforts to improve this with the setting up of the Council on Agriculture and Rural
Development and preparation of the National Social Protection Strategy, but nutrition has
remained peripheral in this process and donors need to advocate for a higher profile.
Training – UNICEF would have preferred HSSP to set budget limits for training and to link
budgets to comprehensive training plans. HSSP2 has made progress on both of these, but this
was not done in HSSP. At project inception in 2003, MOH promised to develop a workforce
plan for human resource development, and DFID provided technical support for this. The World
Bank and other partners requested integrated training plans but neither a ministry-wide human
resource development plan nor annual training plans were forthcoming. Advocacy continues on
these issues in HSSP2.

Medicam 12 issues
Poor linkage with civil society and local government – while Medicam acknowledged the
importance of client satisfaction surveys and HSSP support for HC management committees, it
felt that engagement with civil society and local government needed to be stronger in order to
promote quality assurance in the health system. Part of the problem is that MOH has few
institutional tools for such formal engagement. HC management committees and Village Health
Support Groups are the only permanent mechanisms. Weak links to local government are a

     Medicam is the umbrella organization for NGOs working in the health sector in Cambodia.

                                                               23
function of slow progress on decentralization of MOH functions. Under HSSP2, HEFs are
proving a useful avenue for better engagement with local government,.
No engagement with the private sector – engagement with the private sector was reiterated a
number of times in the PAD as an aim of HSSP. But apart from the regulation of iodized salt
quality and the sale of infant formulas, HSSP made virtually no progress in this area. This
reflects the absence of effective mechanisms in MOH for engaging with the private sector and
the tendency for MOH to narrowly define the private sector in terms of professional
organizations. The private sector remains the largest deliverer of health services in Cambodia, so
engaging with it is vital for MOH to achieve a truly SWAp to health services management and
quality control, but MOH resources and skills to do this remain limited.

Annex3: M&E indicators

This annex presents three tables: (1) key performance indicators from the PAD, which were to be monitored annually; (2) Core
Performance Indicators from the PAD; and (3) ISR indicators collected in addition to the previous PAD data sets. As noted in the
main text, the M&E framework was to be finalized during the first year or so of implementation.
    • None of the indicators in the PAD had targets, and several monitoring indicators were subsequently modified. Once the HSP1
       M&E framework was finalized, baseline figures and targets were aligned with those in the HSP1 and for the MDGs (where
       appropriate). Baseline figures are for 2003 unless otherwise indicated, and targets were set for 2007 unless otherwise indicated,
       with CMDG indicators having intermediate targets for 2010 as well as final targets for 2015.
    All annual figures are from MOH’s HMIS unless otherwise indicated. Because most HSSP activities relevant to HMIS
       indicators ceased at the end of 2008 or early 2009 and were taken up by HSSP2, HMIS indicators are only reported below
       through 2008, but are available through 2011. The HMIS system has continued to improve and is now fully web-based, but
       reporting from the private sector remains problematic, and official HMIS data cover only the public sector. For some
       indicators, household surveys may capture the whole of the health sector (public and private).
    For key outcome indicators, the CDHS 2010 is used.

Notes: HSSP1 provinces are shaded. Data on key outcome indicators in the CDHS (including child and neonatal mortality; skilled birth attendance) represent
averages for the five years prior to the survey. Comparison of 2005 and 2010 CHDS therefore reflects changes during HSSP implementation. Averages for
HSSP and non-HSSP provinces are unweighted. The table shows significant variations among provinces, and some difference between HSSP and non-HSSP
provinces, but differences are not statistically significant.

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis
Annex 4 of the PAD included an economic analysis of the proposed project which
covered consistency with government and World Bank strategies, benefits and allocative
efficiency of the project activities, risks, rationale for public sector investment in the
project activities, a poverty assessment and an assessment of fiscal impact and
sustainability. The analysis included a calculation of net present value which showed that
project outcomes were highly sensitive to good implementation. It also included an
estimated internal rate of return. A likely poverty impact assessment was disaggregated
by wealth quintiles.

No subsequent economic analysis was conducted during the project or on completion, nor
was data collected in a systematic way with a view to doing such an analysis.

MEF did not carry out an economic analysis of the project or any calculation of the rate
of return. There is no RGC policy which mandates this.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
1. Executive summary of Borrower’s ICR, February 2012
The Ministry of Health developed its first five year Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSP1) for the
2003-07 period in 2002 through consultations with a variety of stakeholders including other
ministries and government agencies, local authorities, health development partners, civil society
members, and local and international NGOs. The overall goal of HSP1 was to improve health
status and contribute to poverty reduction through eight strategies in six priority areas: health
service delivery, behavior change, quality improvement, human resource development, health
financing, and institutional development. To achieve the Plan, the Health Sector Support Project
(HSSP) was developed and implemented by the MOH and its partners. The project was financed
by the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) through loans from the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), The World Bank (WB) and by a grant from the Department for International
Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, with additional funding from the UN Population
Fund (UNFPA). The executive agency (EA) for the Project was the Ministry of Health of the
Royal Government of Cambodia.

The goal of the project was to improve the health status of the people of Cambodia, especially
women, children and the poor in targeted regions. The project’s specific objectives were to: (i)
Increase the institutional capacity to plan, finance, and manage the health sector in line with the
HSP1, 2003-07 (ii) Develop affordable, quality, basic curative and preventive health services for
the population, especially for women, the poor and the disadvantaged (iii) Increase the utilization
of health services, especially by the women and the poor, and (iv) Control and mitigate the effects
of infectious epidemics and of malnutrition with emphasis on the poor and disadvantaged.
WB/IDA financing covered 12 provinces, national level communicable disease control, and other
selected MOH activities. A DFID grant also covered national level capacity building, monitoring
and evaluation, safe motherhood activities, and contracting of health services to NGOs. A
significant portion of DFID funds were channeled through ADB or WB/IDA. The project’s
components consisted of the following: (i) improved delivery of health services (ii) support to
programs addressing public health priorities and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity.

At the time of design, the MMR was reported as 437 per 100,000 live births based on the findings
of the CDHS 2000. Subsequently, the CDHS 2005 reported an MMR of 472, which was within
the previous estimate’s margin of error, suggesting that there was no decline. In the CDHS 2010
the MMR estimate is reported at 206 suggesting that a secular decline has occurred. Similarly,
the total fertility rate declined from 4.0 in 2000 to 3.0 in 2010. Both under 5 mortality and the
IMR in contrast to the MMR showed remarkable declines over the period from 2000 to 2010.
Under 5 mortality declined from 124 in 2000 to 83 in 2005 and 66 in 2010, per the CDHS. IMR
declined from 95 per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 66 in 2005 per the CDHS and then to 45 in the
2010 CDHS. Both these indicators therefore, have shown a decline that is more than double that
anticipated at project design, and HSSP interventions and activities funded by World Bank,
among other donors, contributed directly and indirectly to this achievement.

Although the interventions proposed in the initial design directly addressed the challenges and
problems facing the health sector, one of the key weaknesses that emerged in the process of
implementation was the serious underestimation of cost estimates for civil works, and contracting
of health services of NGOs. Civil works overruns reflected the adoption of new MOH approved
designs and guidelines for referral hospitals that were not anticipated in the project design. The
revised CPA equipment list reflected an increased number of items and quantities and therefore
exceeded the original cost estimates. Similarly, the bid prices for NGO contractors for delivering
health services in the 10 ADB funded ODs were also severely underestimated, although

                                                50
subsequent DFID funds covered the shortfall. Also, at design a sum of $90,000 was allocated to
start up kits for drugs and supplies; however, after project launch it was determined that sufficient
drugs and supplies were available through CMS for start-up supply, as well as further routine
supply, and therefore this amount was reallocated for other line items.

The project had three outputs: improved delivery of health services, especially those targeting the
poor and women; support for priority public health programs; and strengthening of institutional
capacity for management and human resources. Most of the targets specified under these outputs
were achieved. At the end of the project, the overall physical completion rate was 95%. In
general, Project implementation was delayed by a year due to delays in the civil works
construction and rehabilitation program and consequent delays in procurement and supply of
biomedical equipment. Contracts with NGOs for management of service delivery at Operational
District levels were also extended to facilitate the transition to Internal Contracting arrangements
comprising of Special Operating Agencies and Service Delivery Grants in line with the Royal
Government’s Policy on Public Service Delivery which came into effect in 2006.

The civil works component was a crucial element of the overall project approach and was
successful with regard to reaching project objectives. Client appreciation of the modern facilities
in combination with improved quality of care brought about increased utilization rates, in
particular in child care. A detailed list of civil works under the WB component is at Annex 1.
MPA Kits were distributed to 901 HCs. CPA kits were supplied to 38 CPA2 RH and to 18 CPA3
RH. Health facility staff who were interviewed as part of the final evaluation survey stated that
they were satisfied or very satisfied with the supply of medical equipment.

Training was a prominent part of HSSP1 activities and involved all categories of health workers
and health managers at all levels of the system. Annex provides a list of the total number of staff
by category and sex who were trained under HSSP1 auspices.

The affordability strategy to improve quality and make services affordable at the same time
included contracting of OD and of NGO and the extension of several schemes of health equity
funds. Support for Community Based Health Insurances was not part of HSSP1 financing. HEFs
have shown better effectiveness in improving access when combined with other demand-side
strategies, such as CBHI and voucher schemes for maternal health services, and with supply-side
strategies such as contracting and the national targeted program of incentives for midwives.

The number of ODs with HEFs increased sharply under the review period, especially in 2007 and
2008. By 31 December 2008, 50 of the 76 OD of the country were operating an HEF, of which 9
were under the MoH subsidy scheme (1 with co-funding in Kampong Chhnang) and 41 with
Health Partners’ funding (29 under HSSP co-funding, and 13 under bilateral funding). In
addition, the MoH subsidy covered 6 national hospitals, 5 since September 2007. By December
2008, HEFs were implemented in 51 referral hospitals and 120 HCs. Implementation of HEFs at
HCs was still relatively limited at Project end, and depended on facilities’ accreditation to the
minimum standards set by the MoH. At the end of 2008, HEF coverage at RH level was 74% and
13% at HC level.

HEF benefit packages were relatively similar in their overall scope but there was a lack of
common arrangements: there was room for harmonization and review of some targeting strategies.
Although Reproductive Health was not included in the original project design, it gained
momentum with UNFPA becoming a partner in HSSP1. Interventions that were supported by
HSSP1/UNFPA for reproductive health included national level support through national
programs and departments of the Ministry of Health, and through health service delivery support.

                                                 51
At the Human Resource Department at the Ministry of Health, support was provided for a range
of activities including human resource planning, development of standards for training and
accreditation, extension of human resource data bases, strengthening of continuing education
systems (regional meetings), revision of training curricula and curriculum development and
review, implementation of training programs (CPA surgery, midwifery), and implementation of
primary nurse midwifery training programs in the north east of the country. Training formed a
significant part of the reproductive health investment. Training was conducted through Regional
Training Centers and covered areas such as use of the partograph, IUD insertions, life-saving
skills, management of the third stage of labor, maternal death audits, refresher training for
midwives, and community based distribution of essential reproductive health commodities.
Aside from government health staff, training was also provided for CBD agents in birth spacing.
RH outcome indicators have improved considerably. ANC2 coverage climbed from 29% in 2002
to 81% in 2009. Deliveries in health facilities have increased by a factor of 3.6 in a 5 year period
to 39% in 2009. The distribution of MPA kits to 901 HCs and of 56 CPA2/3 kits to referral
hospitals has greatly contributed to this success. All these interventions and activities have
contributed to the decline of the MMR as noted earlier.

Over the last decade there has consistently been an estimated 2 million Cambodians at risk of
malaria with 75% of these people living within 1 km of high transmission areas (forest). HSSP1
activities were funded to strengthen malaria services in health facilities, particularly in high-risk
geographical areas, mainly through monitoring and supervisory visit activities, but also limited
civil works and equipment procurement. In addition, funding was dedicated to further integrate
malaria activities within health service delivery. Support for institutional strengthening was
focused mainly on a series of training programs, as well as monitoring and supervisory field visits.
During the Project period, there were major improvements in malaria outcomes. In 2008, malaria
dropped from being the third most common cause of outpatient attendance to being the eighth,
and 0.7% of all outpatient attendance. This significant decline is mirrored by the change in
percent of inpatient hospitalizations due to malaria, dropping more than two-fold to 1.8%. The
once leading cause of mortality in hospitals in 2003 dropped three times to 3.4% of all deaths, or
the sixth leading cause. Improved case management and the utilization of ITNs both supported
by the Project were the driving forces. The percent population at risk who are living in Malaria
endemic areas and received ITNs increased substantially between 2003 and 2008, rising from
49% in 2003 to 76% in 2008. This positive development was strongly facilitated by the
involvement of Village Health Volunteers and multiple training and supervision activities at all
levels.

Like the malaria village health volunteer program, Dengue could have benefited from a
community-based approach to monitoring the disease. However, the program was limited to
epidemiological surveillance. The importance of other surveillance such as entomological
surveillance and environmental surveillance was recognized but the program was under-funded.
In particular vector control needed to be intensified, but also health workers needed to be better
prepared for diagnostics and treatment, especially of dengue hemorrhagic fever.
HSSP1 financed supervision, training, technical assistance, minor civil works, as well as
supporting activities to control the spread of TB in AIDS patients and providing better care to the
TB/HIV positive patients. Along with the HSSP1 inputs, there was also financial support from
other development partners for TB prevention and control activities including from JICA, the
Canadian International Development Agency, WHO and later support from the Global Fund
(Round 2 and Round 5). From 2003 to 2008, all TB related indicators have improved: the
number of TB cases detected increased from 28,386 to 35,466, the case detection rate from 59%
to 69%, the cure rate from 89% to 91%, the DOTS coverage from 75% to 100%, the number of
health facilities implementing DOTS from 704 to 943. In addition to the various IEC materials

                                                52
developed and disseminated, a substantial community village health volunteer network was also
established, with key informant interviews indicating that the village health volunteer network
was a significant factor in achieving CDC outcomes. The TB control program is one of the best
integrated vertical programs. This promotes program success as well as strengthening the entire
PHC system.

IMCI was steadily scaled up over the past decade and covered most HCs and hospitals in the
country. In 2009, IMCI was implemented in all municipalities and 24 provinces and covered 70
ODs (92%) and 751 HCs (78%). Training of health workers was the core activity of IMCI.
HSSP1 supported basic training courses for HC/HP, RH, OD and PHD level (11 days) and for
TOT (5 days). About 80% of all HCs now had at least two health workers trained in IMCI by
Project end, and an estimated two thirds of them practiced IMCI regularly. Observation and
interviews confirmed that real and perceived quality improvements were significant, even if there
were still quality challenges. Health workers in all visited HCs during final evaluation confirmed
that the utilization of child health services had greatly increased with the introduction of IMCI
and because of it. The attendance of under-five children in health services has risen from 0.17 to
1.1 new cases per year. Similarly, hospital staff have reported increasing occupancy rates in
pediatric wards due to more rational referrals from HCs. Intense supportive supervision and re-
training were essential for maintaining the required quality levels.

The HSSP1 nutrition component supported 6 key areas: (i) Infant and Young Child Feeding, (ii)
Vitamin A, (iii) Iron, (iv) Iodine, (v) Growth Monitoring, and (vi) Management of severe
malnutrition. One essential contribution of HSSP1 in support of the NNP was consistent and
continued training of health workers in the MPA 10 Training Module which focuses on nutrition.
By the end of 2008, 3,052 health workers at PHD, OD and HC level were trained on the MPA 10,
and 71% of HCs had staff trained in the MPA 10. Vitamin A coverage for children doubled, and
69% are reported to having received it in 2008. Distribution coverage to women of reproductive
age had increased from 11% to 68% in 2009. About two thirds of pregnant and of post partum
women received regular iron/folic acid tablets. In 2008, 74% of households were using iodized
salt, and urinary iodine excretion levels were satisfactory. Since 2003, 287 health staff have been
trained in the management of severe malnutrition.

Planning was one of the most successful activities implemented in the framework of HSSP1 and
more specifically in the framework of the National HSP1 2003 – 2007. Planning was organized
at all levels of the chain of command. With project funding, the MoH introduced a rolling
medium-term (3-4 years) planning process and redefined the planning roles of the central,
provincial, and district levels. The project supported the progressive decentralization of the
planning process and the integration of planning and budgeting activities. HSSP1 contributed to
the organization of annual sector reviews, which were carried out by an independent organization,
with oversight from a suitable institution within MoH responsible for contracting and managing
the reviews, disseminating the findings, and incorporating them into MoH policy-making and
planning processes. The establishment of the annual health sector review and planning process
(to be followed by HSSP review of allocations to specific project activities) was beneficial for
this new and evolving sub-component. The national HIS has been collecting data on routine
health service activities and public health priorities at all levels from health facility, to operational
district to provincial hospital. Disaggregated data by age group, sex, and geographical
distribution were available for a limited number of indicators. The HIS did not cover
administrative, financial or vital statistics.

During the design stage it was envisaged that a separate M&E unit would be set up in DPHI.
However, in 2003, the HIS Bureau was nominated as the M&E unit for the project with the

                                                   53
Deputy Director in charge nominated as the M&E team leader. Two local consultants were
recruited as health management monitors to monitor ADB and WB/IDA operations respectively,
reporting to the unit chiefs and they along with the international M&E specialist who came on
board in May 2004 assisted the HIS Bureau with HSSP monitoring. NGO contractors
performance was monitored separately by the Monitoring Group under the DDG with staff from
DPHI, DBF, HRD, DP, and DPM as members along with senior staff from the PHDs. The HSSP
contracting specialist served as the secretary to the group. Capacity building was conducted at
various levels during the project. In 2006, 202 staff from all 24 provinces comprising PHDs and
ODs, and national hospitals were trained in the use of HIS database software and similarly, 201
staff from the same units were trained in GIS use and the preparation of choropleth maps for
monitoring. In addition, in 2006, 42 participants from national hospitals, PHDs and DPHI
underwent a TOT in M&E and data use and analysis. Subsequently, a total of 111 staff from
PHDs, ODs, RHs, and HCs attended 3 day workshops on M&E and data use and analysis
conducted by trainers from DPHI, NHs, and PHDs. The HSSP M&E unit has also provided both
classroom and hands on training to PHD and OD staff in Koh Kong province and NGO
contracting staff from CARE in conducting Lot Quality Assurance Sampling Surveys in 2007.
The PHD and ODs have subsequently institutionalized the training by conducting LQAS small
sample surveys in 2009 as well. Evidence of the impact of capacity building on data use is
witnessed through the presentations made by PHD management teams in rotation at the monthly
Technical Working Group-Health meeting consisting of key stakeholders in the sector including
DPs, where trend graphs of key indicators are routinely presented and analyzed. Similarly, there
is greater use of data at the AOP quarterly and annual reviews conducted at PHD and OD levels.
Finally, presentations at the Joint Annual Performance Reviews conducted by the MOH also
show clear evidence of more in depth analysis of sector trends in key indicators; this is mirrored
in the JAPR/NHC reports through the project period. Since 2008, provincial league tables for
core indicators also are a routine feature at such national review events such as the JAPR and
JAPA. During the project period, JAPRs were conducted each year with wide participation of
stakeholders, including MOH managers, representatives of other relevant ministries, members of
the communities and local authorities, NGOs, and DPs. The format of the JAPR has now evolved
to include 4 task forces each of which is assigned one program area for review. Task force
reviews and presentations then form the basis for the sector review and the delineation of sector
priorities and interventions for the next year.

Monitoring of utilization of services by the poor is conducted through the health equity funds
monitoring by the Bureau of Health Economics and Financing and covers about 75% of the total
population of the country through the establishment of 50 health equity fund schemes. In
addition, data from the annual CSES and the five yearly CDHS are routinely analyzed to
determine utilization patterns by the poor. In 2008, after a major revision of the HIS forms,
classification by sex for all illness conditions at health facility level was introduced, thus enabling
monitoring of differential utilization rates by males and females.

The M&E unit within the HSSP secretariat was responsible for monitoring the project's
implementation progress. HSSP1 contributed to the preparation of the following: (a) joint annual
review of the health sector (JAPR); (b) detailed budget and expenditure reports; (c) semi-annual
project reports; (d) Health Management Agreements (HMAs); (e) annual questionnaire surveys
and beneficiary assessments; (f) mid-term evaluation report; (g) final evaluation survey; and (h)
final evaluation report. As the HSSP M&E unit was located in the DPHI, it has had a pivotal role
in instituting progress of M&E practices at central level. The first comprehensive assessment of
the HIS was conducted in 2007 and recommendations used for future planning purposes.
Cambodia has a number of effective tools and structures in place to ensure harmonization and
alignment in the health sector. The most important is the SWiM process which is gradually being

                                                  54
developed into a future SWAp. Milestones include the elaboration of regular MTEF, joint annual
reviews, close cooperation of MoH with international partners in the elaboration of the HSP and
other policy papers, harmonization through annual operational plans (AOP). In the future, the
MoH will further strengthen the dialogue with partners and work towards increased
harmonization and alignment regarding health sector strengthening, including partners like GAVI
and GFATM.

Project management was integrated into the existing MoH structures at central and provincial
levels. The overall direction and guidance for the project was provided by a Steering Committee,
comprising senior staff from the MoH and representatives from the MEF and other key ministries
as needed. Project management structure included a Director, a Deputy Director, a Coordinator, a
Senior Management Group (SMG), and an HSSP Implementation Working Group (HIWG). The
Planning Department had responsibility for project coordination, while the Budget and Finance
Department was responsible for project procurement and financial management. At provincial
and district levels, project management primarily involved the Technical and Account and
Finance bureaus. In order to clearly define the expectations and responsibilities of both the MoH
and the provincial authorities under the Project, Health Management Agreements (HMA)
between the MoH and the Provincial Health Departments (PHDs) were implemented for each of
the twelve provinces under WB-HSSP and nine provinces under ADB-HSSP. HSSP1 inputs are
a mix of institutional, financial and social sustainability strategies, but with a weighting towards
the expansion of a supply driven model of public health service provision, with built in
mechanisms for strengthening demand for health services, especially for specific vulnerable
population groups.

HSSP1 gains in institutional sustainability include the Health Planning and M&E system, the
SWiM process, experience of health contracting, and the extension of HEFs. Further effort is
required in terms of private sector partnerships and decentralization and de-concentration
processes.

Findings from the final evaluation’s HEF survey 13 , qualitative survey 14 and health facility
survey 15 are provide evidence of improvements in quality and utilization of public health services
in Cambodia:

There is a perception by the communities and respondents that health services are now more
affordable. Only 1.2% of respondents in the health facility survey considered that health services
were “too expensive.? This was reinforced by the qualitative surveys which demonstrated that
one of the attractions of the public sector was that it was not as expensive as the private sector.
The impression of respondents in the qualitative survey that facilities are cleaner and more
hygienic, was reinforced in the facility survey from both a provider and client perspective.
In the qualitative surveys, although some respondents reported poor behavior of providers, most
were reporting that in recent years the attitudes of public health providers had improved. This
finding is reinforced by the findings of the facility survey. 80% of client respondents in the
facility survey reported that the politeness of health workers was good (the highest ranked
response).

Although the facility survey demonstrated that the clinical care and observations for maternal
health and ante-natal care showed many shortcomings, results for clinical checklists indicated
significantly better results than for adult health. This was also reinforced by the qualitative
survey in several ways.

Annex 7. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders
Meetings were held with health sector donors and key stakeholders both individually and
as a group. The comments below are sourced from these meetings, as well as HSSP
completion reports prepared by DFID and ADB.
General comments
For all donors HSSP was a new way of working in the sector. Three major financiers
(the World Bank, ADB and DFID) began work in parallel and UNFPA joined from 2004.
All made use of the same PMU in MOH, and worked under the common framework of
the HSP1. HSSP can thus be seen as a set of projects under a single umbrella – what
MOH dubbed a SWIM approach. The advantages included joint planning between
donors, MOH and NGOs, and the centralization of monitoring and administration in the
PMU, which was located in MOH.
The Technical Working Group for Health, co-chaired by MOH and WHO, and the Health
Partners Group, chaired by WHO, were important forums for keeping other donors
informed and for engaging in wider policy and strategic discussions.
Several donors felt that procurement procedures in HSSP were too slow and cumbersome.
However, despite the difficulties and delays in the civil works program, most donors
approved of MOH’s Health Coverage Plan and HSSP’s large infrastructure component to
support this.
Some donors thought that the role of HEF operators needed to be strengthened in order to
counterbalance the power and influence of service providers.
Early in HSSP there were significant advances, with MOH developing its AOPs and
3YRPs. The PMU functions, however, were not integrated into MOH, raising questions
about the Ministry’s vision and commitment to sector-wide thinking, and donors’
expectations of MOH.
There was a consensus among donors that HSSP successfully balanced supply and
demand interventions and this was a considerable achievement. It led to an improvement
in services and user attitudes towards them.
ADB
The ADB completion report in 2010 rated its parallel HSSP successful overall, based on
criteria of relevance, effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability. The project was seen as
successful in supporting the health sector, achieving improvements in health outcomes,
and initiating policy reforms necessary for long-term sector development. Its focus on
expanding access and increasing affordability of health services while putting in place
measures to improve quality were seen as highly relevant to the needs of the country.
The project achieved most of the targets set at appraisal for health outcome indicators.
In expansion of health facility coverage, the project made impressive gains. The ADB
project constructed or renovated 50 HCs, established 7 emergency units at referral
hospitals, and built 15 health posts. Of the 95 MPA medical equipment and supply kits
planned to be provided at appraisal, the project provided 93. NGO contracting of health
services in 10 ODs substantially increased access, utilization, and coverage of all key
reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health indicators. In two of the ODs, project

                                            57
interventions targeted ethnic minorities. As a result of strengthened provision of primary
health care, the project achieved its objectives by: (i) improving access to, and quality of,
health services; and (ii) establishing a foundation for increasing efficiency and
sustainability through user fees and HEFs.
The earlier success of trials in contracting of health services under ADB funding
provided the foundation for MOH’s introduction of internal contracting arrangements
based on the government’s Policy on Public Service Delivery (2006) and adoption of
MOH’s procedures and guidelines on contracting. Many innovative features first
developed under NGO contracting were adopted for internal contracting, including
performance incentive schemes, monitoring indicators, M&E approaches and tools, and
supervision arrangements. Internal contracting included performance agreements
between the MOH and PHDs, and service delivery contracts between the PHDs and ODs
or referral hospitals.
Building on lessons from the earlier ADB-funded Basic Health Services Project, the
ADB Health Sector Support Project gave greater emphasis to close monitoring and
supervision by MOH to ensure that civil works were coordinated with the supply of
equipment and drugs under MPA and CPA guidelines. More efficient planning and
closer oversight by MOH would have allowed timely completion of civil works and
avoided cost overruns. To improve the quality of civil works, implementation
arrangements should have incorporated closer supervision and monitoring at all levels.
In support of MOH’s sector-wide management strategy, ADB participated in a joint
monitoring and management approach along with other partners which proved the
benefits of close collaboration between health partners. While HSSP was co-financed by
different donors and implemented through a single PMU under the SWIM approach, the
project was administered by each donor agency with different implementation schedules.
ADB funded activities were closed in 2009 while the World Bank portion of HSSP was
extended to complete the construction of health facilities. This resulted in different
reporting arrangements including project completion reports. The SWIM approach
significantly helped MOH to improve planning and coordination in project
implementation, avoided duplication, and provided the basis for a broader SWAp.
However, the process of harmonization and coordination of various activities between the
partners challenged and slowed implementation progress. Considerable time and effort
was spent on the harmonization process.
UNFPA
UNFPA’s decision to join HSSP in 2004 was the result of a global UNFPA policy to join
in-country sector programs wherever these were being established. This proved to be a
difficult decision as MOH was keen for UNFPA to continue providing its assistance
using a project arrangement. UNFPA favored the SWIM approach because it would help
to strengthen health systems, leverage resources and decrease the risk of fraud through
joint auditing processes and improved governance. However, UNFPA continued to
manage its activities and procurement separately.




                                             58
DFID
DFID saw previous health sector support as being led by WHO, with World Bank and
ADB activities running as separate and weakly coordinated projects. The SWIM
approach required some adjustment on all sides. Some donors outside HSSP
occasionally felt excluded from discussions with MOH (e.g., during semi-annual review
missions), but over time, communication and trust improved and paved the way for a
much wider donor grouping in HSSP2.
Until late 2005, when the World Bank deployed a Senior Health Specialist, DFID was the
only HSSP donor with a specialist adviser in country. This meant that DFID played a
significant day to day role in getting the management and coordination arrangements of
HSSP working well.
ADB was withdrawing from the health sector in Cambodia at the end of HSSP (apart
from some regional support). DFID noted that during the preparations for HSSP2, ADB
therefore paid less attention to government progress, decreasing the effectiveness of joint
donor advocacy. DFID considered that ADB had weaker supervision systems than the
World Bank for civil works contracts and that its construction was of lower quality as a
result.
DFID’s Reducing Maternal Mortality Project could not be managed through HSSP
because of its large safe abortion component. It was therefore run as a separate project,
even though its objectives were closely linked to those of HSSP.
In its 2010 completion report on HSSP, DFID noted that there had been significant
government reforms, but also a lack of government energy in tackling politically difficult
sector reforms, and that there had been significant reversals in reforms agreed with
donors, such as the abrupt cancellation of the MBPI and PMG schemes in 2009. This
shook the confidence of donors in the government’s commitment to health sector reforms.
An independent review of DFID’s role in HSSP found that there had been an insufficient
donor response to assessments of HSSP performance as slow and that this could have
been addressed more successfully with MOH and government. The review found this to
be ‘perhaps the single most important lesson to be learned from HSSP1’.
UNICEF
UNICEF felt that the SWIM approach in HSSP was a useful counterbalance to the role of
WHO in the sector. It allowed a more diverse range of views and technical advice to be
delivered to MOH.
UNICEF felt that the National Nutrition Program, funded by HSSP, was never able to
fulfill its objectives related to nutrition because of MOH’s decision not to contract
activities to NGOs. There were also poor linkages to other sectors such as agriculture
and water and sanitation. UNICEF felt that to tackle malnutrition in a more holistic way,
HSSP was ‘the wrong instrument in the wrong ministry’.
UNICEF was also of the view that there had been a failure to rationalize and limit
budgets for training in HSSP, allowing staff to use training as a means to generate extra
income through per diems and allowances rather than focusing on technical skills
development.

                                            59
USAID
USAID felt that HSSP complemented its own health program well. It saw the growth of
HEFs and progressively greater funding from government for HEFs under HSSP, as a
very positive shift. USAID cooperation with HSSP2 is closer as a result of its assessment
of HSSP. The shift from earlier contracting of NGOs for health service delivery to
internal contracting in MOH under HSSP was a slow and difficult one, but USAID saw
this as a move in the right direction. There had been many pilots and experiments in the
health sector prior to HSSP, and the project helped to solidify a clear direction and
strategy in line with the HSP1. There was good cooperation between donors in the
preparation phases for both HSSP and HSSP2. The role and performance of the PMU
was not conducive to improving systems in MOH.
MEDICAM
Medicam is the umbrella organization for NGOs working in the health sector in
Cambodia. It felt that HSSP’s alignment with the HSP1 was an important progressive
step for donor involvement in the sector. It also acknowledged the difficulties in moving
towards use of MOH systems in the Cambodian context. HSSP had a positive impact on
health outcomes, but needed to engage more closely with civil society and local
government and to focus on the accountability of health services to communities and
local government. HSSP support to Health Center Management Committees was
insufficient to ensure their sustainability.      Civil society and local government
involvement in the health system at referral hospital and PHD remained weak during
HSSP and the project did not address this. Such involvement is important in driving
demand to improve the quality of care. The government is shifting more strongly
towards promoting program approaches, and the success of HSSP was a factor in this.
HSSP needed more emphasis on promoting good governance and building a better
enabling environment. There was no linkage to the private sector.
