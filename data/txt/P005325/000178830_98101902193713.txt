INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEWMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF LEBANON
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Lebanon for the equivalent of $6.6 million to help
finance a project, which is part of its education development program, for
constructing and equipping primary and lower secondary schools, and technical
assistance for upper secondary schools. The loan would have a term of
25 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 7.25% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A "Memorandum on Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Lebanon" (EME-26a) has been distributed to the Executive Directors in
September 1970.       An economic mission visited Lebanon in October 1972
and is currently preparing its report. Country data are presented in
Annex I.
3.        Lebanon's economic system is essentially an open, free-trade,
laisser faire system, in which the private sector plays the major role and-
government policy aims primarily at ensuring fiscal and monetary stability.
In the Middle East setting, this and the absolute freedom of exchange and
capital transfer have particularly helped in making the country the most
important financial and entrepot centre in the region, attracting substan-
tial deposits of foreign capital and foreign investments, and creating
opportunities for various financial and trade services. This role has
been supported by the country's attraction as a tourist centre, the rela-
tively high level of education and the general atmosphere of religious and
political tolerance. The Government has sought to encourage private
enterprise in agriculture and industry by policies that aim at stabilizing
prices of agricultural products and that provide incentives to promote
private investment in industry under a law passed in 1967.
4.        The services sector includes banking, real estate, tourism,
educational and health services, transport, commerce and transit trade,-
and accounts at present for almost two-thirds of gross domestic product.
Commerce alone contributes 31% of GDP. The banking system developed
rapidly-in the 19501s and up to 1966 under a system of virtually complete
freedom. However, severe competition for deposits among banks, over-
extension of investments, and low liquidity led to a banking crisis toward
the end of 1966 and was followed by the introduction of banking controls.






- 2-
A rapid growth in commercial bank deposits since then, together with a lgE
in the expansion of domestic credits has created excess liquidity.
E The other major sectors are agriculture, industry and construction.
The contribution of agriculture to GDP has declined from 12% in 1964 to 9%
in 1970 in spite of improved production technologies, due to constraints on
growth imposed by the limited area of arable land and by the shortage of irriga-
tion water, Fruits and vegetables are major crops and are exported, mairnfly
to neighboring countries. Industry accounts for about 14% of GDP, and is
primarily concentrated in such light industries as food processing, textiles,
and construction materials. In recent years, industrfal production increased
about 8%o annually, and exports rose by about 30% annually, Construction
accouints for about 5% of GDPo It grew rapidly with investment in office
buildings, housing, and hotels, and accounts for about 64% of investment
expenditure, including some foreign capital.
6.        In the decade ending in 1966, the Lebanese economy grew at over 6%
annually in real terms. However, between 1967-70 a slow-down was brought
about by the banking crisis and the 1967 war in the IMiddle East. As a re-
sult, real growth in GDP averaged about 3% per year. The formation of a
coalition Government in November 1969 ended an eight months' period without
a cabinet, and together with the return of scme semblance of peace to the
region and higher oil income in the Middle East restored confidence and
encouraged capital flows, mainly from Arab oil-producing countries and from
Lebanese emigrants. An economic recovery took place in 1971, particularly
in tcurism, industry and construction.  GDP, in real terms, grew over 7%
in 1971 and has gained momentum in 1972. Following a decline in investment
between 1965 and 1968 (from 22% to 17% of GNP), the investment rate increased
to 18% of GNP in both 1970 and 1971. The private sector accounted for about
80% of the total. National savings which accounted for 13% of GNP in 1965
rose to 1405% of GNP in 1971.
7.        The public sector in Lebanon has a somewhat limited role, and its
relative importance has not inicreased in recent years. In the three years
1969-1971 total expenditures of government (including annexed and autonomous
budgets) were equal to 20% of the GDP, while capital expenditures were about
3% of GDPO The Central Government's revenues have risen by about 6% per
year from   1966  to 1970. However, while Central Government's current
expenditures increased substantially, its capital outlays decreased slightly,
Defense expenditures represent about 3% of GDP and expenditures on Education,
Health and Social Affairs amount to about 4%. The Government's current
budget has consistently shown a surplus which averaged about L.L. 100 million
a year, cove'ring about two-thirds of government capital expenditure.






- 3 -
Lebanonts balance of payments is characterized by   high
imports and a large trade deficit.  This deficit, however. is more than offset
by a surplus on services, particularly receipts from tourism and transporta-
tion, net investment income and royalties from oil transit rights, a
large but volatile inflow of short-term capital, and relatively small
inflows of long-term capital and    remittances from Lebanese working
abroad. As a result Lebanon's balance of payments has been almost
always in surplus and this is reflected in the growth of foreign exchange
reserves and net foreign assets of the commercial banks. Net foreirn assets
grew by 26% in 1970, 33% in 1971 and almost 20% in the first eight months
of 1972 when they reached L.L. 3,690 milLion (US$1.2 billion), equivalent
to eighteen months of imports.
9.      Development planning in Lebanon has concerned itself with an
indicative investment progran. for the public sector.  It was initiated
with the 1958 plan, which was only partially implemented and was followed
by the 1964 plan, which was interrupted by the 1967 war.  In 1972 the
Goverment adopted a six-year plan (1972-77) which includes a public
sector investment program of L.L. 1 ,740 million accompanied by indications
of the direction and size of private investment, estimated at L.L. 5,460
million (US$1,820 million). The main aims of the Plan are: to maintain
the country's 7% real annual growTh rate, to improve further the distribu-
tion of income and education, to maintain a high rate of employment,
to encourage balanced development of the different regions of the country,
and to diversify the economy so as to reduce its heavy dependence on trade
and services by modernizing agricullture and pushing industrialization.
Of the total public investment 21% has been allocated to transport and
communicationsj 20% to health and other -social services, 15% to agriculture
and irrigation, 14% to 'education, and 10% to electricity and pover.
10.     The public development expenditures envisaged by the plan average
L.L. 290 million (US$97 million) a year, while past annual investments
have been under L.L. 200 million, showing a slight decline from
L.L 185 million (US$62 million) in 1969 to L.L. 175 million (US$58 million)
in 1971. Administrative efficiency and coordination have been some of the
constraints to an accelerated rate of development expenditures in the past
and would have to be considerably improved in the future to prepare
projects and implement the higher level of public investment. Nevertheless,
given the dynamism and size of the private sector, and assuming no serious
outbreak of hostilities in the region, the achievement of the Plan's growth
target could be feasible. Public investments are to be financed mainly
from surpluses in the budget of the Central Government and the autonomous
agencies. The Plan also envisages a moderate level of medium and long-
term public borrowing, both local and foreign.






11.      114eeting the plants objective of a balanced sectoral and regional
development, that does not rely heavily on services which are affected by
the situation outside Lebanon itself, requires an acceleration in the
development of infrastructure and social services, particularly in trans-
portation, education and utilities.  A high rate of population growth --
about 2.5% per year -- and of internal migration have created urban con-
gestion, particularly in Beirut. As a result, the urban infrastructure
such as the water supply  and se7iera&e s;-stensms an_ 2oads, particula:ly in
Beirut, have been overstrained, and attentioii is neo;d!d if such strain is
not to affect tourism and business ser-vices, as well as li;ing conditions0
12.       Total external debt outstanding at the end of 1971 was US$73
million of which about US$10 million was undisbursed. Debt service payments
were estimated at US$10.1 million in 1971, equal to 16% of exports of goods
and net non-factor services. This is a reflection of conservative policies
of the Government regarding foreign borrowing and also difficulties of ob-
taining needed long-term funds for use in its infrastructure program. The
debt service is low, and the country's debt-servicing record is good. Lebanon
is creditworthy for borrowing substantial amounts on conventional terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LEBAINON
13.       The Bank has so far made one loan to Lebanon of US$27 million
equivalent for power development made to the Litani River Authority in 1955J
of which $15.3 million was outstanding on November 30, 1972. Performance
under this loan has been satisfactory and there are no outstanding problems,
Annex II contains a summary statement of this loan and of IFC investments
as of November 30, 1972.
14.       For some years, the Government pursued a conservative financial
policy; it was reluctant to incur foreign long-term debt and consequently
aimed at keeping public investment within the limits set by budget considera-
tions. lWith the drop in the annual current budget surplus, there was there-
fore a decline in investment in the public sector. The delay in the highways
project which the Bank was considering in 1968/69 was one of the consequences
of these factors. Howiever, with the restoration recently of a healthy eco-
nomic climate and internal political stability, particularly after the elec-
tions, the Government is giving more attention to public sector investment,
to be financed partly from daaestic sources which are now more readily avail-
able from internal borrowing and budget surpluses, and partly from long-term
foreign borrowsing, including from the Bank. The proposed education project
is the first operation to result from this new trend.






15.       With this change in circumstances, the focus of the Bankts
activity in Lebanon would be to participate in rtiuch needed ,nfrastructure
and social services investments, most of wlich are included in the Six-
Year Plan and which are essential for the growth of private investments
in the productive sectors, The Barns would also support efforts of the
Government to improve institutional arrangements for mobilizing long -
term local funds needed to achieve the Plan public investment targets.
Through its invoxvement in projects-In infrastructure and social
serv'ces sectors--such as education--the Bank would also contribute
to improving the present teclniques used for project preparation,
evaluation and implementation therebyT enhamcincig the capacity of the
administrative machinery to handle more efficiently-the large volume
of public investments contained in the 1972-77 Plan,
16,       In addition to the proposed education project, the Bank is
considering a highway project lin-ing Tabarja and Tripoli. This project
had been considered by the Bank in-1968/69, but was deferred on the
request of the Lebanese Government.  It has recently been revived and the
government funds required have been budgeted, The project is expected
to be ready for presentation to the Executive Directors later this fisc-al
year.
17,       Given the predominant role of the private sector in the lebanese
economy, and in the absence of sufficient local sources of long-term
capital, considerable interest has been shown in IFC financing. During
1971 IFC received proposals for a number of projects and approved its
first two investments in the country. IFC's $093 million loan to Filitex
SAL was approved in April 1971 to finance a $2;h million cotton spinning
mill; in June 1971, IFC approved a loan of $1.2 million to the
Lebanese Ceramic Industries Co. SAL for a $2.2 million project to -
modernize and expand the company's wall tiles manufacturing facilities,
Projects under consideration or for wjhich an IFC investment is likely
to be requested include textile projects, a dry dock project, an
agricultural cooperative, poultry, and greenhouse project, and a flatware
glass project; All these projects are still in a preliminary stage of
consideration,






-6-
PART III - EDUCATION IN LEBANON
18.       The education system in Lebanon is still largely patterned after
the traditional French model. Primary education consists of a five-year
cycle normally beginning at the age of six. General secondary education
comprises a four-year lower and three-year upper cycle. Secondary tech-
nical education and training is offered primarily at the upper cycle in
courses of up to four years. Primary school graduates who do not go on
to lower secondary schools can get further training in private vocational
schools, offering mostly commercial subjects, or in public vocational
schools.  Higher education is offered in courses of normally four to five
years in universities, teacher training colleges and technical institutes.
19.       Although all citizens of Lebanon are entitled by law to an edu-
cation, the Government provides only the srnaller part of the education sys-
tem. Consistent with the private sectorls importance in all fields, the
country has traditionally relied heavily on private schools, which account
for 62 percent of total enrollment, are sponsored by different religious
and commercial groups and vary widely in quality. However, in spite of
increasing subsidies from the government, private schools are expensive,
ranging from $81 to $203 per annum for the primary grades and $116 to $322
for the secondary level, and tuition costs are rising rapidly. iany school.s,
including most of the public schools, are located in privately-owned, rented
buildings uhich are ecpensive and often unsuitable since they were not
built for the purpose.   In 1971, about 8,L' percent of public prii.y--- students
and all Fublic lower secondary students were taught in such buildings.
20.       In primary education, 79 percent of the relevant age-group are
enrolled, but only about 65 percent of those enrolled complete it.
At lower secondary level, 35 percent of the relevant age-group are enrolled
and repeater rates are high. Most of the students in private lower second-
ary schools are taught by qualified teachers, but about 80 percent of those
in public lower secondary education are taught by primary school teachers.
At the upper secondary level, 32 percent of the age-group are enrolled.
Education at this level is academically oriented, and traditional in content.
The secondary technical education curriculum in industrial trades emphasizes
general education and theoretical subjects. The system thus does not produce
adequately trained practical technicians, which are in great demand, and
encourages graduates to seek office jobs at sub-professional level. Lebanese
universities enjoy a good reputation by the standards of the IHIiddle East
and cater to many pupils from neighboring Arab countries.
21.       In 1971, only 40 percent of primary teachers and about 25 percent
of lower secondary teachers were qualified. However, primary teacher train-
ing capacity has now been increased and is sufficient to produce a fully-
qualified primary school teaching staff by 1980. Lower secondary teacher
training began only in 1971 and is expected to meet the demand for science
teachers by 1981, but it is not sufficient to train the general subjects
teachers required.






-7-
22.       Lebanonts national outlay on education and training is high for
a developing country and amounted to 7.4 percent of GDP in 1971. Private
resources account for slightly more than half of this expenditure. Future
government expenditures on education are expected to grow at about 10 percent
per annum over the period 1971-1980.   IJhile recurrent expenditures will
grow slightly, capital expenditures, which in the past seldom amounted to
more than 4 percent of the government's annual expenditure on education,
will increase to about 10 percent. The Government's capital expenditures
for education will represent about 20d0 of its overall investment program
from 1972 to 1980.
23.       Planning of government primary and secondary education and train-
ing is the responsibility of the Mbinistry of Education in cooperation with
the Yinistry of Planning. The five regions of the country have Regional
Planning Offices, attached to the PNinistry of Planning, which include an
Office of Education, linking the local school authorities to the MNnistry
of Education, where all substantive decisions are made.   The government
intends to create a modern educational system adapted to the country's
current needs by re-orienting the highly academic system to a more practical
one and extending educational opportunity to all segments of the population
on an equal basis by improved public schooling.
24.       In line with the priorities in the 1972-77 Plan, the government
is focusing first on reforming, rationalizing and providing universal primary
and lower secondary education and increasing the share of public education
at these levels. This reform will start by (i) providing gradually compre-
hensive lower secondary schooling for all primary school graduates, (ii)
starting primary schooling at 5 years of age, extending primary education
to six years followed by four years of lowiier secondary, and (iii) improving
the quality and efficiency of education at primary and lower secondary
school levels, economizing recurrent costs and imDroving teaching conditions
and teacher/pupil ratios bj replacing rented buildings.   Total public and
private enrollments are planned to expand to 95 percent and 65 percent of
the primary and lower secondary age-groups respectively between 1971-1980.
To achieve this, the government will invest in the expansion of public
primary schools and the replacement of inadequate private primary schools. In
addition, it will provide facilities for about 80/o of expansion of lower
secondary school capacity. It intends, simultaneously, to improve the
quality of education by better and consolidated teacher training and by
the introduction of revised and modern curricula. Once this is underway,
it would then focus on reform of the upper secondary level.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed project would assist the government in implementing
its comprehensive education reform and development program for primary
and lower secondary education. It includes (a) the design, construction,
furnishing and equipping of 39 primary schools, 24 lower secondary schools
and 3 primary teacher training institutes, (b) the extension, renovation,






-8-
;nd ecuipping of one lower secondary teacher training institute, an2d (c)
the provision of technical assistance to prepare for the reform of upper
secondary education.  The total estimated cost is US $15.9 million (net
of duties and taxes), with an estimated foreign exchange component of US
$6.6 million to be provided by the proposed Bank loan.  I'he Government
would cover the local cost. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as
Annex III together with a map showing the location of the project insti-
tutions. A report entitled "Appraisal of an Education Project - Lebanon"
(PE-52a), dated November 29, 1972, is being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
26.       The proposed project was identified in May 1971 by a UTESCO mission.
A second UNTESCO mission assisted the Government in preparing it and it was
appraised by a Bank mission in February 1972. Negotiations were held in
Washington in November 1972. The Lebanese delegation was headed by ,Ir. Foued
Naffah, Ninister of Finance.
27.       The 39 primary schools included in the project would contribute
a capacity of student places equivalent to about 9% of total enrollment by
1980. They would make possible the replacement of about 24,000 primiary
school places now in rented -buildings and the absorption of about 7,000
students who would otherwise be in low quality government aided private
schools, which would be closed. 'The primary schools would adopt the new
curricula including modern foreign languages, mathematics and science.
They would serve as model institutions for demonstrating the application
of the new curricula and the use of new teaching methods and media to
teachers in neighboring primary schools. Five of them would serve as
demonstration schools for tuhe three primary teacher training institutes
included in the project.
28.       The 24 lower secondary schools included in the project would con-
tribute a capacity of student places equivalent to about 5 percent of total
enrollrment by 1980. They would accommodate about 14,400 lower secondary
schools places which would replace public schools in rented _buildings. The
curricula would include a commnon core of academic subjects and optional
practical subjects for all students. As options, ten of the schools would
of-ier agriculture and all schools would have home economics, woodwork and
metalwork. The schools would serve as demonstration schools for new teaching
methods and the use of new media and curricula. New examinations consistent
rith the revised curricula would be. introduced not later than the end of 1976.
29.       The three new prirnary teacher training institutes form part of
the government's program to upgrade and modernize the primary teacher train-
ing system. The institutes would offer 3-year pre-service courses at upper
secondary level and 1-year upgrading courses for unqualified primary school
teachers who have graduated from normal upper secondary level education.
Each institute would enroll 650 pre-service and 110 in-service students.
The institutes would also be used for in-service training of teachers and
school administrators during vacation time.






-9-
30.       The proposed project would furthermore provide new equipment,
furniture and the renovation of the building of an existing lower second-
ary teacher training institute to be used for training teachers, especial-
ly in social sciences and modern languages, and also for periodic in-service
training of directors of education and school inspectors. It would also
provide technical expertise to assess the government staff responsible for
planning the reform of upper secondary education.   This wi1 include up
to two man-years of services of experts specialized in fields such as edu-
cation planning and administration, education economics and manpower anal-
ysis, technical education, and education statistics.
31.       The Conseil Ex6cutif des Grands Projets (CEGP), which is an auto-
nomous office under the supervision of the linistry of Public Wviorks, will
be responsible for the construction of the project institutions and all other
construction activity under the Government's investment program for education.
As C3GP has had virtually no experience in school-building, the project is
expected to develop local school construfction knou-how which will benefit
the rest of the program. The proposed project schools are expected to make
an important contribution to refining planning norms, setting space standards,
establishing technical and fiscal controls for construction and in relating
planning of buildings to curricula changes and new teaching techniquet.
32.       A Project Unit will be established within the CEGP to be responsible
for the implementation of the project, coordination of activities with other
government and private bodies, and liaison with the Bank. The project Unit
would later help carry out the government's overall school construction
program.  The Unit would consist of a director, an architect, an educator,
and a specialist from the iinistry of Planning.  Appointment of the above
officers and the establishment and operation of the Project Unit, with
adequate accounting and procurement services, supporting staff and facil-
ities is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
33.       The schedule for implementing the project foresees acquisition
and survey of sites and appointment of consultant architects early in cal-
endar year 1973. Preliminary plans would be completed towards the end of
1973, and bid documents for construction and equipment purchase would follow
3 to 6 months later.  By late 1974, awards of construction contracts would
be made, and awards for purchase of equipment and furniture would follow
within the following six months. Construction of the first schools would
begin in early 1975 and continue through the following year-and-a-half.
By late 1976, construction and equipping of the project's schools would
be virtually concluded. This would coincide with the schedule for the
preparation of new curricula, textbooks, examinations, and other pedagogic
preparations.
34.       Civil works and equipment supply contracts would be awarded
under international competitive bidding in accordance with the Guidelines
for Procurement under Wgorld Bank loans.  Local manufacturers of equipment
would be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of the c.i.f. costs of
competing imports, or the generally applicable import duty, whichever is
lower. Lebanon has no preferential tariff arrangements with other countries.






- 10 -
Since Lebanon has an adequate and competitive furniture manufacturing
industry which could supply the reouirements of the project, it has been
agreed at the Government's request that the furniture for the project
would be procured locally and not financed under the proposed loan.
35.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against
the c.i.f. cost of imported equipment or 100% ex-factory cost of locally
produced equipment, awarded under the above procurement procedures.
The foreign exchange component of technical assistance and of site
devalopment and construction (estimated at 35%) would also be financed
under the loan.
36.       This project, and other new schools in the national reorganization
and reform program will allow for centralized schools within their catch-
ment areas, for improvement of teacher/pupil ratios, for more efficient
teacher use, and for considerable public savings through substantially
lower recurrent costs per pupil. These savings amount to US$1.1 million
annually which represents a rate of financial return on the investment
in the primary schools of 21.5% over a 15-year period and in the lowzer
secondary schools of 24%.
PART V - LEGAL JNSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Lebanon, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. The draft agreement conforms to the normal pattern
for loans for education projects.
38e       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
39.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approved the proposed
loan.
