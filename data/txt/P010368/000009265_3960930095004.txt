MEMORANDUM AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT
1.        The following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for SDR 40.6 million
(US$57.5 million equivalent) on standard IDA. terms with a maturity of 40 years
46       to help finance a Poverty Alleviation project is submitted for approval.
US$20 million from the proceeds of the Credit would be relent to the
Janasaviya Trust Fund for 25 years, including five years of grace, with
interest at 3Z per annum. US$36.2 million will be passed on to the Janasaviya
Trust Fund as grant for implementation of the non-credit activities, and
US$1.3 million to the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation for
creating policy research and program formulation capacity on poverty and
employment issues. The project will be cofinanced by the Federal Republic of
Germany with a grant of DM 15 million (US$10 million equivalent). Although
not an integrated part of this project, UNDP will provide technical assistance
equivalent to US$2.5 million to the recently established Janasaviya Trust Fund
which will implement the project.
2.        Background.  Sri Lanka is currently confronted by serious socio-
political and economic problems with high rates of unemployment and
politically unacceptable poverty levels. Despite commendable achievements in
terms of social indicators, e.g., high rates of life expectancy and literacy
and low rates of infant wortality and population growth, malnutrition,
particularly among chila.s , is out of line with other social indicators.
Economic growth has slowed down in the past few years against the backdrop of
unprecedented civil strife, exacerbating the poverty problem. The country
faces a difficult task of generating productive employment and income earning
opportunities for a work force which will continue for some time to grow
faster than the total population. Although the recently initiated adjustment
process is expected to accelerate growth to an average of 5.22 p.a. over the
next three years, the poor are unlikely to benefit quickly enough from the
adjustment process.
3.        The government's poverty alleviation policies and -rograms, which
include food stamps, school mid-day meals, and most recently the Janasaviya
program (JSP which provides recipients with a monthly grant of Rs 2,500), are
essentially consumption-oriented welfare programs. They are financially and
economically unsustainable and not well targeted. Production-oriented
programs, such as micro-enterprise development and credit are fragmented and
insignificant. Rural infrastructure is in a state of disrepair and is
inadequate. Policy and program responses, therefore, need to be broadened and
better targeted to enable the poor to participate in the productive process by
providing them with access to resources for self-employment or to wage
employment on productive rural infrastructure programs.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  This project is an important
component of IDA's four-pronged country assistance strategy which includest
(i) promotion of long-term efficient growth through adjustment lending by



-2-
addressing internal and external imbalances, reducing the size of the public
sector while improving its efficiency and increasing the role of the private
sector; (i1) support to agriculture, industry, energy and infrastructure;
(iii) rehabilitation and improvement of social services; and (iv) targeted
poverty alleviation initiatives to facilitate the poor's participation in the
productive process. Under IDA's Economic Restructuring Credit (Cr. 2128-CE)
approved on April 6, 1990, the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) agreed to reduce
the number of families in the food stamp program by better targeting, and to
restructure the JSP to make it more production-oriented, thereby containing
total welfare expenditures to within 3Z of GDP. In this connection IDA has
provided GOSL with assistance in designing and financing this proposed
production-oriented poverty alleviation project.  IDA's continuing dialogue
with GOSL has led to a realization that welfare expenditures must be contained
and streamlined. The project will further help demonstrate the feasibility
and sustainability of an alternative approach to poverty alleviation through
productive employment generation, which is a high priority in Sri Lanka's
development plans. The proposed project is consistent with IDA's areas of
special emphasis and complementary to other IDA-supported projects which do
not reach the very poor directly. This project would also support the
Government's long-term growth policies by creating additional productive
employment.
5.        Project Oblectives.  The major objectives of the project are to
increase income earning opportunities among the poor and to improve the
nutrition status of children under three years of age and pregnant and
lactating mothers. To achieve these goals, the project has the following
specific objectivess
(a) reorient and expand the existing institutional capacity to serve
the poor, and to create additional capacity;
(b) provide credit and other services for promoting self-employment and
micro-enterprise development through group-based financing and
entrepreneurial development;
(c) expand productive wage employment for the poor through technically,
economically and socially viable rural works projects;
(d) develop programs for nutritional interventions for malnourished
children and pregnant and nursing mothers; and
(e) create policy research and program formulation capacity to take
greater account of issues of poverty and unemployment in overall
growth policies and public investment projects.
6.        Project Description.  The project will assist the newly created
Janasaviya Trust Fund (the Trust), in financing credit operations, human
resource and infrastructure development, and nutrition intervention activities
of NGOs and government agencies. The Trust will manage four funds: (a) a
Credit Fund to lend to partner organizations (POs), which will onlend to the
poor in a manner prescribed by the Trust at interest rates which will make the



- 3 -
Credit Fund operations self-supporting; (b) a Human Resources Development Fund
for promoting the productive use of credit and for developing the lending
capacity of POs: (c) a Rural Works Fund for building economically viable
infrastructure and creating wage employment; and (d) a Nutrition Fund for
reducing the proportion of wasting and stunting in children and for reducing
the incidence of low birth weight and the prevalence of maternal malnutrition.
In addition, the project will support an Employment and Poverty Policy
Planning Unit in the Ministry of Policy Planning and Implementation.
7.        The project cost is estimated at US$85 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of US$5.4 million equivalent (6.4Z); estimated
taxes and duties are negligible. IDA would finance 1001 of the foreign
exchange cost and 681 of the total. A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Sri Lanka are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 9316-CE dated March 28, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
8.        GOSL has established the Trust as the apex organization which will
implement the project through P0. The President of Sri Lanka is the Patron
of the Trust, and the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance is the Chairman.
The Trust has a 16-member Board of Directors appointed by the President, half
from within the Government and half from non-government organizations, the
private sector and academia. The execu*ive arm of the Trust operates
Independently of civil service procedures and regulations. The day-to-day
management rests with the Managing Director.
9.        Borrowers from the Credit Fund and recipients of the grant funds
will be government agencies, NGOs, grassroots organizations (GROs),
cooperatives and financial intermediaries which lend to the poor. These
organizations would become eligible for project support provided they haves
(a) socio-economic objectives consistent with the overall objectives of the
project; (b) a proven track record in organizing and assisting community
groups; and (c) managerial capacity to identify and supervise small borrowers
and community rural works teams. Likely POs for use of the Rural Works Fund
will be the government agencies involved in rural infrastructure development,
selected NGOs and Rural Development Societies. Nutrition interventions will
be primarily implemented through NGOs and GROs.
10.       The ultimate beneficiaries from the project would be JSP families
whose income falls below about Rs 700 per month. They would be identified
through a community-based screening process from among the current food stamp
recipients. They would then be organized by the POs for production-oriented
work, which includes civil works, land development, and skills and
entrepreneurial training for self-employment and micro-enterprise development.
The beneficiaries of the Nutrition Fund will be malnourished children under
the age of three, as well as pregnant and lactating mothers.

11.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has already established the Trust
and nominated its Board of Directors and the Managing Director, who has
recruited the five department heads.  A UNDP-financed technical assistance
team is in Colombo for a period of six months to assist in starting up the
Trust activities. Agreements have been reached ons (a) GOSL's contribution
of an amount equivalent to US$5 million to the Trust's Credit Fund as a
provision for credit risk; (b) the onlending terms of the IDA Credit to the
Credit Fund and the minimum interest rate to be charged to the ultimate
beneficiaries which would not be less than the weighted average lending rate
(both short- and long-term) of formal sector credit institutions; (c) GOS8's
responsibility for bearing the foreign exchange risk; (d) the criteria for
evaluation of participating organizations for receiving loan and grant funds
from the Trust; te) GOSL's allocation of sufficient quantities of food
supplements to meet project requirements; and (f) the requirement for IDA
approval before amending the Trust's Charter during the project implementation
period. Conditions of Effectiveness would be: (a) transfer of US$3 million
from GOSL to the Trust's Credit Risk Fund; (b) signing of a subsidiary loan
agreement, satisfactory to IDA, between GOSL and the Trust; and (c) signing of
UNDP project documents, providing technical assistance to the Trust.
12.       Environmental Aspects.  No specific environmental dimensions are
included in project activities, which will be small-scale and primarily rural.
However, GOSL programs and NGOs that would in principle be eligible for
project support, attempt to assist the poor in several ways simultaneously,
such as group formation and skills acquisition. Experience shows that when
the poor become empowered through organization they are quick to address
environmental issues, especially as they relate to public health and
nutrition.
13.       Proiect Benefits.  Benefits under the proposed project are expected
from: (a) enhancing the capacity of participating NGOs and government
agencies to enable them to increase their human resource development efforts
and to provide access to credit for productive activities to the poor, about
half of whom would be women; (b) creating some 10 million workdays of wage
employment for the poor; (c) improving the targeting and containing the cost
of welfare programs; (d) improving nutrition among children and women; and (e)
creating capacity to analyze employment and poverty impact of macro-economic
and sectoral policies.
14.       Risks.  Possible risks include political interference in the
working of the Trust, and poor decision-making and sub-loan supervision by the
POs. To minimize these risks the project will: (a) ensure that the Trust's
professionalism is maintained by using transparent eligibility criteria, high
calibre staff and Board members and an NGO advisory committee to the Board;
(b) assist participating organizations in observing strict credit discipline
by helping build their credit mechanisms and capacity of ultimate borrowers to
make effective use of credit; and (c) deny project resources to POs which do
not meet performance criteria.

15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
