REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S. A. WITI THE GUARANTEE OF THE
UNITED MEXICAN STATES FOR A SECOND INDUSTRIAL EQUIPIfNT FUND (FONEI) FROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S. A. with the guarantee of the United Mexican
States for the equivalent of US$50 million, to finance the foreign exchange
component of the lending operations of the Industrial EAuipment Fund
(FONEI)..over the coming two years- The loan would have a term of 16 years,
including three years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Some of the major structural features of the Mexican economy -
past, present and future - were analyzed in "The Economy of Mexicos A
Basic Report" (192-ME), distributed to the Executive Directors on June 26,
t973s short-run trends in 1973-75 were covered in "Mlexico: Current
Economic Position and Prospecta", distributed on September 27, i974.
Another updating report on the economy is now being prepared by a mission
which visited Mexico in July this year.  Country data sheets are contained
in Annex I.
3.        For the three most recent decades, the Me dcan economic system
measured in terms of GDP growth, has been outstandingly successful. Since
1940, the annual average growth rate has exceeded 6 percent. And from
the oid-1950's to 1972, Mexico was among the few countries in the developing
world to combine sustained and rapid growth with monetary and balance of
payments stability. Inflation averaged less than 5 percent a year and the
dDllar value of the peso was maintained at the level fixed in 1954.
11.       Rapid and sustained growth was the product of successful policies
affecting the mobilization and use of both private and public sector
resources. The role of Government in promoting eooi2omic growth was expressed
on the one hand in the development of strategic infrastructure and major
utility industries and, on the other, in policies which featured price
support, import control and agrarian reform measures in the agricultural
sector and external protection and the provision of fiscal incentives in
the industrial sector.
5.        The sectoral emphasis of public and private investaent was
reflected in changes in the structure of output and employment and
particularly in the expansion of manufacturing industry. Agriculture,

nevertheless, continued to be the chief source of livelihood for much
of the population and in 1970 accounted for almost 40 percent of total
employment.
6.        In spite of rapid and sustained economic growth over this long
period, the combination of a high demographic growth rate - rising to
about 3.4 percent per year in the 1960's - and, until fairly recently
an emphasis on import substitution in industry, have prevented an
adequate absorption of the labor force in productive eamployment. Industrial
growth has been quite rapid - about 8 percent annually since the mid-
fifties - but could have been even faster if industrial and trade policies
had been primarily focused on exploiting Mexico's unique export
opportunities based on its contiguity to a large industrial market in
which labor costs are much higher than those in Mexico. It was only in
the early seventies that some important steps were taken to develop
manufacturing exports on a large scale - the system of drawbacks on domestic
taxes paid on exports and the "border industries" regime were introduced
at that time, and these have been so highly successful as to suggest that
a lot more could still be done. As it is, 40 percent of the labor force
is estimated to be still engaged in marginal occupations - relatively
unproductive and hence poorly paid - or to be openly unemployed.
7.        The Mexican strategy for development has, in the past, relied
on a combination of public action and private profit. The Government has
played a highly important role in this process, both in promoting key
industries, such as power and petroleum, and in creating a regulatory
and institutional framework within which private and social groups could
compete and contend, but which was both firm enough and flexible enough
to ensure overall continuity and stability. As a formula for growth,
this system has served Mexico well; it has however also led to a
sharpening of contrasts in income and wealth between people and among
regions. This was not entirely an incidental by-product of the process
of growth; the share of the Government in the economy was kept down
quite deliberately for many years, and the scope of redistributive
policies was necessarily limited as long as the tax ratios remained under
ten percent - among the lowest in the world. The Government played a
crucial role in the development of private commercial agriculture through
irrigation and credit policies and of industry through the provision of
infrastructure, education, social legislation and financial policies, but
it did not concern itself primarily with the problems of the poorest
sections of the population. While the process of land reform based on the
1915 legislation was sustained, the absence of abundant fiscal resources
made it impossible to develop major programs to improve the economic
status of its beneficiaries. The present Government, however, came to
power on a program of combining past growth policies with much greater
efforts in favor of the raral poor, and has launched a number of ambitious
initiatives in this direction.



- 3 -
8.        The attempts which have been made by the present adcinistration
(1970-76) to alleviate the poverty of the countrysiLde and to redress some
of the imbalances between rural and urban Mexico have several dimensions.
They include a revised Agrarian Reform Law (i971) and a new Federal Water
Law (1972), both of which are intended to promote a more equitable
distribution of basic agricultural resources. These measures have been
complemented by changes in the sectoral allocation of agricultural credit
in order to increase the share of low-income farmers and eJidatarios
(members of eJidos which are a form of collective land tenure based on
usufruct), and the introduction of higher support prices for basic
fooderops. The Government has also increased outlays for agricultural
research, training and extension services, with particular regard to
the needs of peasant farmers. Perhaps the most signLificant innovation
has been a new program for integrated rural development with which the
World Bank has been associated from an early stage.,
9.        The social and economic needs of the rurail sector have not
monopolized government attention; those of urban-industrial development
have also been stressed in the form of heavy public investment in basic
industries - delayed during the 1960's - and an innovative low-income
housing progran which has been financed with a five percent payroll tax.
Productive investment has thus been complemented, In the urban as well
as the rural economy, by institutional changes and public expenditures
designed to improve the living conditions of the poor. This parallel
effort has, however, generated several problems of short-run economic
managment.
10.       In 1971, after monetary and balance of payments pressures had
emerged during the previous year, the (then new) Government took stringent
action to control demand with the effect that the GDP growth rate fell to
3.7 percent by comparison with a decade average of 7.1 percent in the
1960's. In 1972, renewed expansion was stimulated by public expenditure
and the GDP growth rate rose to 7.4 percent. There was another year of
rapid growth (7.6 percent) in 1973 - but this time associated with an
increase of 21 percent in the GDP deflator which was strongly associated
with the impact of extem al inflation. Inflation was not the only novelty;
private domestic financial savings, which in the past had helped finance
sustained growth increased by only 11 percent, compared with an average
annual rate of increase of 18 percent in 1965-71; the inflow of private
capital was replaced by a net outflow; and private investment - particularly
in the industrial sector - slackened, reflecting some uncertainty on the
part of the business community and a declining interest rate differential
vis-a-vis those prevailing on financial savings instruments in the United
States. In the public sector, the fiscal deficit amounted to 5.6 percent
of GDP by comparison with an average of 2.7 percent in 1965-71. A major
share of the limited eapansion of real credit was used to finance part of
this deficit while net external borrowing of US$102 billion (2.4 percent



of GDP) was deployed to finance the rest. These trends were inevitably
reflected in the balance of payments, where the current account deficit
rose to 3 percent of GDP (by comparison with an average of 2.0 percent in
1965-71).
II.       Noting these trends, the authorities had, by mid-1973, adopted
a restrictive monetary and credit policy and complemented this with what
was originally intended to be an austere public finance program for FY74.
Taken together, these measures were expected to restrict demand and to
reduce both inflation and the size of the current account deficit in the
balance of payments. The results for the year indicate that whereas the
former objective was achieved, the latter was not. Monetary and credit
policies were, on the whole, carried out as planned; the rate of increase
of prices decelerated from April onwards, and a positive differential
between Mexican and foreign interest -Ates had been reestablished by the
end of the year. Credit was not hcodever allocated as originally intended
because the public sector again pre-empted a large part of the available
expansion. Higher than planned public expenditures and lower than
expected revenues meant, moreover, that the fiscal deficit was larger than
foreseen as were the growth rates of aggregate demand and of real imports.
The deficit in the balance of payments on current account thus amounted to
4.2 percent of GDP rather than the intended 2.8 percent. Net public
external borrowing of more than one year rose to US$2.4 billion.
12.       During 1975, the Goverment's original objective was to
achieve sustained economic growth under what were expected to be adverse
conditions associated with the world recession. The public finance program
called for an increase in public expenditures, which was to be partly
financed with a substantial increase in public revenues based on tax refonus,
and it was expected that the public sector deficit could be reduced to 4.3
percent of GDP by comparison with 5.6 percent in 1974. Given this, and
assuming only a moderate growth of imports in real terms, a decline in the
resource gap and in the current account deficit in the balance of payments
were anticipated. With a modest level of public internal borrowing and an
expected recovery in quasi-money deposits the intention was to maintain a
restrictive monetary policy while allowing a modest increase in real private
credit and on this basis to achieve a substantial reduction in inflation.
13.       In the light of provisional results for the first half of 1975,
and likely trends for the remainder of the year, it is now clear that the
objectives of this program will not be fully realized. The real GDP growth
rate is expected to be of the order of 4.0 percent, the current account
deficit in the balance of payments is projected at the equivalent of 4.9
percent of GPD, the public sector deficit is expected to be equivalent to
7.8 percent of GDP, quasi-money growth is ps'ected at 11 percent over
the year, and the annual rate of inflation is expected to be approximately
18 percent. In accounting for these trends, it is clear that the growth
of the public sector deficit is a significant factor. It is also clear
however that the world recession has had a much greater than exected
impact on the economy and has moreover been one of the factors that has
led to the growth of the public deficit because the Government has
attempted to counteract the slowdown in economic growth with increased



public oxpenditures0  The increase in public sector revenues has been
somewhat smaller than expected but will nevertheless amount to an
increase of about 1.8 percentage points of GD?, which represents an
important achievement in resource mobilization.  The relatively high rate
cf expected inflation and the relatively modest level of projected growth
oi qursi-money are closely inter-related, although the growth of quasi-
maney is aiso associated with a narrowing differential in the second half
of the year between Mexican and foreign interest rates.  The discrepancy
between the original targets of the 1975 economic program and its likely
outcome is expected to have a constraining influence on economic management
in 1976 and it is expected that the authorities will make a major effort
to control public expenditures and to limit the size of next year's public
deficit. It is also expected that money, credit and balance of payments
policies will be designed to reduce this resource gap. In recent
discussions with Bank staff, the authorities have stressed their
determination to take whatever action may be necessary to reduce inflation,
and to restore financial and balance of payments ecuilibrium.
14.       On December 31, 1974, Mexico's outstanding and disbursed public
debt of more than one year was US$7.5 billion. Net medium- and long-
term public borrowing in 1974 of US$2.2 billion reflected heavy reliance
on external as well as internal capital to finance the fiscal deficit and
some borrowing - as in 1973 - to offset private capital movements.
150       During 1975, it is expected that net public external borrowing
of more than one year will be of the order of US$2.8 billion, which will
amount to 3.1 percent of estimated GDP compared with 2.7 percent in 197L.
Both in 1974 and 1975 a very large proportion of new borrowing has been
in the form of financial credits. Mexico's level of indebtedness is
consistent with the country's projected capacity tc service interest and
amortization payments given the expected growth of real exports in the
medium term. The behavior of petroleum exports is an important element
in these projections. After allowing for the growth of domestic consumption,
the rate of growth of crude output and the export surplus will continue
to rise through 1980 by which time net exports of crude and petroleum
products are conservatively projected at US$1,000 million.  Mexico's debt
service ratio was 20.5 percent in 1974; the estimate for 1975 is 24.5
percent. The debt service ratio will probably be higher than this in the
remainder of the 1970's and early 80's but can be expected to decline to
about the present level by the mid-80's. The actual level of debt service
payments will, of course, depend on the management of the balance of
payments. The Bank's share of the public debt outstanding and disbursed
at the end of 1974 was approximately 12.9 percent and its share in debt
service payments was about 8.5 percent. These shares are expected to fall
during the remainder of this decade.
16.       Mexico is creditworthy for borrowing on conventional terms
provided the Government exercises due restraint in monetary, balance of



payments, credit and fiscal policies and, above all, maintains a favorable
climate for export expansion; its recent statements concerning economic
policies for 1976 suggest it intends to do so and it is our intention to
continue to monitor developments in close contact with the Authorities.
17.       In order to meet its financing needs to assure continued growth
with equity in the future, Mexico will have to strengthen its fiscal
effort and supplement that effort with substantial external borrowing.
Given that the countryls diversified industrial structure is capable of
supplying a good part of its capital goods requirements, some local cost
financing by external agencies is necessary. Bank loans in such sectors
as power, transport and industry are traditionally tied to the foreign
exchange cost of projects. Some local currency financing is Justified in
other sectors with characteristically low foreign exchange requirements,
especially for high priority and institutionally complex projects like
agricultural development in which there are substantial economic and social
benefits and which call for strong institutional support by the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEICO
Bank Operations
180       Including the recently signed loan for a water supply and
sewerage project, the Bank had made 42 loans to Mexico for a total of
US$237.7 mil14on net of cancellations; of these, 25 loans, totalling
US$1,239.9 million, were fully dtsbursed as of November 30, 1975. During
FY66-70 disbursements averaged some US$70 m4ition per year, increasing to
about US$123 mllion per year over the period FY71-75- Some 35 percent of
Bank lending to Mexico has been for agriculture and rural development
(13 loans for close to US$781 dl.lion), 32 percent for power (11 loans
for some US$71 5 mllion), and 20 percent for transportation projects
(11 loans for US$448 million); the remaining 13 percent of Bank lending
has been for industry and water supply. The execution of Bank financed
projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory0 A mnmber of problems
relating to financial management of the power, railways and ports sectors,
on which I reported to you in earlier Presidentts Reports, have now largely
been resolved. Annex II contains a suimary statement of Bank loans as of
November 30, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
IFC Operations
190       As of November 30,, 1975, IFn had made 13 investent comitnents
in Mexico, for a total of US$6909 zillion, of which US$36.4 million had
been solds repaid or cancelled0 The balance held by the Corporation,
US$33.5 million, consist of US$27.8 million in loans and US$5.7 million in
equity. A suwmary statement of IwC investments as of November 30, 1975 is
presented in Annex 11.



-7-
Bank Strateas
20.       The main objectives of Bank lending in Mexico have been to:
(i) support policies and programs leading to a wider distribution of the
benefits of economic growth; (ii) strengthen policies and programs
leading to continued economic growth, by helping to finance projects that
would, directly or indirectly, make significant contributions to output
and employment and by supporting institutional changes that would contribute
to more effective management of key sectors of the economy; (iii) help
resolve critical adjustment problems induced by Mexico's continued economic
growth; and (iv) complement Mexico's domestic savings by helping to
finance economic and social investments in a framework of internal and
external financial stability. In the light of Mexico's short- and medium-
term prospects, we intend, during this and the next fiscal years, to pay
special attention to projects that would: (i) make relatively limited
demands on the Government's budget; (ii) help generate public enterprise
revenues and savings; and (iii) have a positive impact on the balance
of payments, either in the form of additional exports or efficient
import substitutions, where Bank participation can play a catalytic
function.
21.       Bank lending to Mexico has evolved over the last few years to
the goals outlined above, as manifested in its sectoral mix and policy
emphasis. A Bank loan of US$70 million, made for the Las Truchas ateel
mill in FY74, for instance, was designed to further the country's industrial
growth as well as to support the Government's policy of industrial
decentralization. Likewise, a fertilizer project, for which the Bank
made a loan of US$50 million in Fr75, was intended to enable Mexico to
become independent of imported urea fertilizer in the medium term and to
provide support to the fostering of new poles of development in the
resource-rich southeast region and north central area.
22.       The Bank has, however, put special emphasis on agriculture by
making it the leading sector of its lending.   Our lending is aimed at
strengthening and expanding irrigation and agricultural credit programs
to meet the denands of the rapidly growing population and generate foreign
exchange earnings, raising the standard of living amd incomes of the
rural poor through a combination of dlrectly productive, social
infrastructure and productive support investments, strengthening Mexico's
institutional capability to use agricultural resources and inputs more
efficiently, Specifically, the Rio Bravo/Rio San Juan irrigation project,
for which a US$150 million loan was approved in FYr5, will help bring
agricultural production back in line with domestic and foreign demand and
benefit directly more than 100,000 people through intensive agriculture
and livestock operations on more than a quarter of a million hectares,
thereby quadrupling the incomes of small-scale farmers in the area.



The Papaloapan and the second integrated rural development projects,
approved in FY75 for US$50 million and US$110 million loans respectively,
are designed to improve the living conditions and productivity of close
to 1.5 million people. Another rural development project, an agricultural
project and two irrigation projects are now being prepared for possible
Bank financing.  In addition, we are exploring the possibilities for a
lagoon fisheries project and a tropical agricultural research and
development project which would lay the foundation for the future
development of hitherto untapped and sizable resources.
23.       As to infrastructure, the Bank's focus has been on the provision
of needed investments in key areas of the country, and the premotion and
implementation of institutional reforms and sector policies, including the
establishment of suitable pricing mo  anisms to mobilize resources to help
finance investments. The Mexico CGty water supply project, where a loan
of US$90 million was made in FY73, was instrumental in the establishment
of a specialized institution for the efficient management of water resources
in the Mexico Valley, cutting across existing functional and administrative
boundaries, and in the pricing of water to levels more closely related to
costs. An airports development project, approved in FY74 for a loan of
US$25 million, is supporting the Government's policy of regional integration.
Similar aims have been sought through projects in the railways, ports,
roads and electric power sectors. Further projects are being prepared
in all these areas, and will be presented in due course.
24.       The proposed project fits the objectives of Bank operations
in Mexico. Through it, additional resources will be channeled to
a sector in which investment must expand rapidly. Through the project,
institutional improvements among participating intermediaries are sought, and
the Government will be supported in its efforts to strengthen its
industrial sector policies to exploit fully the opportunities to export.
The proposed loan will be the second to Mexico in FY76. In addition to this
loan, we plan to present to the Executive Directors for consideration during
the current fiscal year loans for the railways and an agricultural credit
program.
PART III - THE INIUSTRIAL SECTCR
25.       Over the last 30 years, Mexico has cone to place a heavy reliance
on industrial expansion to achieve its economic growth targets. The
thrust of Goverment industrial policies has been to pronote employment
opportunities to absorb surplus labor, increase foreign exchange earnings
thzough a rapid expansion of manufactured exports, strengthen intra- and



inter-industry linkages to improve their competitiveness, and intensify
efforts at a wider regional dispersion of industrial investment.  Since
1971, the Goverruent has introduced policies which farther emphasize
investments in export-oriented projects and the estsblishment of a
geographically balanced industrial structure.
26.      M1nuf acturing industry represents today one of the most dynamics sectors of
the Mexican economy, accounting for 28 percent of GDP (as compared with
19 percent in i940), absorbing nearly a fourth of gross domestic
investment and proviiding employment for 23 percent of the total labor
force. Both domestic and export market demands have contributed to the
relatively rapid growth of manufactured output with the most important
product groups in recent years, in terxs of annual rates of growth of
output, being textiles and wearing apparel, engineering goods, metals and
metal products, chemical and petrochemioal products. The growth of output
in the last three of these product groups points to a changing structure
of the sector, from consumer goods to capital and intermediate goods.
Nevertheless, measured in terms of the value of output in 1974, consumer
goods industries - led by processed food products - still dominate the
sector with an estimated share of about 57% of manufacturing value added.
27.       Although initially Mexican industry grew up under substantial
protection, the growth of manufactured output from the mid sixties onwards
has been aocompanied by rapidly increasing industrial exports.  These
exports, which stood at about US$200 million in 1965, rose to some
US$1,300 million in 1974 (excluding exports of assembly industries along
the U.S.-M4exican border), accounting for nearly 46 percent of total
merchandise exports. Most notable gains in manufactured exports between
i970-73 have occurred in the categories of textiles, apparel and footwear
followed by non-traditional items, such as machinery, electronics and
automotive parts which, in part, reflect the growing integration that has
developed between Mexican parts suppliers and the U.S. industry and the
success of the export promotion policies instituted since 1971.
Industrial and Trade Policies
28.       Its growing export orientation notwithstanding, manufacturing
in Mexico is geared primarily to producing for the domestic market; less
than 4 percent of the manufactured output in 1974 was exported.  This is
attributable to an industrialization strategy, which. has placed much
emphasis on import substitution, resulting in a domestic market protected
by both direct import.controls and tariffs. Increased impetus to
manufactured exports came in 1971 at a time when export growth as a whole
was sluggish and there was a mounting pressure on the balance of payments,
threatening to slow down the pace of economic growth. Consequently,



- 10 -
special legislation was introduced to permit duty free temporary imports
of equipment and materials for export-oriented assenbly plants in the free
zone and border areas (maquila industries). Since October 1972, firms in
the interior of the country, outside the central zones, are also eligible
for maquila status. Thus, by the end of 1973, 5¶ firms in the interior
had been given maquila status, compared with 454 such firms in areas
contiguous to the United States. The results of the free zone and border
area concessions have been spectacular as estimates of exports for 1973
from these sources amount to US$577 in value and US$272 million in domestic
value added.
29.       To foster the growth of non-maquila eaports, the Government,
also in 1971, instituted a program of tax rebates (CEDI) which is designed
to offset the high costs of domestic intermediate goods to exporters
through indirect tax rebates granted as non-transferable certificates that
may be used only for payments of taxes. This program has been gradually
expanded and improved. Today, it enables manufactured exports with more
than 60 percent of dDmestic content to receive a rebate of 11 percent of
their export value, a rebate of 7 percent for products with 50 to 60
percent domestic content, and a rebate of 505 percent for products with 40
to 50 percent. A special 15 percent rate is allowed for goods with more
than 60 percent domestic content exported by trading companies. The export
incentives program, which permits duty-free temporary import of inputs for
products that will be exported by maquila industries, was also expanded last
July to encompass products with more than 20 percent of domestic content (down
from 40%). It is hoped that this broadening of the program will be
accompanied by a streamlining of the aduinistrative procedures to grant
these permits. Most manufactured exports with more than 50 percent domestic
content are also eligible for short-term export credit from a Government
Export Promotion Fund (FOMEX) at concessionary rates.
30.       In addition to these measures directed specifically at export
promotion, the Government has also initiated policies aimed at strengthening
industrial efficiency and reducing the costs of import-substituting
industries, thus improving their competitiveness. One such measure is the
denial of nominal protection of more than 25 percent to new industries.
Extension of this policy has so far been limited because of resistance
from business groups; nevertheless, a recent study estimates an average of
25 percent nominal and 28 percent effective protection in Mexico, one of
the lowest in any developing country. Nominal protection has increased in
recent years and the manufacturing sector retains a bias for import-
substitution leading to the establishment of high cost firms producing
for the domestic market. Import substitution in Mexico has however never
been carried to the extremes reached in many countries, thus preventing
exaggerated price differentials.



- II -
31.       The Bank plans to continue its dialogue with the Government to
find ways to provide proper incentives to encourage the establishlment of
industries in which the country has a comparative advantage.   In the
near-term, any significant lowering of tariffs and loosening of the
licensing system would be difficult because of its effects on the
balance of payments. The main thrast of industrial policy will,
therefore, have to focus on export promotions as has been done since
1971.
Industrial Financing
32.       The growth of Mexican industry has been aLided by a sophisticated
bankikng system consisting of about 200 banks of public, mixed and private
ownership with the central bank, the Banco de Mexico, at the apex. The
central bank is endowed not only with the traditional functions comon to
this type of institution, but also with powers to direct the flow of funds
of the banking system to industry and other sectorts.
33.       The largest publicly owned financial inst;itutions are Nacional
Financiera, S. A. (NAFINSA) and Financiera Nacional Azucarera, S. A. 2/
which operate as investment banks and provide long.-term credit to industry.
Their lending principally goes to public sector enterprises and together
in 1973 they extended 43 percent of all investment bank credits.
34.       To provide assistance exclusively to indckstry the Govermuent has
also set up five trust funds. The activities of the three adainistered by
NAFINSA range from temporary equity investments to the provision of medLum-
term loans mainly to small enterprises and financing of pre-investment
studies.  Two of these Funds have been the recipients of Inter-American
Development Bank loans. We have recently initiated discussions with the
authorities with a view to exploring possibilities for long-term financing
of small and medium size industries through the Guarantee Fund (FOGAIN)
which NAFINSA operates for this purpose; if our discussions are successful,
the Bank's involvement would strengthen FOGAIN operations, thus helping to
generate more employment and diversify the country's industrial structure.
We would also complement our operations through FONEI and strengthen the
support being already given to FOGAIN by the IDB. Banco de Mexico
administers the other two Funds; FONEI, the beneficiary of the proposed
loan; and FOMEX, which rediscounts pre- and post-commercial export
credit at concessionary rates. FOKEXts operations have grown fairly
rapidly, more than doubling in volume since 1970, reaching Mex$4.5 billion,
with over 90 percent of its operations in short-term credit.
/ The role of Financiera Nacional Azucarera, S. A. is specialized insofar
as it mainly finances the sugar industry.



- 12 -
35.       The private and mixed banking system is highly concentrated,
and many of the banks are affiliated to eleven large identifiable banking
groups.j These groups offer a complete range of financial services
through their ownership of commercial, investment and mortgage banks. In
most cases, well-established large firms have a close relationship with
these banking groups, which facilitates their access to finaancial resources,
at times for equity investments. For those firms that do not have this
close relationship with a banking group, access to term credit is lilitedj
they normally have to borrow on short term, with the expectation that loans
will be "rolled over" at maturity.
36.       Given Mexico's currency convertibility, domestic interest rates
are necessarily influenced by interest rate movements abroad. Moreover,
there has been a tendency to favor the use of short-term, high-yielding
savings instruments to support the growth of Mexico's investment banks,
which, in turn, have tended to pas,s money to the ultimate industrial
borrowers on correspondingly short maturities.  As a result, the share
of term-finance in total credit has never been high, and many long-term
investments had to be financed through loans on terms that did not meet
the cash flow requirements of the projects.
37.       Between the years 1970-73, industrial credit grew at an annual
rate of 8.4 percent, while total credit expanded at a rate of 17.5 percent,
reducing the share of industrial credit in the total from 26.5 percent in
1 969 to 23.9 percent in 1974. The declining share of industrial credit is
largely a product cf the Government's currently restrictive monetary policies
and its efforts to finance internally its growing public deficit.
38.       Finally, the role of the three stock markets in Mexico continues
to be unimportant, as Mexican tax legislation has tended to favor fixed
return instruments over equity investments, and as disclosure requirements
for publicly traded firms continue to be limited. The Government, aware
of this situation, has encouraged the merger of Banks and their gradual
independence from non-financial groups. Also, a Securities Market Law
issued in January 1975 provides for somewhat enlarged disclosure requirements
and greater regulatory requirements of banking transactions in stock
transactions. These measures ares howevers, applied with caution, as the
Governzent wishes to avoid adverse consequences in industrial investments.
39.       In sum, the absence of a well-developed equities market, the
limited availability of funds to meet further industrial investment
requirenents, and the concentration of much of the available resources
within banking - industrial conglomerates, have placed severe capital
constraints on medium size firms, especially those with limited access
1 Only two of these eleven groups are jointly owned by public and private
capital.

to the banking community. It is in this environment, that FONEI is
designed to play a key role in supporting the Goverrment's effort to
strengthen the country's balance of payment.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
40.    - The proposed loan will be the Bank's second to the Industrial
Equipment Fund. The project was appraised in January 1975. Delays were
encountered in reaching agreement on the interest rate arrangements for
this project, and an updating appraisal mission visited Mexico in October
1975. The appraisal report (No. 943a-ME dated Janusry 15, 1976) entitled
"Appraisal of Second Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project" is being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors. A loan and project
sumlary is presented in Annex III. Negotiations took place in Washington
in January, 1976. The Mexican delegation was led by Lic. Fernando Torres,
Resident Representative of NAFINSA in Washington.
41.       In 1971 the Bank participated actively with the Government of
Mexico in establishing the Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI), a Trust Fund,
with Banco de Mexico as its Trustee. The Fund was dLesigned to provide
supplenental term finance through commercial and investment banks to
industrial enterprises with capacity to produce efficiently industrial
goods and services both for the domestic and export markets. To support
FONEI's operations, the Bank made a loan of US$35 million in 1972, which
has largely accomplished its objective of having FONEI finance economically
sound projects that have a positive impact on the country's balance of
payments. The proceeds of the first loan were fully committed by June
1975, or about one year behind schedule due to a slcw start-up in FONEI's
operations. From its inception to September 30, 1975, FONEI had approved
56 loans totalling US$79 million equivalent and its portfolio on that
date stood at US$45 million; most of these loans arel in their disbursement
period. Of the loan approved, only about 15 percent - in both loan
numbers and loan amounts - have gone to new enterprises while the rest
were committed to expansion projects. The sectors benefiting most from
FONEI's operations were metallurgical products with about 22 percent of all
approvals, chemicals with 16 percent, processing of non-metallic minerals
with 14 percent, and electrical products with 13 percent.
ProJect Objectives
42.       In the light of Mexico's current economic and industrial development
situation, as described above, the proposed loan is designed to meet a



- l4 -
twofold objective: (i) to assist the Government in its efforts to
strengthen its balance of payments position by supporting export-oriented
projects and efficient import substituting proposals with reasonable
export prospects; (ii) to encourage financial intermediaries to lend on
the basis of more systenatic project appraisals. In addition, the project
would provide much needed long-term financing for industrial development.
43.       As to the balance of payments objective, FONEI has operated
within the general framework of the Government's industrial policies
and guidelines and has responded to priorities set within'this
-framework by financing economically and financially sound projects.
These projects, on reaching full capacity, are likely to generate US$65
million per year of additional exports, in addition to significant import
savings at competitive prices. FONEI has also oontributed to the
Government's decentralization effort by providing 80 percent of its total
financing to projects located away from Mexico City. The proposed loan
would retain the balance of payments objectives, but with a more pronounced
orientatlon towards export prcwotion. To this end, in addition to meeting
economic tests at international pricing standards, the ventures that will
be financed under this loan will be screened in the light of a project
profile prepared by FONEI's technical staff, and more stringent criteria
will be applied to import-substituting investment proposals.
44.       As to the systenatization of lending criteria, FONEI would be
assigned the role of encouraging participating intermediaries to lend on
the basis of project appraisal. Under the first project, FONZI has mostly
relied on appraisals done by consultants. The quality of these appraisals
has improved over tine. However, the participating intermediaries have
missed out on valuable appraisal experience while FONEI acted as a
coordinAtor between its consultants and the final borrowers. As a consequence,
project appraisal requirements were largely irrelevant to the intermediaries
who continued to base their lending decisions mainly on the strength of
client guarantees. To remdy this situation, the Bank of Mexico has agreed
to establish a mechanism to encourage the partieipating intermediaries to
carry out appraisal of investment projects; FONEI would reimburse to
intermediaries reasonable appraisal Costs when consultants are used, and
pay a fee where in-house appraisal units are established by intermediaries
(Sec. 2.03 of Project Agreenent), To assure suitable standards of appraisal,
an understanding has been reached purmsant to See. 3.02 of the Project
Agreement to strengthen FONEI's Technical Department through training of
its staff members, the appointment of new staff, including a Director to
provide appropriate supervisory guidance to financial intermediaries.
Direct participation of intermediaries in the appraisal process by fully
involving then in the review of the prospects of a project is expected to



- 15 -
induce them to relax their hitherto exacting guarantee requirements, thus
making it easier to provide finance to sponsors with sound projects but
without collaterals generally acceptable to financial intermediaries.
45.       To reinforce the selection of borrowers independently of
guarantee requirements, FONEI's on-lending rate to final borrowers will
be brought more in line with the cost of alternative funds. This, it is
hoped, would discourage the well-established borrowers, who can obtain
financing elsewhere, from applying for FONEI finarcing. Furthermore,
the release of these funds from the more established companies should
enable firms that most need the assistance of appraisal requirements to
receive sufficient attention through this project.
46.       Since FONEI's inceptions, its funds have been lent to final
borrowers at 11 percent, including a spread of 2 percent to intermediaries.
At that time FONEI's funds cost borrowers only slightly less than did
alternative funds. However, since mid-1973, under the impact of restrictive
monetary policies in Mexico and inflation, market rates have escalated
substantially, with effective interest rates in rec:ent months in the range
of 14 to 18 percent for long-term local currency loans. The Bank of Mexico
agreed that the interest rate to final borrowers would be 13.5 percent
when the cost of funds to the financieras is 11.9 percent, as it was
towards the close of 1975. This interest rate will be adjusted from
time to time in line with changes that take place in the average cost
of liabilities to financial intermediaries - which is published monthly -
whenever the latter changes by more than 0.25 percentage points. Final
borrowers will repay the loans in local currency and will be given the
option to enter into loan agreements at either a variable interest rate,
determined every six months by the formula mentioneid above, or a flat
rate, throughout the life of the sub-loan, determined as the prevailing
interest rate at the time the loans are made (Sec. 2.02 Project Agreement).
The spread to intermediaries on the funds supplied by FONEI wi1l be
maintained at 2 percent. This closer link of the interest rate structure
with the cost of funds should also help FONEI in the future to increase
its capacity to mobilize resources for its lending activities.
Management, Organization and Lending Procedures
47.       FONEI's Board (Technical Committee), which is responsible for
the formulation of policy and approval of loans, consists of nine members,
six of whom are appointed by the Government and the other three by chambers
of industry and commerce0 FONEI is headed by a dynamic chief executive,
but its Technical Departent will need to be strengthened as outlined above
to undertake guidance and supervisory responsibilities for appraisal
activities undertaken by intermediarieso Management consultants have
recently completed a study with a view to streamlining FONEI's organizational



16 -
structure and procedures and preparing a procedures manual. Likewise,
follow-up activities will need to be enphasized. Until the intermediaries
develop the institutional strength to conduct effective follow-up, FONEI
has agreed to carry out this function by instituting a standard follow-
up procedure, including reporting requirements on arrears from the
intermediaries on its loans. At the same time, FONEI will help develop
follow-up capability within the intermediaries with a view to transferring
this function to them as soon as possible. In the light of FONEI's
expanded role, the Bank envisions a close supervision of its operations.
However, FONEI's free limit will be raised from US$500,000 to US$750,000,
to take into account the inflation that has occurred since the first loan
and FONEI's greater experience with Bank procedures (Sec. 2.04(c), Project
Agreement).
48.       In line with Mexican laws, all financial intermediaries are
eligible to operate with FONEI. Houver, as in the first FONEI project,
only a small proportion of the 2(XJ banking institutions are likely to
participate in this program; of these, six financial groups are likely
to account for the bulk of the volume of operations both in terms of the
number and value of loans. Given these banking groups' managerial,
organizational and financial strength, as well as their geographical
coverage, FONEI's efforts towards this introduction of appraisal procedures
and follow-up will initially concentrate on them.
49.       Apart from feasibility studies, FCNEI only finances fixed
asset costs of eligible projects between the lower limit of Mex$3.5 million
(US$280,000) and the ceiling of Mex$37.5 million (US$3 million). FONEI
can land up to 70 percent of project costs; the financial intermediaries'
participation has to represent at least 11 percent of FONEI financing
with the final borrower providing at least 25 percent (new projects) or
20 percent (expansion projects) of the fixed asset costs. These and the
above mentioned constraints on the scope of FONEI's operations are
determined by its Operating Regulations. New Operating Regulations,
governing operations under this project have been agreed with by the Bank
of Mexico and their issuance is a condition of effectiveness (Sec. 6.01 (c),
Loan Agreement). Assurances have been further obtained that its provisions
shall not be changed or amended without prior consultation with the
Bank (Sec. 2.01(c) (ii, Project Agreement).
50.       FONEI's initial funding consisted of an equity contribution of
Mex$125 million (US$10 million) from the Government, a Bank loan to NAFINSA
of US$35 million which was transferred to FONEI and placed as an equity
contribution, and a Government loan of Mex$375 million (US$30 million)
which the Government undertook to make available with a minimum maturity
of 20 years; the latter was authorized in October 1974 in the form of
five-year renewable obligations with a 9 percent interest rate. These
funds have been fully committed. Based on its projected level of loan



- 17 -
approvals of Mex$1,200 mllion (US$96 million), of which about half
would be in foreign exchange, FONEI's plans to cover its domestic
currency requirements through colLections of outstanding loans
(Mex$95 million), and a loan by the Government (Mex$565 million)
carrying a maximum interest rate of 10 percent and maturity of at least
the life of the proposed Bank loan. The balance, that is FONEI's
foreign exchange needs for the coming two years, would be covered by
the proposed Bank loan.
Terms_, Procurement and Disbursements
51.      The proposed loan would be repaid on the basis of a fixed
amortization schedule of 16 years, including three years of grace. The
proposed 16-year term is warranted since sub-loans will be coitted
over two years for terms up to 14 years. No Link is called for between
the amortization schedule of the Bank loan and the composite of the
amortization schedules on the sub-loans since the Government would repay
the Bank loan as part of its equity contribution to FONEI's resources.
52.      NAFINSA would enter into contractual arrangeaments with Banco
de Mexico to transfer the proceeds of the proposed loan to FONEI
(Sec. 3.01 Loan Agreement). In line with sinilar arrangements made under
the first loan, the Government will carry the foreign exchange risk
of the principal of the loan, as it will be responsible for its repayments,
and FONEI will be responsible for the interest and other charges. The
Bank would disburse the loan against the CI? cost of' imports, including
imported goods purchased "off the shelf" from domestic distributors if
CIF prices can be established. Where CIF prices cannot be determined,
70 percent of the domestically procured goods would be financed. The
proposed loan includes a provision for reimbursing FONKI for approved
disbursements up to US$5 milion equivalent, made between October 1975,
when the new interest rate arrangement described above was instituted,
and the date of the loan agreement (Sec. 2.02(a) Loan Agreement).
Projeet Justification
53.       The proposed loan will contribute to strengthen Mexico's balance
of payments by helping finance projects with export potential that might
otherwise not be undertaken due to scarcity of long-tem financing. The
individual projects would have to show acceptable economic rates of return,
in addition to meeting sound technical and financiaL criteria.
54.      The loan will also complement the recent series of fiscal
measures adopted by the Government for the promotion of manufactured
exports, and will support efforts towards more flexible interest rate
policies which are conducive to efficient resources mobilization efforts.
Additionallys the project will be instrumental in fostering significant
institutional development by inducing participating intermediaries to



- 18 -
move towards financing projects on the basis of project appraisals,
thus providing credit to borrowers who have sound projects but who
lack sufficient collateral to satisfy other guarantee requirements.
Project appraisals will thus contribute to improved project design
and will enable the carrying out of economically and financially sound
projects that otherwise night not be executed.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUYENTS AND AUTB(RITY

C. PRDJECTS IN EXECUTION A!
Ln. No. 527   Fourth Irrigation Project:  $25 Million Loan of January 26
1960; Effective Date: March 1, 1969 Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Civil works to be executed under the project were
completed by the end of 1975. The loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by the present closing date of
June 30, 1976. Annual net agricultural production
values, valued in terms of 1967 prices (appraisal
date) are already at a level equal to 87% of those
projected at appraisal for full deve:Lopment.
Ln. No. 695   Fourth Road Project:  $21.8 Million Loan of June 26, 1970;
Effective Date: October 1, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Seven project roads have been completed and opened to
traffic. The remaining four roads are expected to be completed
at various dates up to the end of 1976, or about two years
behind schedule. This delay was caused by the lag in bud-
getary appropriations for project works and by increased
quantities of works. There have been cost increases on five
of the project roads for these sane reasons, and also because
of design revisions and sharp price increases since late 1973.
Ln. No. 793   Zihuatanejo Tourism Project:  $22 Mi:Llion Loan of January 22, 1972-
Effective Date: March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Most project-related construction in the Ixtapa tourism
zone was completed by end 1975. A Trust Fund was recently
organized for the provision of urban infrastructure in the
town of Zihuatanejo and the necessary works have been under-
taken since December 1974. It is now estimated that all works
related to this project will be completed early in 1976.
By that time over iO0 hotel rooms will be available in the
tourism area and another 400 hotel rooms are expected to be
in service by the end of 1976.
Ln. No. 820   Ports Project:  $20 Million Loan of May 17, 1972; Effective
Date:  August 17, 1972; Closing Date:  June 30, 1976
Progress in execution of the project continues to be
satisfactory. Appraisal of a second ports project, based
largely on studies carried out as a part of this project, is
under way. Port tariffs have recentLy been increased but
further increases will be needed within a year to put the
port system on a sound financial bas:is and provide a contribu-
tion to the financing of the port investments proposed in
the next few years including those in the project being appraised.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in that sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 824   Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project:   $35 Million Loan of
June 2, 1972; Effective Date:  October 12, 1972; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The loan became effective on October 12, 1972. After a
slow start due to organizational problems all funds under the
project have been committed by June 1975.
Ln. No. 825   Second Railway Project:  $75 Million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Effective Date:  August 17, 1972; Closing Date:   December 31, 1975
Progress in implementation of the Investment Plan, procure-
ment and disbursements is satisfactory. Freight traffic carried
in 1974 is considerably higher than in 1973, and early 1975
statistics indicate a continuation of this trend. Locomotive
utilization has significantly improved but freight car utiliza-
tion has deteriorated due to higher turn-around time. Tariffs
have been increased by an average of 44% for freight from
January 1975 and by an average of 22% for passenger services
from February 1975. While the financial position of the freight
service will improve substantially with this tariff increase,
the situation remains unsatisfactory for passenger services.
Therefore, further passenger fare increases and rationalization
of passenger trains would be necessary to comply with the
agreements under Loan 825-ME.
Ln. No. 834   Fourth Power Sector Program:   $125 Million Loan of June 23,
1972; Effective Date: April 13, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975
The construction program has been delayed by over a year
except for frequency unification, which is ahead of schedule.
Recently, the borrower has tried to improve its overall con-
struction performance by strengthening its construction manage-
ment and the results of the last six months have been encouraging.
The sector's financial performance is unsatisfactory and the
Government is considering remedial measures to improve it.
Ln. No. 909   Mexico City Water Supply Project:   $90 Million Loan of June 18
1973; Effective Date: April 30, 1974; Closing Date December 31,
1977
Physical execution of the project is progressing satisfac-
torily. However, disbursements from the loan account have been
delayed due to delays in the resolution of adninistrative
arrangements between the Mexico Valley Water Commission
(the executing agency) and the Federal Government. It is
expected that disbursements from the Loan account will soon
increase substantially reflecting the progress of the project.

Ln. No. 968   Seventh Highway Project:   $90 Mi:Llion Loan of March 1, 1974-
Effective Date: May 29, 1974; CLosing Date: December 31, 1975
The engineer-
ing for the six roads included in the project, for which detailed
engineering had not been completesd at the time of Board presen-
tation, has now been completed. The economic justification
of the roads concerned has been confirmed on the basis of
final cost estimates.   Construction works on two road sectors
have recently started. The project as a whole is hdwever
suffering cost over-run and is behind schedule for lack of
sufficient budgetary allocations. The matter has been taken
up with the Government.
Ln. No. 969   Rio Panuco Irrigation Project:   $77 Million Loan of March 1,
19T'h; Effective Date:  May 29, 1974; Closing Date:  December 31,
Very good progress is being made on construction of this
project and it is anticipated that irrigation service can be
initiated on a 10,000 ha unit of the Las Animas unit by late
1975. Owners of private land in the project area are largely
electing to be paid for their land in cash rather than by
accepting a 20 ha irrigated holding. This will make more
land available for forming ejidos than anticipated at appraisal.
Ln. No. 970   Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project:   $47 Million Loan of March 1,
1974; Effective Date:   May 29, 1974; Closing Date:  December 31,
Construction of the Sinaloa de Leyva Diversion Dam and
the first 17 km of the Bamoa Canal is virtually complete.
Construction will start on the Bacurato dam and storage reser-
voir, the major feature of the project. Negotiations are still
underway between SRH and the private land owners having water
rights (as part of existing Irrigation District 63) concerning
the size of holding which may be retained by the owner under
the project. These will take time but no major problems are
foreseen at this time in project implementation.

Ln. No. 1022  Airport Development Project: $25 Million Loan of May 28, 1974-
Effective Date: September 16, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The first group of contracts for this Regional Airports
Development Project was awarded in November and December 1974,
for amounts averaging 15% above appraisal estimates including
contingencies. Because of governmental budget problems, the
executing agency, SOP, has proposed a re-scheduling of the
future contract awards to extend the construction period by
two years. Such an extension would add additional escalation
costs. The government was requested to reestablish the original
project schedule. SOP has given assurances that this will be
accomplished by greatly accelerating the work during the next
fiscal year.
