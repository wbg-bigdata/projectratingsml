                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The technical assistance provided under the project has developed a number of relevant tools/ building blocks that create enabling conditions for the Technical and Vocational
                         Education and Training (TVET) sector to become more responsive and driven towards the requirements of employers and the job market. Those tools are now readily available to be
                         put in action, once there is a clear institutional set-up, funding, and policy directive to do so.
