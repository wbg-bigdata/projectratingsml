                         Cooperation, so that the project activities are completed and the development objective achieved by the closing date of September 30, 2013.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The following key next steps were agreed during the March 2013 mission wrap-up meeting:

                         Ministry of Labor/ Development and Coordination Unit (DCU) and Vocational Training Corporation will ensure that the piloting of the new business, governance and training models in
                         three VTC Centers starts during the life of the Project, i.e., before the closing date of September 30, 2013.

                         The contributions of the project to the institutional development of the E-TVET Sector must be widely disseminated in the remaining project implementation time. The DCU is to
                         conduct dissemination activities around the tools and procedures developed and delivered by the project to raise stakeholders’ awareness and understanding, and to encourage
                         adoption of such tools in moving towards a more employer-driven orientation of the sector.

                         The Bank Team will continue to provide intensive implementation support over the remaining 6 months of the project's life (four months at the time of writing this ISR).

                         Next mission is scheduled for September 2013 and will include a discussion of the upcoming Implementation Completion report.
