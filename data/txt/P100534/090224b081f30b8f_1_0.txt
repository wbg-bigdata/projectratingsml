                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The technical assistance provided under the project has developed a number of relevant tools/ building blocks that create enabling conditions for the VET sector to become more
                         responsive and driven towards the requirements of employers and the job market. Those tools are now readily available to be put in action, once there is a clear institutional set-up,
                         funding, and policy directive to do so. Concerning the piloting of the new business models at three VTC Centers, the actual start of training delivery is again delayed.
