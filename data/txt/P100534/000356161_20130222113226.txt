B. Project Status
The Project was signed on July 8, 2008 and will close on September 30, 2013. The project implementation
rating is moderately unsatisfactory (as of June 2012), due to extensive implementation delays in all
components, as well as delays in proceeding with the project restructuring, which was first discussed in
September 2011. The proposed project restructuring has been agreed with the Government and aims to
ensure and enhance the project’s relevance to Jordan’s National Employment Strategy (NES), which was
formally launched in June 2012. It would remove activities that are now deemed to be unachievable within
the remaining life of the project. The proposed restructuring would allow the Project to focus on activities
that are relevant and realistic in the current country and sector context. The disbursement rate is low at
17.2 percent (US$1.3 million out of the total Loan amount of US$7.5 million) and the percentage of
disbursed and committed funds remains at 55 percent of total project funds, with net commitments at
US$2.15 million. The low disbursement is essentially due to delays in rebidding the contract which
supports Component 2 (Restructuring of Vocational Training Corporation (VTC)), as the first contract was
terminated in January 2010 and the new consulting firm was contracted only in May 2011. The GOJ has

                                                     5
indicated that project activities after restructuring can be completed by the original closing date, and thus
has not included a closing date extension in its formal request.

Implementation progress of both the Component 1 (E-TVET Council Development with Employer
Participation), as well as Component 2 (the largest component related to the restructuring of the VTC), is
improving and getting back on track. Regarding Component 2, following some implementation delays
recorded during the May 2012 mission, the restructuring of the VTC is back on track and the piloting of
the models has already started with institutional Business Planning training in three selected vocational
training institutes, to be followed by self-assessment and a dynamic process towards responsive and
decentralized training modality.

                                    Development Objectives/Results
Project Development Objectives
Original PDO
Realign policy formulation with Employment, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (E-
TVET) operational mechanisms through the development of employer community participation in (i)
sector policy formulation, (ii) institutional development and reform, and (iii) skill development program
design and delivery.
Change in Project's Development Objectives
Explanation
The proposed project restructuring aims to ensure and enhance the project’s relevance to Jordan’s National
Employment Strategy (NES), which was formally launched in June 2012. It would remove activities that
are now deemed to be unachievable within the remaining life of the project. The proposed restructuring
would allow the Project to focus on activities that are relevant and realistic in the current country and
sector context.
Proposed New PDO
Realign the E-TVET sector with the National Employment Strategy by enhancing the enabling conditions
for employer participation in: (i) TVET institutional development; and (ii) skills development program
design and delivery by the Vocational Training Corporation.
Change in Results Framework
Explanation:
The Results Framework has been revised to reflect the new PDO and the modified project scope in terms
of components and activities. This would ensure relevance of the indicators and their close linkage to the
PDO.

Change to Components and Cost
Explanation:
Components 1 and 2 will be revised, and Component 3 will be dropped to adapt the project to the dynamic
nature of the TVET sector, by removing those activities that are not realistic or relevant to the current
country and sector context, and adding activities to support the implementation of the NES.

              EMPLOYER DRIVEN SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT

                                 RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1.       This Restructuring Paper introduces changes to the Jordan Employer Driven Skills
Development Project (IBRD-75610, P100534) and any required amendments to the project’s
legal documents. The proposed project restructuring has been agreed with the Government of
Jordan (GOJ) and aims to ensure and enhance the project’s relevance to Jordan’s National
Employment Strategy (NES), which was formally launched in June 2012. The project
restructuring has the following objectives:

   (i)     Revise the Project Development Objective (PDO).
   (ii)    Revise project components.
   (iii)   Cancel Component 3 (related to the E-TVET Fund).
   (iv)    Revise the project’s results framework.
   (v)     Reallocate funds within expenditure categories.
   (vi)    Cancel US$1.21 million from the Loan amount.

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The Project was signed on July 8, 2008 and will close on September 30, 2013. The
project implementation rating is moderately unsatisfactory (as of June 2012), a rating that is
warranted because of extensive implementation delays in all components, as well as delays in
proceeding with the project restructuring that was discussed in September 2011. The
disbursement rate is low at 25 percent (of the original Loan amount of US$7.5 million) and the
percentage of disbursed and committed funds remains at 56 percent of total project funds, with
net commitments (commitments less disbursements) at US$2.15 million. This is essentially due
to delays in rebidding the largest component in terms of budget (Component 2), as the first
contract was terminated in January 2010 and the new consulting firm was contracted only in May
2011.

3.       Project Status. Implementation progress of both Component 1 (E-TVET Council
Development with Employer Participation), as well as Component 2 (the largest component
related to the restructuring of the Vocational Training Corporation (VTC)) is improving and
getting back on track. For Component 1, while the E-TVET Council has not been effective in
fulfilling its mandate of providing employer-driven policy directives to its stakeholders, a number
of activities were completed and are considered acceptable project outputs, including: (a) well-
defined roles and responsibilities of the E-TVET Council and secretariat vis-à-vis other sector
stakeholders, which were endorsed by the Council; (b) operational tools to develop the E-TVET
sector action plan, to be regularly updated by the Secretariat; (c) procedural manual to create
employer-driven occupational profiles and initial set of six profiles for demonstration purpose,
through a participatory approach–engaging employers; (d) the know-how to identify priority
sectors and the identification of three economic priority sectors closely correlated with
employment opportunities; (e) tools to develop a TVET performance assessment system,
including sector performance indicators, tools for data collection and data analysis, and reporting
process (technical assistance is still on-going) and the development of the first sector assessment

                                                8
report that was endorsed by the Council; and (f) a communication strategy driven by market
surveys to better understand attitudes and perceptions of the potential TVET sector beneficiaries
to conduct well-informed awareness campaigns. It should be noted that these activities provide
the building blocks towards a more employer-driven E-TVET sector, regardless of the
governance structure that may eventually be in place (either the E-TVET Council or the Higher
Council for Human Resource Development envisaged in the NES). In addition, there are a
number of ongoing activities, as follows: (a) technical assistance to support the E-TVET sector
performance assessment system with involvement of training providers and employers is
underway; (b) technical assistance to support the development of a decision support system will
be deployed by end-January 2013. This is closely linked to the sector performance assessment
system, leading to well-informed sectoral decision making process; (c) TVET Sector Awareness
Campaign: technical assistance to be deployed by February 2013, which will focus on clearing
the current misperceptions about the E-TVET sector as reflected in the Perceptions Survey; and
(d) technical assistance to support the tri-partite working committee to facilitate the policy
dialogue among the education, higher education and E-TVET councils/boards to promote
awareness of their roles and responsibilities. It was agreed to proceed with the procurement of
this activity.

4.      Regarding Component 2, following some implementation delays recorded during the
May 2012 mission, the restructuring of the VTC is back on track and piloting of the models
already launched. Actions agreed in May 2012 were achieved: (a) the consulting firm finalized
the February 2012 consultations conference report, incorporating comments while revising the
models; (b) the business model, training model and governance model were approved by the VTC
in September 2012; (c) deployment of technical assistance resources is consistent with contract
agreements; (d) organizational audit, staffing plan and draft organizational structure are expected
to be finalized by January 2013; and (e) progress reports are being submitted on time to the
director general of the VTC so as to address implementation issues as they arise. The piloting of
the models has already started with institutional business planning training in three selected
vocational training institutes; and was followed by self-assessment and a dynamic process
towards responsive and decentralized training modality.

5.       As for Component 3, while a reformed and well-targeted E-TVET Fund can be one of the
strategic instruments to achieve predictable and sustainable financing for employer-driven
training programs, the mandate and the financial sustainability of the E-TVET Fund have not
been clarified. Moreover, the Fund continues to face a financial sustainability issue triggered by
the following: (a) annulment of the one percent training tax levy since January 2010; and (b)
allocation of 70 percent of the additional work-permit revenues to the National Employment and
Training Company. As a result, it is proposed to cancel this component.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

6.      Project Development Objectives

The current PDO is to “assist the Borrower in improving its TVET sector through the
harmonization of policies pertaining to the development of said sector and the realignment of
such policies with the operational functions of E-TVET, including the development of employer
participation in the formulation of said policies and in carrying out institutional development
reforms as well as in the design and delivery of a skills development program.?

The PDO would be modified as follows: “Realign the E-TVET sector with the National
Employment Strategy by enhancing the enabling conditions for employer participation in: (i)

                                                9
TVET institutional development; and (ii) skills development program design and delivery by the
Vocational Training Corporation.?

7.     Results indicators

The Results Framework has been revised to reflect the new PDO and the modified project scope
in terms of components and activities. This would ensure relevance of the indicators and their
close linkage to the PDO. (See Annex 1 - Revised Results Framework)

8.     Components

Components 1 and 2 will be revised, and Component 3 will be dropped to adapt the project to
the dynamic nature of the TVET sector, by removing those activities that are not realistic or
relevant to the current country and sector context, and adding activities to support the
implementation of the NES.

(i)    Component 1: E-TVET Council Development with Employer Participation

The consistency of the component’s design with both the National Agenda and the NES provides
a rationale for retaining the component. It was agreed to:

a. drop further project support or capacity development activities to the E-TVET Council and
   the Secretariat, performance based-planning, medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF);
   and realignment of budget/resource allocations in accordance with the established objectives
   and targets/results framework.
b. retain support to develop an E-TVET sector performance assessment system (ongoing),
   sector awareness activities (ongoing), and MIS/decision support system (underway) as
   follows:

      Technical assistance to develop a decision support system is underway. Stakeholders need
      to be guided by a dynamic performance assessment system that feeds into a decision
      support system. Accordingly, it has been agreed to retain this activity, including training,
      on-the-job training, and an MIS/IT system that draws on the TVET sector performance
      assessment system under sub-component 1.3 to build the relevant decision making body
      capacity of the E-TVET Council/TVET to develop well-informed decisions at the policy
      level as well as guide decisions at the operational level.

c. Add an activity to support the implementation of the NES: to better understand the mandates
   of three TVET providers (Education, Higher Education, and E-TVET) and the rationalization
   of VTC vis-à-vis the Ministry of Education (MOE) vocational education, technical assistance
   to support the decision support system, and implementation of the first phase of the
   awareness campaign as follows:

      Technical assistance to support the tri-partite working committee to promote a policy
      dialogues and awareness of the three councils (Education, Higher Education, and E-
      TVET) roles and responsibilities. Based on the persistent sector fragmentation and
      disconnect in the mandates of the three primary education and training providers, there is a
      clear need to address these gaps to develop an integrated education and training system
      with pathways to learning and employment at all levels. It would be very useful to
      adequately rationalize the links between the VTC and the MOE vocational education in
      terms of resources, infrastructure, teaching capacity, practical training, and outputs
      relevant to the market needs. Such a comprehensive review would then be conducive to

                                               10
       policy recommendations and legislative changes to the laws and by-laws of the
       councils/boards, as previously stipulated in the National Agenda and now the NES.

 (ii) Component 2 – Restructuring of Vocational Training Corporation
 Within the proposed restructuring, it is critical to determine the effectiveness of VTC
 interventions and allow for evidence-based decision making in the sector. Technical assistance
 would support VTC M&E system to regularly collect and analyze data, and provide the VTC
 Board and the E-TVET Council with credible and accurate information to guide decision
 making. This would also strengthen VTC’s position while reaching out to the employers’
 community to open new business channels in response to market skills requirements. This is
 not an entirely new activity, as it was already in the project design. The Bank has already
 cleared the terms of reference, and the technical assistance firm is expected to be deployed by
 January 2013. This needs to be coordinated with activities under sub-component 1.3 whereby
 capacity building of TVET providers to produce performance assessment system oriented
 reports is already included as well as the ongoing technical assistance related to the
 restructuring of VTC.

 (iii) Component 3 – Strengthening of the E-TVET Training and Employment Fund
 Component 3 will be dropped from the Project. While a reformed and well-targeted E-TVET
 Fund can be one of the strategic instruments to achieve predictable and sustainable financing
 for employer-driven training programs, lack of clarity concerning the immediate future of the
 Fund, its mandate and sources of financing prevents it from being supported by the project.

9. Detailed presentation of the Proposed Changes:

  Component 1: E-TVET System and Council Development with Employer Participation (original
  cost US$1.9 million; revised cost US$0.9 million)
  Sub-component 1.1: E-TVET Council Orientation and Capacity Development. The objective of
  this sub-component is to: (i) to build a common understanding of employment driven TVET systems,
  structures, and operational practices amongst the E-TVET Council members and TVET Stakeholders
  (National Center for Human Resources Development (NCHRD), E-TVET Fund, Private and public TVET
  training Providers employers, and Federations/ Chambers); and (ii) build the capacity of the Secretariat to
  provide policy options analysis in the TVET sector, and establish an agenda and action plan for the work of
  the Council, based on an analysis o f its mandate and the surrounding regulatory framework.

 This sub-component would be modified to: (i) build a common understanding of employment driven
 TVET systems and operational practices among the key TVET providers and employers; (ii) provide
 TVET stakeholders with system-driven MIS to develop the E-TVET Council/ TVET relevant decision
 making body capacity to develop well-informed decisions.

  (RETAINED)
Sub-component 1.2: E-TVET Sector Policy, Planning and Organizational Development with Active
Employers Participation
Guided by national economic priorities and analysis of labor market dynamics in the country, the objective
of this sub-component is to support the E-TVET Council and the Secretariat to: (i) formulate national
policy directions for the TVET sector; (ii) establish and harmonize explicit policy objectives and
accountabilities for the respective public and private TVET providers; (iii) initiate the establishment of
common performance based planning and management procedures amongst public sector TVET providers
within MTEF framework; (iv) recommend resource allocations for public TVET providers; and (v)
progressively build the national qualification, certification and accreditation bodies and procedures.

This would be redefined as follows: this sub-component would contribute to the TVET sector enabling
conditions pertaining to TVET institutional development through: (i) identification of economic priority
sectors with employment potential to enhance matching labor supply and labor demand; and (ii) active
participation of employers in developing occupational profiles.

Sub-component 1.3: E-TVET System Performance Assessment with Involvement of Training
Providers and Employers
The objective of this sub-component is to build the capacity of the Secretariat and NCHRD as the
Council’s technical arm to: (i) establish performance indicators for the ETVET system derived from
national policy objectives; (ii) design data gathering tools and reporting mechanisms; (iii) undertake
performance analysis and recommend remedial action; and (iv) ensure feedback into the policy assessment
cycle.

This sub-component would be slightly revised to ensure feedback into the policy assessment cycle at the
level of the E-TVET Council, Higher Council for Human Resource Development, or any other TVET
policy entity that will be established during the NES implementation.

1.4 E-TVET Sector Promotion and Awareness among TVET Stakeholders.

TO BE RETAINED

The objective of this sub-component is to engage employers and TVET Stakeholders (NCHRD, TEF,
Private and public TVET training Providers, employers, and Federations/Chambers) in enhancing and
promoting understanding and awareness of occupational opportunities in the TVET sector.

  Component 2: Restructuring of Vocational Training Cooperation (VTC) (original cost US$6.14
  million; revised cost US$6.14million).

  TO BE RETAINED.

  The objective of this component is to establish the new financial and managerial governance structure by
  which a restructured or new autonomous organization can operate driven by the demands of the market.

  Component 3: Strengthening the Training and Employment Fund (original cost US$0.06 million)

  TO BE DROPPED.

  Training and Employment Fund Development: Institutional Development of the TEF under the E-
  TVET System Reform. The objective of this component is to support the institutional capacity of the TEF
  in the fulfillment of its mandate to identify, finance, and facilitate the delivery of skill development
  initiatives that will enhance the operational efficiency of the productive sector. The E-TVET Council will
  provide policy guidance for implementation of the component.
  Component 4: Project Management (original cost US$0.69 million; revised cost US$0.55million)

  TO BE RETAINED

  The objective of this component is to support project implementation arrangements. This component will
  fund key staff to be hired for the implementation of the proposed project. This will, inter alia, include an
  Executive Director, Procurement Officer, Financial Management Officer, M&E Officer, and IT Specialist.
  The component will fund activities related to the overall project implementation, including minor goods,
  materials and operational expenses and services.

  Note:
  Current DCU staff financed through the Project:
  Procurement Officer, Financial Management Officer, M&E Officer, and VTC Component Coordinator;
  and no longer includes an IT Specialist.

10. Institutional arrangements
 Primary responsibility for project implementation continues to reside with the E-TVET Council
 chaired by the Minister of Labor, with the Development and Coordination Unit (DCU)
 responsible for all procurement and financial aspects of the project and coordination of all
 related services as well as project monitoring and evaluation (M&E). Specific activities and
 components are implemented by the implementing entities (E-TVET Council/Secretariat and
 VTC). Contrary to the understanding during project appraisal, there is no need for a steering
 committee to play an executive leadership role for implementation of the overall reform

 program, as it has proven redundant to the role already played by the DCU and the secretariat.
 In effect, the steering committee has not existed since the project launch.
