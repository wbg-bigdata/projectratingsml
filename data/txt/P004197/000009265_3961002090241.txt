NEMORAJDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF T'IE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
FOR A PROVINCIAL GRID INTEGRATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenda-
tion on a proposed development credit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic
(Lao PDR) for SDR 25.3 million, the equivalent of US$36 million, on standard
IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a Provincial Grid Inte-
gration Project. The proceeds of the credit would be onlent to Electricite du
Laos (EdL) for 20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 8%
percent per annum. EdL will bear the foreign exchange risk.
*               Part I.  COUNTRY POLICIES AND THE ASSOCIATION'S ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
Background
2.        The New Economic Mechanism.  The Lao PDR has already taken major
steps in its transition from central planning to a market economy. Its com-
prehensive economic strategy of moving swiftly to a market system, known as
"the New Economic Mechanism", had the objectives of exposing the economy to
market forces, opening up crade and foreign investment opportunities, streng-
thening the role of the private sector and improving macroeconomic management.
Initial actions included the freeing of virtually all prices, the elimination
of consumer and other subsidies, the unification of official exchange rates at
a level determined by market forces, greater autonomy for state enterprises
a-d the authorizationi of private activities.  This was accompanied by a mas-
sive devolution of administrative and fiscal authority te local governments.
Despite some early setbacks, the Government has persevered with its reform
program. The recent Party Congress strongly reaffirmed the commitment of the
country to a market economy.
3.        Macroeconomic Developments.  The supply response was initially
slow, in large measure because the 1987-88 drought substantially reduced agri-
cultural and hydroelectric exports, thereby reducing the country's capacity to
import raw materials and spare parts. Growth, however, revived in 1988, ac-
celerated in 1989, and continued at a sustained pace thereafter. This recov-
ery was supported by a 40% shift in the domestic terms of trade between agri-
culture and industry during 1986-89, due to the price liberalization and the
4         adjustment of the exchange rate.  The same phenomenon led to a redistribution
of the national income in favor of the private sector. The resultirng sus-
tained improvement in private disposable income greatly alleviated many of the
adverse social impacts that the reforms might have had.
4.        Despite the magnitude of these policy changes, the authorities have
been successful, with assistance from IDA under two Structural Adjustment
Credits, in stabilizing the economy. Inflation increased during the first
part of 1989, but after peaking in the summer of that year, inflation has
since steadily decelerated. The inflation rate was 68% between December 1988
and December 1989, but declined to 22% during 1990; as of the end of 1991, the
annual inflation rate had dropped below 11%. The aim is to reduce that rate
to 6-7% by December 1992, and to the level of partner countries thereafter.
Also reflecting prudent macroeconomic policies, the exchange rate has remained
at Kn 700 per US$ since January 1990, consistent with market developments.



5.        This success in taming inflation was achieved primarily by stopping
and then reversing the deterioration of public sector savings, while financing
the remaining deficit through foreign aid. Both state enterprise and Govern-
ment savings were adversely affected by the reforms: consolidated public sec-
tor savings declined from 2.5X of GDP In 1986 to -3.3% in 1989. But these two
sub-sectors reacted differently: while Government endeavored to cut expendi-
tures by a cumulative 27X in real terms between 1986 and 1989, the expansion
of credit to state enterprises led, to a 901 increase in liquidity by 1989.
Subsequently, owing to a drastic curtailment in the credit extended to these
same enterprises, liquidity growth was limited to 141 in 1990.
6.        The deterioration of the external current account was less than
anticipated. Exports of goods and non-factor services grew very strongly in
1989-90, at an estimated 171 per year in real terms, thanks in part to the
recovery in hydroelectric exports. On the other hand, import growth (about 91
per year in real terms) was only slightly higher than output growth. Conse-
quently, the current account deficit declined from 201 of GDP in 1988 to an
estimated 131 in 1991, well within the bounds of available foreign assistance.
The maintenance of a market-based exchange rate undoubtedly contributed to
this result.
7.        Measures supported by SAC1 were instrumental in bringing about mac-
roeconomic stabilization. The June 1989 tax reform succeeded in reversing the
deterioration of revenue collection: fiscal revenues increased from 8.21 of
GDP in 1989 to almost 111 in 1991, while Government investment started growing
again from 51 in 1990 to an expected 101 in 1991. Furthermore, the August
1989 decision to maintain interest rates positive in real terms helped curtail
the demand for credit. Growth has been steady, with GDP rising by about 4X in
1991 despite a drop in rice production due to uneven rainfall. Finally, the
inflow of balance of payments support, combined with a recovery in electricity
and log exports, stabilized the exchange rate and provided non-inflationary
financing to the economy.
8.        The price, exchange rate, financial and trade reforms pursued under
SAC1 have laid the foundation for a resumption of growth based on a more effi-
cient allocation of resources.   Thanks to a relatively good endowment in
fertile land and an extremely low population density, the Lao PDR has poten-
tial for sustained growth. The gains achieved so far will remain short-term
ones if they are not consolidated by fresh efforts to tackle outstanding ob-
stacles to the sustained development of the country. Despite impressive in-
roads, private participation in the modern sector remains small, wages are
unsustainably low in the civil service and delinked from labor productivity in
the public enterprise sector, and development expenditures are still undesir-
ably low. On this last score, recent growth performanee clearly cannot be
sustained without a major increase in investment, particularly in the social
and physical infrastructure without which markets cannot operate. While sub-
stantial growth in private activities is expected in the modern sector, this
sector will not be able to meet its potential in the country's development
unless basic public services begin to develop. The key policy issue now is to
strengthen public savings performance to support the needed investment effort,
building upon the initial achievements of SAC1, while bolstering the fledgling
private sector.



- 3 -
9.        The Current Agenda.  The market reforms unmasked the vast ineffi-
ciency of the state enterprises, which had been concealed by price distor-
tions: when exposed to market forces, r0st state enterprises could not adjust
their selling prices sufficiently to recoup the increased cost of their inputs
and wage payments, in the face of the increased competition from abroad and
from a more dynamic private sector. Moreover, once the corset of central
regulations disappeared, employee compensation in autonomous state enterprises
started to absorb an increasing share of enterprise gross income, reducing
profits available for reinvestment.
10.       The public resource mobilization system under the central planning
system was highly inefficient due primarily to its heavy reliance on the
forced procurement by Government and state enterprises of goods at below-mar-
ket prices and exchange rates. Reduced state enterprise profitability affect-
ed the budget by shrinking the revenue base. Moreover, the introduction of a
proper tax system to replace the previous system of pooling enterprise sur-
pluses, had to be conducted by an administration with scant experience in this
field. A substantial further improvement in public savings will be needed to
help finance an expanded investment program.
11.       Finally, the abandonment of central planning left the administra-
tion with as yet undeveloped instruments of public management. The capacity
of the Government to formulate development programs and conduct fiscal poli-
cies in a market economy was especially affected, and the inherited organi-
zation of public administrations proved ill-suited to conduct the Government's
new tasks. In particular, the existing pattern of decentralization made the
fiscal squeeze even worse on the central Government. While rich provinces
were keeping the majority of their revenues for themselves, notwithstanding
the autonomy principle, the central Government had to rescue the poorer prov-
inces to enable them to maintain a minimum level of public services.
12.       The experience gained during the first years of reforms has led the
Government to revisit the design of its enterprise and fiscal reforms, with a
view to deepening the former and broadening the latter. The initial thrust
was the decentralization of economic decision-making. Tae Government now
seeks to complement these achievements by developing mechanisms that ensure
greater financial discipline. In this spirit, current Government policy to-
wards state enterprise emphasizes privatization and the development of the
private sector. It also seeks to strengthen public finance management and to
bring fiscal revenues back at least to their historical levels.
13.       IDA's strategy for the Lao PDR is to support sustainable growth
together with poverty alleviation. To achieve this, macroeconomic stability
is critically important, and stabilizing measures were the focus of SAC and
SAC2. Additional elements needed for sustainable growth are a sound invest-
ment program as well as improved administrative efficiency and more effective
institutions. To develop the sound investment program, IDA has worked with
the Government to (i) improve the planning process, and (ii) shift investment
priorities toward infrastructure and human resources development. To improve
the Government's administrative and operational efficiency, IDA has been work-
ing actively with UNDP and other donors to provide technical assistance.



-4-
Plans for Future Dqeelopment
14.       The future adjustment program was outlined by the Government in a
third-year Policy Framework Paper, endorsed by IDA and the IMP, which lays out
its overall medium-term program and the macroeconomic framework underpinning
its implementation. Growth is expected to average at least 5% during 1991-93,
based on continued improvement in infrastructure. To make this possible,
public investment is expected to grow at an average annual rate of about 10l
during 1991-95. The Government does not expect growth to be an automatic
byproduct of investment; considerable emphasis is being given to improving the
allocation of resources, thanks to an expanding private sector and a redizec-
tion of investment priorities. As to the latter, the Government's main prior-
ities are shifting from creating and keeping afloat state enterprises to de-
veloping (i) infrastructure, supported by higher user fees, and (ii) human
resources accompanied by significant administrative reforms. Direct involve-
ment in agriculture would be scaled down and restructured.
15.       Budgetary Policies.  The generation of a current fiscal surplus,
primarily through resource mobilization efforts, is the key component of the
macroeconomic program. It will serve the twin objectives of supporting the
country's investment effort and ensuring that the inflow of foreign savings,
which is being mobilized, contribute to this effort rather than to an inevita-
bly short-lived consumption boom. The current fiscal account deficit (exclud-
ing grants) should be eliminated by 1992, and a surplus is projected to reach
2.5% of GDP by 1994. Since expenditures have already fallen below appropriate
levels, the achievement of this objective will be sought primarily through
revenue mobilization measures, including the introduction of excise taxes,
improvements in the sales tax and further increase in public tariffs and user
fees. The target would be for revenue to increase to 13.5% of GDP by 1994,
while current expenditures would be maintained at an 11% share of GDP. Legic-
imate needs for current expenditure increases would therefore be addressed
through a prioritization and rationalization of expenditures, particularly at
the level of local governments -- which control half of the consolidated fis-
cal revenues. The achievement of these revenue and expenditure objectives
will not be possible without a complete revamping of public finance management
techniques and tne establishment of national public financo administrations.
16.       While substantial growth in private investment is expected, this
will not become the driving force of development until basic infrastructure
makes such investments profitable. Still in its endeavor to build such an
infrastructure base, the Government will hardly have any recourse to private
savings beyond the proceeds of the privatization program, hence will not com-
pete with the private sector for scarce investable funds. The overall budget
deficit (including onlending of foreign funds) will continue to be almost
exclusively financed through foreign aid and the stance of fiscal policies
will therefore remain neutral. During 1991-94, about 30% of the overall defi-
cit will be financed by IDA credits.
17.       Monetary Policy and Financial Reforms.  A continuation of tight
monetary policies is essential to consolidate the recent stabilization.
Thanks to a conservative fiscal policy, bank financing of the Government will
remain marginal. The control of domestic credit will increasingly rely on the
use of indirect policy instruments rather than on moral suasion or quantita-
tive ceilings. The maintenance of positive real interest rates is key to



dampening credit demand and enhancing the demand for bank deposits. The re-
cently introduced reserve requirement will be actively used and the rates at
which banks refinance themselves with the central bank will be adjusted ac-
cordingly to prevailing credit and liquidity conditions. Furthermore, greater
wage discipline through privatization and the use of temporary public wage
regulation will help curtail credit demands from state enterprises. On this
basis, inflation is expected to reach the level prevailing in trading partner
countries by the end of 1993 (para. 4). These policies will also help main-
tain a stable, market-related exchange rate.
18.       To attain higher output growth, larger imports of investment and
production goods will be needed. Exports are projected to continue to grow
faster than output, at an annual growth rate of 14%.  The prospect is tl'us for
some widening of the current account deficit through 1992. Thereafter, the
current account deficit is expected to stabilize and gradually decline as a
percentage of GDP. This would nevertheless allow the country to maintain a
strong reserves position, although the latter would gradually decline in terms
of weeks of imports to about 13 weeks in 1994.
19.       This framework and the policieas that support its attainment are
laid out in more detail in the third-year Policy Framework Paper, which was
endorsed by the Committee of the Whole and the IMF Board in April and May
1992, respectively.
20.       Exterr.al Financine Reauirement.  To support the necessary level of
investmeat in productive capacities and infrastructure as well as to improve
currently underfunded social services, the external financing requirement
would average US$180 million per year over the 1992-94 period. In view of the
withdrawal of Soviet aid, this requirement calls for an increased mobilization
of the Western donors and burden sharing among them.   Thus, official trans-
fers are expected to provide US$60-65 million annually towards covering this
requirement. In addition, private investment, commercial loans and private
transfers are projected to average about US$25 million. The remaining financ-
ing would come from multilateral institutions, of which about US$50 million
from IDA and US$45 million from ADB, i.e. respectively 28 and 25% of the ex-
ternal financing requirement.
IDA Operations Strategy
21.       IDA has played and will continue to play an important role in the
design and implementation of Lao PDR's economic reform program and in the
mobilization of the needed financial resources to support the program. Policy
Framework Papers, prepared annually by the Government, IDA and the IMF, estab-
lish an appropriate policy umbrella for IDA adjustment and investment opera-
tions. The objectives of the Association's country assistance strategy are
to: (a) support government efforts to move to a market economy while maintain-
ing macroeconomic stability; (b) assist in development of the physical capital
needed to expand production and exports; (c) support human resource develop-
ment, both for alleviating poverty and for increasing labor productivity; and
(d) promote a sustainable use of the country's natural resources. Both our
lending program and our economic and sector work program are geared toward
these objectives. Since 1986, when the Association resumed lending to Lao
PDR, ten credits have been made, totalling US$227 million. About 35X of IDA
assistance has been provided to support the economic reform program through



- 6 -
two quick disbursing adjustment operations, which provide finance for balance
of payments. In the investment projects, the main focus has been the rehabil-
itation of essential infrastructure, with about 50% of IDA assistance going to
the energy, telecommunications and roads sectors. About 9X went to agricul-
ture and 41 to industry. Direct investment in the education and health sec-
tors has thus far been low despite the importance of these sectors to improv-
ing human resources for the country's development; however, more operations
are anticipated in the next few years.
22.       A small minority of projects in the Bank Group's pcrtfolio have
slow disbursement records, mainly because of the Government's relative inexpe-
rience witk the requisite procurement procedures. Otherwise, implementation
of the overall program has been relatively free of problems.
23.       Future Country Lending Operations.  The overall level and pace of
IDA assistance to Lao PDR will take into accotnt the progress made in imple-
mentation of the reform program and the feasibility of specific operations.
The planned volume of lending for FY93-95 includes seven operations (including
the proposed project) for a total amount of US$160 million equivalent. The
primary goal of the Association's country assistance strategy will be to
broaden the economic recovery initiated since the economic reform of 1985, by
pursuing the objectives described above. Most probably, about 47X of total
lending volume will support energy, telecommunications, and transport infra-
structure; 25% would support further economic reform programs; 16X would sup-
port human resources development; 61 would support agriculture; and 61 would
support WID and poverty alleviation issues.
24.       Specific issues in sectoral management will be addressed through
the orientation of IDA lending. In the agricultural sector, proposed invest-
ment operations aim to support increased and more efficient production through
provision of improved agricultural services such as extension, research, cred-
it, land management and titling, and basic rural infrastructure, particularly
marketing facilities. Lending would also support the Government's efforts in
the forestry sector to better manage and improve the utilization of forest
resources. The Government is placing high priority on discouraging the prac-
tice of shifting agriculture and slash-and-burn practices, which are currently
used on about 401 of all agricultural land, streamlining commercial logging,
and simultaneously implementing a policy of maximizing regeneration and reha-
bilitation of the degraded forests. Complementing these policies, the Govern-
ment intends to intensify and develop permanent agriculture in up- and low-
land and other appropriate areas, which should also decrease deforestation.
25.       In the transport sector the emphasis of IDA assistance is on devel-
oping the backbone of a national network and rehabilitating feeder roads in
major agricultural areas. The Government cooperated with the Association and
the UNDP in carrying out a National Transport Study which serves as the first
transport master plan for further expansion of the network. The plan will
identify investment priorities and recommend the development of a network
system to provide access from industrial or agricultural surplus zones to
domestic and export markets. In this context, the Government is also review-
ing the role of user charges, which are currently very low, and considering
selective increases, particularly in vehicle license fees, to foster a more
efficient use of the network and provide resources for road maintenance. On
the basis of this study, the Government adopted late in 1991 a program of road



maintenance and introduced new measures including increased user charges to
help fund this program. Starting from 1991, the Government has allocated a
core budgtetary envelope for maintenance and will review the maintenance versus
investment allocation on an annual basis.
26.       The strategy in the industry sector is geared toward increased pro-
duction etficiency and export market development. Since 1985, this policy has
been reflected in a revamping of the incentive and regulatory framework for
state enterprises and the authorization of private sector participation in
industry. A liberal Foreign Investment Code issued in mid-1988 has permitted
the creation of some joint venture and leasing arrangements w;:th foreign part-
ners. However, as there is still a lack of familiarity with international
practices in this field, IDA and UNDP technical assistance has been arranged
to strengthen foreign investment promotion.
27.       In the energy sector, the Government's aim is twofold: developing
electricity production and distribution facilities and enhancing the efficien-
cy of its use. The public investment program includes rural electrification
projects, new transmission lines, and the construction of a new hydro plant.
The dual nature of the Lao energy sector, as both domestic infrastructure and
provider of the largest export commodity, makes appropriate pricing crucial to
achieving an optimal allocation of available production between domestic con-
sumption and exports. Under present contracts, the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand has agreed to buy any quantity that is not sold in the
domestic market. To achieve this balance, domestic electricity prices, which
were increased by about 75X in January 1990; 43X in June 1991; and another 75X
in July 1992, will continue needing adjustment in steps so as to cover incre-
ments in cost associated w..th service at low-voltage.
28.       Given the country's extremely high rates of illiteracy and infant
mortality, lending to the human resources sector will be geared toward reha-
bilitating, improving quality and eventually expanding the coverage of basic
health and education services. The main focus of IDA lending under prepara-
tion for education will be on building the local management capacity of the
private and public sector, through assistance to improve the quality of voca-
tional technical education, upgrade the effectiveness of higher education and
strengthen the management and financing of non-formal training activities. In
the health sector, operational priority will be given to reducing the high
rates of infant mortality, child mortality, maternal mortality, and fertility,
and to increasing work output, labor productivity, and life expectancy. In
order to achieve these objectives, IDA would support Government plans to: (a)
expand the program of immunizations to control the six vaccine-preventible
chiXihood diseases; (b) control diarrheal disease through effective use of
oral rehydration therapy by mothers; (c) provide maternal and child health
services including birth spacing, growth monitoring, nutritional surveillance,
and promotion of breast-feeding; (d) control acute respiratory infection
through effective education of mothers in early recognition of pneumonia symp-
toms and the availability of antibiotic therapy; and (e) control malaria
through diagnostic capability, community education and participation, and
availability of drugs.
29.       The authorities have recently become particularly concerned about
the connection between women and Roverty -- nearly 20X of households are head-
ed by women, and these are among the poorest households -- and the lack of



- 8 -
development in outlying provinces.  The Bank Group has been asked to help the
country deal with these issues. We are planning an operation for the northern
hill province of Luang Namtha (where the proportion of women in the population
is close to 60X). Initially, the operation wil_ in0olve social and infra-
structure components, together with activities to generate incomes through the
development of small scale manufacturing for local and regional markets.
30.       Environment.  The major environmental issues in Lao PDR are associ-
ated with the management of forest resources. The Government is keenly aware
that deforestation due to encroachment, shifting cultivation and unregulated
logging is a serious environmental problem. A National Conference on Forest-
ry, held in May 1989, recognized that overexploitation of forest resources had
reached a stage where indiLcriminate felling anJ burning of forests had to
cease and that the protection of forests needed to be placed at the forefront
of forestry and agricultural activities. The Conference set ambitious targets
for preservation and reforestation. After a temporary ban on log exports, the
Government decided to rely on taxation and production quotas as measures to
regulate logging activities, pending the achievement of a thorough policy
review. The Government has now made substantial progress toward the latter in
the context of preparing a Tropical Forestry Action Plan which defines a fea-
sible approach to the issues of sustainable forestry exploitation, taxation,
pricing, land use, watershed management, and reforestation actions. Thlis
report was presented at a Round Table meeting with the Government and inter-
ested donors in December 1991. An IDA-financed Forestry Project, currently
under preparation, will help establish the proper institutions and incentive
framework for sustainable forestry use. In regard to wildlife protection, in
October 1989, the Council of Ministers issued a decree on the protection and
conservation of aquatic and wild animals, and hunting and fishing.
31.       IFC Membership.  The Government's application to become a member of
IFC was approved by the IFC Board in 1990. IFC is looking into prospects for
promoting the country's industrial sector.
32.       Cooperation with the IMF and Other Multilateral and Bilateral Agen-
cies. IDA has worked closely with the IMF in designing and monitoring the
reform program. Since 1989, IDA and the IMF have annually conducted joint
missions to assist the Government in developing the three-year Policy Frame-
work Papers. Moreover, each institution has regularly sought the other's
support in the conduct of initiatives of mutual interest; e.g., IDA has sub-
contracted to the IMF a Tax and Customs Administration Study under a UNDP-
financed, IDA-executed technical assistance program.
33.       In addition, the Bank has actively been involved in executing a
number of UNDP- or other donor-financed technical assistance programs and
sector work, including studies defining a policy framework for the public
investment program, support for the New Economic Mechanism, and a master plan
for the transportation sector. The Policy Framework for the Public Investment
Program is the first rolling five year investment plan (1991-95) for the coun-
try since 1975, and the sole operational tool for the Government in allocating
public resources on a medium-term basis. It is also the basic document for
the 1992 UNDP round table meetings. Support for the New Economic Mechanism
includes basic support for the reform program in the areas of business legis-
lation, privatization and foreign investment, tax and customs reform, and
statistics. The master plan for the transportation sector is the country's



- 9 -
first thorough study on transport demand and network planning. It will serve
as a basis for formulating the Bank Group's transport lending program. A
review of population, health and nutrition sector was completed in November
1990, and served as the basis for identifying the first health project (cur-
rently under preparation). IDA cooperated actively in the development of the
Tropical Forestry Action Plan for Laos, and is currently administering a Japa-
nese Grant to assist the Government in developing an improved policy, institu-
tional and regulatory framework for the forestry sector.
34.       Cofinancing.  Since the Lao PDR faces substantial difficulties in
mounting a sustained development effort, opportunities are actively being
sought to coordinate IDA's activities with other multilateral and bilateral
aid programs and mobilize cofinancing. The IDA-financed National Polytechnic
Institute, Upland Agricultural Development, Second Telecommunications, and
Highway Improvement Projects all have important cofinancing components.
Summary Assessment
35.       Lao PDR is in a period of rapid economic and social evolution,
largely precipitated by the economic restructuring under its reform program.
Given the difficulties inevitably associated with economic reform, together
with the problem of institutional and management bottlenecks constraining
timely project implementation, a period of consolidation seems warranted.
Therefore, IDA's strategy for the next few years emphasizes portfolio manage-
ment, with particular attention devoted to supervision of ongoing operations,
and to training local staff in a number of basic preect implementation areas
such as disbursements, procurement, accounting and auditing and to continue
deepening the policy dialogue at the sectoral level. New lending operations
are planned at the relatively rapid level of two to three projects, or lending
of US$50-60 million equivalent a year. However, if external disturbances
arise for which balance-of-payment support is required, additional funds would
be allocated, provided that the economic reform is progressing satisfactorily.
To date, progress by the Government in carrying out the comprehensive set of
macroeconomic and sectoral reforms set out in the Policy Framework Papers has
been satisfactory. Nevertheless, 7iven the magnitude of existing imbalances
and the currently very low levels vf production, adjustment will necessarily
be a long-term process. For the next decade at least the country will contin-
ue to depend heavily on external assistance to finance imports that are essen-
tial for restoring the capital structure and providing consumer goods that are
necessary complements to the reform of financial incentives.
Part II. THE PROJECT
36.       Backgroud.  The Lao PDR, a land-locked country with 236,800 km2 of
area and 3.6 million people, is one of the poorest in the world, with a per
capita Gross Domestic Product of US$210 per annum (1990). The largest city is
Vientiane, the capital, with a population of 381,000. Some 40X of the popula-
tion lives in, and much of the economic activity centers around, two narrow
ribbons of development: (i) along the Mekong River and in close proximity to
the Thai border in the south, and (ii) in the Vientiane-Luang Prabang corridor
in the north. These areas are clearly separated from each other; elsewhere,



- 10 -
the country is characterized by difficult terrain (including rugged mountains
and dense tropical jungle), sparse population, and meager infrastructure.
37.       Power consumption within the Lao PDR, at about 50 kWh per person
per year (1989), is among the lowest in Asia. The distribution network is
limited, and only about 171 of the population currently has access to elec-
tricity supplied from three small, separate grids, which are interconnected to
the Thai system, but not to each other. Thus, excess energy from the two
grids that are supplied by hydropower originating within the country is ex-
ported to Thailand; while the third grid imports its supplies from Thailand.
38.       Electricity exports are critical to the Lao PDR.  In the 1970s, the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) began buying the excess of
production over local demand from the Nam Ngum power plant (serving the Vien-
tiane area). Until the mid 1980s, the amount of exported electricity in-
creased continuously and a formal sales agreement between EdL and EGAT was
signed in 1981. In 1990, EdL sold about 70% of its output of about 900 GWh of
energy, representing about US$18.2 million in revenues, to Thailand; this ac-
counted for 28% of all Lao exports. Electricity is also an important source
of tax revenues; in 1990, EdL accounted for US$4.9 million in total taxes. In
1991, EdL renegotiated its export price; the new arrangement is based on time-
of-day differentials, and provides EdL with average revenues of US 3.6i/kWh,
up from US 3.05g/kWh. Electricity imported from EGAT is priced at the export
rate plus a wheeling charge of US 0.5#/kWh, so that the effective cost of
supply of 4iports is about US 4.1g/kWh.
39.       Export prospects and operational interlinkages with the Thai grid
play a dominant role in the Government's investment strategy for the sector.
Even small and medium sized hyero schemes, which normally would serve local
requirements, need to be designed with exports in mind; and electricity supply
for local load centers needs to follow the least cost option, even if this
implies reimporting from Thailand. EdL's investment program for the period
1992-2000 includes: (i) about US$130 million of generation and water diversion
projects aimed at increasing exports from Nam Ngum and related sources of
supply from the present 650 GWh to about 950 GWh; and (ii) about US$70 million
for electrification within the Lao PDR aimed at increasing the population that
has access to grid supplies from 17% to 25% by the vear 2000. The proposed
project is the cornerstone of EdL's internal electri'tication program.
40.       Electric power falls under the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts
(MOI), which is the parent for EdL, the country's national utility. EdL had
been responsible for (i) construction and operation of all major generation
and transmission facilities nationwide, and (ii) distribution of electricity
in the Vientiane and Vientiane Plain areas. Elsewhere, electricity service
had been provided by provincial utilities; however, on June 30, 1991, EdL
acquired the five utilities serving the provinces receiving benefits from the
IDA-financed Southern Provinces Electrification Project (Credit 1826-IA) and
the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed Northern Transmission Line Project.
EdL is a competent utility; however, it has limited depth of capable managers
and engineers. The recently acquired provincial utilities have scant human
and financial resources. Although IDA-financed consultancies are providing a
framework for decentralization, EdL urgently needs to implement that frame-
work, refine its internal processes, and provide training at all levels. On
the operational side, high distribution losses (about 23X in 1989) had been a



- 11 -
chronic problem for EdL; however, losses have declined sharply to about 17X in
1990, as EdL implemented a stringent action program agreed with ADB and IDA.
41.       The Government's policy had been for export revenues to cross-sub-
sidize local consumption. However, since its export revenues are taxed heavi-
ly, EdL's financial health depends on local rates being maintained at appro-
priate levels.  During the last few years, because many of its local costs
have a significant foreign content, EdL has experienced cash flow constraints
resulting from its low revenues related to local service. The Vientiane area
tariff that was introduced in July 1991, while substantial in local currency
terms, only raised EdL's dollar equivalent revenues to slightly above 1987
levels. Consumers served from grids in the southern and central areas have
until recently paid about Kn 19/kWh, or less than the cost of supplying those
grids.  Then, on July 1, 1992, EdL raised electricity tariffs nationwide so
that local revenues are now expected in the range of Kn 26-30/kWh. The new
tariff exceeds the cost of providing electricity to the various grids, and
covers a considerable proportion of distribution costs.
42.       Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations.  The Bank first be-
came involved in the late 1960s as adminis. rator of a multi-donor fund to con-
struct the first phase of the Nam Ngum plant. In 1982, IDA lent US$13 million
under the Nam Ngum Hydroelectric Project (Credit 1197-LA) to finance the third
phase of Nam Ngum plant; that project was cofinanced by a US$4 million loan
from the OPEC Fund. The project's main works were completed within six months
of schedule; however, the closing date was extended by about three years so
that EdL could use savings to refurbish the Nam Ngum plant. A Project Comple-
tion Report was issued in 1988. The main lesson from that project was that,
by becoming more systematic in supervising procurement, IDA could mitigate
early implementation delays. In 1987, IDA provided US$25.8 million to finance
the Southern Provinces Electrification Project (SPE) (Credit 1826-LA). Super-
vision of procurement became more systematic, and EdL expects to complete that
project within the original cost estimates and implementation schedule. The
Bank Group has also served as executing agency for two UNDP-financed studies:
(i) a hydro ranking study, which was begun in late 1986 and completed in mid
1988, and (ii) the recently concluded feasibility study of the Nam Theun Hy-
droelectric Project.
43.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  For the past five years, IDA has
endeavored to effect and support a coordinated strategy for development of the
Lao power sector.  This strategy emphasizes the interdependence of the Lao and
Thai power sectors. The proposed project affords IDA the opportunity to con-
tinue assisting the improvement in relations between EdL and EGAT, while also
helping the Lao Government and EdL to fine tune their investment strategy for
the sector. Also, the proposed project enables IDA to support the next phase
of distribution network expansion. It also affords IDA the opportunity to
support the next phase of institutional development within the sector, and a
more rational approach toward pricing electricity for local consumption.
44.       Project Objectives.  The project's objectives are (i) extending
electricity supply to more consumers in the country's southern and central
regions; (ii) enhancing the quality of supply for existing consumers in those
areas; (iii) developing additional export prospects; (iv) improving EdL's sys-
tem efficiency; and (v) continuing EdL's institutional development.



- 12 -
45.       Project Descrigtion.  The proposed project includes: (i) an elec-
trification component that includes construction of: (a) one 115 kV overhead
river-crossing line (with associated substation) and three 22 kV overhead
river-crossing lines, to interconnect disaggregated local networks with EGAT's
grid, and (b) extension of the 22 kV distribution networks in six provinces in
the central and southern regions of the country; (ii) a system efficiency
component that includes (a) implementation of an action program for EdL to re-
duce system losses, improve billing and collection practices in all of EdL's
service areas and reduce arrears from Government agencies, and (b) provision
of goods and equipment to strengthen EdL's operation and maintenance services,
especially at its provincial subsidiaries; (iii) an institutional development
component that includes equipment, material, technical assistance and a tech-
nical cooperation arrangement with a well managed utility in the region, for
upgrading the skills of EdL's staff and its training facilities; and (iv) a
project development component that includes a feasibility study for installing
additional capacity at the Nam Ngum plant.
46.       Project Implementation.  EdL would implement the proposed project.
The project cost is estimated at US$45.1 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$38.2 million equivalent (85X); the project is exempt
from taxes and duties. The total financing required, including interest dur-
ing construction, is US$49.3 million. IDA would finance US$36 million equiva-
lent (93X of the foreign exchange requirement), and EGAT would finance about
US$2.2 millionV. EdL's entry into an acceptable contractual arrangement
with EGAT covering the interconnections is a prerequisite to EdL's investments
in the central region networks, which depend on those interconnections for
their electricity supplies. A retroactive financing provision of US$140,000
equivalent has been established to reimburse payments to consultants appointed
after June 1, 1992. Schedule A gives a breakdown of project costs and the
financing plan. Amounts and methods of procurement, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Lao PDR are presented in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 10384-IA, dated August 10, 1992, is being distributed separately.
47.       Project Sustainability.  EdL will operate and maintain the facili-
ties being financed after the completion of construction. Actions to be taken
with regard to its local tariff should ensure that EdL has sufficient funds,
and training being provided by the proposed project should ensure that its
staff retains the competence to continue operating and maintaining its facili-
ties up to current high standards.
48.       Agreed Actions.  The following agreements were obtained from the
Government and EdL: (a) acquisition by EdL of the provincial utilities in new
provinces receiving benefits from the proposed project prior to the onset of
the construction of networks in those provinces; (b) timely implementation of
the action programs comprising the project's system efficiency component; and
(c) continuation of the revenue covenants agreed under SPE, including an annu-
al: (i) 20X contribution to investment from internal cash generation, and (ii)
debt service coverage ratio of 1.1.
1/ EGAT would finance the full value of the links between its grid and
the Thai end of the river-crossings, and 50X of the river crossings.

49.       Environmental AsRects.  The project is not expected to pose envi-
ronmental problems. The rural electrification components involve adjustments
to systems already in place, or construction of low voltage networks along
existing infrastructure. EdL has agreed to screen any changes in the pro-
ject's contents for potentially adverse environmental effects, and if deemed
necessary by IDA, formulate an environmental impact assessment regarding such
changes. The terms of reference for the design study would provide for an
environmental impact assessment of the works being designed.
50.       Program Objective Categories.  Since the electrification component
has been well coordinated with integrated infrastructure developments, these
investments in electricity supply can contribute to the alleviation of rural
poverty through the creation of additional employment opportunities. Women
would benefit from the improved quality of life in the home, and from an en-
hanced capacity to do weaving or sewing in the home after dark.
51.       Project Benefits.  The main benefit of the proposed project would
be the extension of electric networks within dispersed areas of the country's
central and southern regions. Additional benefits include: (i) improving the
reliability of supplies to consumers throughout EdL's networks; (ii) increas-
ing the technical competence at all levels of EdL; and (iii) transferring to
EdL new techniques for managing a dispersed enterprise.
52.       Risks.  The proposed project faces no major risks.  Possible risks
include minor construction delays if: (a) EGAT does not complete its portion
of the interconnecting links on time; and (b) constraints persist in the sup-
ply of cement. However, a sensitivity analysis has shown that the proposed
project would be justified even if construction is delayed by as much as a
year. In addition, counterpart funding could be constrained if drought condi-
tions limit the availability of energy for export. However, the Government
has agreed to provide EdL with whatever assistance is needed for execution of
the project, including coverage of shortfalls in counterpart funding.
53.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development cred-
it would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recom-
mend that the Executive Directors approve it.
