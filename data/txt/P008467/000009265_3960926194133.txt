MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
NATIONAL BANK OF HUNGARY WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE HUNGARIAN
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC FOR A
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
National Bank of Hungary with the guarantee of the Hungarian People's Republic
for US$50 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be on standard IBRD terms with 15 years maturity, including 5 years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance
industrial technology development.
2.       Background.  Hungary's economic performance deteriorated in 1985-86
largely because an expansionary demand management policy was not accompanied
by a sufficiently strong supply response. By 1986, the convertible currency
current account deficit had reached 6.0 percent of GDP, and the State Budget
deficit 4.3 percent. External indebtedness had risen oharply while the main
indicators of creditworthiness had deteriorated. In 1987 the Government took
measures to reverse the deterioration, which have been successful in achieving
a partial turnaround. The current account deficit declined to 3.2 percent of
GDP, and the fiscal deficit to 2.9 percent. The 1987 measures were succeeded
by the adoption of an Economic Stabilization and Structural Reform Program for
1988-90 designed to halt the growth of external debt by the end of the
period. The main lines of the program are stabilization to reduce the current
account and fiscal deficits, and acceleration of the economic reform. The IMF
is supporting the program through a one fear Standby Arrangement negotiated in
April and approved in May 1988. The Bank's direct support to the program is
reflected in the proposed Industrial Sector Adjustment Loan negotiated in May
for presentation to the Executive Directors in June, 1988.
3.       The structural reform program focuses on the industrial sector with
the objectives of iwprovinL, industrial productivity and international
competitiveness and thus providing the needed growth in exports to convertible
currency markets. It continues implementation of a matrix of wide-ranging
policy and institutional actions, agreed with the Bark and designed to enhance
competition, resource mobility and enterprise financial discipline. The
matrix also emphasizes measures to promote industrial technology development.
4.       The level of industrial technology is a major constraint on Hungary's
industrial and export performance. Inadequate technological development
constrains the quality and variety of products for export and inhibits
productivity growth. In recognition of the importance of promoting industrial
technology development, the Government has accorded it a high priority in both
the Seventh Five-Year-Plan (1986-90) and the recently adopted Program of
Economic Stabilization and Structural Reform.

S.       Traditionally, the proportion of GNP devoted to R&D in Hungary has
been comparable to industrialized nations. However, Hungary's success in
translating this into real economic returns was limited. The principal
reasons are a wide and diffused R&D program without sufficient focus and
incentives for implementation of new technology. Recently, the Government has
decided to sharpen the focus and market orientation of technology development
(TD) efforts. Expenditure priorities are being concentrated on (i)
electronics and the application of computer technology; (ii) energy and
material savings; (iii) chemicals and bio-technology; and (iv) infrastructure
for TD. In addition, measures are being introduced to make R&D more
demand-driven by transforming many public research institutes into commercial
engineering and consulting enterprises, by putting the distribution of
government R&D funds on a more competitive basis (with financial return as a
major criterion), and by strengthening incentives to industrial enterprises to
adopt newer and better technologies. The Government has also established
financial institutions to promote TD activites and is modernizing accounting
practices so that the value of intellectual property (e.g., patents) can be
capitalized.
6.       Bank's Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement.   In the 1988-90
period, the Bank's program of assistance to Hungary will focus on adjustment,
particularly in industry but also in the broader aspects of the economy such
as incentives, the regulatory framewcrk, and the trade regime. There is a
strong complementarity between investment lending and adjustment lending.
Systemic reform supported by adjustment operations will increase the
likelihood of success of the investment operations. Investment operations in
the industry sector are planned to: promote needed restructuring of
enterprises and subsectors toward improved international competitiveness;
foster the creation and growth of small and medium enterprises as well as
feeder industries to deepen Hungary's industrial structure; strengthen
industrial technological development capacities; and, importantly, support
continued development of the evolving financial institutions.  Investment
operations in agriculture, energy and infrastructure have all been designed to
further restructuring in those sectors. The knowledge and experience gained
from the implementation of investment operations will continue to provide a
major input into the development of the reform program and adjustment
operations. Improvements in the capital stock resulting from the investment
operations are needed to establish a sustainable supply response.
7.       Within Hungary's overall reform program, industrial restructuring is
the centerpiece. The industrial restructuring program is based on a
medium-term strategy developed jointly with the Bank which combines support
for reforms of the economic management system and industrial sector policy
with that for specific restructuring investments. One theme being pursued in
these investments is encouragement of small and medium sized enterprises.
Another critical focus of restructuring is to promote rapid and significant
improvement in the technology of Hungarian industrial processes and products,
which is a critical requirement for success of Hungary's restructuring
strategy.
8.       The proposed project would directly address the critical
technological underpinning of the industrial policy reform program. It would
do so through direct investments (in TD infrastructure, introduction of new



3-
technologies, and the computer software industry), improved sub-proSect
appraisal and design methods, support for a review of TD policy and programs,
and through a contribution to the dialogue between the Bank and the Government
on industrial restructuring. The Bank is well positioned to provide the
package of financial, institutional and policy support required to provide the
environment for promoting TD.
9.       Project Objectives:  The project would help (i) strengthen the
policy, financial and institutional framework for industrial TD; (ii) improve
technology services, facilities and infrastructure available to Hungarian
industry; (iii) promote closer links between the R&D community and enterprises
and users, thereby improving the effectiveness of R&D; and (iv) enhance the
international competitiveness of Hungarian industry and the development of
viable exports.
10.      Project Description:  The project consists of three components: (I)
subloans to commercial enterprises through eligible participating i.atermediary
banks for commercial sub-projects; (II) investments by non-commercial
government entities to provide essential metrological and quality control
services to industry and the R&D community; and (III) technical assistance and
training. The sub-projects under the first component are divided into three
categories: R&D infrastructure (e.g., rental of specialized instruments,
provision of special purpose printed circuit boards), introduction of new
technologies which have a wide impact on industrial technology (e.g., computer
aided design and computer aided manufacturing, industrial automation systems),
and the computer software industry (e.g., development of workstation software
and expert systems). Eight sub-projects under Component I and the two
investments under Component II, accounting for approximately 702 of the Bank
loan, have been pre-appraised by the Bank. A line of credit will finance
other investments under Component I. Under the line of credit, participating
Hungarian banks will appraise sub-projects according to criteria and
procedures agreed with the Bank and will assume the credit risk. Component
III is primarily aimed at-supporting and strengthening the Hungarian banks and
relevant Government agencies in this role. Estimated costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and method of procurement and
disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing
events and the status of Bank Group operations in Hungary are given in
Schedules C and D respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7191-HU and a
map are also attached.
11.      Actions Agreed:  Assurances satisfactory to the Bank were obtained
from the Government and NBH regarding the following main points: (i) terms
and conditions of subsidiary financing agreements for NBH onlending to
participating banks; (ii) creation, with suitable composition, powers and TOR,
of a project coordination unit under the supervision of OMFB; (iii) reporting
and audit requirements for participating banks, enterprises and institutes;
(iv) procedures and criteria for enabling additional banks to participate;
(v) sub-project eligibility criteria including minimum financial and economic
rates of return of 18%; (vi) terms and conditions of subloan agreements
between the banks and enterprises, e.g., enterprises must maintain a current
ratio of more than 1.3, a debt/equity ratio of less than 65/35 and a debt
service coverage ratio above 1.5; and conform to audit, reporting and
environmental practices approved by the Bank; (vii) use of the subloan
repayment surplus over the Bank loan repayments of NBH to refinance TD
sub-projects; and (viii) application of Bank guidelines for procurement of
goods and services.

12.      Benefits:  Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected
from: (i) increased productivity in industry from introduction of new
technologies, (ii) improved quality and competiziveness of industrial products
resulting from more effective and efficient R&D (leading, in particular, to
increased earnings of convertible currency); and (iii) strengthened ability of
the banking system and of the Government to design, appraise, finance and
implement TD related activities. The quantifiable benefits from the 8
pre-appraised commercial sub-pro4ects (accounting for 61% of the Bank loan)
yield an economic rate of return of 312. This estimate is conservative since
it excludes the many indirect benefits to industry from the improved TD
services resulting from the project.
13.      Risks:  The principal risks concern: (i) the effectiveness of the
many financial intermediaries and implementing entities involved; and
(ii) possible export restrictions on some equipment. The first risk is being
minimized by careful attention to sub-project evaluation and to the necessary
support and supervision of sub-projects, including technical assistance and
training. The second risk is small because the project is made up of a number
of independent sub-projects with discrete lists of equipment. Thus, failure
to obtain a license for a particular piece of equipment may delay that
sub-project while a substitute is found or re-specified, but it is unlikely to
jeopardize the viability of the sub-project or of the project as a whole. The
risk has been further reduced by reviewing equipment specifications and
conducting procurement procedures for pre-appraised investments (accounting
for 701 of the Bank loan) in parallel with loan processing, thus increasing
the likelihood that export licenses will be obtained for the needed equipment.
14.      Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
