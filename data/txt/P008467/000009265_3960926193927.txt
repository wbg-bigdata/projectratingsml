HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  National Bank of Hungary (NBH).
Guarantor:                 Hungarian People's Republic.
Beneficiaries:             Government, financial intermediaries, enterprises
and institutes involved in Technology Development
(TD).
Amount:                    US$50 million equivalent.
Terms:                     15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
OnlendinR Terms:           US$45.9 million of the Bank loan would be onlent to
eligible participating financial institutions at
maturities not to exceed 15 years including 5 years
of grace at NBH's prevailing refinancing rate for
medium and long-term loans, or at the prevailing
Bank rate plus a mark-up of 20 percent, whichever is
higher. Participating financial institutions would
onlend to beneficiaries for periods not exceeding 10
years, including 3 years of grace, at rates
determined pursuant to their lending policy
statements agreed with the Bank so that they:
(i) cover operating costs including provision for
doubtful debts; (ii) are positive in real terms; and
(iii) do not subsidize any category of borrower. Of
the remainder of the loan, US$4.0 million would be
lent to the Government and US$0.1 million to the
participating banks for technical assistance and
training with maturity of not more than 15 years,
including not more than 5 years grace, and an
interest rate not less than the Bank rate.
Proiect Description:       The project consists of three components:
(i) subloans to commercial enterprises through
intermediary banks for sub-projects to be operated
in a commercial mode; (ii) investments by
non-commercial government entities for activities to
provide essential research and development (R&D)
services; and (iii) technical assistance and
training. The sub-projects under the first
component are designed to: (i) improve the
infrastructure of Industrial R&D; (ii) introduce new



- ii -
technologies into Hungarian industry both to improve
the production of the sponsoring ex:terprise and have
an impact on the technology of other firms and
industries; (iii) develop the Hungarian software
industry as an essential input to TD and to
exports. Eight sub-projects under Component I and
two investments under Component II accounting for an
estimated 70% of the Bank loan have been
preappraised by the Bank. The remainder will be
appraised by the participating Hungarian banks.
Benefits and Risks:        The project would be p-imarily aimed at increasing
the effective application of R&D results in
Hungarian industry. To this end the project would
strengthen the infrastructure, policy, institutional
framework, and financial mechanisms connecting
research activity to productive industry. The
direct benefits would accrue to the enterprises
receiving subloans. In addition, indirect benefits
would accrue widely to: (i) enterprises which need
improved R&D to modernize their products and
processes; (ii) enterprises requiring improved
quality control and certification to retain or
expand markets; and (iii) enterprises needing
improved technology inputs to increase productivity
and competitiveness. The resulting impact on these
groups of enterprises in terms of more modern,
better quality products is expected to improve the
performance of Hungarian industry in both domestic
and foreign markets. The principal risks concern
the effectiveness of the many implementing entities,
and restrictions on export of high technology from
the western industrialized countries to Hungary.
The first risk has been minimized by careful
attention to sub-project evaluation and to the
necessary support and supervision of sub-projects.
The second risk has been minimized by conducting
procurement procedures for pre-appraised
sub-projects in parallel with loan processing.
During this exercise, sub-project design and
purchasing lists have been reviewed for conformance
with export regulations thus reducing the
possibility that export licenses will not be
obtained. The remaining risk is small because the
project is made up of a number of independent
sub-projects with discrete lists of equipment.
Thus, should an export license not be obtained for a
particular piece of equipment this might delay that
sub-project while a substitute is found, but is
unlikely to jeopardize the execution of the
sub-project or undermine the viability of the
project as a whole.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Industrial restructuring is the centerpiece of Hungary's medium-term
structural adjustment program and is accordingly reflected as one of the
primary objectives of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90). The industrial
restructuring program for 1986-90, is based on a medium-term strategy
developed jointly with the Bank. The strategy combines reforms of the entire
economic management system, especially industrial sector policy, and support
for specific restructuring investments. The industrial policy reform program
aims to increase reliance and competitive market mechanisms and signals in
order to promote efficiency, innovation, and financial discipline at the
enterprise level. Simultaneously, the investment program iE intended to help
restructure the potentially competitive parts of the industrial sector.
1.02     A critical component of the overall industrial reform program is a
program to increase the rate and quality of technology development (TD) in
Hungarian industry. Actions under this program have been formulated in the
Medium Range Plan for TD, which has been formally incorporated into the
Seventh-Five Year Plan. It is also reflected in the matrix of policy actions
which summarizes the overall reform program.
1.03     The original industrial policy reform program (1986-90), as reflected
in a Letter of Industrial Policy Intent of May 1986, provided the framework
for the Bank's lending for two industrial restructuring projects in Hungary
during 1986-87 (loans 2700-HU and 2834-HU respectively). In continued support
of the evolving policy reform framework, the Bank has prepared jointly with
the Hungarian authorities during 1987-88 a separate policy-based Sector
Adjustment Loan (SECAL) which was negoticted in May 1988, for presentation to
the Executive Directors in June 1988.
1.04     The proposed project would complement the ongoing industrial
restructuring projects and the proposed SECAL by providing the TD underpinning
which is essential for Hungarian industry to achieve its growth, productivity
and export goals. The project would also address the institutional objectives
of the ongoing reform by emphasizing decentralization and commercialization of
TD decisions and by strengthening the R&D, industrial and financial
institutions supporting TD activities.
1.05     The project is supported by a loan of US$50 million equivalent or 42%
of total cost. It was prepared through missions between May 1987 and January
1988. Additional documents concerning the sector and the project are listed
in Annex 1 and are available in the Project File.

U. TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN HUNGARY
A. Background.
2.01     Hungary implemented a successful stabilization by end-1984 returning
the convertible currency current account and the central budget to surpluses.
The economy's performance in 1985-86 was not satisfactory. GDP declined in
1985 and grew only 1.5% in 1986. The convertible currency account turned from
a surplus of US$329 million in 1984 to deficits of US$0.5 billion and US$1.4
billion in 1985 and 1986 respectively. These deficits were financed by heavy
external borrowing. Recognizing that the continuation of weak economic
management would lead to unsustainable debt which, in turn, would undermine or
halt the underlying reform of the Hungarian economy, the Government early in
1987 prepared and began implementing several measures to reverse the
deterioration in internal and external balances.
2.02     Preliminary data for 1987 indicates that a turnaround has commenced.
GDP growth accelerated to 2.9% p.a.; value added in industry grew by 3.9%
compared with a decline of 0.5% in 1986 and non-ruble exports grew by 5.0%
after declining in 1985 and 86. Export growth to the highly competitive
Western European and North American markets was even faster. This performance
confirms that the design of Hungary's policy reform program, which was
vigorously relaunched in 1985, is fundamentally sound and will produce the
desired results if implemented consistently and forcefully within a
sufficiently tight macroeconomic environment.
2.03     The Government is aware that the recovery program must be
strengthened and sustained. Accordingly, it has prepared a medium-term
(3-year) program of economic stabilization and structural reform which a focus
industrial sector policy reform. The overriding objective of the program,
supported by the IMF and the Bank, is to halt the growth of external debt by
the end of 1990 by progreasively reducing the convertible currency current
account deficit.
2.04     As Hungary is a highly trade dependent economy (over 40% of GDP is
traded internationally) reducing the current account deficit while achieving
growth in output requires continuous increases in efficiency and international
comretitiveness. In this endeavor, industry must receive the major emphasis
since it is the single largest sector in the economy (about one-third of GDP,
employment and fixed investment) and accounts for 75-80% of total imports and
exports. Industrial restructuring is, therefore, the centerpiece of the
Hungarian overall economic program. The Government has already taken a number
of actions to advance the reform of the sector, supported by two Bank-financed
industrial restructuring projects. The supply response to these actions has
begun to emerge but has not yet fully met expectations. Although the high
proportion of foreign debt and the exigencies of stabilization present
difficulties, the Government is committed to pressing ahead with accelerated
implementation of the industrial reform program. The program aims at
increasing reliance on competitive market signals in order to promote
efficiency, innovation and financial discipline at the enterprise level. The
reform consists of actions covering 11 critical policy areas: entry of
enterprises; liquid ion and restructuring of inefficient enterprises,



-3-
international trade, pricing, taxation and subsidies, wage differentiation and
worker mobility, capital markets, banking, enterprise management, direct
foreign investment, and technology development (TD). The policy actions which
the Government is committed to take have been summarized in a policy matrix
which has been the subject oi continuing dialogue with the Bank in the context
of the industrial restructuring projects and the proposed sector adjustment
loan. Progress on the measures *#numerated in the matrix is likewise being
monitored in the context of those projects.
2.05     A fundamental constraint on industrial performance and thus an
important focus of the industrial reform program is the level and rate of
change in industrial technology.  Specific policy actions associated with TD
have been agreed and are being implemented as an integral part of the policy
reform matrix (para. 3.03). TD is being a corded very high priority during
the seventh Five-Year Plan and the medium-t"rm recovery program; this emphasis
is expected to continue, if not increase, d ring the eighth Five-Year Plan.
The high priority reflects the recognition ttat the technological level of
Hungarian industry is below international st.ndards and faces the risk of
lagging further behind.  Hungary's TD effort, discussed in the following
sections, in the past has not been effective in narrowing this gap and
continues to face a number of cinstraints.
B. Overview of TD in Hungary
2.06     The Level of R&D Expenditure.  Gross Expenditure on Research and
Development (GERD) constitutes approximately 2.4% of Hungary's national
income.-" This is comparable to many advanced industrialized countries:
lower than the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), Japan, and the United States
but higher than Austria, Belgium and Italy (Table 2.1). Compared with CMEA
countries, Hungary devotes a higher percentage of national income to R&D than
Poland (1.1) but less than Czechoslovakia (3.9), the German Democratic
Republic (4.1) and the Soviet Union (4.7). Despite the reasonable percentage
of GDP devoted to R&D, available resources are insufficient, due to the small
size of the economy, to support R&D in Hungary at an internationally
competitive level for the full range of industrial and other sectors.
2.07     R&D Manpower.  The same is true for human resources.  While more than
1.5% of the five million labor force is working in registered R&D units, full
time scientists and engineers holding university degrees number only 22,000.
They are spread thinly over all areas of R&D including natural and social
sciences, industry, agriculture and medicine (Table 2.2).
1/       Official figures indicate a ratio of 3.0X.  However, this ratio is
not comparable to that for OECD countries because of differences in
definitions (e.g., Hungarian figures include expenditures, such as
publication and distribution of papers, which support R&D but are
not, strictly, part of it). Correcting for these differences gives
an R&D ratio for Hungary of approximately 2.4X.

More serious, the relative isolation of Hungary from the leading edge of
technological development in the advanced industrialized countries has
adversely affected the quality of human resources for R&D. Further, the long
lead time necessary to build up human resources makes it difficult to redeploy
them so as to meet new demands and thus maximize their contribution to
economic development.
C. Performance of TD
2.08     Hungary's performance in TD has not been satisfactory either in terms
of developing cutting-edge technology or of realizing economic benefits. It
is true that, superficially, the magnitude of technology exports appear
reasonable; receipts from licensing by Hungary were approximately Ft 842
million or US$19.6 million in 1985. Tae ratio of this value to GERD was
3.92. Though much lower than the levels for France (7.41), the U.K. (9.1X),
the U.S. (8.5%) and a few small countries in Europe, it is comparable to those
for Austria (3.2Z), FRG (3.51), Italy (3.72), Japan (3.41) and Sweden (3.6%).
However, a breakdown of the technology exports shows that a dominant share
(531) comes from licensing computer software and another large percentage
(291) is represented by the pharmaceutical industry (Table 2.3). Thus, more
than 80% of Hungary's technology export earnings are dependent on only two
areas despite the extensive resources devoted to TD across a broad range of
subsectors. An alternative way to evaluate the performance of TD is to
observe some direct accomplishmenits of R&D activity, such as the increase in
intellectual property. The number of applications for patents in Hungary is
quite small and, even considering the small absolute size of Hungary's GERD,
far from satisfactory. The number of patent applications as compared to GERD
is much lower in Hungary than in the West (Table 2.4).

2.09     Evaluated from the perspective of productivity growth in industry,
the TD performance of Hungary is again not satisfactory. Although ineffective
R&D is not the only cause of the low rate of productivity growth it is one
contributing factor. Of the 2.6% average annual growth of gross output of
total industry between 1976-1983 only 0.2% came from growth of total factor
productivity (TFP), the rest being realized by increases resource inputs.1'
TFP growth thus contributed only 8% to the output growth in Hungary compared
to a normal pattern of 20-30%, which implies poor productivity performance
and, indirectly, ineffective TD.
D. Constraints on TD
2.10     The constraints on achieving sufficient and effective TD in Hungary
can be summarized under the following five categories:
(i)    resource constraint.  Although the macroeconomic R&D intensity of
Hungary is comparable to that in many advanced industrialized
countries, the absolute volume of resources available for R&D work is
1/ Hungary: Industrial Policy, Performance, and Prospect for Adjustment, Bank
Report No. 6124, Sept.30, 1986, p.54.



limited because of the small size of economy. In addition, the
shortage of convertible currency resulting from continuing economic
difficulty has limited the import of critical equipment and licenses
for R&D. Hungary is also scarce in human resources for TD,
especially in manpower required for application of R&D results to
commercial production.
(ii) inefficient resource allocatior. Resources have been spread too
thinly, without sufficient targutting to ensure effectiveness of TD
activities. Given the overali limitatior on resources, remedying
this situation means painful decisions to reduce or eliminate
resources in some areas in order to make increased critical amounts
available for others.
(iii) excessive autarky. Hungary's R&D programs have exhibited an inward
looking tendency, in an apparent attempt to achieve self-sufficiency
in a broad range of technologies. The autarkic tendency has
exacerbated the problem of scarce R&D resources being spread thinly
over many areas with too little use being made of foreign R&D
results through purchasing of licenses and know-how. Hungary's
over-concentration on its own lines of development has reduced the
level and quality of contacts with developments elsewhere and
prevented optimal "make or buy" decisions regarding specific
technological requirements.
(iv) inadequate infrastructure for R&D. Partly due to the lack of policy
attention, the Hungarian community for technological R&D has
suffered from the lack of required infrastructure, i.e., instruments
and other facilities, information and its network essential for
carrying out R&D. The institutional framework for TD (including
standardization and metrology, legal and accounting procedures to
protect intellectual property, financial mechanisms, etc.) has not
been sufficiently successful in raising the level of production
technology and encouraging enterprise efforts for innovation.
Improving the infrastructure for R&D is essential to support greater
TD effectiveness through decentralization of R&D into commercially
oriented enterprises.
(v) policy and institutional environment. Finally, and most
importantly, the general environment in which enterprises have
operated in Hungary in the past has not provided the needed
incentives for efficiency, productivity growth and profitability.
Within this general environment, which also affected TD adversely,
the specific policy and institutional environment for TD has
suffered two major weaknesses: (a) policy focussed too heavily on
direct research and not enough on practical commercial application,
and (b) a lack of market orientation. The structure of the R&D
community and of i-ldustrial establishments has limited the
commercial application and development of the results of R&D
activity. The etivironment and incentives within which enterprises



- 8 -
functioned did not induce them to seek and implement new
technologies. Tax and related incentives as well as enterprise
accounting methods did not support enterprise efforts for
innovation and commercial application of research results.
Decisions concerning the direction of TD rested largely with the
authorities, not with individual enterprises. Financial
institutions specialized in operations for TD were de facto
financial agents of the Government rather than independent banks
operating at their own risk. Since the late 1970s growing efforts
have been made to remedy these problems. These efforts are
reflected in the current National Medium-rai,ge R&D Plan (para.
3.03) and the reform program related to the Plan, but much remains
to be done to create a favorable environment for satisfactory TD
performance.
2.11     The need to address the problems outlined above has become
increasingly urgent in view of two salient worldwide trends. First, the speed
of technological advance in most areas, especially those affected by micro-
electronics and biotechnology, is accelerating as is the capital intensity of
research efforts. Thus the critical manc of resources necessary to stay on
the cutting edge of any particular technology is increasing, and the costs of
continuing to spread resources too thinly and declining to take advantage of
foreign licenses and know-how, are rising correspondingly. Second, the
increasing integration of world markets and rapid spread of new technologies
means that production based on inferior techno'ogy quickly becomes
uncompetitive, both in foreign and domestic markets. (Although the domestic
market can be partially protected by some policy measures, this has its own
high costs in economic yrowth and does not provide a long-term solutior. to the
problem.) Therefore, ror a small open economy such as Hungary, with limited
resources and an intense need to increase productivity and international
competitiveness, the costs of a thinly spread, economically ineffective TD
effort are increasingly severe.
2.12     The Government recognizes that failure to remedy the situation will
result in Hungary falling progressively behind -n most technological fronts
with a resulting loss of competitiveness and market strength and, thereby,
will seriously compromise its plans for sustained economic growth and
structural reform. Accordingly, a high priority for TD forms an integral and
critical part of all current plans and is supported by an explicitly
articulated strategy.

Im. STRATEGY FOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
A. Policy Objectives
3.01     The Hungarian Government has increasingly recognized that past
efforts to improve the rate and efficiency of TD have not been sufficient,
and has launched a policy program to improve TD performance. The foundation
of the program lies in Hungary's Long-Term Plan (LTP) for TD. The last LTP
.was completed in 1980. Preparations are well under way for the next, which is
scheduled for 1990 and will cover the period 1990-2010. Although not yet
completed, the basic premises underlying the new LTP are becoming clear.
These are: (i) Hungary is a small country with limited financial and human
resources. Economic growth cannot proceed any further in the traditional
path. Hungary must increasingly specialize in areas of comparative advantage
in order to raise productivity and living standards; (ii) Hungary must
increasingly become iategrated in the world economy, relying on foreign trade,
both to sell its own products and to obtain goods and services for its
investment and consumption purposes; (iii) Raising productivity and
international competitiveness requires restructuring of the economy in favor
of market oriented modes of operation and a continuing improvement in the
level of technology; (iv) The Government's TD policy, recognizing the scarcity
of resources, must place heavier emphasis on increasing the efficiency of R&D
activity rather than on expanding Government spending for R&D; (v) Global
trends in TD are changing the importance of different factors of production,
with intellectual inputs and information rising in significance. Key areas in
future global development will be electronization, biotechnology, new
materials, space and new forms of energy production (and conservation). Of
these, the first two provide the best immediate prospects for Hungary to
specialize, though the others (especially new materials) may also offer
opportunities; (vi) To take advantage of these technologies and opportunities
requires more than simply undertaking specific R&D projects--it requires
creating an entire "culture" in chosen fields (e.g., of precision engineering
or computers and information technology, a complex of infrastructure,
qualified manpower, institutional support, and incentives etc.); and
(vii) Short and medium-term TD programs must aim simultaneously at building
the necessary cultures as well as meeting immediate need. These require a
balanced partnership between Government, which provides long-term guidance and
support and ensures the necessary environment, and enterprises which are the
direct actors in TD.
3.02     By the early 1980s, after the formulation of the first LTP, the
Government had begun to address the constraints on effective TD especially
by: (i) concentrating TD resources on priority sectors (electronics, the
application of computer technology and software, energy and material savings,
chem5cals and bio-technology, and provision of infrastructure for TD); and,
(ii) introducing a greater degree of market orientation.  Central R&D
resources are being allocated in increasing proportion to enterprises through
competitive contracts with commercial viability playing a more important
criterion in awarding contracts. The Government has also promoted the
establishment of innovation financing institutions, and is introducing new
incentive mechanisms for R&D through the tax reform. Deterioration of the
external economic balance over the last few years has forced Hungary to attach



- 10 -
additional 'Importance to activities which promise to earn or save convertible
currency. This concern is manifested in the TD program as well--extra
priority being given to R&D which upgrades the quality and Aaternational
marketability of Hungarian products, develops substitutes for imports, or
develops new areas where Hungary has a realistic possibility of achieving a
competitive position in the world market.
B. The Current Medium-Rnane R&D Plan (MRP)
3.03     By the mid 1980s the Government had concluded that efforts to improve
TD had to be increased. Accordingly it launched a Medium Range Plan (MRP)
based on the premises and objectives outlined above. The MRP increases the
attention on the objectives: (i) greater concentration of R&D resources on
priority areas; and (ii) promotion of market-oriented R&D and implementation
of R&D results. In addition, the MRP emphasizes: (iii) strengthening the
R&D-related infrastructure and institutional framework through direct
Government initiative; and (iv) encouraging introduction and assimilation of
foreign technology by imports of equipment, licensing agreements, joint
ventures, etc. The MRP is set in the context of policy and institutional
measures to improve the TD environment that are contained in the industrial
restructuring program. The MRP consist of: (a) twelve government-led sectoral
programs and (b) a program to improve R&D infrastructure. Both are
summarized, along with complementary policy and institutional measures, in the
TD component of the policy reform matrix (Table 3.1), implementation of which
is being monitored as an integral parL of the Bank dialogue with Hungarian
authorities on industrial restructuring and sector policy reform.
1. Policy and Iistitutional Measures to Iuprove the TD Environment
3.04     A major sphere of policy measures relates to economic incentives.  In
general, the Government has sought since 1968 to move R&D policy away from
direct commands and toward use of indirect incentives to enterprises. Until
1983, however, these moves were inadequate and ineffective. Since 1983 there
have been a number of measures intended to remedy this. However, these
measures have sometimes appeared to be confusing or even contradictory, and
their net result is not clear. For instance, an enterprise undertaking R&D
for external clients could earn a 75% tax credit for the profit generated from
its sale of R&D services. On the one hand, this scheme encouraged TD
companies to expand their operations. On the other hand, "in-house" R&D by
enterprise did not receive any benefit from this scheme. The purpose of the
tax credit was to encourage specialized R&D companies and institutes to seek
industrial clients, but it may have had an unintended effect of biasing
manufacturing enterprises against in-house R&D. This possible bias has been
reduced after January 1, 1988, when the rate of this tax preference was
reduced to 67% and at the same time, a new tax preference was introduced to
provide enterprises with a corporate tax credit up to 10% of average R&D
expenditure in the three most recent years. However, the apparent reduction
in the bias against in-house R&D result is muddied by the fact that, since
January 1, 1988 R&D services are exempt from the new value-added tax. This
exemption may outweigh the two other measures and, once again, make "traded"
R&D services cheaper than "in-house" R&D services. Finally, there has been an
accelerated depreciation mechanism for specific equipment used for R&D as well

as for production purpose.  Under this mechanism any enterprise or R&D
institute can choose an accelerated depreciation schedule of up to 302 per
year of original value for its purchase of designated kinds of equipment such
as numerically controlled machine tools, industrial robots and certain
electronic measurement systems. Given the complicated nature of R&D incentive
mechanisms together with the massive changes associated with the new tax
reform, the iverall net effects are unclear. In view of this, the Government
will review the system of incentives affecting TD, assessing its effectiveness
in achieving the desired policy objectives, and implement needed improvements
(Table 3.1).
3.05     Other measures include: (i) abolition of the compulsory R&D reserve
under which enterprises were required to set aside a specific amount of money
from R&D. Since January 1, 1988, enterprises are free to decide how much to
spend on R&D and how to spend it; (ii) simplification of the procedures for
obtaining foreign technical license and knowhow; and (iii) strengthening of
the banking sector's capacity to mobilize and allocate TD resources.
2. Govermnent-led R&D Prograns
3.06     As a Government initiative in efforts for R&D in priority areas, the
MRP specifies twelve National R&D Programs financed jointly by
state-controlled resources and the enterprises' own funds (Table 3.2).
Expenditure for the twelve programs over the five year period 1986-90 will be
approximately Ft 38 billion, or some 252 of the total expenditure for R&D
during the same period.  Of this, approximately Ft 18 billion, or some 471,
will be financed either by the state budget or by the Central Technology
Development Fund (CTDF); the remainder will be financed by enterprises. (Even
for Government-led R&D programs, market-orientation is being made a more
important a criterion for selecting participating enterprises and
sub-projects). The major portion of total expenditure is directed to
electronics and related areas such as production automation. Other priority
areas include pharmaceutical products, material and energy saving,
biotechnology and its application to food production. Some 411 of the total
available resources from the CTDF will be devoted to the twelve programs while
the remainder will be allocated to sectoral and other R&D programs under the
jurisdiction of various agencies (51X) and to the infrastructure development
program (8X). As shown in Annex 2-1 (Table A-1), the State Office for
Technology Development (OMFB) and the Ministry of Industry (MOI) supervise the
majority (approximately 701) and finance approximately one-third of the total
sectoral program. Elements of the proposed project directly support programs
1 and 6 (paras. 4.09-4.11) and indirectly also support programs 2, 4 and 5
(paras. 4.05-4.07, 4.09-4.11, 4.12-14).

3. R&D Infrastructure
3.07     In addition to the n.tional R&D programs discussed in para. 3.06, the
Government has, as part of the MRP, adopted a national program to modernize
and develop the infrastructure for R&D with an aim to iimprove the environment
for the entire R&D sector and the efficiency of R&D activities at various
levels. The total amount of the program will be Ft 8.5 - 9.0 billion for the
five year period, out of which Ft 2.5 billion will be financed by the CTDF,
Ft 1.9 billion by the National Scientific Research Fund (OTKA) and the
remainder by resources of relevant research institutes or enterprises. Areas
of the program include: (i) increasing and upgrading the stock of
instruments; (ii) implementation of R&D results through innovation parks, a
training center for printed circuit boards, pilot plants for biotechnology and
experimental workshop for mechanics; (iii) information processing,
(iv) dissemination of CAD/CAM for R&D; (v) standardization; (vi) metrology;
and (vii) dissemination of patent information. The program is summarized in
Table 3.1. Elements of the proposed project support each of these components
of the TD infrastructure program (paras. 4.03-4.07, 4.19 and 4.20).
3.08     Hungary meets minimum requirements for having its own systems for
standardization, metrology and quality control, all of which form, an
indispensable basis for TD. However, there is much to be done to modernize
these facilities. The proposed project contains an element to support
upgrading of metrology (para. 4.19). The GOH is working on a broad program to
upgrade the institutions and activity of quality control as one component in
the general drive to improve the productivity and international
competitiveness of Hungarian industry. Besides state organizations for these
areas, the Government has established some 30 institutions (some are wholly or
partly state supported, some are part of R&D Institutes and some are wholly
commercial). One part of the project is designed to support this effort
(para. 4.20).

(Ft 50 million) and by each relevant organization(s) (Ft 1,176 million).



- 16 -
3.09     Another important aspect of TD infrastructure is the framework for
proteci:ion of intellectual property, which is also essential to promote R&D.
Hungary has been a cooperative member of the international community in this
respezt and its State Office for Invention (OTH) works as an executing body
for the legal protectiotn of patents, trademarks and industrial designs.
However, the number of parent applications per year is quiva small
(arproximately 5,500 for the period 1981-85, para. 2.08) despite a scheme of
remnleration for official inventions by employed workers. Compu-er software
is regarded not patentable but copyrightable as is the case in many
industrialized countries. Accounting changes permitting capitalization of
intellectual property including method of valuation are being studied within
the Government and are available on a limited basis (i.e. for items purchased
commercially). Consideration is being given to further extension of this
principle for self-developed property for introduction in 1989 (Table 3.1).
C. Introduction of Foreign Techno1oi
3.10     Tne Government has been aware that Hungary has to increase the
introduction of foreign technology in order to keep up with t'orldwide
progress, and to utilize domestic resources more efficiently. The
Medium-Range Plan indicates this indirectly by stressing a need for
international cooperation in R&D. Also, a series of actiors has been taken to
simplify and streamline procedures for approval of a licensing agreement with
foreign partners along with a similar move for direct foreign investment
including investment in joint ventures. As the next step to facilitate the
process, the Government intends to replace, in 1989, the current license
approval procedure in specified areas by a simpler mechanism for registering
licensing agreements. Several elements of the project involve introduction of
new foreign technology either through purchase of licenses and/or through
joint ventures.
D. Planning for the Next Medium-Rane Plan
3.11     The Government will conduct a mid-term review of the implementation
of the current MRP toward the middle of 1988 (Table 3.1). The impact of the
recent tax reform as well as of specific tax mechanisms on R&D activity will
also be monitored. In addition to these ongoing reviews, work is beginning on
development of the next Medium-Range Plan to commence with the eighth Five
Year Plan (1991-95) based on the experience with initiatives which have
already been launched in the current plan. Although still at a very
preliminary stage, the next Medium-Range Plan can be expected to pursue a
strategy which builds upon and strengthens the main themes of the current MRP,
especially: decentralization of R&D activities to individual enterprises
within a commercial, market-oriented context; strengthening of the
infrastructure available to support R&D activity; facilitation of the
introduction of foreign technology; and improvement in the direction and
quality of P&D activity undertaken directly by the Government.
E. ChaUenges for Future StrategY
3.12     Hungary faces a number of challenges in evolving and subsequently
implementing a dynamic strategy to promote effective TD. First, an effective
system of incentives for TD is needed to improve the current system of too



- 17 -
rn'y micro incentives each designed to induce specific types of behavior but
whose net effect may become confused and unmonitorable. Second, an optimal
balance needs to be struck between concentrating resources on too few
projects, which is risky, and spreading resources too widely and thinly, which
avoids the risk of any large failures but also renders large successes
unlikely. The latter kind of risk is increasing due to the enhanced capital
intensity of cutting-edge R&D (para. 2.11). In addition, the Government will
have difficulty overcoming the historical tendency to spread resources too
thinly. The task of selecting those areas with the highest probability of
success is equally difficult and will require effective institutions and
necessary skills.
3.13     Finally, there are two major issues to be addressed in designing the
future strategy on 'Tungary's TD: the proportion of nationwide resources to be
directed for R&D, and the role of Government in resource allocation for R&D.
Since the rate of economic growth of Hungary in coming years is expected to be
slow, a large increase in expenditure for R&D in absolute terms is
unrealistic. This will generate increasing pressure for more efficiency and
greater effectiveness in the use of R&D resources. In view of the increasing
capital intensity of cutting-edge R&D, the number of R&D directions which can
be dealt with effectively will tend to decrease over time. The need for
budgetary restraint will need to be balanced against an upward tendency of the
GERD/GNP ratio as in many western countries which are strongly committed
toward strengthened macroeconomic R&D intensity and whose industries are
Hungary's actual and potential competitors. Finally, increased R&D
expenditures by commercial enterprises could make it possible for GERD to grow
faster than GNP without additional government spending. This once again
underlines the importance of effective incentives and also of appropriate
mechanisms to finance R&D efforts of enterprises.
3.14     In light of the above, the Government will supplement its ongoing
analysis and review of the MRP with two studies, financed by the project:
(i) to recommend methods to improve the appraisal of TD activities and
allocation of TD resources by the Government; and (ii) to examine ways to
strengthen the venture capital function of the banking system. This was
confirmed at negotiations (para. 4.22).
F. Bank Strategy for Assisting Industrial and Technology Development in Hungary
3.15     Since it started lending to Hungary in 1983, the Bank's strategy for
assistance has focussed on supporting Hungary's program of structural reform
in the economy, to make it more efficient, flexible, market responsive and
competitive in external markets, particularly in the convertible currency
area. Until the mid-1980s, Bank involvement in the industrial sector took the
form of investment projects in support of energy conservation, export
development and development of the fine chemicals industry. From 1985, the
Bank has supported intensification of the reform effort and industrial
restructuring through two industrial restructuring projects, which combined
subsector and enterprise restructuring with support for policy changes to
encourage competition, tighten financial discipline, and enhance resource
mobility in the economy.



- 18 -
3.16     Consistent with this strategy, the proposed Technology Development
Project is designed as an integral part of the overall industrial
restructuring and reform program sketched above. It seeks to address a
fundamental constraint to improved productivity and international
competitiveness of Hungarian industry. The Bank's involvement has
strengthened the dialogue specifically linked to TD policy and served to
heighten the Government's awareness of some of the underlying critical
issues.  It has also contributed to strengthening the policy/institutional
framework as well as the financing mechanisms for TD.

[V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives and Description
4.01     Objectives.  The proposed TD project is designed to improve the
capability of Hungarian industry to undertake and sustain TD necessary to meet
the national objectives of increased productivity and international
competitiveness in the context of the Government's economic reform program.
The direct objectives of the project are: (i) to strengthen the R&D
infrastructure, especially in areas of computer applications and software;
(ii) to irprove production technology in selected industries where it is
likely to have a spread effect on other industries; (iii) to increase the
efficiency and applicahility of R&D by increasing the commercial orientation
of R&D entities; (iv) to develop activities which have a strong chance of
becoming internationally competitive and which, thereby, can save or earn
convertible currency; and (v) to develop and strengthen the institutional and
financing mechanisms for TD in Hungary. With regard to strengthening the
institutional framework for TD, the project aims to: encourage and strengthen
the role of the banking sector in identifying, appraising and financing TD;
and strengthen the ability d eovernment institutions to assess, plan and
execute TD strategies.
4.02     Project Description  fI accordance with the above objectives, the
project is comprised of three components: (I) investment in commercially-
oriented sub-projects via participating Hungarian banks (US$$45.9 million of
the Bank loan). These sub-projects are grouped in three areas: R&D
infrastructure, new industrial technology, and computer software. A number of
sub-project proposals were examined for conformity with the project
objectives, and eight sub-projects (US$31 million of the Bank loan) were
selected for pre-appraisal.-'  Additional sub-projects will be screened by
OMFB for eligibility and appraised by Hungarian banks for funding under the
line of credit; (II) two pre-appraised investments in non-commercial,
government-owned entities which provide essential services to TD activities
(US$3.6 million of the Bank loan); and (III) technical assistance to train
staff of enterprises, Hungarian banks and government departments, assist in
appraisal of sub-projects, and suppcrt preparation of the next mid-range plan
(US$0.5 million of Bank loan). A description of the sub-projects can be found
in Annexes 4-1 - 4-10 and full details are available in the Project File.
B. Component I - Commercial TD Investments
4.03     This component consists of subloans to commercial enterprises.  Eight
of these are for sub-projects which have been pre-appraised and the remainder
for s'b-projects which will be appraised and funded under a line of credit.
Sub-projects in Component I fall into three categories: Infrastructure,
Industrial Technology and Software.
1/ Examples of proposals that were rejected, and the reasons are given in
Annex 4-16.



- 20 -
1. R&D Infrastructure
4.04     Decentralization of R&D to commercially-oriented entities can only
succeed if the necessary infrastructure to support these entities is
strengt.nened. Accordingly, Component I includes sub-projects desi ned to
strengthtn the infrastructure supporting industrial R&D activities-'
including irproved provision of essential background services and essential
inputs and components.
4.05     Production of Special-Purpose Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs).  R&D
activities require special purpose equipment to be built--experimental tools,
models, instruments etc.-many of which require specially designed and
produced PCBs. Typically, only one or a few of such PCBs are required for
each task. Hungary does not have a specializeu ...,terprise to produce these at
the moment. As a result Hungarian R&D units must obtain these from the
existing PCB producer on an exceptional basis or from abroad. Because of the
high degree of close co-operation between user and designer required for such
special-purpose, custom-designed boards, neither source is satisfactory. Thus
Hungarian researchers often have to either accept long delays or make do
without such PCBs entirely. The sub-project would establish a specialized,
commercial Hungarian facility to improve significantly the availability of
this critical input as well as the speed and convenience with which the R&D
comunnity can obtain it. In addition, certain aspects of the design of
special-purpose PCBs will become an export activity primarily to PCB firms in
nearby countries (e.g., Austria, FRG). The proposed facility would be
established as a fully independent, commercial joint venture of a number of
Hungarian firms with one of them (SERVINTERN) as the lead agent. The facility
will operate in technical and marketing co-operation with a foreign partner
and future equity participation by this partner is possible.
4.06     Instrument Rental.  There is a severe shortage of instruments for
R&D. Most companies ard R&D organization do not have the resources
(especially foreign exchange) to buy the instruments they need; nor would it
make sense to purchase an expensive instrument for use in one or two
experiments if equipment could be obtained temporarily when needed on a rental
basis. Unfortunately, the small rental capacity which exists does not
function adet4uately because the lack of instruments, in both number and
variety, is sc great. Often the required instrument is not available at all.
Also when it is available, enterprises tend to hoard rented instruments in
order to ensure their availability when they need them. The proposed
sub-project would significantly increase the number and variety of rental
equipment and would set prices high enough to discourage excessive hoarding of
rented equipment. The subloan would be made to MMSZ, an existing organization
of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The facility will operate on a
commercial, self-sustaining, profit-making basis.
1/ An earlier sub-project, a computer data-base and information network
(along the lines of Dialogue or Meade Data Central) was financed under the
First Industrial Restructuring Project (Loan 2700-HU). Its design and
appraisal have served as a model and learning opportunity for the rest of
the project.



- 21 -
4.07     Innovation Park.  A considerable amount of potentially commercial
research is currently being done in the Budapest Technical University (BTU),
which specializes in electronics and computer applications. A number of
professors already have ad hoc practices working for or with Hungarian and
foreign industrial enterprises. This activity could be greatly stimulated,
thereby improving both the quality of the research and its direct application,
by the creation of an independent innovation park which would provide
infrastructure facilities (computer services, premises, marketing, clerical
support etc.) on a commercial basis to businesses based on research taking
place in the university. At the Bank's suggestion, the partners (MOI, the
Council of Budapest Borough 11, the Industrial Development Bank, and BTU)
engaged in a survey of similar research parks in western countries visited
several. The results of this research have been incorporated in the design of
the sub-project. The innovation park would be a new joint venture with the
Technical University as the lead partner and would operate as an independent
commercial entity.
2. Introduction of New Technolonr
4.08     The second category consists of sub-projects which introduce a new
technology into a particular Hungarian industry, to have an impact on the
general level of industrial technology beyond the beneficiary enterprise, and
improve prospects of Hungarian products for either export or import
substitution on a competitive basis.
4.09     CAD/CAM Services.  Many small and medium industrial firms need
Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) services to
improve their productivity and the quality of their output but do not have the
resources to acquire in-house capability. The proposed sub-project, operated
by SZAMALK (the well-established Computer Applications and Services Company
under the supervision of the Central Statistical Office), would provide
CAD/CAM services on a commercial basis, primarily to small and medium sized
Hungarian firms which do not have the capacity for in-house generation of
these services. This will contribute to improved quality and competitiveness
of these firms. In addition, based on existing initial experience with a few
CAD/CAM tools already created by SZAMALK there is a reasonable chance that the
new firm will be able to export some of its products and services, either
directly or on a sub-contract basis.
4.10     Industrial Automation I.  This sub-project will upgrade the
production of automated control equipment for manufacturing industry and is
sponsored by VILATI, an established firm in this area. Automation is crucial
to increased productivity and higher quality. The technology of process
control is being revolutionized worldwide by microprocessors, lasers, fiber
optics etc. The Hungarian process control industry must make a major effort
to modernize their product soon or be in danger of falling irrevocably
behind--which, in turn, would jeopardize the rest of industry (since Hungary
cannot effort to import everything it needs in this area).
4.11     Industrial Automation II.  This sub-project is similar to Industrial
Automation I, but with the focus on flow system controls. The lead partner,
MMG, has a background in controls for continuous flow systems (e.g., for power
grids, power stations, chemical plants, refineries, railroad and



- 22 -
transportation networks, and pipeline systems of all sorts) and is an
important exporter of these systems. Like manufacturing automation, this
sector is at a critical juncture. If the Hungarian industry does not quickly
move on to electronic technologies its market position could collapse--
resulting in a gap in the supply of modern systems to Hungarian industry, and
the loss of export markets.
3. Computer Software
4.12     Hungary has a burgeoning computer software industry with considerable
potential (Annex 4-11). This is a critical input to TD of virtually all other
industries and also constitutes an area where Hungary has demonstrated
expertise and comparative advantage. Despite operating with several handicaps
(especially outdated tools and equipment, in large part arising from the CoCom
restrictions), Hungary is emerging as a successful niche producer of computer
software and software services at home, in the CMEA and in the West.  The GOH
has decided to emphasize the software industry in the interests of both
supporting the technical development of Hungarian industry in general and as
an export-oriented industry in its own right. The following sub-projects
would support this strategy.
4.13     Expert systems.  The Institute for Computer Coordination (SZKI), is a
leading Hungarian software firm which had early experience adapting
academic-oriented logical computer languages (e.g. Prolog) to practical
applications and some success exporting software design tools based on its own
variation (MProlog). This market is now highly competitive, if not
saturated. To sustain and improve its position it must move into producing
the "shells" (programs which provide links between standard software tools and
specific applications) and complete applications programs (expert systems).
The latter is especially desirable because it builds upon (low-cost) Hungarian
expertise in specific substantive areas (such as health care) as well as on
(low-cost) Hungarian computer expertise. The sub-project would support this
strategy. The sub-project would function as an independent profit center
within SZKI. Initially, activity would be centered on in-house development of
shells and expert systems while revenues would come from expansion and
redirection of its established contract business (on average 202 of SZKI's
professional employees are abroad working on contract with foreign customers)
toward expert system work. Over time emphasis would shift to sale and
servicing of its own products. Other Hungarian industries would benefit both
from forward linkages (supply of expert systems for their own operations) and
backward linkages (use by SZKI of Hungarian experts in various subjects in
building systems).
4.14     Software Development for Professional Workstations.  The Institute
for Computer Application and Automation of the iNIational Academy of Science
(SZTAKI) is a well-established reputable enterprise with considerable
experience in software development. The sub-project aims to capitalize on
Hungary's comparative advantage in devising custom-tailored small-system
software. The sub-project would concentrate on developing systems designed to
operate on "workstation" computers (which are powerful desktop machines
affordable to many small and medium-size business), which incorporate some
"texpert system" features and which are highly tailored to specific customer
needs. To facilitate the major focus on exports to convertible currency
areas, joint ventures will be set up in major target markets with partners



- 23 -
which have established customer bases. In addition to the principle
production facility in Budapest a small additional facility will be
established in Austria to permit final adaptation of software products for
use on enuipment which is unavailable in Hungary because of export
restrictions.
4. Line of Credit for Additional Sub-projects Under Component 1.
4.15     The line of credit would be for additional sub-projects which would
be screened by OMFB for eligibility and appraised by the Hungarian banks.
assisted by OMFB when necessary, according to procedures and criteria which
have been developed on the basis of experience with pre-appraised sub-projects
and subsequently agreed with the Bank. The project design deliberately
emphasizes, appraisal and risk-taking by the banks rather than concentrate on
building up a central TD agency to make funding allocation decisions. This is
in keeping with the thrust and spirit of the Hungarian reform process in
general and with the Bank's overall strategy in Hungary.
4.16     In order to be eligible, a sub-project proposal must be certified by
OMFB as meeting the goals of at least one of the three sub-project categories,
i.e. (a) strengthen R&D infrastructure; (b) introduce new technology into an
industry in such a way as to have a broad impact on industrial technology in
general; (c) strengthen and upgrade the computer software industry-as an
input to other industries and as an export. In addition, sub-project
proposals should exhibit a strong commercial, market-oriented focus and
contribute (either directly or indirectly) to the development of
internationally competitive products or services capable of earning or saving
foreign exchange.
4.17     Participating banks would be responsible as part of their subloan
agreements with the NBH for assuring that sub-project entities would be able
to maintain a current ratio of more than 1.3, a debt/equity ratio of less than
65/35, and a debt service coverage above 1.5. Sub-projects should contribute
significantly to expanding exports by enterprises, and also to spreading the
benefits of technological development widely in industry. Each sub-project
must have a projected financial and economic rate of return of at least 18X
and must conform to Hungarian law with respect to environmental practices.
While the prime responsibility for appraisal would rest with the participating
banks, the banks may utilize the services of specialized consultants or
consulting firms or the OMFB to assist them in appraisal of enterprises and
sub-projects as necessary.
C. Component It - Non-Comrmercial Investments
4.18     Component II consists of investments by non-commercial entities
providing R&D infrastructure services. Financing for them will be made
available directly to the beneficiary entities by the Government. Two
investments have been identified and pre-appraised (details are provided in
Annexes 4-9 and 4-10); there is no line of credit for this component.
4.19     Center for Metrology.  One of the most basic elements of R&D
infrastructure is the national system of metrology and standards for the
calibration of all measurements (distance, mass, time, strength etc.).
Weaknesses in the Hungarian metrological center are a constraint on R&D



- 24 -
activity throughout the country. The sub-project would upgrade the Institute
for metrology, concentrating on those areas which are most important to
industrial TD, especially in relation to exports.
4.20     Institutes for Quality control.  In Hungary, as in other nations,
there are a number of institutes which test for and certify basic standards of
quality (purity, tensile strength, chemical composition), compatibility
(electric plugs and current, TV and radio, etc.) and safety. The project
would support a program of upgrading the caliber and equipment of these
institutes especially those involved in export industries.
4.21     The nature of the metrology and the quality control activities and of
the institutes which undertake them is only partly commercial. Accordingly,
as is normal in most countries,it is not expected that they would be fully
commercial, although fees would be charged for many services.
D. Component m - Technical Assistance and Traiing
4.22   (i) Technical Assistance (TA) provided under the project consists of
three facets:
(a) TA and training for new technology which is specific to, and
included in pre-appraised and line-of-credit components (and
therefore is not included in this separate component);
(b) TA to assist participating banks in appraisal of
line-of-credit sub-projects; and
(c) TA in support of two studies related to the policy planning
process in preparation of the next FYP, i.e., resource
allocation of central TD funds, and risk capital functions
for TD (para 3.11). Draft Terms of Reference for both
studies, which are to be completed by end 1989, are given in
Annex 4-12, and were agreed at negotiations.
(ii) Training activities to be financed under the project consist of
three parts:
(a) Training of OMFB, NBH and Ministries staff in project design,
appraisal and administration in the TD field;
(b) Training of the staff of participating commercial and
Innovation Banks in selection, screening, appraisal and
administration (including procurement, execution and
supervision) of specific sub-projects in TD area; and
(c) Training of enterprise executives in development and
implementation of market oriented R&D activities within
enterprises.
The broad framework and content of the above training activities are given in
Annex 4-13.



- 25 -
4.23     As the Hungarian counterpart experts for the different studies have
considerable sophistication, it is envisaged that the TA will blend
consultancy assistance with various forms of training for Hungarian experts.
Following this, studies will be jointly produced, i.e., prepared by Hungarian
experts supervised and assisted by foreign consultants. Similarly the
training activities will blend training with study visits abroad where
"hands-on" training of Hungarian experts will be conducted. The TA and
training activities (excluding the ones included in the pre-appraised
sub-projects totalling about US$0.67 million) will amount to about 56
man-months of Hungarian counterparts and 15 man-months of foreign experts and
will cost about US$0.5 million which is comprised of US$150,000 to set up a
small fund for assistance to the participating banks in appraisal of
sub-projects, US$125,000 to support TA Studies, and US$225,000 for training.
An overview is given in Annex 4-14.
E. Project Cost and Financing
4.24     The total project cost is estimated at US$118.1 million, of which
US$50 million is in foreign exchange, as summarized in Table 4.1 (see also
Annex 4-15 for year-by-year details). The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million
would cover 100% of the foreign exchange costs. Of the US$50 million foreign
exchange required, about 69% is needed for the pre-appraised sub-projects, 30%
for the credit line and 1% for the separate technical assistance and training
component. For component I, the local costs would be met by the beneficiaries
through self-generated funds, equity contributions and loans from
participating commercial banks and specialized financial institutions. For
components II and III, the local costs will be met by enterprises own budgets
as well as contributions from the Government through OMFB (Table 4.2).

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Proiect Execution
5.01     NBH, as the borrower, has ultimate responsibility for the Bank loan.
However, in executing this function, NBH will work closely with and rely
heavily upon OMFB, which is the arm of the Government responsible for
promotion and coordination of TD and which has direct technical expertise in
the development and execution of the project. To ensure smooth
implementation, a project advisory unit will be established under the
supervision of OMFB to provide initial screening for eligibility of
sub-project proposals, to assist enterprises and banks in generating and
evaluating v:able proposals, and to act as liaison between the Bank and the
beneficiaries (e.g., regarding procurement, reporting etc).
5.02     Execution of the commercial sub-projects under Component I will be
accomplished by the enterprises which receive the subloans. The participating
Hungarian banks (para. 5.11) will appraise each sub-project, act as financial
intermediaries between the NBH and sub-project enterprises, and bear the
direct financial risk associated with individual subloans. OMFB performs
three functions: (i) screening sub-project proposals to ascertain conformity
with the goals and purposes of the project; (ii) assistance to banks and
enterprises in project identification, design and appraisal; and (iii) liaison
between Hungarian participants and the Bank (including responsibility for
agreed reporting requirements). OMFB's functions will be performed, at the
working level, by a project advisory unit whose composition, powers, and
mandate (Annex 5-1) were agreed at negotiations. The loan will be made to the
NBH and onlent to eligible financial institutions for use in financing
sub-projects chosen for the project. US$31 million will be lent to commercial
sub-projects which have been pre-appraised by the Bank in co-operation with
the relevant Hungarian banks.
5.03     Sub-projects under the line of credit would be handled as follows:
individual enterprises will propose projects to one of the approved Hungarian
banks. The bank, if sufficiently interested, will submit the proposal to
OMFB for initial screening to determine eligibility for funding under the
project.
5.04     Once OMFB has certified a sub-project as eligible, the relevant
Hungarian Bank would appraise it in detail, using the same general methodology
employed in the pre-appraised sub-projects and drawing on any of the
following, as needed and available: (i) consultant services (under Component
III); (ii) OMFB assistance; (iii) other Hungarian or foreign sources.
Sub-projects which are successfully appraised by the Hungarian banks would be
extended subloans by these banks. Summary information on these subloans would
be submitted to NBH and OMFB. The latter would forward this information to
the Bank for review. The Bank may require additional information including
full appraisal reports before it authorizes withdrawals from the loan for
these subloans and will require that the appraisal report for the first
subloan by each participating bank be submitted to the Bank for review before
authorizing withdrawal for that subloan. An important purpose of this
procedure, which was confirmed during negotiations, is to encourage, and
require, Hungarian banks to do their own appraisal and assume their own risks
in accordance with the principles of the reform program.



- 30 -
5.05     Investments in Component II would be executed by the relevant
government institutions. The NBH would onlend required funds to OMFB which
would channel them to the institution according to normal government
procedures.
5.06     Technical assistance and training programs will be implemented by
OMFB except for the small fund (US$150,000) for consultancies to participating
banks to assist in the appraisal of line of credit sub-projects (para. 4.23).
This amount will be onlent by NBH to the banks on the same terms as Component
III. OMFB will provide assistance to the banks, if needed, to identify
suitable consultants.
B. Status of Project hnplementation
5.07     Appraisal of pre--identified sub-projects has been conducted for eight
sub-projects in Component: I and the two investments in Component II. The
participating Hungarian bank has been present in all meetings and involved in
the appraisal process.
5.08     Implementation schedules for the individual sub-projects have been
scrutinized and agreed upon during appraisal. A summary schedule is providee.
in Annex 5-2 and individual sub-project schedules at Annex 5-3. All of the
organizations are well qualified for execution, as they, or their lead
partners, have experience in their relevant field of activities.
Implementation of some of the sub-projects (e.g., PCB) will be assisted by
foreign suppliers. In addition, the proposed training programs and TA will
support project execution. Beside OMFB, MOI will have an overview and reader
assistance where needed in the execution.
5.09     Procurement preparations have been under way simultaneously with loan
processing. Five projects (PCBs/Instrument renting, metrological center,
quality control centers and CAD/CAM totalling US$16 million in subloana) are
expected to be ready to award contracts shortly after the loan is effective.
The Innovation Park (US$5.6 million) is expected to reach this stage by
end-1988.
5.10     For additional sub-projects under the line of credit, the eligible
Hungarian banks have issued a joint public announcement describing the project
and inviting enterprises to submit proposals. This has elicited a strong
response. From the initial expressions of interest, the banks have made an
initial selection of potentially eligible and viable projects for further
examination; examples are given in Annex 5-4. Analysis of the proposals
indicates that there is a sufficient supply of creditable proposals to ensure
that the line of credit can be soundly committed in a reasonable time period.
It is estimated that the line of credit would be fully committed within two
years from loan signature (i.e., by September 1990) leaving ample time for
execution before termination of the project.
C. Participatim Financial Institutions.
5.11     The proposed Bank loan would be made to the NBH, with the guarantee
of the Government. Following the implementation of the banking reform on
January 1, 1987, NBH (which, previously exercised both central banking and



- 31 -
cowitercial banking functions) is responsible for all foreign exchange
operations, management of the external debt and administration of credit
polices of the banking system. The current role of NBH is that of a
traditional central bank in a country with a conventional two-tier competitive
banking system. NBH's commercial banking functions were transferred to three
commercial banks formed from the credit sections of NBH and the State
Development Bank. These are the: (i) Hungarian Credit Bank; (ii) Commercial
and Credit Bank; and, (iii) Development and Credit Bank of Budapest. The
commercial banks compete across all sectors. Besides these three banks, three
additional banks with foreign participation - Citibank, Central European
International Bank (CIB) and UNICBANK (the latter with equity ?articipation of
IFC), are also functioning in Hungary. The three banks formed out of NBH are
undertaking measures to strengthen their organization, management, staffing
and financial position. Towards this end, they are undertaking a training
program satisfactory to the Bank to upgrade their staff capabilities in
commercial banking operations, project evaluation, loan supervision and
customer services. The banks have also agreed to review their loan portfolios
periodically, segregate substandard loans for closer watch and to make
separate provisions to cover any likely loss resulting from them. The
authorities are also expected to introduce a uniform requirement for all
commercial banks to establish such provisions in lin-e with international
practices. Based on an appraisal of their institutional, operational and
financial aspects of the banks and their operational and financial prospects,
the three banks formed out of NBS plus the General Bank for Venture Financing
Interbank, Agrobank and the UNIC bank are judged to be eligible to be
participating banks under the proposed TD project. They are also
participating in other Bank-assiisted projects.
5.12     To promote further development of the financial sector and financing
of innovations and technology, several specialized financial institutions had
been created in the early 1980s. Some of these are expected to become full
service commercial banks in early 1988, while a few others would continue to
function as specialized institutions. The Bank has appraised the specialized
institutions--Industrial Development Bank, Investbank and Innofinance--and
judged them to be eligible to be participating banks for the proposed
project. The new commercial banks are also eligible as intermediary
institutions, having met the agreed institutional criteria for participating
banks, had their operational and financial aspects assessed and have
undertaken to strengthen their operations as is being done by the other
banks. The loan pro-ides the flexibility for additional commercial banks,
which may be establi,hed after loan signature, co seek eligibility based on
meeting the same criteria applied to the banks previously accredited under the
second Industrial Restructuring Project (Loan 2834-HU), as was agreed during
negotiations.
D. Onlending Arrangements and Criteria
5.13     The following agreements were reached at negotiations: the proposed
Bank loan would be made to NBH for a period of 15 yearss including 5 years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest. NBH will carry the foreign
exchange risk. NBH will onlend the part of the loan proceeds relating to
Components II and III to the Government (OMFB), and to the participating banks
for use of consultants in appraisal of sub-projects, for a period of not more



- 32 -
than 15 years including a grace period of 5 years at an interest rate equal to
at least the Dank rate. The conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement with
the Government on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank will be a
condition of loan effectiveness. NBH will onlend the remaining loan proceeds
to the eligible intermediary banks and specialized financial institutions
through its loan rediscounting facility at NBH's prevailing rediscount rate or
at the prevailing Bank rate plus a mark-up of at least 20% whichever is
higher. This mark-up would provide a risk premium to enable NBH to cover the
estimated foreign exchange risk and also its processing costs. In practice,
NBH is expected to make the funds available to the participating intermediary
institutions at its rediscount rate.  This rate, which is currently 12.5%, is
substantially higher than the Bank's current interest rate plus a 20%
premium. NBH would enter into subsidiary financing agreements with eligible
participating banks for onlending of the Bank loan proceeds. The conclusion
of such agreements with at least two of the eligible banks or financial
institutions would be a ^ondition of loan effectiveness.  NBH will undertake
to ensure provision of necessary funds (including foreign exchange) to
intermediary banks to meet subloan requirements of selected sub-projects and
to use any subloan repayment surplus over Bank loan repayments to refinance TD
sub-projects.
5.14     Under the credit policy guidelines, the intermediary banks are free
to set their own deposit and lending rates. The participating banks will
undertake to set their interest rates on the basis of the following principles
agreed with the bank, and incorporated in the policy statement of each bank:
(i) the rates would include an adequate spreau Lo cover the bank's operating
costs including adequate provisions for doubtful debts; (ii) the rates would
be positive in real terms; and (iii) the rates would not subsidize any
category of borrowers. Thus the interest charged by the intermediary
institutions to the ultimate beneficiaries would be their prevailing interest
rate for medium and long-term loans. This initerest rate would be strongly
influenced by the NBH's rediscount rate. NBH's current rediscount rate of
12.51 has been positive in real terms, taking into account recent inflation in
Hungary. Term-lending rates of commercial banks currently approximate 14.5X.
Though this rate may be marginally negative in real terms in 1988, in the
light of projected 152 inflation, the negative interest in real terms would
only be temporary, as in.'lation is projected to decline to 9-10% in 1989. The
Bank would periodically review these interest rates to ensure that they
continue to adhere to the three principles mentioned above.
5.15     Subloans made by intermediary banks to the final beneficiaries will
have maturities of not more than 10 years, including a maximum grace period of
3 years. The intermediary banks will repay NBH the funds onlent by them to
the enterprises on a back-to-back basis. NBH will repay the Bank on a fixed
amortization schedule. Sub-loan repayments received by NBH in excess of its
debt service require:ments on the Bank loan would be relent by NBH to the
~Rrticipating banks for eligible sub-projects.  Participating banks will
undertake to provide, in timely fashion, their share of sub-project financing.

E. Proeurement
5.16     A summarized overview of procurement arrangements is given in
Table 5.1. Details of procurement for pre-appraised sub-projects are given in
Annex 5-5. Equipment and supplies totalling US$19.7 million to be financed by
the Bank will be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in
accordance with Bank guidelines. ICB will be used for about 21 packages
including all packages which exceed US$750,000 in value. Another 27 bid
packages totalling approximately US$10.1 million and licenses will be procured
through LIB as there are only a limited number of suppliers of the particular
goods or services needed. Participating banks as part of their subloan
agreements with the NBH will undertake to ensure that procurement practices of
sub-project beneficiaries will conform to Bank policy and practice. Prior
Bank review of procurement documentation would be required for all contracts
larger than US$750,000.
5.17     Bid packages, each with an estimated value below US$100,000, and
totalling no more than US$15 million in aggregate, will be procured through
international shopping based on price quotations from at least three suppliers
from eligible countries. Bank's prior approval will be necessary for the
procurement through international shopping of bid items each exceeding
US$100,000 £n value.
5.18     Proprietary items, licenses, and extension of existing equipment and
systems estimated to cost not more than US$6 million in total will be obtained
through direct purchase. Contracts for consulting services and training
financed by the Bank totaling US$1.2 million would be let in accordance with
the Bank guidelines. Locally produced goods not financed by the Bank are
procured according to usual practice, through local bidding procedures, direct
purchase, negotiated prices as appropriate subjecr to GOH regulations which
are satisfactory.
5.19     The participation of Hungarian suppliers in ICB is expected to be
very limited since equipment and supplies expected to be purchased under the
proposed loan are generally not manufactured in Hungary. Hungarian
enterprises which do compete under ICB will be eligible for a 15% preference
on the CIF value of the bids, or the amount of customs duties and taxes, which
ever is lower.

F. Disbursement
5.20     The proceeds of the Bank loan would be disbused as follows:
(i) 100l of foreign expenditures and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory
cost) for agreed goods and equipment, and (ii) 1001 of foreign expenditures
for consultants services, technical licenses, and trai:ing. Associated local
costs for these purchases would be met by the relevant institutions, OMFB,
bank or enterprises. All disbursements for contracts valued at less than
US$200,000 would be on the basis of statements of expenditure which detail
the individual transactions. The documentation supporting these expenditures
would be retained by the NBH, and audited by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank, and made available to the Bank for review. Other applications
for disbursement would be fully documented. To facilitate the Borrower's
access to loan funds, NBH will establish a revolving fund. The Bank will make
an initial deposit of US$5 million to be placed in a special account to be
opened by NBH. It is anticipated that the Bank loan would be completely
disbursed by June 30, 1994 in accordance with the disbursement schedule (Annex
5-6) which is in line with the standard disbursement profile for Bank loans
for similar projects in the EMENA region.
G. Accounts and Audit
5.21     It was agreed during negotiations that NBH will furnish to the Bank,
within five months after the end of the fiscal year, a report of the project
account, audited by independent euditors acceptable to the Bank.  NBH will



- 35 -
also retain the annual audited financial statements of beneficiary enterprises
and institutes for Bank staff review during supervision missions.  Within four
months after the closing date of the Bank loan, NBH will prepare and furnish
to the Bank a project completion report dealing with project implementation,
initial operations, and costs and benefits. The above reporting procedures
and contents of the reports were finalized during negotiations.  The project
accounits, the revolving fund, statements of expenditure, and the financial
statements of the project entities will be audited at the end of each fiscal
year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.  Short form annual audit
reports for the preceding fiscal year will be available to the Bank no later
than May each year. The annual statements of the intermediary banks w5ll also
be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank at the end of each
fiscal year. The general Banking and Trust Company, which used to cerry out
such audits for project entities under previous Bank loans has been converted
into a commercial bank. Its audit functions are being separated into an
independent organization which will audit the participating banks and project
beneficiaries.
H. Supervision and Moditoring
5.22     The responsibility for supervising and monitoring the progress of
execution of sub-projects will rest primarily with the commercial banks for
the respective subloans. Reporting requirements toward NBH and the Bank will
be channeled through OMFB's project advisory office, which will have a role in
providing early warning of problem subloans, and in utilizing and
consolidating data required by the Bank. Both NBH and OMFB will monitor,
supervise and, when required, assist in procurement activities which will,
except in two cases of preappraised subprojects (MMG and SZKI), be assisted by
experienced specialized trading enterprises. Disbursement will be supervised
by NBH. Reporting responsibilities for NBH, OMFB and participating banks
(through their separate agreements with NBH) were agreed during negotiations.
5.23     OMFB will coordinate the monitoring and supervising the execution of
the TA and training activities. The two studies and study tours connected
with them will be executed by OMFB. For the organization of the three
training components it is expected thac OMFB will engage, on a contractual
basis, a well qualified specialized Hungarian training organization. The
execution of the TA and training component in the particular sub-projects,
which will be the sole responsibility of the enterprise and its foreign
partner, will be monitored and supervised by OMFB staff.

VI. BENEFTS -AND RISKS
A. Financial Anlysis.
6.01     Preliminary estimates of the financial rates of return of the
pre-appraised sub-projects are summarized in Table 6.1.  These rates of
return, based on assumptions detailed in individual appraisals of the
sub-projects, average 25.4Z for the eight commercial sub-projects and 22.4Z if
the two non-commercial investments are included.  They range from 20% for the
instrument rental sub-project to 37.62 for the MMG industrial automation
sub-project. Assuming that subloans under the line of credit will yield the
minimum financial IRR of 18X required for eligibility of new sub-projects and
excluding the benefits of TA and training, the financial rate of return for
the project can be conservatively estimated to be no less than 21%.

6.02     The estimates for the foreign exchange earnings of the project are
only approximate since most of the sub-projects' output will have an upgrading
effect on other manufacturing activities in Hungary, leading to improved
product quality and competitiveness in western markets. Conservative
estimates for net convertible currency savings indicate that Hungary would
save US$40 million on a single investment count as well as US$55 million/year
in direct and indirect earnings/savings (Table 6.1).



- 37 -
6.03     The financial IRR estimate is conservative because:  (i) the cost of
equipment imports is based on retail price lists, ana, especially in case of
computers, these costs are higher by 5-15S than purchase prices which can be
obtained through ICB, LIB or international shopping; and (ii) the application
of a 10% physical contingency is also conservative, since all sub-projects are
well prepared, and changes in quantities and/or methods of implementation of
this magnitude are unlikely. Thus, there is little prospect of capital cost
overruns. Also, most sub-projects do not include a civil works component, thus
reducing the likelihood of implementation delays.
6.04     The results of sensitivity tests on the pre-appraised sub-projects
for changes in key parameters are summarized below (Table 6.2). These
indicate that the IRRs are most sensitive to adverse movements in output
prices.

6.05     The financial condition of the existing enterprises is good with
little or no long-term debt, current ratios generally higher than 2.4, and
adequate reserves to finance all or a significant portion of the local costs
of the proposed sub-projects. Projected debt-equity and debt service coverage
ratios are satisfactory. Summarized results for each enterprise are contained
in Annexes 4-1 to 4-10.  Key financial indicators are summarized below in
Table 6.3.

6.06     The general agreement between NBH and the Hungarian banks on
onlending arrangements would ensure that the enterprises would not engage in
activities which might adversely affect their financial position in a way that
the enterprises would no longer satisfy agreed financial criteria (para 4.17).
B. Economic BenefiLts
6.07     In addition to the direct financial return included above, all of
Hungarian industry will benefit from the improved quality and flow of R&D
activities, improved technical and software support for modernizing their
production processes and from improved quality control and metrological
services. All of these are critical to Hungary's strategy for increasing
industrial productivity and enhancing the quality of products both of which
are essential for increased exports.
6.08     A minimum economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated by removing
duties and taxes (on investments) from the financial cost/benefit streams for
the pre-appraised comercial sub-projects, and is approximately 312.
6.09     It should be noted that in calculating the above ERR, the indirect
benefits to the industrial production of Hungary are not reflected. However,
these are substantial: (i) PCB Facility, Innovation Park and Instrument Rental
sub-projects will improve the R&D infrastructure of industry, leading to
faster implementation of R&D and improved productivity; (ii) CAD/CAM and
Industrial Automation sub-projects will upgrade the overall industrial
technology by providing more advanced and accurate production control systems;
(iii) Metrology and Quality Control sub-projects are aimed at improving
productivity and product quality and standards (which is a critical factor in
increasing industrial exports). The gross production value of industry in



- 39 -
Hungary was equal to Ft 1,294 billion (US$25 billion) in 1986. If we assume
the sub-projects' indirect effect on the sector will cause a marginal increase
of 0.1% in the production levels due to increased productivity, the ERR for
the pre-appraised commercial sub-projects will be 57%.
C. Environmental Impact
6.10     The vast majority of the activities under the project have no direct
environmental impact. Some of the instruments to be purchased under the
Instrument Rental and Metrology sub-projects will permit improved monitoring
of environmental hazards, primarily in workplaces and will therefore have a
small indirect but positive impact. Direct environmental impact is an issue
in only three sub-projects (specialized PCBs and the two automation
sub-projects) and that arises because one part of the sub-projects (i.e.
production of PCBs) involves some potential exposure to toxic chemicals.
However, processes to be installed under the project: (i) are generally safer
than those they replace; and (ii) conform to Hungarian environmental and
occupational safety and health requirements and are satisfactory to the Bank.
Participating banks will require a statement to this effect from subloan
beneficiaries.
D. Risks
6.1;     The principal risks faced by the project concern:  (i) variation in
the quality of execution (which is inevitable when there are a number of
different beneficiaries); (ii) inadequate appraisal of new sub-projects under
the Line of Credit by the Hungarian banks; and (iii) possible delays in
obtaining some equipment as a result of export restrictiorq.
6.12     The first risk is minimal.  The demand for support for the project
from enterprises has been sufficiently great so that only the best
sub-projects sponsored by by enterprises with strong track records have been
chosen. This is expected to remain the case for the remaining Line of
Credit. In addition, ongoing reporting and supervision requirements will
permit constant monitoring by Hungerian authorities and the Bank to prevent
possible problems.
6.13     The second risk is potentially more serious because of the relative
inexperience of the Hungarian banks in general and with respect to
technology-based venture capitalism in particular. The risk is reduced by
(a) involving the banks in the appraisal of the pre-appraised sub-projects in
order to familiarize them with the task; (b) provision for consultancy and
technical assistance by the banks including assistance from OMFB; (c) training
in appraisal of technology projects for the banks.
6.14     The third risk to the project is manageable because: (a) failure to
obtain an export license for a particular piece of equipment may delay the
relevant sub-project while equipment is re-specified to meet lower technical
requirements but will not have any more serious effect; (b) the project
consists of a number of sub-projects, delay in any one will not materially
affect the viability of the whole project; (c) finally, procurement procedures
have been conducted simultaneous to project preparation for most of the



- 40 -
pre-appraised sub-projects. For these, equipment lists and specifications
have been reviewed. While here is no guarantee that all will receive export
licenses immediately, it is highly likely that most will, and should that any
encounter difficulties equipment can be easily respecified without impairing
the viability of the relevant sub-project. Further, as familiarity with
export regulations increases among Hungarian purchasers, the risk of delay due
to over-specification of equipment will continue to decline.

VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
A. Acreements
7.01     During negotiations agreements were reached with the Government, OMFB
and NBE regarding the following issues:
(i) Creation, under the supervision of OMFB, of a project advisory
unit with composition, powers, responsibilities and TOR
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.02 and Annex 5.1);
(ii) Procedures and criteria for enabling additional banks to
participate in the project (para. 5.12);

satisfactory to the Bank (including, but not limited to,
environmental practices) (paras. 4.17, 6.10);
(b) lending by participating banks will be in accordance with
agreed eligibility criteria and on agreed terms and
conditions (para. 4.17); and
(c) participating banks' share of sub-project financing will be

7.03     The signing of the subsidiary loan agreement with the Government and
subsidiary financing agreements with at least two participating banks will be
a condition of effectiveness (para. 5.13). The signing of a subsidiary
financing agreement with other participating banks will be a condition of
disbursement to such banks.
B. Recommendation
7.04     On the basis of the above agreements and the staff appraisal, the
project is considered suitable for a Bank loan of US$50 million for 15 years,
including 5 years of grace, at the Bank standard variable interest ratE.. The
loan will be made to the National Bank of Hungary and guaranteed by th'
Government.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Outline of Technology Development in Hungary
1.       Participants.  The three major direct participants in technology
development (TD) activity of Hungary are universities, research institutes and
enterprises, each with approximately 21%, 292 and 44% respectively of total R&D
staff. Besides these organizations, the Goverament plays an important role in
planning and implementing TD programs. The principal Government actors are the
Committee for Science Policy (TPB), the Hungarian Academy of Scitaces (MTA),
which supervises basic research programs, the Ministry of Industr.; (MOI),
which controls the greater part of Government-led programs for technology
development, and the State Office of Technical Development (OMFB). which is
the central agency for coordination of intersectoral programs.
2.       Least important of the three direct TD participants are universities.
This is because the research facilities of universities and other organizations
for higher education are primarily engaged in basic research financed by the
state budget. However, they do undertake developmental tasks on a commercial
basis as well by contracting with enterprises. Although the link between the
universities' research work and industry is not nokmally strong, some
researchers in the academic community are active in working for or with
industrial enterprises; the Budapest Technical University, for example, played
an essential role in formulation of an innovation park project, a potential
beneficiary of the proposed loan. In 1986, there were 917 research facilities
in Hungarian universities.
3.       Second in importance are reseArch institutes.  These organizations are
independent legal entities which werr. established by the state to undertake
research as their major activity. There were 68 such institutes in 1986, 53 of
which are highly dependent on the state budget (50% of their budgets, on
average and are supervised eithar by various ministries or by the MTA. The
remainder are engaged mostly in profit-making R&D activity covering various
subsectors of industry, mining, energy, agriculture, construction, transport
and telecommunication. An example of research institutes of the first category
is the Research Institute for Computer Science and Automation (SzTAKI), (which
is a beneficiary of the proposed loan). The Coordination Institute for
Computer Science (SzKI), another potential beneficiary, belongs to the second
category. Since 1982, more than 20 budgetary research institutes have beet.
converted to commercial operation, either as R&D units of enterprises or as
technical development companies discussed below.
4.       The most important participant of R&D activity is the enterprise.  R&D
at the enterprise level is performed by two types of organizations. First,
development activities on a profit-making basis are carried out by technical
development and engineering companies which are venture-type organizations; the
government has encouraged their establishment since 1982. Some of their
activities go beyond the scope of R&D in a strict sense and extend to market
application of R&D results. These exhibit a variety of organizational forms:



- 45 -
ANNF:X 2-1
Page 2 of 7
state-owned enterprises, subsidiaries or joint ventures of enterprise(s),
limited liability companies and cooperatives in 1986. There were 106
technical development companies in 1986. One potential beneficiary of the
proposed Bank loan, the Company for the Application of Computer Science
(SzMALK) is an example of the technical development compa.ies. Secondly, many
enterprises have their own R&D facilities operating either as an independent
unit or as an organizational unit within the company. 243 facilities have
been registered as such enterprise R&D units.
5.       Policy Organs.  Directing overall TD policy, and interacting with the
Cirect participants listed in paras 2 - 4 are a number of governmental
agencies. The Committee for Science Policy (TPB) is responsible for
coordinating policies at cabinet level and for proposing long-term and
medium-term R&D plars. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA), together with
the Ministry of Education, controls basic research programs. The MTA
influences applied research and experimental development as well through
founding and supervising a number of research institutes and enterprises.
Each of the branch ministries, such as the 4inistry of Industry (MOI), has
sectoral responsibility for planning and executing R&D programs as well as
promoting R&D activity at enterprise level in its respective sector. OMFB
advises the Government on overall R&D policy and is responsible for
coordinating intersectoral and interdisciplinary R&D programs.  In terms of
allocation of the resources from CTDF, the MOI has the largest share (412)
|           followed by the OMFB (30%) (Table A-1).

6. Distribution of Expenditures. Basic research represented approximately
102, applied research 281, and experimental development 62S of total R&D
expenditure during the 1981-85 period.  This pattern of allocation is more
development-oriented than both the previous five year period (Table
A-2) and the average of OECD countries (i.e. 151, 272 and 581 respectively in
1981). Considering the very limited scale of available resources, the
Hungarian emphasis on development is justified from the viewpoint of efficient
contribution of R&D to economic development.

7.       The range of R&D activity is quite extensive.  The industrial sector
accounts for 52Z of the R&D expenditure and 461 of the total R&D manpower.
Among various subsectors of industry, the engineering industry takes a majority
share of 541 in the total industrial R&D expenditure, within which the
electronic equipment subsector occupies the leading position. The chemical
industry follows with 251 focusing especially on the pharmaceutical subsector
(Table A-3). The R&D intensity, or the ratio of R&D expenditure to turnover,
varies considerably by branch of indusrvy from more than 9% in electronic
equipment and precision instruments to lower than 11 in most light industries.

8.       Sources of R&D Funds.  Approximately 22% of the R&D expenditure,
mostly for basic and applied research, is financed by the state budget. This
ratio has been gradually decreasing from 26.0% in 1975-80 to 22.7% in 1981-85
and 21.72 in 1986-90. Besides the state budget, a state-controlled Central
Technology Development Fund (CTDF) covers approximately 23% of expenditure.
The total of all state-controlled funds amount to 45% of all R&D expenditure
(Table A-4). The role of Government in overall financing and allocation of
R&D funds is not out of line with the experience of advanced industrialized
countries. While the FRG, Japan and Switzerland have lower ratios of
Government financing of R&D costs, Austria, France, Italy, the United Kingdom,
and the U.S. have higher ratios than Hungary (Table A-5).

ANNEX 2-1

9.       There has been a series of efforts to decentralize decisions
regarding R&D experditure to the individual enterprise level. Until 1983
enterprises were required to reserve a fixed portion, depending on the
subsector's R&D intensity, of their value-added for the enterprise's TD Fund.
40% of this reserved amount was centralized in the CTDF which are reallocated
by Government agencies. The remainder was retained as the enterprise's own
resources for expenditure solely on R&D. Starting in early 1984 an increasing
percentage of enterprises were exempted from the compulsory establishment of
the TD Fund. As of January 1, 1988, the compulsory reserve mechanism for
enterprises' own TD was abolished. Enterprises still contribute a specific
portion of their value-added, determined according to a schedule, to the CTDF,
ranging from the lowest 0.2% for food processing industry to the highest 2.3%
for electronic equipment manufacturing industry. Beyond that they are free to
determine their R&D expenditure level. Under the new system, an enterprise
retains the option to establish a TD reserve for tax purposes. As is shown in
Table A-4, enterprises' own resources including bank credit represent some 55%
of the total R&D expenditure.
10.      Financial Intermediaries for TD.  The financial sector in Hungary has
recently become invclved in TD through newly established financial
institutions engaged mainly in financing technological R&D and related market
applications. Since the beginning of the 1980s, 11 specialized financial
institutions (five of which are known as "innovation banks") have been
established by government agencies including the Ministry of Industry and
OMFB, banks and foreign trade companies with an aim to assist the TD in the
forms of medium-to long-term loans, equity participation and leasing. The
total value of assets of the seven largest such institutions amounts to 27
billion Ft as of September 1987. Three of them have already transformed into
"full" banks by the license to operate as commercial banks. Sources of funds
of the specialized financial institution were initially limited to original
equity, the Central TD Fund and resources raised by issuing bonds earmarked
for specific purposes. However, with the advent of limited liability
companies from the beginning of 1988 they may now raise as much as five to six
times of original equity by selling equity shares to an unlimited number of
enterprises. As the sources of funds diversify, the remaining specialized
financial institutions are being transformed from simple financial agents of
their founding entities to more self-sustained organizations making
independent decisions.
11.      Introduction of Foreign Technology:  Hungary has been said to have a
bias toward autarky in TD. Taking the ratio of royalty payments for foreign
technology (including one-time licensing fees) to the Gross Expenditure for
R&D (GERD) as an indicator of the importance of foreign technology, Hungary is
becoming steadily less autarkic in its search for technology. Between 1980
and 1985 the GERD grew at an average annual rate of 5.4% while the royalty
payment increased by 17.4% annually, so that the ratio of royalty payment to
GERD increased from 4.1% to 7.0%. This is comparable to the FRG (7.0%) and
the UK (7.1%). However, as is seen in Figure A-1, there is an observable
negative correlation between the dependency on foreign technology and the
absolute size of GERD for major OECD countries. Countries which spend a vast
amount in absolute terms for their domestic R&D activity, such as the FRG,



- 49 -
ANNEX 2-1
Page 6 of 7
France, Japan and the U.S. show relatively low dependence on foreign
technology. while smaller countries such as Austria, the Netherlands and
Portugal pay a relatively large percentage of GERD for royalties (regardless
of the level of technology or industrial development). This observation
indicates that small countries with limited resources for R&D must rely
heavily on technology purchased from abroad in order to keep abreast with
state-of-the-art technology over a broad range of fields. An estimated curve
depicting the relationship of the ratio of royalty payment to GERD for 10 OECD
countries suggest that Hungary would have been in the normal range for
advanced industrialized countries if it had paid 25% to 30% of its GERD in
royalties or almost four times as much as the actual level.
12.      Four factors contribute to Hungary's autarkic bias it: technology
development: (i) lack of exposure of the industry to international competition
and the resulting self-sufficient inward-looking mentality of researchers and
engineers; (ii) caution against overdependence on the western technology in
the context of the political division of Europe and possible restriction on
exports of selected technologies; (iii) apparent lack of motivation among CMEA
countries for active technology transfer even among themselves; and (iv)
procedural complications for government approval of a licensing agreement with
a foreign partner.  None of these four factors will disappear overnight; (ii)
and (iii), in particular, involve matters which are not entirely within
Hungary's control.  However, all four are declining, which provides an
opportunity for the Government's program to reduce the autarkic bias of
Hungarian R&D.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
PCB Facility Sub-project
A. Introduction
1.       The Printed Circuit Board (PCB) sub-project would purchase laboratory
and production equipment in order to allow the design (1400 designs/yr),
documentation, testing, and production (8000 m2/yr) of multi-layer PCBs for
the R&D sector of the economy. This service is presently unavailable in
Hungary at the level of proposed technology, and will lead to accelerated
development of the R&D and electronics industry.
2.       The company would be organized under Law #34 of 1986, as a joint
venture. It would have four major shareholders: Ministry of Industry (MOI),
State Office for Technical Development (OMFB), Hungarian Academy of Sciences
(MTA) and National Council of Industrial Co-operatives (OKISZ)-with equal
shares of Ft 100 million in equity capital each. Two Hungarian enterprises
SZTAKI, and SERVINTERN (a manufacturer of PCBs) will also participate as share
holders, with Ft 5 million and Ft 15 million respectively. In addition FUBA,
a West German manufacturer of large-series PCBs, is interested to participate
in the project with approximately Ft 50 million in equity.
3.       The legal procedures for the establishment of the company are well
under way. The executive director of the future PCB enterprise board and the
controlling committee has been appointed. PROKON (a local consulting firm)
has been given the responsibility for project implementation and SERVINTERN
will manage the design shop.
B. Markets and Marketing
4.       The demand for multi-layer PCBs manufactured in small quantities, has
existed in Hungary for many years. Presently, the supply of PCBs required for
R&D purposes, is not sufficient to meet the demand. There are a number of
producers of large-series PCBs in Hung.iry, such as SERVINTERN and VILATI who
can try to meet the demand, but at non-,ealistic long throughput times and
with PCBs of lower quality. This in turn leads to customers looking in the
West for such services, which at the derign end cost 5-6 times more than they
would under the new company. Furthermore, for the production of such designs,
they have to wait for a gap in the production in most cases, since there are
not many small series producers.

5.       For the purpose of the feasibility study of the proposed project,
market research was made through personal calls and correspondence with R&D
facilities in Hungary. Results indicate that the facilities of MTAL, OMFB and
Universities will have the following annual demand for PCBs:
(i) Central Physics Research Institute, MTA 2500 ma
(ii)  Computer Technology and Automation, MTA 400
(iii) Other MTA Institutes, 200
(iv)  Research and  nnovation Center for Computer Technology (SZKI),
OMFB 600
(v) Budapest University 300
(vi)  Other Universities 100
6.       Approximately 502 of the expected output will be consumed by the
above demand. Demand for the remainder of the capacity will come from OKISZ,
MOI and the manufacturing sector as follows:
(i)  R&D facilities of OKISZ                       500 m2
(ii)  OKISZ                                        1400
(iii)  R&D facilities of MOI                         500
(iv)  Manufacturing companies                      1500
7.       Should there be any unutilized capacity, the company can accept
orders for large-series PCBs, for which there is a significant demand in
Hungary. There is also the possibility of exporting films and output
data-carriers, but it is not currently included in the company's plans, and
projections.
8.       Prices will be set at competitive levels which provide an adequate
profit margin, and are in line with international prices. Significant
variations do occur, in the prices of PCBs, depending on the degree of
sophistication and delivery-time requirement for the products.
9.       The shareholders of the company and their affiliates will pay the
same price for the output as other clients.
C. The Project
10.      The project's main objective is the design, documentation, production
and testing of PCBs for research and development. The company will produce
8000 square meters (m2) of PCBs (based on double sided) and 1400 different
designs and documentations.
11.      The site will be in Budapest and will employ 120 employees, 100 of
which will be involved in direct production (15 design and 85 production).
The project involves civil works, purchase of design and production equipment
and software, as well aa training and know-how. The equipment purchases range
from personal computers, photo-plotters, and film developing equipment for the
design lab to boring machines, circular-saws, chemical and surface treating
galvanizing equipment, and vacuum presses for thy production facilities. It
is expected that the project will be implemented caring the 1988-90 period.

16.      These figures show that future financial performance of the company
should be satisfactory. The base case financial rate of return is 24.52. The
economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 30.62.
17.      The project is aimed at the domestic market, but there is a
possibility of exporting designed films t Western Europe (FUBA has already
approached the company). The immediate indirect saving is in import
substitution. It must be noted that most of the materials used in the
production are imports (direct or indirect), 702 of chemicals used are also
imported.

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Innovation Park Sub-project
A. Introduction
1.       The Innovation Park sub-project would create a facility to cater to
the needs of universities, small companies, and R&D departments of major
manufacturing enterprises. The project will: (i) promote and help implement
R&D by providing the infrastructure necessary for basic research, and by
offering special services such as licensing and legal support, among others;
(ii) speed up technology transfer and innovation in industry by creating a
link between academia and industry; and (iii) be a focal point for ideas and
applications.
2.       The park would make it possible for the small enterprises and
entrepreneurs to participate in R&D activity at a reasonable cost. The
management of the company intends to support such R&D activity and/or its
implementation. The ultimate benefit will be the promotion of innovation in
Hungary leading to modernization and upgrading of the manufacturing industry.
3.       The park will operate as a profit oriented joint-venture.  The
company has been registered as an "Economic Association" under the management
of the Budapest Technical University (BTU), once the 1988 changes in the
regulatory system occur, the legal status of the park will be reviewed, and
transformation to a legal enterprise could be done on the basis of the
required economic, financial and legal conditions. The following are the
shareholders who will have equal votes despite their equity-share.
(i)  BTU (as well as OMFB indirectly)        Ft 94 million
(ii)  Ministry of Industry (MOI)                 29
(iii)  Council of Borough 11                      60
(iv)  Industrial Development Bank                 5
4.       The Managing Director will be a non-voting member of the board and
will have three deputies in the areas of marketing, technical, and economics.
B. Markets and Marketing
5.       The park will have several competitors, including: universities,
innovation parks, e.g., Borsod innovation park; research institutions of the
Academy of Science (MTA), and enterprises such as Flexis.

the planned activities of the Park. The companies include; TUNGSRAM, FORCON,
VIDEOTON, Raba, Hungarian Steel Works-MAG, ELZETT, MEDICOR, Telecommunication
coop, Atomic, etc. Of the 21 companies approached, 6 will be willing
immediately to start joint projects, 8 plan to do so in the next 2 years, 3
were undecided, and 4 gave negative answers.
7.       The company has also started TV commercials aimed at the industry
managers, and the Borough Council (Budapest 11) is promising additional space
to enterprises in the Borough (creation of an industrial park) as an incentive
to use the services of the park.
8.       The company's aggressive marketing strategy, advertising the various
services of Lhe park, has led to very high demand for the space as well as
demand for the services.
9.       The Park management, considering the very high demand, is in a
position to choose the future tenants carefully. The area of interest to the
Park management is R&D work leading to instrument development/micro
electronics and software development/technology applications.
10.      The management of the Park has visited innovation park facilities in
the UK and West Germany in order to gather information on services provided by
such organizations, their price and their business strategies.
11.      Services of the Park will be priced based on market supply demand
conditions. The Park intends to strengthen its market image and share by
aggressive customer relations activities.
C. The Project
12.      The project's main objective is the creation of an R&D
infrastructure, to facilitate innovation and implementation of such
activities' results. The services of the project will be: (i) leasing of
space; (ii) special services (equipment usage, time sharing of computers,
etc.); (iii) office services (typing, copying, translations, legal, etc.);
(iv) marketing; (v) training, and (vi) contracting in the field of innovation
in collabor4tion with BTU and tenants.
13.      The location of the project is in the 11th district of Budapest.  The
total area of the premise is 4000 square meters (m2) of which 3600 m will
be leased. Initially the Park would have a staff of 5 people, including the
managerial and administrative staff; within 3 years this number will grow to
40-50. The project will finance the purchase of heavy laboratory instruments/
equipment, personal computers and software, etc. as well as study tours. The
project will be implemented during the 1988-89 period.
D. Project Cost and Financing
14.      As summarized below, the total financing required for the project is
estimated to be Ft 211.4 million (US$4.2 million equivalent), of which Ft 84.0
million (US$1.7 million) would be in foreign currency and the balance of
Ft 127.5 million (US$2.6 million) would be in local costs.

A. Introduction
l.       The Instrument Rental sub-project consists of the acquisition of
modern instruments in order to expand the rental inventory (both in quantity
and variety) and operations of Instruments and Measuring Technique Service of
the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA-MMSZ) to meet the very high underfilled
demand in Hungary. The project will: (i) improve quick demand fulfillment
from 40Z to 652; and (ii) provide advanced measurement devices, not currently
available in Hungary, to small and medium size enterprises.
2.       MTA-MMSZ is a profit oriented legal entity founded in 1957 under the
Academy of Sciences supervision. As an autonomous organization it has
generated substantial profite since 1972. The main organizational units of
the company are; Instrument rental, Instrumentation, Service, and Technical
(consulting) divisions. The company maintains a national data base on all
instruments in Hungary which cost more that US$5,000.
3.       The company maintains regular liaison with several hundreds of
instrument manufacturers, and provides authorized repair service for 57
foreign companies (including SONY, PHILLIPS, HP, and UNIVERSAL) in Hungary.
4.       Total assets of the company at the end of 1Q86 were Ft 1,045 million
(US$20 million equivalent) with no outstanding loans. Total revenues for 1986
amounted to Ft 284 million (US$5.7 million) with a net profi_ of 25%. Average
growth in gross revenue during the 1982-86 period was approximately 14% per
year. The instrument rental division accounts for more than 50% of the
operations.
5.       The staff of the company are highly qualified technically and the
company is under efficient, effective and innovative management. Total number
of staff is 302, of which 30 are directly involved in renting (overhead not
included, i.e., not including the repair shop etc.).
B. Markets and Marketing
6.       MMA-MMSZ is the only supplier of instrument rental services in
Hungary. It rents, repairs, and provides advisory service on selection of
instruments. Requests that cannot be fulfilled from existing inventory are
put on a waitin3 list and are accommodated on a first come first served
basis. Presently, waiting time for some instruments is in excess of 6
months. The level of quick demand fulfillment (within a week) is at 40X
presently, but with the proposed investment it will increase to at least 651
and new types of modern instruments will be available.

Annex 4-3
Page 2 of 4
7.       Currently the following problems occur in fulfilling the demand:
(i) demand unfulfilled for a long time (this is with all equipment types and
quite regular), (ii) instruments of lower technical level are supplied (this
is due to lack of convertible currency and leads to customers' specification
not being fully met), (iii) customers hoard the instruments.
B.       The demand for the instrument rental services is distributed in the
following sectors of economy: (i) Industry, 73.3X; (ii) Health-care, 4.6X;
(iii) Housing, 3.7%; (iv) Transport & Telecom., 1.51; (v) Agriculture, 6.8%;
(vi) Research, 6.9%; (vii) Universities, 2.21; and (viii) Other, 4.0%.
9.       The company has regular contacts with clients, and the customer
relations department receives approximately 500 calls, 50 letters and 30
personal inquiries per month. In addition, it has extensively studied the
demand through contacts with the existing clients, as well as, the
distribution of more than 1000 copies of a questionnaire (54% to industrial
enterprises, 162 to food processing companies, 101 to R&D institutes, 8% to
construction industry, and 121 to others). Results of the above are the basis
for the proposed sub-project.
10.      Prices are based on 0.5-1.5% of the gross book value of the equipment
per week, depending on the age and type of the instruments.  This is
considerably lower then the prevailing rates in the US and UK of 2.0-2.5%.
For the sub-project component a rate of 1.2% has been used.
C. The Project
11.      The project's objective is the modernization and expansion of the
instrument inventory of MTA-MMSZ. This enables the institute to satisfy the
demands of small and medium enterprises in Hungary. The instruments purchased
under the project would be general purpose, versatile, robust, portable
instruments that can normally be serviced in-house. They include; electric
measuring devices, signal generators, signal recorders, thermometers and
analytic/environmental protection equipment.  In total 417 new instruments
will be purchased, ranging in price from US$3,000 for a Fluxmeter to US$40,000
for a Network analyzer. It is estimated that an additional 10 full-time staff
are required to handle the increased activity. The project will be
implemented during the 1988-90 period.
D.  Project Cost and Financing
12.      As summarized below, the total financing required for the project is
estimated to be Ft 371.5 million (US$7.4 million, equivalent), of which
Ft 206.0 million (US$4.1 million) would be in foreign currency and the balance
of Ft 165.5 (US$3.3 million) would be in local costs.

through the Hungarian Commercial and Credit Bank under the general terms
agreed upon for all onlending for the Technology Development Project.
Additional financing requirements will be met from company resources including
funds generated by the project (at the end of 1986 period the company had Ft
111 million in cash, as well as, Ft 310 million in Development Money shown in
its current assets).

17.      These figures show that future financial performance of the company
should be satisfactory. The base case financial rate of return is 202. The
economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 24.8X.
18.      The project in itself will not generate any convertible currency
revenues, however, based on the company's estimates, if such instruments were
to be purchased by client organizations, the collective instrument inventory
would at least be ten times higher than it would be under the arrangement.
This is almost equal to US$40 million savings to the economy. In addition the
function of the project--upgrading the Hungarian manufacturing sector--will
lead to some exports of high quality products indirectly.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
CAD/CAM Sub-project
A. Introduction
1.       The CAD/CAM sub-project consists of the acquisition of hardware and
software in order to focus and expand the CAD/CAM activities of the Computer
Applications and Services Company (SZAMALK). The project will enable the
company to meet the demand of small and medium size enterprises for its
services.
2.       SZAMALK was established in 1982 by merging three organizations:  the
International Computer Education Center (SZAMOK); the Research Institute for
Applied Computer Sciences (SZAMKI); and the National Computing Company
(NOTO-OSZV). SZAMALK is under the administration of Hungarian Academy of
Science, but operates as an independent profit oriented organization.
3.       The company is the largest system house and computer services company
in Hungary providing services in: Hardware and software sales, systems and
software development consulting, data processing, information and technical
services, and training. It operates mainly domestically but is also active in
the international markets, where it is known primarily for its scientific
research and training activities.
4.       Some oi the domestic clients of the company are:
(i) Videoton Electronic--largest computer manufacturer in Hungary-
(development of MIS and PCS)
(ii) Hungarian Railways (full computer network)
(iii)  Ikarus Motor Co.-one of the world's leading bus manufacturers--
(design of data processing systems)
(iv) National Gas and Oil Corp. (systems software *ipgrade)
(v) BAGE-one of Hungary's largest agricultural enterprises--(supply
of a fully integrated information system.)
5.       Foreign clients include:
(i) BMW, Munich (SZAMALK's integrated system for software development)
(ii) Siemens, Munich (long-term software development assignments)
(iii) Scanvest, Oslo (joint venture, computerize operations of a hotel
chain).

ANNEX 4-4
Page 2 of 4
6.       Total assets of the company at the end of 1986 were Ft 1,703 million
(US$34 million). Total liabilities as of end 1986 were 182 of total assets,
and current ratio was in excess of 3.3.
7.       The 1200 staff of the company are highly qualified technically and
the company is under very efficient, effective and innovative management.
B. Markets and Marketing
8.       The application of CAD/CAM in Hungary is about to accelerate
significantly due to technological and economic pressures. Presently,
domestic competition is limited to 2 or 3 small companies offering services in
specific application areas. With the increase in demand, competitive services
are bound to appear specially since the government is encouraging the growth
of the CAD/CAM activity by regulatory steps (e.g. under the tax reform law,
employees of such companies will enjoy preferential treatment on their
personal income taxes, R&D and TA activities will will be taxed at lower
rates, etc.).
9.       Market research was done by contacting the existing clients as well
as prospective ones. Over 800 questionnaires were sent out and to date 320
have responded. When replies were useful (representing a lead) personal
contact was established to narrow down the perceived requirements of the
clients. The company has been participating in exhibitions and trade fairs
(in a recent Budapest Trade Fair the company's exhibit of "Information and
Service" was approached by thousands o^ interested people), doing commercials
on TV and other forms of media, and using their education services to create
demand for CAD/CAM services.
10.      Potential customers would be mainly small and medium scales
industries in: electronics, 30 to 40 enterprises, cooperatives and research
institutions with a combined production value of Ft 10 billion (US$200
million) annually; machine industry, 50 to 60 companies with a total output
value of Ft 20 billion (US$400 million); building industry, 10 to 15
companies; industrial, structural, and mining engineering; and water
management. Larger companies will mainly use their own in-house CAD/CAM
services/facilities.
11.      SZAMALK's prices for the services would be based on market supply
demand conditions, prices set by competition and the company's overall
marketing strategy.

C. The Project
12.      The project will be a pilot for further development of the technology
in Hungary.  With that in mind the objective is to expand and enhance the
CAD/CAM operations of SZAMALK.  This enables the company to meet and increase
demand in Hungary for computerized design and control using CAD/CAM. The
project will offer the following services in the CAD/CAM fields: (i) leasing
computer time; (ii) leasing hardware/software; (iii) consulting and general
contracting; and (iv) resolving complex design tasks.
13.      Proposed purchases under the project range from micro-computer work
stations and CAD/CAM software, and special CAD/CAM input/output (I/O) devices,
to TA and study tours. The implementation period will be 1988-90. Services
will originally be offered from the central Budapest location. From the
second year on, with the establishment of SZAMALK's branch offices, service
centers will be set-up in major towns. The project will employ 80 people at
full capacity. SZAMALK projects a steady-state volume of operations of, 28800
hours of time sharing, 30 hardware and software leasing operations, 4300
man-hours/month of consulting and 2740 man-hours/month of design tasks.
D. Project Cost and Financing
14.      As summarized below, the total financing required for the project is
estimated to be Ft 518.5 million (US$10.4 million equivalent), of which
Ft million (US$5.4 million) would be in foreign currency and the balance of
Ft 247.3 million (US$5.0 million) would be in local costs.

18.      These figures show that future financial performance of the company
should be satisfactory. The base case financial rate of return is 24.3%. The
economic rate of return for the project is estimated at 30.4%.
19.      There would not be any direct convertible currency revenues from the
project, since it is directed at the domestic market. The benefit to the
economy would be through savings in the clients' operating costs (material,
energy, and time savings, etc.), and better output quality. As a result, the
benefits will arise from a reduction in imported inputs, as well as revenues
from the sale of superior products in the convertible currency markets.
SZAMALK estimates the annual benefits at US$20-30 million.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Industrial Automation I Sub-proiect
A. Introduction
1.       The Industrial Automation I sub-project consists of the acquisition of
advanced technology to upgrade VILATI's industrial automation hardware and
software systems product-line based on current international standards. This
would allow the company to produce 11000mz/yr of PCBS, 200 high complexity
CNC controls, 800 simple CNCs, 70 cell controls, 230 robot controls, 40
controls of special machines, 800 units of booking and ticketing machines, 50
test benches for automobile and tractor industry, and 100 OEM modules in
additions to its current production capacity. No such services, at the
proposed level of technology are currently available in Hungary, and import
modules/parts are hard to install/adapt. VILATI intends to increase its market
share of 171 domestically by 1% annually during the life of the project.
2.       The VILATI automation company is a state-owned company founded in 1960
by the Ministry of Industry (MOI). Its main line of products is industrial
automation and process control equipment. The company is divided into the
following profit centers: (i) Eger factory, production of control systems
equipment and components (including PCBs); (ii) Development office, R&D
activity; (iii) Design office, design of automation systems, mainly for
continuous technologies; (iv) Installation unit, assembly after production up
to turn-key delivery; and (v) Traffic technical unit, design, production and
service of traffic control equipment.
3.       Total assets of the company at the end of 1986 were Ft 1,446 million
(US$28.9 million), with a current ratio in excess of 2.3, and practically no
long-term liabilities. Total revenues for the year amounted to Ft 1,454 million
(US$29.0 million), with a net profit of 5.5%. The company employs 1718 people
of whom 400 have university degrees.
B. Markets and Marketing
4.       Demand exists in the following sectors of Industry: (i) Chemical and
petrochemical; (ii) Agriculture and food-processing; (iii) Metallurgy;
(iv) Building materials; (v) Power; (vi) Telemechanics of water supply; (vii)
Machine tool; and (viii) Textile; as well as other manufacturing industries.
5.       Presently, domestic demand is being supplied from the domestic
production as well as imports. There is, however, no domestic supply of
technologically advanced products (such as the output of the proposed project)
in Hungary, and there are certain COCOM restrictions on the import of such
automation devices.
6.       Market research has been conducted by VILATI mainly through contacts
with larger customers. A list of expected demand for the main products has
been collated and is available.



- 70 -
ANNEX 4-5
Page 2 of 3
7.       Prices would be set based on the world market prices, with due
consideration given to domestic supply and demand.
8.       The increase in the software/hardware ratio in production of process
control equipment would make VILATI more competitive in international markets,
since software costs in Hungary are lower.
C. The Project
9.       The objective of the project is the upgrading and modernization of
the company's design and production facilities. This would lead to an
expanded and technologically more advanced product-line. The project scope is
development, production and turn-key delivery of complete manufacturing and
control systems equipment provided with network adaptors.
10.      The project will be located in Budapest (design and development) and
Eger (production). The required know-how for the implementation and operation
thereafter of the project are available in the company. In addition, for the
R&D technical knowledge the company has a long standing relationship in using
the services of the Central Physical Research Institute of the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences, SZTAKI, and the Budapest Technical University on a
contractual basis.
11.      The project will finance the purchase of equipment ranging from
personal computers, oscilloscopes and measuring instruments for th.e design and
development facility in Budapest to machine tools, PCB production equipment
and technology, machines for mechanical works and test instruments for the
factory in Eger. The implementation is expected to be completed by the end of
1990. The project would require hiring of an additional 115 people by 1990
(55 in Eger and 60 in Budapest).
D. Project Cost and Financing
12.      As summarized below, the total financing required for the project is
estimated to be Ft 1,120.6 million (US$22.5 million equivalent), of which
Ft 69.5 million (US$7.4 million) would be in foreign currency and the balance
of Ft 751.1 million (US$15.0 million) would be in local costs.

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Industrial Automation II Sub-project
A. Introduction
1.       The industrial Automation II  sub-project consists of the acquisition
of modern production equipment in order to modernize and expand the company's
manufacturing of modular hardware and software system components, for
industrial process control, based on international standards. The project
would (i) upgrade the the company's product line, (ii) provide the industry
with process control equipment not currently available in Hungary, and
(iii) save energy and material at industry level.
2.       MMG Automatic Muvek (MMG Automation Works) was founded in 1900,
primarily to manufacture mechanical instruments. The company's line of
products has evolved/increased since then and it presently manufactures and
implements products in the instrument-automatics industry. The present scope
of the company's activities is:
(i)  manufacture of electric and pneumatic components and instruments;
(ii)  manufacture of pressure, differential pressure and temperature
teletransmitters with electric output signal;
(iii)  manufacture of microprocessor-based processing and display units
for industrial purposes;
(iv)  manufacture of modular data processors for industrial purposes;
(v)  manufacture of industrial data acquisition and processing systems;
(vi)  design and "turn-key" delivery of integrated industrial process
control systems;l/ and
(vii) applied resear-h and development of industrial process control
systems;l-
3.       Total assets of the company at the end of 1986 were Ft 3,372 million
(US$67.4 million).  The current ratio was 4.2 (mainly due to high inventories,
801 of current assets), and long-term debt to equity of 0.2. Total revenues
for 1986 amounted to Ft 3,940 million (US$78.8 million), with a net profit of
10X. The company employs 5100 staff.
1/ In connection with these two activities, it is essential for the company
to procure the modern technology level proposed under the project, to be
able to meet current international standards, in order to be competitive.

B. Markets and Marketing
4.       The standard elements and modules of VME bus type systems are
produced in the industrialized countries. In Hungary, however, only a few
small cooperatives are involved in the production of such equipment, but not
for the process control market. So the only real competition will be from
imports.
5.       There is an increasing demand for modern process automation and
control equipment in Hungary. In addition, the output of the project could be
directed to the developing countries as well as CMEA countries.  MMG's
approach to the assesment of demand for its proposed products has been based
on client specifications and, in some cases, orders for the future. Based on
the above, the company expects the demand primarily in Power industry and
secondarily in Oil and Gas industry, as follows:
(I) Primary demand:
(i) nuclear power plants;
(ii)   control system of thermal power plants;
(iii)   operations control centers of electric power distribution; and
(iv)   operations control centers for the dispatcher centers.
(II) Secondary demand:
(i) central system of gas main dispatcher of Hungary.
6. The project will basically focus on the domestic market. Exports to
developing countries and the CMEA countries will be pursued from the 4th year
in the life of the project.
7. The prices of the outputs will be competitive with the international
market price of the similar imported products and systems.
C. The Project
8. The project's primary objective is the introduction of new technology for
the manufacturing of modular hardware and software system components for use
in industrial process control, meeting international standards based on VME
bus. The project focuses on continuous process technologies producing:
(i) secondary supply units; (ii) I/O analog and digital modules; (iii) local
area network interface modules; and (iv) real-time basic software.
9. The project will finance the purchase of equipment ranging from PCB
testing and mounting machines to calibration instruments, and is expected to
be fully implemented by the end of 1990. The project will involve 350 staff.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Expert System Development Sub-project
A. Introduction
1.       The Expert System Development sub-project would upgrade the Computer
Research and Innovation Center's (SZKI) hardware and software, as well as
provide technical assistance an( training, in order to develop a facility in
which advanced end-user oriented micro computer based expert systems can be
developed. The products and services would be mainly for export to
convertible currcncy markets.
2.       SZKI w~  )unded in 1968, and is a profit-oriented organization under
the supervision _  -FB. The main activities of the institute are as follows:
(i)  rtsearch and development of artificial intelligence tools and
systems;
(ii)  development, production and turn-key application of a large
capacity PPC instrument range; and
(iii)  development and application of software development technology
tools.
3.       The company is highly export-oriented, and has sound business
relations with leading computer technology and electronics manufacturers and
software houses of Western Europe. On a yearly basis, 100 to 120 business
deals are made with more than 50 partners in the West. The company has plans
to establish foreign subsidiaries in the active markets.
4.       The company is one of the leaders of the Hungarian computer
industry. Since its founding, it has built Hungary's first desk-top computer
(an MS-DOS IBM compatible machine, first marketed four years ago), and has
exported one of the world's leading artificial intelligence (AI) software
systems, MPROLOG, in both micro and mainframe computer versions. It has
special development relationships with some western vendors (notably,
SIEMENS-FRG) and is currently marketing image processing and optical character
recognition software, which are state of the art.
5.       Total assets of the company at the end of 1986 were Ft 1,145 million
(US$23 million). Long-term debt:equity ratio for that year was 1:14, and
current ratio was in excess of 3. Sales in 1986 were Ft 579 million (US$12
million), of which more than 30% was derived from exports (80% to convertible
currency and 20% to CMEA countries). The convertible currency software
exports of the institute represent one third of that of Hungary.

ANNEX 4-7
Page 2 of 4
6.       The most important resource of the institute is its highly qualified
staff, that can be flexibly mobilized and assigned to projects. More than
two-thirds of the 700 employees of the company have college degrees, and about
400 have passed language proficiency examinations.
B. Markets and Marketing
7.       The penetration of expert systems has been impeded not only by time
and cost (SZKI has a definite advantage on the cost side, since the man/yr
cost of an expert programmer in Hungary is less than half of that in Western
Europe) considerations, but also by confusion over what hardware platforms and
software languages are best suited for expert system development and
delivery. The low end of the expert system market appears to be more vigorL'1S
today than the high end as PC-based systems allow users to experiment without
making a substantial investment, and to tackle smaller, more manageable
problems that may have a higher probability of becoming field applications.
8.       Marketing the expert systems is essentially a research effort.
Expert systems are composed of two parts: (i) the program and (ii) the
knowledge base.
9.       SZKI does not intend to develop the program and sell it to users who
would add the knowledge base, because the bare program will not be attractive
to any market. Users will not see utility and developers will look at such a
product as just another development language. The company's strategy is to
use consultants to help locate target markets to sell PC-based software plus
the customizing services required to build the knowledge base.
10.      The expected size of the software sector in selected European
countries ond the US artificial intelligence market is given below.

C. The Project
11.      The project consists of the development and marketing of micro
computer based AI software. The main market for the product would be Western
developed countries. The product would be adaptable to various computer
environments (ie. IBM/PC compatibles, the larger super microcomputers, the
Apple McIntosh family, etc.).
12.      The company has the technology base, staff resources, and a good
international reputation in software products for the development of expert
systems. The project would require the full time participation of 80 experts.
Implementation is expected to be complted by end 1989. The project will
finance computer hardware and software, as well as study tours, consultants
.nd international marketing support.
D. Project Cost and Financing

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Software Development Sub-project
A. Introduction
1.       The Software Development sub-project consists of the acquisition of
hardware and software in order to renew the institute's system development
infrastructure, hardware and software tools and workstations. This would
enable the institute to use its human resources more efficiently in
development of custom-designed software. The project would lead to a 50%
productivity increase, improvement in the quality of software, faster
implementation in the home market and guaranteed compatibility of products
with Western standards. Most of the products will be exported.
2.       The Computer and Automation Institute (SZTAKI) was founded 26 years
ago under the supervision of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA). The
institute's main line of activity is design and development of customized
hardware and software systems.
3.       The institute has carried out a series of projects, mostly for the
home market, in the following fields:
(i) On-site process control application systems,
(ii) Intelligent control of energy-consuming technological processes,
(iii) Artificial Intelligence (AI) based application and process control
systems for the engineering industry, and
(iv) Distributed cooperative local network graphic systems and
corporate information systems.
4.       The company has business relations with Western companies in the
following fields:
(i) Process control systems; Siemens and Krupp-Polysius--West Germany,
Voes Alpine--Austria.
(ii) Knowledge based engineering design systems; COMPUMAX and Cincinati
Millacron--USA.
(iii) Natural language systems; Siemens--Austria.
(iv) 3D graphic volumetric modelling; Kwerku--Austria, N+S Int.--the
Netherlands.
v)  Other; SES--Denmark, SERTEL and Inform Elect--France.
5.       The institute has always performed innovative activities and its
specialists regularly undertake jobs abroad. The institute is the principal
stockholder of MTA SZTAKI-COSY, FLEXYS Inc., and Information Infrastructure
Development (IID), which is being financed in part with funds from the Bank's
Second Industrial Restructuring Project.

6.       Total assets of the company at the end of 1986 were Ft 663 million
(US$13 million). Long-term debt:equity ratio for the same year was 1:2, and
current ratio was in excess of 12. The company had a cash balance of Ft 262
million (US$5 million) at the end of the same year. Sales for 1986 amounted
to Ft 393 million (US$8 million). The company employs 600 full time staff.

8.       Within the computer application and software market, custom-designed
problem solving is a special activity. The creation of a custom-designed
system needs the combination of computer engineering and expert knowledge in
the field of application.
9.       The custom-designed computer systems are especially in high demand in
the fields of: process control; decision support and office systems; CAD/CAM;
and CIM and Al based application systems.
10.      During the past 5 to 10 years SZTAKI has considerably concentrated
its strategies on the development of special, function-oriented, complex and
customized turn-key systems. As a result, the institute has accumulated a
significant amount of application specific knowledge, which they believe
formulates the prime human resource in the move to enter expert system
software market on an international basis.
11.      The sale of special task-oriented software, and its implementation on
a turn-key basis is primarily export oriented. But SZTAKI, based on its
relations and references, would also take into account demands from domestic
clients.
12.      It is a precondition of opening up new markets in the West that
SZTAKI should be present there, with activities from marketing to education to
follow-up services. The company is using its business partners in the West
for such purpose, but it is also actively pursuing the establishment of a few
small joint ventures with Western partners.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Metrological Center Sub-project
A. Introduction
1.       The sub-project will upgrade the measureme.t certification equipment
of the National Office of Measures (OMH) in order to allow for:
(i) certification of secondary measurement instruments of Hungarian
manufacturers based on internationally acceptable standards, leading to
improvement in expocts; (ii) decentralization of certification; and (iii)
improvement of the shop-level environment. It would finance calibration
instruments and reference materials in the following areas:
(i) Luminous Intensity,
(ii) International Practical Temperature Scale in the range of optical
pyrometry,
(iii)  Laser Interferometer length measuring system,
(iv) Material composition certified reference materials and radio
active certified reference materials, and
(v) Noise Level measurement.
2.       OMH, under the supervision of OMFB, is responsible for certification
in Hungary. Certification is the part of metrology that assures the
uniformity and accuracy of measurements on a national and internatioral
level.  This is done by periodical int ection of measuring devices and methods
to ascertain their conformity witb relevant technical and legal
standards/requirements. OMH maintains very close relationships with the
National Bureaus of Standards of the 'Western developed countries, such as US
NBS, through research participation, and employee exchange programs. It is an
highly informed, well managed institute with a total staff of 550 (300 in head
quarters in Budapest and 250 in the regional offices) and an annual budget of
Ft 150 million (US$3 million).
3.       The next Five-Year Plan of OMH (1986-90) aiias at the development of
its institutional infrastructure. OMH will spent Ft 121.6 million (US$2.4
million) for the program from its own resources and from the national budget,
of which Ft 43.9 million (US$0.9 million) is in convertible currency. This
will be sufficient for the dynamic maintenance (metrological assurance of
branches already served). It, however, will not cover the intensive
development aimed at enlarging and modernizing the metrological background
which will serve as basis for industrial restructuring.
B. The Project
4.       The project will upgrade and modernize the measurement stancdards
instrumentation of OMH through the acquisition of modern equipment. This will
ensure the calibration of secondary measurement standards (at enterprise
level) according to the specifications and criteria set forth as part of
international standards.

5.       The project will be implemented during the 1988-91 period.
C. Project Costs and Financing
6.       As summarized below, the total financing required for the project is
estimated to be Ft 110.1 million (US$2.2 million equivalent), of which Ft 64.1
millior, (US$1.3 million) would be in foreign currency and the balance of
Ft 46.0 million (US$0.9 million) would be in local costs. There is no
incremental working capital or interest cost included in this sub-project.

8.   In restructuring the industry to increase productivity, improve
competitiveness, and modernize products, an intensive technical development of
certification in Hungary is an urgent need. The project will aim at achieving
this goal through upgrading of technical equipment and techniques of
measurement of the OMH. Export potential is being presently lost because of
the lack of modern legal metrology equipment in the country.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Quality Control Institutes Sub--project
A. Introduction
1.       The Quality Control Institutes (QCI) sub-project includes the
upgrading of the Institutes' equipments/instruments and technical assistance
in order to: (i) improve by modernization the certification capabilities of
the participating quality control institutes; (ii) improve product quality of
the clients; and (iii) maintain/increase e:xports of products.
2.       There are nine QCIs participating in the sub-project.  They were
selected from among twenty applicants because of the direct impact of their
proposed investments on exports. The clients of the QCIs are all major
exporters, whose exports are suffering because the QCIs increased inability to
certify products according to the Western Markets' certification requirements.
B. Quality Control In Hungary
3.       There are three levels of quality control in Hungary.  First, the
manufacturer is obliged to provide a declaration of adequacy. Second, an
independent, officially authorized, quality control institute, based on
standards, checks the quality of a product or manufacturer's certification
(staVdard certification system). Finally, after the standard certification,
the application of a trade mark is permitted.
4.       Different branches of the economy and national authorities operate
several standard certification systems. (Ministry of Health, Post Office,
Ministry of Trade, etc). In addition there are approximately 25 independent
quality control institutes in Hungary.
5.       Most of the instruments of the quality control institutes have become
obsolete in the last 10 years, and hardly any modern instruments have been
purchased from the Western industrial countries. The lack of modern
instruments has not only curtailed the technological competitiveness, but has
also adversely affected the credibility of the Hungarian certification,
creating the grave need for npgrading/modernization of QCIs' instrumentation.
C. The.Participating QCIs
3.       The participating QCIs are all independent institutes with qualified
staff and management. They are the following:
(i) Bureau for Quality Control of Petroleum Products (AMEI),
(ii) Research-Development Company for Leather and Shoe Industry,
Quality Control Department for the Leather Industry (BIMEO),
(iii) Quality Control Institute for Wood, Paper and Printing Industry
(FAIMI),

D. The Proiect
7.     The project will upgrade the instrumentation of the participating QCIs,
improving their certification capabilities. This will have a direct effect on
the exports of QCIs' clients as well as creation/restoration of confidence of
the Western clients of Hungarian Exports.
8.     The foreign exchange cost of the project will be the cost of equipment
purchases including training when appropriate. The combined convertible
currency savings/revenues, for the clients of the participating QCIs, will be
a minimum of US$30 million annually.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Hungarian Software Industry
Prospects, Advantages and Disadvantages
1.       Computer software is an industry in which Hungary appears to have a
comparative advantage in selected fields and has already had some success.

2.     Along with the pharmaceutical industry, the computer software industry
is Hungary's most successful and fastest growing sector of technology related
exports to convertible currency areas. Convertible currency earnings have
grown at the rate of 44Z p.a. (admittedly from a small base) and show every
sign of continuing to grow rapidly. This figure does not include convertible
currency earnings from Hungarian computer programs and other experts who are
employed by Hungarian firms but work abroad on fixed term contracts arranged
with their employers. This is a significant business (for most if not all
Hungarian computer services companies).
3.     The Hungarian software industry has several long-term disadvantages:
(i) restrictions on exports to Hungary of the latest hardware and software
tools and (ii) the restricted size of the pool of computer professionals which
limits the size of the projects which can be undertaken.



- 91 -
ANNEX 4-11
Page 2 of 4
4.       However, the Hungarian software industry also has characteristics
which give it important marketable advantages in certain niche markets. All
of them derive from a combination of (i) low cost of highly qualified computer
professionals, (ii) close geographical and cultural connection with major
markets (compared to other potential low wage competitors in, for example,
Asia), and (iii) unusual skills torced on the Hungarians by the very export
resteictions which are simultaneously a handicap.
5.       More specifically, Hungarian programmmers who work in developing
software for world markets are very capable because they must work very close
to the hardware. This is not merely due to the restricted availability of
advanced software development tools. The mechanism is more complex. For
example, SzKI and SzTAKI (two beneficiaries of preappraised software
development subloans under the TD project) both use "substitute technologies'
as development bases. For example, they are not allowed powerful
workstations, such as the Sun and Apollo. They are, however, allowed to
import Apple MacIntosh computers, which use the same basic technology--the
Motorola 6800 processor chip. To develop products for Sun-class workstations,
they use the Mac. Since the Mac software is useless to them, they program the
Mac's processor in machine language. The resulting programs run on Sun
computers, also working directly at the chip level. Final testing is
conducted in a country where the target class of computers is available and to
which exports of the software are planned. Programming in machine code is a
difficult, arduous, and skill-honing activity.
6.       A second competitive characteristic is the use of computer scientists
as programmers, which was once a characteristic of Western computing   This
practice passed into history 25 years ago in the US. Although, in th'Le US, it
is now difficult for a college graduate to become a programmer without a
computer science or closely related degree, but the vast majority of
practising programmers have not had this training.  Both the volume of demand
for computer application systems and this lack of highly talented and trained
programmers have led Western programming practice to move toward increased
development au; Lmation, teamwork methodologies and "cut-and-dried" approaches
to solutions. The Hungarian approach is to use very small teams--basic
technology and scientific or engineering approach to problem solving.
Furthern.ore, these skills are focussed upon application problems, while in the
West, the finest talents are invested in the support of the operating systems
associated with vendors' hardware architectures (such as IBM's MVS). An
example of the results of the Hungarian approach is SzKI's RECOGNITA text
digitizing system, whi^h, by the use of a very clever algoritlhm, digitizes
almost any printed font without storing pattern recognition codes for each
font, as most Western systems do. SzKl's system represents the state of the
art in this area.

7.       A third major competitive advantage in Hungary, compared to western
countries in the immediate vicinity of major software markets, is labor
pricing, which is well known. However, direct comparison of average salaries
leads to understatement of the salary advantage because overhead in western
countries such as the US is also much higher. For example, in proposals
prepared for NASA computer work, contractors are required to show the cost of
staff turnover, which can be considerable; Hungary has almost no turnover.
The cost of professional software development in Hungary could be as little as
1/15 of the cost in the US. The technical approach taken by both SzKI and
SzTAKI (developing expert-system shells and then adding knowledge bases for
each customer) further increases their leverage.
8.       Even the small size of their country gives advantages to the
Hungarians. SzKI and SzTAKI have experience in many industrial areas, from
airport management to medicine. For small (500-700 staff) organizations,
their experience is very broad by US standards. Most of the work they have
done arose from first-, second- and third-hand personal contacts. Both
companies are also very diversified in terms of automation skills. For
example, SZTAKI builds local area networks and SzKI builds PCs, PC boards and
many other hardware products. Most Western computer service houses do not
have any hardware skills, even those which are over 10 times the size of the
Hungarian firms.
9.       All of this does not mean that Hungary is about to take over the
world's computer service industry. They are limited by a lack of experience
and (probably) methodology in large-scale development efforts. The Western
computer pro&fssion has developed methods to accommodate and even benefit from
the lack of extremely talented programmers. Methods such as structured design
(Euwopean in origin) and information engineering are in fairly common use
today and are truly essential when it is necessary to coordinate the efforts
of a large systems development team. SzTAKI and SzKI both use small teams
headed by senior technicians (not managers), and their proposals show that
they intend to use this approach in Western markets. For this reason, their
marketing efforts are best directed toward middle-sized businesses and
departments of larger ones, which also suit their equipment selection and
their pricing.
10.      Another limitation is that they lack in-depth mainframe experience.
COCOM restricts access to these machines, but the prices are probably a more
significant problem. Even if COCOM did not exist, how many very large-scale
machines could Hungarian science and industry support? The cost of
experimentation, for example, on IBM 3090, Model 600 machines is rather high.
This limitation is practically coincidental with the Hungarian project size
limitation discussed above. Large projects are generally associated with
large mainframes. The Hungarians do have considerable experience with the
architectures and operating systems of IBM and Siemens mainframes, however.
They are capable of working in the IBM MVS environment but not with the same
facility with which they address the smaller-scale workstation architectures
and operating systems.

11.      Ultimately, Hungarian systems work is limited by the size of
Hungary. Having only 10 million people, Hungary will run out of trained
talented systems professionals, of training capacity and raw talent if it
concentrates on selling people on the international market. SzTAKI and SzKI
both seem unwilling to operate as pure "body shops". which seems prudent; they
need to obtain more leverage.
12.      It seems, then, that the best products for the Hungarian automation
industry are those which rely on small but very talented development teams.
The systems may be developed for large-scale mainframes if they do not try to
work around the systems software, and only for IBM, Siemens and DEC systems
(not Unisys, NCR, CDC, Etc.). Micro computer products will have a broader
range; they can do anything with micro and supermicro computers.
COCOM Restrictions
13.      In general most products intended for sale in the west can be
produced without violating CoCom restrictions. Both SzKI and SzTAKI are adept
at working within COCOM limitation to develop hardware and software products.
They use the following methods:
D develop on compatible but less powerful products; such as using
IBM PC/XT in place of upper-end PS2s and using IBM 4361s (the most
powerful IBM mainframe clearing COCOM at this time) to develop MVS
application;
- develop on base architecture, such as the example of the Motorola
32-bit chip described above; this approach works only when the
base architecture is available in an unrestricted product, and it
will not help with mainframes;
- develop or perform final testing in a nearby unrestricted country,
such as Austria (no travel restrictions and Vienna is only 2 hours
by car) or West Germany; SzTAKI is planning a subsidiary in
Austria for such purposes;
- revelop the restricted products in Hungary; both companies have
produced hardware that is in advance of the current COCOM
restrictions, such as local area networks and 32-bit
microprocessors.

Technical Assistance Component
Outline of Terms of Reference for a Study of Development Venture
Capical Functions in the Banking System
Background
One of the actions of COH to be implemented during the execution
of the TD Project will be a study of the reasons for relative weakness of
venture capital functions in the Hungarian Banking system despite the recent
introduction of the two-tier banking system and the emergence of innovation
banks. As international experience shows, venture capital plays an important
role in financing high risk/high benefit development projects especially in
the area of new technologies. The study would analyze the existing situation
and propose measures to strengthen the venture capital function in the
Hungarian banking system. The study will be executed by Hungarian experts
assisted by foreign consultants.
Terms of Reference for the Study
t.       Analyse the reasons of the weakness of venture capital functions in
the Hungarian banking system.
2.       Study the experience and practice of similar or relevant countries
and, after careful selection, made study visits to a limited number of sucu
countries whose practice and experience are appropriate for Hungary.
3.       Synthesize and correlate information and experience acquired during
the visit and prepare a study addressing the relevant issues and assess
possible options for actions raquired to develop such venture capital
functions geared particularly toward the needs of technology development.
4.       Special attention should be given to identify the appropriate
organizational structure of venture capital operations within existing
financial institutions.
5.       The study will be conducted by Hungarian experts but will be assisted
by foreign consultants especially in the final version of findings and
preparation of proposals. The study will be completed by December 31, 1989.

HUNGARY
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Technical Assistance Component
Outline of Terms of Reference for a Study on Resource Allocation and
Decision Making for Central Allocated TD Funds
Background
One of the actions of GOH to be implemented during the execution of
the TD Project will be a mid-term review of R&D programs undertaken during
the Seventh Five-Year Plan (FYP) with a view to determining the degree of
their economic effectiveness and considering ways to increase it. In order to
better apply past experience in the design of a new long-term R&D strategy
especially with regard to upgrading R&D infrastructure, OMFB will study the
practice and experience of similarly situated or relevant countries
concerning policies of resource allocation and decision making processes for
centrally allocated TD funds. Based on the conclusions of the study, measures
will be designed and implemented thereafter. The study will be executed by
Hungarian experts but some expert assistance may be required in the final
revision of the findings and preparation of proposals.
Terms of Reference for the Study
1.       Based on the findings of the mid-term review of the R&D erogram in
the Seventh FYP analyze the past experiences, present situation a:.d its
relevance to the preparation of a long-term R&D strategy and especially with
regard to upgrading R&D infrastructure: analyze present practices for
resource allocation of centrally allocated TD funds.
2.       Study the available literature for an overview of experiences and
practices in similar or relevant countries and make a selection of the
countries and organizations whose practice and experience are appropriate to
Hungary. Contact the selected countries/organizations, collect information
and prepare study visits of Hungarian experts.
3.          Synthesize and correlate collected information and experience
acquired during the visit and prepare a study addressing two main issues:
(i)  what are the methods -  lied and decision making process followed
in the selection of    - nment-sponsored TD/R&D projects which, as
a matter of principle      uld concentrate on areas where
(i) Hungary has a str. actual or potential comparative
advantage; (ii) the re: -irces necessary are larger and/or the
risks are greater than i,dividual enterprise(s) can shoulder;
(iii) there are strong social or national reasons for undertaking
an activity, e.g., because of externalities;

ANNEX 4-12
Page 3 of 3
(ii) how to distribute resources to attain an optimal balance between
concentrating resources on too few project areas thus increasing
the risk of failure and spreading resources too widely and thinly
which renders success unlikely or affects effectiveness.
4.       Design and propose measures and course of actions conducive to
improved method and practices in managing resource allocation of and decision
making for central TD funds.
5.       The draft study should be circulated and discussed with appropriate
experts including the WB and the acceptable feedbacks should be incorporated
in the final version of the study.
6.       In the finalization of the study some foreign expertise may be
involved. TOR for such eventual assistance would then be prepared. The study
will be completed by December 31, 1989.

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Sub-project Proposals which were
Rejected for Pre-appraisal by the Bank
In selecting sub-projects for pre-appraisal, a large number of
proposals were surveyed and discussed. Of these 15 were sufficiently well
advanced to be seriously considered, given the project preparation schedule.
From these 15, ten were chosen as conceptually, financially and technically
sound.  Five were rejected on various grounds, which are summarized below.
Reasons for Exclusion from
Subproject                         Pre-Appraisal Sub-project
1.  Development and production of       Did not clearly meet any of the main
office automation equipment.        eligibility criteria, i.e.,
(i) strengthening R&D infrastructure,
(ii) introducing new technology into
industry in a manner which has a wide
impact on level of industrial
technology, (iii) exhibiting a strong
potential for exports.
2.  Computerization of transport        Did not clearly meet any of the
system in Budapest.                 eligibility criteria (listed above).
3.  Upgrade secondary and tertiary      Although the sub-project would
school facilities for computer-    ultimately contribute to R&D
related education.                  infrastructure, the connection is too
long term and remote. The focus of the
project is on more immediate
translation of R&D activity into real
economic benefits (including exports).
4.  Improve monitoring of guage         Insufficient impact on general
and purity at major steel           technological level of industry
rolling mill.                       especially since continued investment
on steel plants in Hungary is unider
serious review.
5.  Enzymes for carbohydrate            Insufficient preparation for timely
chemical industries.                completion of review.

Project Unit will support the other entities by providing liaison with the
Bank, co-ordination, implementation, repcrting, training, etc. and to provide
advice and support to participating banks and beneficiary enterprises. As
such its role is to support and co-ordinate.

(i) assessing sub-projeet proposals for conformity with project
objectives and priorities and their eligibility for inclusion in
the project;
(ii) assistance for the banks: (a) in generating viable project
proposals; and (b) in analyzing and appraising such proposals by
advising them abcut available expertise for this purpose and by
offering appropriate expertise if it can be made available through
OMFB;
(iii) acting as focal point and the Bank's counterpart in:
(a) monitoring overall implementation (b) providing for relevant
information required by the Bank; (c) assisting implementing
entities in following the Bank's adopted practices and guidelines
