INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO SPAIN
FOR A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Spain for the equivalent of US$50 million to help finance a second
education project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5
years of grace, with interest at 7 1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The proposed loan, the Bank's ninth operation in Spain and the
second for education, would bring total bank lending to $377 million. The
amount outstanding and held by the Bank as of April 30, 1972 was $302.3 mil-
lion. Lending in the past has been in transportation (railways: $205 mil-
lion; highways: $33 million, and ports: $40 million), agriculture (live-
stock: $25 million; and research: $12.7 million), and education: $12 mil-
lion. Progress with Bank-financed projects has been generally satisfactory,
although there have been delays in withdrawals under some loans. Annex I
contains statements of Bank loans and IFC investments as at April 30, 1972,
and comments on the status of individual loans.
3.        Spain is among the relatively advanced countries seeking Bank funds,
both in terms of income per head and degree of industrialization. The rationale
for Bank lending has therefore rested largely on the need for external help in
introducing reforms. The Bank has been able to help initiate significant
changes in several strategic sectors of the economy - transport, agriculture
and education. In view of the growing importance of industry, an industrial
sector mission visited Spain in November, 1971. The mission is now preparing
its report on the basis of which the possibilities for Bank lending to the
industrial sector will be considered.
4.        The objectives of the Bank's lending to Spain will continue to o
the promotion of more economic crops and improved management, price and crc
it policies in agriculture; support for the further reforms in education; and
consolidation of the reform already underway in transport. To these sectors
industry should soon be added in those cases where Bank lending would signi-
ficantly help in rationalizing the structure of the sub-sectors selected and
in improving financing mechanisms.



-2-
5.        The proposed Second Education Project would be the only operationi
for FY 1972. Projects for ports, drainage irrigation, livestock and indus-
try are in various stages of preparation.
6.        IFC has made investments in three Spanish enterprises amounting in
total to $13.5 million (see Annex I, page 2).   The loans to Fabrica Espanola
Magnetos, S.A. (FEMSA), an automotive electrical equipment manufacturer, are
now fully repaid and IFC sold its FEMSA shareholding in March 1972. The loan
of $7.2 million and equity investment of $2.3 million in Industrias del Papel
y de la'Celulosa, S.A. (INPACSA), a pulp and paper manufacturer, are not yet
effective. A number of other industrial projects are at an early stage.
PART II - THE ECONOMY
7.        An economic mission visited'Spain in November/December 1970 and its
report (EMA-34a), dated May 20, 1971, has been distributed to the Executive
Directors. A Bank mission An November 1971 reviewed industrial sector poli-
cies and developments. Country data are presented in'Annex II.
8.        The gradual liberalization and outward orientation of Spanish eco-
nomic policies during the last decade brought about unprecedented economic
growth, involving a rapid rise in average living standards and Spain's trans-
formation into a predominantly industrial country. During 1960-70, GNP ex-
panded in real terms on average by 7.5 percent per year, with GNP per capita,
expressed in 1970 dollars, increasing from some $500 to^a'lmost $1000.   In-
dustry, the leading sector, grew on average by 10 percent per year during
this period, one of the highest rates achieved among developing countries,
and the second highest, after Japan, among OECD countries. The share of
industry in GDP increased from 31 percent to 40 percent.
9.        Real GNP grew by 6.8 percent in '1970, and by an estimated 5.2 per-
cent in 1971, despite a considerable slackening in the expansion of manufac-
turing which entered a recessionary phase in late 1970, characterized by a
marked slowdown of investment and stock building. The agricultural sector
led growth in 1971 with a rate probably in excess of 6.5 percent, substan-
tially above long-run trends, owing mainly to favorable weather conditions.
Output in service sectors expanded by an estimated 5.7 percent reflecting a
record inflow of tourists, while the growth of industrial production slowed
down to about 4 percent or half of that in the previous year.
10.       Spain's balance of payments improved considerably in 1971.    Com-
modity imports rose by only 5 percent, reflecting the slowdown in economic
activity, and particularly in industry. Commodity exports led by manufac-
tured goods, increased by 23 percent; weakened domestic demand for indus-
trial goods forced manufacturers to expand exports; additional incentives
were provided by the revaluation of several European currencies. The
strengthening of the trade balance was accompanied by further substantial
increases in tourist earnings and workers' remittances thus leading to a



-3-
current account surplus of about $760 million in 1971. Due to the conti-
nuing strong inflow of foreign capital, including some speculative movements,
Spain's net foreign reserves rose by about $1.5 billion to a total of $3.2
billion at the end of 1971, equivalent to about 7 months of imports.
11.       In 1971 there was a further acceleration of price and wage in-
creases. Consumer prices went up by 9.7 percent during the year, compared
to 6.8 percent during 1970. Notwithstanding the good harvest, increases in
food prices (12.5 percent during 1971) were particularly sharp owing to price
policies supporting agricultural incomes. Wage increases, estimated at more
than 14 percent for 1971, were higher than in 1970 and well above official
guidelines and productivity gains.
Short-Term Economic Objectives
12.       Government policies give first priority to stimulating the economy
and consequently containment of price and wage increases remains difficult.
The rediscount rate of the Bank of Spain was lowered twice during the year
and has been at 5 percent since October 1971. In the public sector, variou3
measures have been taken to stimulate demand. Budgetary spending was accel-
erated and subsidies for the construction of apartments were increased. To
encourage private investment, a tax rebate of up to 7 percent of investment
cost was offered in December 1971 for all industrial investment leading to
orders prior to July 1, 1972. As a result of the more expansionary fiscal
policy, the Government budget (including extra budgetary Treasury operations)
has shown a deficit.of about Ptas. 26 billion ($370 million) in 1971, com-
pared with a small surplus in 1970.
13.       The 1972 budget continues to be expansionary.   Total expenditure
is forecast to increase by 13 percent over the initial 1971 appropriations.
Capital expenditure would increase by 28 percent while current expenditures
are expected to rise by 12 percent. Appropriations for education (14 per-
cent of total budgeted expenditure) are well ahead of all other groups.
Revenue is expected to accelerate but not beyond the increases in expendi-
ture, and the budget deficit is expected to be of the same order of magnitude
as that for 1971.
Medium-Term Economic Targets
14.       The Third Development Plan (1972-75) aims at an average annual
growth rate of 7 percent. Projected growth is somewhat lower than that
achieved in the 1960's (7.5 percent) but exceeds substantially the growth
targets of previous plans. The Plan also aims to keep unemployment at its
present low level of 2 percent of the labor force and to limit price increases
to less than 4 percent. Contrary to previous plans it does not foresee
constraints from the balance of payments. Imports of goods and services are
projected to rise on average by 11 percent per year in volume (15.5 percent
in value), while the projected annual growth of expdrts of goods and serv-
ices is 10 percent in volume (14 percent in value). The Plan implies a con-
tinuation of the rising trend of workers' remittances. These forecasts as-
sume that world trade and economic development in other European countries



-4-
will continue the trends of the past decade and that Spanish costs and prices
can be kept in line with those abroad, thus preserving Spain's international
competitiveness.
15.       Plan policies are designed to support important structural reforis.
Emphasis is given to strengthening the industrial sector in the expectation
of further economic integration with the EEC, following a Preferential Trade
Agreement concluded in 1970. Other major reform areas of the Third Plan are
education and urban development. For the first time, Spanish planning also
includes environmental and research objectives.
16.       The Plan's public investment program envisages total expenditure
of $13.5 billion, of which $11.6 billion is for investment by the Government
itself. Of the latter, 74 percent is allocated to five sectors: transport
(25 percent), agriculture(,15 percent), education (13 percent), urban de-
velopment (11 percent), and housing (10 percent).
17.       The budgetary situation can be expected to impose a constraint on
the attainment of these targets unless tax policy and tax administration are
considerably reformed and. improved. The public sector savings ratio has been
declining in recent years, and it may be difficult for the Government to raise
sufficient tax revenue to meet the anticipated rise in public expenditure.
18.       The share of foreign financing of the public investment programs
envisaged for the Third Plan period is relatively modest, i.e. 4.8 percent.
Of the total amount of $647 million, $259 million is for the transport sec-
tor, (of which $174 million for RENFE), $1.24 million for agriculture and
irrigation, $93 million for education, and $15 million for research and de-
velopment. INI (Instituto Nacional de Industria), whose activities extend
to a large number of companies in virtually all major industries, expects
to raise about $155 million in foreign capital, probably through issues in
the international capital markets.
External Assistance
19.       The net inflow of medium- and long-term capital increased from an
average of about $540 million per year during 1967-69 to $676 million in 1970
and probably slightly over $700 million in 1971. Private loans to enterprises
and real estate purchases rose sharply while direct investment continued at
high levels.

Memorandum item
Gross borrowing in capital markets
(including undisbursed commitments)            20     25     76     498
There has been a marked change in the Government's attitude toward borrow-
ing in international capital markets, resulting in a sharp increase in loans
from financial institutions.   Gross government and government guaranteed bor-
rowing in international capital markets amounted to $25 million in 1969 and
$76 million in 1970, but commitments jumped up to possibly $500 million in
1971. The largest single loan ($200 million) was contracted by the Govern-
ment with a consortium of American banks. Also in 1971, INI borrowed $70
million through a consortium of American, European, and Japanese banks.
Three privately-owned toll-road companies raised $96 million in the American
and European capital markets, and the national telephone company raised $32
million. Maturities of the 1971 loans were between 5 and 7 years, while
toll-road bond issues ($56 million) were for 15-year terms.
20.       During FY 1963-71, Bank loans to Spain amounted to $328 million on
a commitment basis, while net disbursements reached $154 million, correspond-
ing to about 4 percent of total net inflows of medium- and long-term foreig.
capital during that period.
21.       Other important aid donors were the German Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau, the French Government and Eximbank. Kreditanstalt has been
active mainly in irrigation and hydraulic works, lending to the Guadalhorce-
Bembezar project (DM 200 million, 1962) and the Tajo-Segura project (DM 200
million, 1970). It also provided suppliers credits for the UNINSA steelworks

-6-
(DM 450 million, 1968) and for phosphate rock m'ining (DM 54 million, 1969-70).
The French Govermnent helped to finance the HIFRENSA atomic power plant
(FF 455 million, 1967). U.S. Export-Import Bank financing amounted to over
$380 million during 1961-70, mainly used for the purchase of equipment for
iron and steel ($154 million), aviation ($120 million) and power ($101'm'il-
lion).
22.       Total external public debt outstanding at the end of 1970 was
$1,534'million, of which about $320 million was undisbursed. 1/ Debt serv-
ice payments were estimated to be $264 million in 1971 equal to about 4.5
percent of total foreign exchange receipts. Including private debt service
the ratio amounted to about 10 percent. Spain's debt servicing record is
very good. The future debt burden is expected to remain modest and Spain
remains creditworthy for borrowing in substantial amounts.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
23.       In August 1970, the Spanish Cortes (Parliament) passed a sweeping
educational reform law, unique both in its scope and in its potential impact
on development. The law provides for a far reaching modernization of the en-
tire education system over the next 10 years and initiated one of the most
important public programs now under way in Spain. The reform has received'
widespread support in Spain, and has also aroused great interest in other de-
veloping countries, notably in South America.
24.       The first phase, now under way and benefitting from a Bank loan
(699-SP) made in June, 1970,' focusses on primary and general secondary edu-
cation, while the second stage, which the proposed' project would assist,
centers on vocational and technical education in secondary and higher educa-
tion. A future third phase would include vocational training in agriculture
and multi-purpose educational' centers and could possibly lead to a third
Bank project.
25.       Under the reform, all children between 6 and 14 years old will fol-
low a common course for eight years of primary education, which includes prac-
tical subjects in the last three years. Following this, students will pro-
ceed either to short, intensive vocational training, or to secondary educa-
tion. The present specialized types of secondary education are to be merged
into a common curriculum of three years, featuring optional courses in tech-
nology, home economics, commerce, and' agriculture. Career information and
guidance will be provided. Final examinations will be supplemented by con-
tinuous evaluation of students. For- the first time, curricula will be planned
comprehensively to coordinate successive levels of education and to eliminate
overlapping. Implementation of these reforms started in the academic year
1/   Valued at exchange'rates in effect since December 1971 the total out-
standing increases to $1,606 million.



- 7 -
1970/71 for grades 1-4 of primary education, and reached grade 5 in 1971/72;
it will be extended to grade 6 of primary education and the first year of
secondary education in 1972/73.
26.       Formal vocational training, which enrolled approximately 183,000
students in 1970/71, has been generally inadequate, and has not supplied
the practical training responsive to labor market needs. Responsibility
is divided among the Ministries of Education, Labor, Commerce and Agricul-
ture, as well as the Labor Syndicates and the Church. Moreover, no adminis-
trative mechanism exists which would involve employers in the actual training
or in adapting curricula to trends in occupational demand. Partly to com-
pensate for the inefficiency of the formal system, complementary efforts
were made by public and private agencies in developing non-formal vocational
training. The success of this non-formal training was a major factor in
adapting the labor force to changing economic conditions in the 1960s. One
such scheme, the "Programa de Promocion de Obreros" was created by the Min-
istry of Labor with OECD support in 1964. Under it, approximately 130,000
adult workers annually receive short intensive skill upgrading courses in
industry, services and modern agriculture.
27.       The second phase of the education reform will reshape formal voca-
tional education in accordance with the requirements of a modern industrial
society. Vocational education will be shortened and divided into three dis-
tinct levels for greater responsiveness to changing labor market conditions.
To complement the basic knowledge acquired at each level, additional train-
ing of six months to two years will be offered to those not proceeding to
the next level. Transfer from any of the three vocational levels to other
academic levels will be allowed, and programs to facilitate re-entry to
formal education by persons in the labor force, and programs for on-going
adult education will be developed for implementation during the third phase
of the reform.
28.       Higher education is comprised of three separate systems under the
aegis of the Ministry of Education: (i) technician and university schools
of three years duration, (ii) engineering schools and (iii) universities of
five years duration. The crucial problems in higher education have been the
lack of overall planning and the low quality of technical education. The
partial autonomy of universities and the status of certain professions have
limited the control of the Ministry of Education over enrollments, which in-
creased during the sixties without benefit of systematic national policy (
guidance from manpower plans.
29.       The reform changes the structure of higher education by dividing
the five year program into cycles of three and two years. On completion of
the first cycle, students who are considered unlikely to benefit from higher
studies or who do not wish to continue towards a degree may pursue brief third
level vocational training leading to a diploma. Other students will continue
in the two year second cycle degree program of specialized studies. The new
system thus provides a much needed terminal course to prepare for employment
students who are unable to complete their university courses.



-8-
30.       Engineering education traditionally has been offered in higher
technical schools, each specializing in a single branch. Between 1966 and
1968, 16 of the 29 specialized schools were consolidated to form three poly-
technical universities to achieve economies of scale.
31.       The B'arcelona Polytechnic University suffers from many of the prob-
lems typical of'Spanish engineering education. The students are of uneven
quality and few coherent curricula are available to students, as teachers
plan and give 'their coursei'independently.
32.       Teacher training, until recently, was offered only to prospective
primary teachers in 160 three-year teacher training colleges and to prospec-
tive-school inspectors and teacher trainers in five university schools of
education.- No institution provided systematic secondary or vocational teacher
training and research onf education was virtually non-existent. The reform
would improve teaching standards at all levels through compulsory teacher
training, research on teaching methods and steps to make teaching a full-
time career. Institutes of Education have been established in fifteen uni-
versities for training and upgrading academic teachers for basic and second-
ary levels under the coordination of the National Center of Educational Re-
search. The new Institutes can meet the need for academic teachers, but a
crucial gap exists in vocational and technical teacher training.
33.       Public expenditures on education have grown rapidly since 1960,
as the State assumed increased responsibility for financing the educational
system, but Central Government expenditures on education in 1970 were still
only 11.2 percent of total Central Government expenditures.    Private ex-
penditure continues to account for about 30 percent' of total national ex-
penditure on education.   Public and private expenditures combined represented
only 3.5 percent of GDP.
34.       The Spanish Third Development Plan (1972-1975) outlines the Gov-
ernment's immediate financial proposals for implementing the reform. Educa-
tioni and culture will receive 11.5 percent of the total Plan allocation and
14 percent of the Central Government, which amounts to about the same pro-
portion as in the Second Plan.
35.       A Sector Working Paper on Education was published by the Bank in
September, 1971.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       A report. entitled "Appraisal of a Second Education,Project in
Spain" (PE-44a) dated May 15, 1972 is being distributed separately. A
Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III. A map showing the lo-
cation of project items is also attached..



-9-
37.       In early 1971, the government prepared plans to extend implementa-
tion of the education reform to comprehensive secondary schools, vocational
education and university planning, and requested Bank assistance. Following
a Bank reconnaissance mission in May 1971, a project preparation and apprais-
al mission visited Spain during September and October 1971. Negotiations
were held in Washington from April 1-12, 1972. The Borrower was represented
by Messrs. Diez-Hochleitner (Undersecretary), Villa (Director General of Pro-
gramming and Investments), Lopez (Director General of Vocational Training),
Utande (Project Director), and Garcia de Paredes (Architect), all from the
Ministry of Education. Mr. Alvarez represented the Barcelona Polytechnic
University, and Mr. de la Fuente the Ministry of Finance.
38.       While the previous Bank loan (699-SP) is helping to finance the
first stages of the reform in basic and secondary education, the proposed
project would (i) carry the reform a step further in secondary schools in
selected areas of high population growth, (ii) introduce the new concept of
vocational training, (iii) upgrade the training of engineers, a key factor
in Spain's future development, in an expanded and reorganized Barcelona
Polytechnic University, which would be relocated outside the city, (iv) fill
a crucial gap in technical teacher training, and (v) reorient the training
of agricultural technicians at one model agricultural institute. Technical
assistance would cover vocational curricula development, technical teacher
training and university planning, as well as preparation of master-plans
for multi-purpose educational centers, all key areas of the education
reform.
39.       The proposed project, details of which are in Annex III, would in-
clude:
(a) design, construction and equipment of:
- 39 comprehensive secondary schools
- 37 vocational training centers
- 1 agriculture technical institute
- 1 polytechnic university
- 4 institutes of education
(b) equipment of the Valencia Polytechnic University; and
(c) technical assistance related to items (a) and (b) above.
40.       The total estimated cost is US$152.5 million, with a foreign ex-
change component of US$50 million, which would be financed by the proposed
loan. Unit capital costs per place, US$836 for secondary schools, US$1,440
for vocational centers, US$2,725 for the agricultural institute, and US$1,550
for the institutes of education, are within the ranges of costs of other Bank
projects. The cost per place at the Barcelona Polytechnic University, US$3,730,
compares with costs of previous Bank projects in engineering education (Singapor
US$3,650 (1971) and Zambia US$3,720 (1969)). At full operating capacity the
project institutions would require Ptas. 3.3 billion in annual operating costs
per year, corresponding to about 2.0 percent of the projected recurrent budget



- 10 -
of the Ministry of Education by- 1980.   The Barcelona Poiytechnic is expectdd
to reach an annual operating budget of just over Ptas. 1 billion, or 1.9
percent of the projected higher education budget.    As these project itemis
have priority in the reform program it is expected that the-government will
meet.its share of the project capital costs and the resulting recurrent ex-
penditures.
41.       The proposed 39 secondary schools would be located in major urban
areas (see Map) 'and designed, equipped and staffed to serve as experimental
schools for continued implementation of the first-phase of the education
reform and to meet requirements-for new schools in ar&as of high population
growth.
42.       Thirty-seven vocational training centers would be constructed and
equipped to launch vocational training reforms at first and second levels.
All majoT occupational fields would be covered, except agriculture.     The
centers would function as pilot schools to test and demonstrate innovations
for all formal vocational training in the public and private sectors.     Train-
ing courses would be moderidzed, replacing traditional fields with those prev-
iously neglected and now essential, such as construction, catering and tourism,
food-processing and electronics.   The locations of the proposed centers (see
Map) conform with- government priorities for regional development.
43.       The Palencia Agricultural Institute-would include the design,
construction, furnishing and equipping of an agricultural technician in-
stitute for 360 students. It will help to meet by 1980 the foretasted
anhual shortage of agricultural technicians.    The institute would have a
well-equipped teaching farm of about 30 irrigated ha. The Government has
agreed that it will establish an Advisory Board, consisting of represen-
tatives from agricultural research, extension agencies, cooperatives 'and
agro-industries to review the Institute's training program periodically
from the viewpoint of employers of agricultural technicians.
44.       The Barcelona Polytechnic lUniversfty.would be relocated about
30 km from the center of Barcelona.   The Project would assist the snew uni-
versity in realizing its objectives to (a)-meet the proje6ted increase in
demand for qualified engineers in the Catalonia region, (b) initiate the
diploma level course for those unable to complete the degree program, dnd
(c) rationalize the present system of separate schools by consolidating three
specialized engineering institutes with-a combined futl'-time dnrollment
of 5,290 at present.   The major contribution of this ,project item, would be
to upgrade the quality of engineering education and to produce eifgineers
adapted to the requirements of Spanish industry.

for a-computer' center has been included for the new Polytechnic University
of Valencia.   This would allow students to follow a more practical cur-
riculum of laboratory teaching, introduce civil and industrial engineering
programs, and double enrollment from 2,000 Co 4,000 in 1980. The Government
has provided assurances that enrollments will' be consistent with the na'tional



plans for university education, and with its capacity to meet new teaching
requirements.
46.       To plan university education, the Government will establish a perma-
nent technical secretariat within the National Board of Universities. This
secretariat will be comprised of full-time specialists in planning, economics
of education and operations research, and will prepare national plans for
higher education, including engineering, in accordance with educational and
economic priorities. Its first plan will be prepared within two years.
47.       The effectiveness of the reform in technical and vocational educa-
tion will depend on an adequate supply of properly trained teachers. To
assist in providing this training, the project includes three new Institutes
of Education (grades 16 and 18), at the Barcelona Polytechnic, Valencia Poly-
technic and at Sevilla University; the latter would also offer training for
academic teachers. In addition, a branch of the Institute of Education in
Valladolid would be established at the Palencia Agricultural Institute for
agricultural teacher training. When completed, the Institutes would have a
capacity for 850 students (university graduates or diploma holders) in five-
month courses and would graduate about 1,500 practical teachers and 200 gen-
eral teachers annually. They would also offer upgrading courses during the
evenings and summers annually. From 1975, when the project institutes would
be in full operation, they would satisfy about 35 percent of the annual needs
for agricultural teachers and vocational teachers.
48.       Project Administration.   The Project Unit established within the
Ministry of Education to administer the first education loan will be expanded
to assume overall responsibility for the second one. In order to speed up
implementation, the Unit will prepare shortly a series of comprehensive crit-
ical path diagrams, summarizing the major events for all parts of the project.
The Director of the Unit will continue to report directly to the Under-
Secretary of the Ministry of Education.
49.       Under the responsibility of the Project Unit, a Project sub-unit
is to be established in Barcelona which would be responsible for that part
of the project related to the Barcelona Polytechnic University (BPU). The
Project director of this sub-unit is to be assisted by an architect, a
procurement officer and an engineering educator. The expansion of the Project
Unit and establishment of the Barcelona sub-unit are conditions of effective-
ness.
50.       Technical Assistance and Architects' Services.   Technical assistal.-,
amounting to US$1.4 million, is currently being provided by the UNDP and Ford
Foundation to strengthen general teacher training and research at the National
Research Center for Educational Development. However, this assistance does
not cover vocational curricula development, technical teacher training or
university planning, three key areas of the educational reform. The proposed
Project would fill this gap by including the cost of specialists and fellow-
ships needed for the above areas. In addition, the cost of expert services
for developing master plans for future multi-purpose educational centers is



- 12 -
included.  Consultant architects would also be employed to assist in building
design, evaluation of civil works tendering, and supervision of construcition.
51.       Procurement.   Contracts for civil works, furniture, and equipment
would be awarded in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for international
competitive bidding. It is expected that relatively few foreign firms would
submit bids for civil works, which total US$73 million, since Spain has a
well developed and competitive construction industry. Equipment and furni-
ture, however, are expected to attract.considerable international bidding
and items will be grouped so far as possible to form sizable bid packages.
Local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a preferen-
tial margin of 15 percent of the c.i.f. cost of competing imports or the
existing rate of duty applicable to imports from non preferred countries,
whichever is lower.
52.       The normal range.of import duties on the furniture is from 22 per-
cent to 40 percent, and on the equipment from 0 percent to 41 percent.    On
furniture and equipment coming from EEC countries duties are one to six per-
centage points lower. However, the Ministry of Education has informed the
Bank that it would not be tbeir policy to take these preferences into account
in evaluating -these bids.
53.       Disbursement.   The proposed loan would correspond to the foreign
exchange component, estimated at about US$50 million equivalent, or approxi-
mately one third of the total project cost of US$152.5 million equivalent.
For equipment and furniture,, disbursements would be 100 percent of c.i.f.
cost if a foreign bid won the award or 100 percent of ex-factory cost in
case of a successful local bid. Civil works disbursements would be on the
basis of 20 percent of total expenditures.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.       The draft Loai Agreement between the Bank and Spain, the Report
of the Committee provided for -in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agree-
ment generally conforms to the normal pattern for loans for education projects.
55.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
56.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Co PROJECT EXECUTION AND DISBURSEMENTS
Disbursements on several loans have been proceeding at a somewhat
slower pace than originally.-scheduled, but have been accelerating during the
past-year.  The three loans for Highways, Railways I, and Ports have now been
fully disbursed. The Second Railways Loan (507-SP) is expected to be fully
disbursed by the closing date of July 31, 1972. The Third Railways Project
(772-SP) signed on June 30, 1971 became effective on December 29, 1971, and
although no withdrawals have yet been made, the Bank has already approved
$62 million worth of tenders. While disbursements under the Livestock De-
velopment Loan (633-SP) of July 17, 1969 were only $1.5 million out of $25 mil-
lion as of April 30, 1972, commitments by the project authorities totalled
$14 million as of December 31, 1971, the funds for one sub-project area having
been fully committed. Factors in the slow rate of disbursement have been
initial delays in organizing the project unit .and an unprecedented drought af-
fecting one of the two project areas in early 1971;   implementation of the
project is now proceeding satisfactorily. The loan to assist agricultural
research (768-SP) became effective November 1, 1971. The project is still in
the early stages of implementation, but recruiting of staff for the various
research centers is proceeding well.   Disbursements as of April 30, 1972 were
$400,000. Initially the First Education Loan experienced administrative and
legal difficulties in establishing a project unit in the Ministry of Education,
but these have been overcome and the first disbursements of about $0.5 million,
are expected in May 1972.

under the General Education Law. It would (i)
extend the Spanish education reforms in secondary
schools in selected areas of development priority
and high population growth, (ii) introduce the new
concept of vocational training, (iii) up-grade the
training of engineers, a key factor in Spain's
future development, (iv) fill a crucial gap in
teacher training institutes for vocational and
technical subjects, and (v) give a new orientatio;k
to training of agricultural technicians. The
project comprises:
1.   Design, construction, furnishing and equipping
of 39 comprehensive secondary schools (esti-
mated 31,600 student places), 37 vocational
training centers (estimated 18,600 student
places), 1 agricultural technician institute

Procurement:              International competitive bidding for civil works,
equipment and furniture. Spanish suppliers of
furniture and equipment would be given a margin
of preference of 15% or the customs duty applicable
to non-exempt importers from non preferred countries,
whichever is the lower.
The normal range of import duties on the furniture
is from 22 percent to 40 percent, and on the equip-
ment from 0 percent to 47 percent. On furniture
and equipment coming from EEC countries duties are
one to six percentage points lower. However, the
Ministry of Education has informed the Bank that it
would not be their policy to take these preferences
into account in evaluating these bids.
