MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRI)
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL
FINANCIERA, S.N.C. FOR AN ON-FARM AND MINOR IRRMGATION
NETWORKS IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.    1 submit for your approval the following memorandum and reconmmendation on a proposed
loan to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN) with the guarantee of the United Mexican States for the
equivalent of US$200.0 million to help finance a project for on-farm and minor irrigation networks
improvement. The proposed loan would be repayable over 15 years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The National Water Commission (Comision Nacional del
Agua, CNA) would be the executing agency.
2.    Background. Irrigated agriculture is very important in Mexico. It covers 5.2 million
hectares (ha), anJ accounts for 30% of all cultivated land, ovei 50% of the total value of agricultural
production, and 65% of agricultural exports. A total of 3.2 million ha is organized under 78
Irrigation Districts (IDs), and the remaining 1.8 million irrigated hectares is under more than 27,000
Irrigation Units (lUs). Cropping intensities (repetition of annual crops in the same area) in IDs are
only 1. i to 1.2 on average, and due to past agricultural incentives and policies, about 75 % of the
irrigated area is cultivated with relatively low-value grains and oilseeds. Production, especially in the
second cropping season, is limited by the scarcity of water. Only 35-40% of irrigation water actually
goes to the crops due to water conveyance losses and waste in distribution, and on-farm applications
average 65-70% due to inadequate minor distribution networks, incomplete on-farm irrigation and
mninor networks, poor water management, lack of incentives for individual farmers to save water, and
in some cases, low water prices. Water losses stem partly from the traditional reliance on unlined
ninor network and on-fann gravity systems; another contributing factor has been the low level of
expenditure for operation and maintenance, especially during the 1982-90 economic crisis. In
addition, subsidized energy rates have led to the intensive use of groundwater in IlUs, endangering the
long-term sustainability of aquifers by lowering water pressure and water levels. Salinity and water-
logging, in various degrees of severity, affect about 7% (450,000 ha) of the irrigated area.
3.    A rapid expansion of irrigation occurred during 1960-80, when over 2.6 milliob ha of
irrigated agricultural land were developed. Further expansion of the irrigated area is technically
challenging, expensive, and in some cases, of doubtful economic feasibility due to the difficulty of
tapping more groundwater on a sustainable basis and of developing new surface water resources. The
most economic strategy to increase production from irrigated land is through the completion and
improvement of existing systems, where gains in production can come from improved water
management and infrastructure, increased cropping intensity, and the conversion of low-value
cropping patterns to higher-value ones. The on-going Irrigation and Drainage Sector Project (IDSP,
Loan 3419-ME, approved in December 1991) supports investments to complete and rehabilitate or
modernize existing major off-farm systems within IDs. It also establishes targets for expenditure and
cost recovery for operations and maintenance, and supports the transfer of management responsibility
for 21 major IDs (two-thirds of the total ID area) from the CNA to water user organizations (WUOs).
This project is complementary to the IDSP, addressing the completion or improvement of the minor
off-farm and on-farm systems, neither of which is supported by the IDSP.
4.    The Government's continuing priority is to liberalize the agricultural sector and to promote
private investment in it-a process that should be strengthened under the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). This priority is having, and will contime to have, a significant impact on
irrgated agriculture. Policies and subsidies encouraging the growing of staple grains are being
eliminated, forcing producers to become more competitive and to diversify their crops. The new



-2 -
Agra,ian and Water Laws (November 1991 and December 1992) provide a legal framework that
supports private sector participation in irrigation investments. A Government policy letter was issued
in support of the project which spells out subsector policies, the priority of the project, and assurances
of adequate annual budget allocation. With NAFrA, there will be an expanded market for higher
value crops, such as vegetables, fruits and nuts, and the current trend to diversification and
intensification of irrigated production will accelerate. With the gradual reduction of subsidies for
electricity between 1989 and 1992 (at the rate of 3% per month, although this was reduced to 0.5% in
1993, and was stopped altogether on October 5, 1993), the electric fees for pmunping inicreased from
18 % to 55% of the long-run marginal cost, resulting in many energy-intensive pumping systems
becoming uneconomic. As a result, it is possible that the total irrigated area in Mexico, especially in
lUs (over two-thirds of which are fed by groundwater), will decrease gradually but become more
economically viable and environmentally sustainable.
5.    Management in 21 IDs is being dramatically changed through the transfer, with Bank (IDSP)
support, of management functions to WUOs. This helps to resolve the chronic problem of deferred
maintenance and creates a better environment for private investment. Establishing bulk volumetric
allocation and water delivery in those IDs is also an IDSP target. The new Water Law has created
the legal framework for incentives to save water and the transfer of water rights. Further steps in this
direction is being addressed by the Government, in the context of this project, through the
formulation of supplementary policy, regulatory, and administrative changes. To facilitate the
implementation of these changes, some modifications in the design and operation of minor irrigation
networks are also required, including the establishment of efficient, dependable, and flexible water
supplies, volumetric water rights, and volumetric allocation of water to farmers.
6.    Project Objectives. The proposed project fits within the Bank strategy of increasing the
efficiency of the agricultral sector in Mexico through promoting both economically and financially
viable private sector investments in agriculture, and the overall efficiency of the sector. The strategy
includes a limited "public good" role for Government. The project's main objective is to assist
irrigation farmers in transferred IDs complete the transfer process, consolidate existing irrigation
investments through direct user participation in decision-making and investment, move to diversified
agricultural production, and increase their efficiency in the use of land and water resources. Specific
project objectives are to: (a) reduce the loss and waste of irrigation water; (b) promote
decentralization and private investment in irrigation; (c) increase cropping intensities and yields; and
(d) increase crop diversification into higher value crops.
7.    Project Description. The three major components are:
(a)    Tecbnological Support, Communications, and Traning (US$39.6 milolon total
cost). This would assist farmers and their WUOs develop and implement
improvements in mnior network and on-farn irrigation systems. Investments would
be made in: training technical staff (from WUOs, CNA's Irrigation and Drainage
Engineering Field Offices, private banks, FIRA, technical assistance consultants, and
others); field surveys and studies to support the implementation of on-farm and minor
network improvements; adaptive research for water management; technical assistance
to WUOs; and equipment and material for training.
(b)    Minor Network Improvements (US$259.5 millon). This component comprises
mainly field sL-veys, engineering works, small irrigation and drainage networks,
water measurment and control structures, access roads, electrical distibution
systems, regulating works and equipment. The component is designed to help farmers
and their WUOs to improve off-farm minor irrigation and drainage networks related
to command areas of between 80 and 500 ha. The completion or improvement of



- 3 -
such works will allow farmers to save water and to develop more frequent, flexible,
and dependable irrigation schedules; together, these actions would increase
productivity, and permit diversification into higher value crops or intensified
cropping. The investment cost of this component will be shared equally by farmers
and the Government. Financing will be channelled through CNA, which will be
responsible for recovering the farmers' 50% share of capital costs through an
addition > and specific surcharge on the water fees (which are paid by all irrigated
farmers and _ollected by WUOs.)
(c)    On-fa  Improvements (US$269.6 million). This component mainly comprises land
leveling, on-farm distribution and drainage systems, control and measurement devices,
internal regulating tanks, and pressurized irrigation systems. These improvements
would be entirely financed by fatmers through cash from savings (10%), labor
contributions (10%), and money borrowed from the rural credit system (80%).
8.    Project Cost and Financing. Total project cost is estimated at US$568.8 million. On-farm
improvements will be mostly financed by US$224.6 million from rural credit, farmers' savings and
contributions in kind, and loans from private banks (average proportion: farmers' cash and kind
207, rural credit rediscount system 64%, private banks 16%). Minor network (off-farms
improvements will be financed through a combination of Bank and government funds channelled
through CNA on a 50% cost-sharing basis with WUOs; 50% of such funds to capital cost investnents
will be recovered through water fees. On-farm improvements will be done at full cost by farmers,
using material procured by CNA and thei sold to farmers. Given the project's high reliance on
WUO's for subproject design, execution and operation, only those that are self-sufficient in operations
and maintenance (O&M) expenditures will participate in the project. The technological support,
comumnications and training component, due to its public good nature, would be financed by
government grants. To promote the smooth start-up of project implementation, retroactive financing
of up to US$20 million is recommended for key project expenditures incurred after June 21, 1993
(e.g., for feasibility studies, field surveys, engineering services, construction designs, and the first
batch of machinery and construction materials for the subprojects to be initiated in 1994). Schedule
A reflects the estimated project costs; Schedule B shows the amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement, as well as the disbursement schedule; Schedule C shows the processing time table and
the last five completed subsector loans to Mexico; and Schedule D reflects the current status of Bank
Group Operations in Mexico.
9.    Project Implemenion. The implementing agency will be the National Water Commission
(CNA). The Mexican Institute of Water Technology (IMTA), under CNA supervision, will be
responsible for implementing sub-components related to adaptive research, communications, and
training. In order to coordinate, supervise, and monitor project implementation, CNA would
establish a small project unit within the General Sub-Directorate of Infrastructure. Operating
Regulations have been designed and agreed upon to guide project implementation and monitoring.
The minor network and on-farm improvements components will be planned and implemented through
"subprojects" which will encompass entire transferred modules (3,000 to 18,000 ha) in IDs.
Feasibility studies for these subprojects will be prepared under CNA supervision in coordination with
the WUOs. Each subproject will have its own financing, cost recovery, and implementation scheme,
consistent with the project's operating regulations. Under the technological support, communications
and training component, CNA will also prepare and supervise field surveys, monitoring of drainage
and salinity, and environmental check lists. Performance and impact monitoring indicators were
developed during appraisal, and will be maintained in project management systems, and reviewed in
Bank/Government annual and mid-tvrm reviews.

10.   Project Sustanabillty. This projer: is expected to have a positive effect on sustainable
irrigated agriculture and on the consolidation of the private sector's role in the agricultural sector.
Under the project, the new regulatory and administrative reforms related to water and land use will
create an environment conducive to private investnents and to the more efficient use of land and
water resources. In addition, the project will introduce priority-setting mechanisms for public
infucture cost sharing between the Govermnent and the private sector, as well fo- improved water
use and better drainage of irrigated land.
11.   Lemons learned fhm previous Bank involvement. During the past 25 years, Mexico has
received 19 Bank loans for the irrigation and drainage sub-sector, amounting to about US$1.4 billion,
These projects, excluding IDSP, contributed to the creation of about 500,000 ha of irrigated land and
to rehabilitation of an additional 900,000 ha in central and northern Mexico.
12.   The five main lessons learned from thece operations, including the on-going IDSP, have been
reflected and incorporated in the design of this project. These are the need for: (a) training in
modern irrigation .ethods and technology; (b) early preparation of a manual for minor hydraulic
structes; (c) ensuring substantial farmer participation through improved communications;
(d) improvement of field monitoring of yields, water table movement, salinity levels, irrigation
schedules, and water distribution efficiency; and (e) strengthening the capacity for subproject
preparation (notably through feasibility studies and construction designs).
13.   Rationale for Bank involvement. Bank involvement will support the reorientation of the
irrigation sub-sector away from centralized management toward greater private sector control and
investment, and away from dependence on the subsidized provision of inputs and prices toward the
use of technologies and crops appropriate to market conditions. Both shifts are central to the Bank's
country assistance strategy (CAS) of promoting rational and sustainable agricultural resource
utilization (the most recent CAS Board discussion took place on June 3, 1993). Bank participation
will help ensure that sub-sector policies are consistent within themselves and in relation to the broader
agricultural strategy. It will also help the Government make further progress in the following
desirable but difficult areas: (a) adjustment to the new economic environment that will follow
NAFTA; (b) decentralization; (c) privatization; and (d) improved efficiency of resource use. Bank
involvement is also important as this project is a direct complement to the investment and institutional
changes taking place under ll)SP. The proposed project will benefit about 20% of the area
transferred to users under IDSP. The remaining transferred area will require similar on-farm and
minor network development, but whether this requires Bank support is an issue that should be
examined later, in the light of project implementation and other operational considerations.
14.   Actions Agreed. Project identification, design and preparation have required of the
Government significant up-front action related to institutional and legal-regulatory changes. During
preparation, several studies were carried out by CNA regarding key legal, regulatory, and
administrative issues, and a mnmber of decisions were taken to create a better environment for private
investments in irrigation. As a result, new provisions were developed under the new Water Law;
priorities were set to speed up the creation of the Water Committees and District Regulations;
implementing regulations for the new Water Law was put into effect by January 12, 1994; and a
small project unit was created within the CNA Directorate of Infrastructure.
15.   During negotiations, agreement was reached on: (a) participating IDs; (b) prepatation of
construction designs under agreed terms of reference; (c) schedules to prepare feasibility studies and
construction designs; (d) indicators to measure project implementation and impact; (e) maintenance
within CNA of a PU with structure, func.ions, staff satisfactory to the Bank; (f) preparation and use
* the 'Minor Irrigation Structures Design Manual,; (g) reporting schedules, semi-annual and annual
,.Aews; (h) the scheduling of a project mid-term review no later than October 31, 1997; (i) CNA



-5-
providing tinely information to allow the Bank to monitor its annual budget allocations for the project
and the Government providing the Bank with evidence of the actual release of sufficient funds to
CNA; 0) project accounts and audits, in accordance with procedure; acceptable to the Bank;
(k) adjustments of the regulations of the participating IDs, and of the statutes of the WUOs in these
IDs, in accordance with the requirements of the Water Law; (I) use of standard legal agreements for
(i) design commlitments and (ii) project implementation and cost recovery between the WUOs and
CNA; (m) the signing before June, 1996, of all the Implementation and Cost Recovery Agreements
for the participating WUOs; (n) Government giving evidence of budget funds release before March 31
of each year; and (o) Government ensuring that adequate credit facilities for projects with long
maturation periods would be available to the on-farm financing of the project.
16.   Conditions of Board Presentation were: (a) Congressional approval of a 1994 budget
allocation for the project of not less than US$27.6 million equivalent; (b) CNA submission to the
Bank of draft feasibility studies for all modules larger than 10,000 ha in the second group of
subprojects; (c) CNA presentation to the Bank of a copy of the implementing regulations for the
Water Law; and (d) receipt of a satisfactory signed Policy Letter. Conditions of Loan Effectiveness
are: (a) establishment of a project monitoring system in the CNA's project unit; (b) NAFIN entering
into contractual arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, with the Government and CNA for the
transfer of the loan proceeds; (c) signing of a contract between CNA and a specialized firm,
satisfactory to the Bank, for inventory control of construction materials and machinery; (d) delivery
to the Bank of construction designs for all subprojects included in the first group of modules;
(e) issuance by all participating IDs using surface water of their regulations; (f) signing of a
contractual arrangement between CNA and IMTA for implementation by IMTA of its parts of the
project; and (g) presentation of a satisfactory draft 'Minor Irrigation Structures Design Manual."
Conditions of Disbursement are: no disbursement will be made for (a) construction and
maintenance machinery after June 30, 1998, and (b) construction materials after June 30, 1999.
17.   Project Benefits. The "core" project area wiUl cover over 400,000 ha and will directly
benefit 42,000 farmers in the 14 IDs that have been rehabilitated and transferred to users under the
IDSP. Expected benefits are an increase in the value of production from irrigated agriculture, greater
returns on public and private investment in irrigation, water and energy savings, improved
management of groundwater resources, reduction of salinity and water-logging risks, and the
generation of employment. The project will also help farmers in participating IDs make the necessary
transition to new cropping patterns and practices. From farm models of ten sample subprojects, the
ERR is estimated at 19%. No subproject with an ERR below 12% would be accepted in the
implementation portfolio.
18.   Although on-farm and minor network improvements activities will be implemented only in a
core area, wider areas would also benefit from the technological support, communications and
training component. This component will benefit also over 1.5 million ha in the 14 participating IDs.
The expected project impact on poverty will be indirect. The project is expected to generate about
52,000 new jobs through incremental harvested land (150,000 ha) and diversification into high value
crops (50,000 ha) like fruits and vegetables, which are labor intensive.
19.   Enviromental Aspects. The project has been rated "B." It will not fince any new
irrigation system nor any increased exploitation of groundwater, there therefore will be no direct
negative environmental in'pact. It will include investments for environmental monitoring. The
project will also reduce risks of waterlogging and salinity through the development of more efficient
water distribution and drainage systems, and by providing incentives to save water. Reduced water-
logging would also help the control of water-borne diseases.



- 6-
20.   Project Risb. There are three principal risks involved in the implementation of the project.
One relates to the provision of adequate and timely government counterpart funds. This risk will be
addressed, through: (a) monitoring of CNA's annual budget reviews, and (b) the Government's
Policy Letter ensuring priority to the project and its adequate annual budget allocation. A second risk
telates to the timely availability, for each subproject, of feasibility studies, field surveys, detailed
designs, and up-front agreements with the beneficiaries for implementation and cost-sharing. The
timely availability and delivery of construction materials and machinery to WUOs is also critical.
These risks will be addressed by: (a) CNA having already completed the preparation of all subprojects
to be included in the first year of project implementation before effectiveness, and thereafter ensuring
subprojects are prepared one year in advance of need; and (b) ensuring reliable planning, monitoring
and supes-+%ion of procurement, pooling and distribution of materials and equipment. A third risk
relates to the farmers' willingness to invest in on-farn improvements by borrowing money from
private bavks, and the availability of credit from banks. This will be addressed by an active extension
program (using analytical results of farm models), technical assistance, demonstration plots, and
training for farmers and local banks' staff.
21.   Recommendation  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
