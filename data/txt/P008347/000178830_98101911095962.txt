APPRAISAL OF
THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK
INCLUDING A SMALL SCALE INDUSTRY SCHEME
SUMMARY
i.        The Cyprus Development Bank (CDB) was established in 1963 with the
objective of providing medium- and long-term financing for industry and tour-
ism. Total capitalization was CL 1 million, with 60% of the shares held by
the Government and 40% by private investors.
ii.       The first Bank loan to CDB of $3 million, approved in 1972, helped
to finance the foreign exchange component of 17 projects with a total value
of $20.6 million.
iii.      The economic development of Cyprus has been seriously affected by
political events in July 1974. Since then, a separate de facto Turkish-
Cypriot administration has retained control of the northern part of the is-
land (36% of the land area), which includes rich agricultural areas, tour-
istic important cities, as well as the island's major port of Famagusta.
About one-third of both Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots were displaced and be-
came refugees.
iv.       The shock of these events led to a temporary stagnation in the
buoyant economic life, but with active Government support, and following the
establishment of an apparently stable status quo, an upturn in the economic
activities, at least in the southern, Government-controlled area, has been
noted. This appraisal limits itself to the area under Government control,
as this is the area in which CDB can effectively operate at present.
v.        CDB's portfolio in the northern area, amounting to half its total
loan portfolio and a third of its total equity portfolio by end 1975, is no
longer under CDB's control or supervision. Reports indicate that many of the
enterprises financed by CDB in the northern area are either closed down or
operating at a greatly reduced rate. With the loan and equity portfolio in
the north (including accrued interest) amounting to CL 2.9 million virtually
"lost", CDB would have been technically insolvent as its equity and reserves
amount to only CL 1.2 million.
vi.       The Government has recognized these difficulties.  In order to make
CDB a major instrument of development assistance to industry and tourism, it
has initiated a series of measures to rescue CDB and restore its credit-
worthiness.   The Government will take over all CDB's shares still in private
hands, and subsequently provide CDB with grants and guarantees of payment
to offset past and future non-payments of principal and interest on the
northern area portfolio; CDB will also receive compensation for its small
equity holding in projects in the north. The Board of CDB will retain a
majority of non-Government Directors, and continue to make decisions based on
sound professional criteria.



- ii -
vii.      CDB has prepared a new Policy Statement defining its future role
in Cyprus, and its status as an autonomous institution within general. Govern-
ment policies.
viii.     These changes have been accompanied by the appointment of new man-
agement and a reorganization of the staff. The new organization, although
yet untested, appears to be sound and dynamic. It includes a small but ex-
perienced and capable staff. CDB's appraisal work is good, and it is
strengthening its supervision work which has been lagging in the past, re-
sulting in excessive arrears in loan collection. A substantial increase in
staff is considered a prerequisite to the efficient operation of CDB, parti-
cularly as it is facing an increasingly important task in Cyprus.
ix.       CDB has been moderately profitable in the past, earning a 5.6%
return on its equity in 1973, the last undisturbed year of operations; profits
in 1974 and 1975 (after substantial provisions) were negligible. Total capital
mobilized by CDB at the end of 1975 amounted to CL 8.2 million, of which 68% in
local currency. In 1973, the last year of normal operations, 31 projects were
approved with a value amounting to CL 1.2 million. The corresponding figures
for 1974 were 25 projects and CL 0.6 million, and for 1975, 28 projects and
also CL 0.6 million. In 1974, 9% of approvals were for agro-industry, 20% for
tourism, and 71/% for industry; the corresponding figures for 1975 were 24%,
2/,', and 74%.
x.        Until mid-1974, CDB was faced with a strong competitioh from com-
mercial banks, providing rolled-over short-term funds for long-term projects.
The commercial banks, which also suffered financially from the 1974 events,
have since become more selective in matching the terms of their resources
to the terms of their loans. They are prepared to recognize CDB as the major
source for medium- and long-term financing, and to participate in projects
financed by CDB to meet the liquidity and working capital needs of these pro-
jects. Lending rates in Cyprus are controlled by the Government. Long-term
interest rates are limited to 9% p.a., i.e. close to the cost to CDB of the
proposed Bank loan. However, CDB expects to receive German bilateral and
Government loans at rates substantially below 9%. On the average, CDB would
therefore remain profitable.
xi.       Prospects for CDB are good, and reflect the important investment
objectives and programs in manufacturing and tourism proposed by the Govern-
ment to accelerate economic growth in the south of Cyprus. Special emphasis,
supported by generous incentives, is placed on (i) export-oriented industries
taking advantage of Cyprus low-cost and efficient labor and (ii) labor inten-
sive small scale enterprise. CDB's business volume for 1976 is estimated at
CL 1.3 million in approvals, and CL 0.7 million in disbursements; subsequent
annual increases in business are expected to be in the 20-25% range.
xii.      At the request of the Government, CDB is also planning to finance
small scale industries (SSI) in Cyprus under a special Scheme which would be
funded in equal parts by the Government and the Bank. Though certain aspects
of the SSI Scheme are still under review, and will have to be approved by the



- iii -
Bank as a condition of disbursement for the SSI Scheme component of the
proposed loan, CDB's role in this area is expected to fill a major gap in the
financing of small manufacturing enterprises in Cyprus.
xiii.     The proposed second Bank loan to CDB of $6 million will finance
about 60% of its estimated resource needs in foreign exchange, over the next
2-1/2 years or so, to finance imports for enterprises in the manufacturing and
service sector (including tourism, small scale industries, and processing of
agricultural products). Of the total loan of $6 million, an initial amount of
$0.75 million is allocated to small scale industries (SSI), and $5.25 million
to CDB's other business operations. After about a year or so, the Bank will
review, with the Government and CDB, the progress of the Scheme. If progress
and prospects are found satisfactory and promising, as now expected, the Bank
will agree to an additional amount of up to $0.75 million to be used for the
SSI Scheme, raising the Bank's contribution to $1.5 million.  The amount
available for CDB's normal operations would, in that event, be reduced to $4.5
million.






I.  INTRODUCTIOf
1.(1      This report appraises the Cyprus Developrent Bank (CT)B) for a second
Bank loan to finance part of the import requirements of projects financed by
this institution.
II.  THE ENVIRONMIENT
A. Background
2.01      Cyprus became an independent country in 1960, and now has a total
population of 650,000. Since independence, the country has been plagued
by the political difficulties arising from the intercommunal disputes between
the Greek Cypriot majority (80%) and the Turkish Cypriot minority (20%:).
In spite of these difficulties, Cyprus as a whole had an impressive growth
record. Economic growth averaged 7% per annum in real terms from 1960 up to
1972, but an unprecedented drought led to stagnation in 1973. Agriculture has
been the largest economic sector, contributing about 18% to GDP in 1972 and
employing 34% of the economically active population. Manufacturing contri-
buted 13% to GDP (1973) and employed 14% of the work force. Tourism revenues
were also substantial and, at CL 23.8 million in 1974, equivalent to 42% of
all export earnings. In 1974, foreign intervention lead to a major upheaval
of the political, economic and social life in Cyprus. A de facto Turkish-
Cypriot administration has retained control of the northern part, which
includes rich agricultural areas, a quarter of industrial investments, the
touristic important cities of Kyrenia and Famagusta, as well as the island's
major port of Famagusta.
2. 02     At present, reliable data and information about the economic situa-
tion in the north, is not available. Movement of goods and persons between
the two zones (see map, Annex 1) is very limited. Various sources, including
a Bank economic mission which made a brief visit to north Cyprus in November
1975, indicate that many productive enterprises in manufacturing and tourism,
owned by Greek Cypriots who have left the area, have remained idle since
mid-1974. This appraisal report limits economic assessment of the situation
and prospects of Cyprus to the southern part of the island which is controlled
by the Government, and in which the Cyprus Development Bank operates for the
time being.
2.03      As a result of the 1974 events, the Government now controls about
64% of the island.  The area out of control includes 47% of the cultivated
area, with 80% of the citrus orchards and 65% of the dryland grain-growing
areas. One-third of the country's livestock population remains in the north.
The industrial losses included 20%o of total industrial fixed assets, producing
30% of gross output and 25%o of industrial value added, and providing some



- 2 -
11,000 industrial jobs.  About 60%" of tourist hotel accommodation was lost, as
well as infrastructure facilities and major sources of Government revenue.  A
massive displacement of population took place as 180,000 Greek Cypriots moved
south and bout 45,000 Turkish Cypriots left for the north; about one-third of
each community was thus displaced. Full employment was replaced by an unem-
plovment rate of nearly 20% in the Government-controlled area, although only
about half of those unemployed registered at the Labour Exchange. Wlith the
Loss of the tourist centers, the Turkish Cypriot market, and the creation of
a large number of refugees with minimal purchasing power, the domestic market
for industrial products for industries in the south was about halved. Some of
these industries have also been cut off from their normai sources of raw
materials.
2.()4     The 1974 events resulted in large structural changes in the
Government-controlled area. In the second half of 1974, exports fell by 30%.
following the loss of productive assets in the north, and imports by 45% due
to a combination of reduced purchasing power, reliance on existing stocks and
the collapse of investment generally and construction activity in particular.
Tourism and foreign private investment also virtually ceased. According to
latest Government estimates, GNP per capita droped 17% between 1973 and
1975.
2.05      Both Government and the private sector have shown great resilience
in reacting to the shock of the hostilities. The Government set up a relief
service for the refugees which supports almost 140,000 people; it has embarked
on a large housing program for the 26,000 people still living in tents and
other temporary shelters. It also compulsorily reduced incomes in both the
public and private sectors on a progressive scale running from 10% to 25%, and
channelled the proceeds into refugee relief; dismissal of employees has been
regulated. Finally, it has been running a large budget deficit and an expan-
sionary monetary policy to supplement private demand, which has been greatly
reduced by the fall in disposable income and the loss of the Turkish Cypriot
market. In August 1975, the Government issued an Emergency Economic Action
Plan (EEAP) for the area under its control, covering 1975 and 1976. Its
basic approach is to reactivate the economy and provide maximum employment,
with emnphasis on intensive utilization of existing resources, and priority
for export-oriented activities. Development expenditures by the Government
were targeted at CL 23 million for 1975 and CL 28 million for 1976.
2.06      The Government is promoting quick-yielding small-scale agricul-
tural schemes under the EEAP which are land- and capital-saving, to reac-
tivate as many farmers as possible, recover lost production, and save or earn
foreign exchange. The EEAP also aims at the creation of additional capacity
in labor-intensive export-oriented industries, as well as increased utilization
of the existing capital assets, for example through double-shifting working.
It has introduced new tax incentives for accelerated depreciation of new in-
vestment, mergers of firms, and establishment of foreign companies in Cyprus.
Other measures include the proposed rehabilitation of the Cyprus Development



Bank, as described below, liberalization of bank credit, a Special Fund at
the Central Bank for loans to mianufacturing, elimination of remaining import
duties on industrial raw materials and machinery, an export credit guarantee
faciLity and the maintenance of relatively low interest rates on bank loans
(para. 2.20). The Government, under the EEAP, is also prepared to guarantee
about 75%O of the value of approved bank loans to industry, including CDB's
loans. Up to December 1975, about CL 2.5 million had been so guaranteed, with
three times that amount in pending applications (CDB's guaranteed loans amounted
to an insignificant CL 55,000). Finally, the Government proposes to take
shares in several Larger industrial projects, the construction of which is
projected to begin in 1976.
B. Manufacturing and Mining
2.07      The 1972 census of industrial production in Cyprus indicated that,
at the end of that year, there was a total of 6,421 manufacturing establish-
ments (excluding cottage industries) in the island with an employment of
32,279 persons; about 90% of all manufacturing establishments employed less
than 10 persons. The gross output from these industries in 1972 was CL 93
million and the value added CL 39 million. The estimated mid-1974 annual rate
of gross output of manufacturing industries in all of Cyprus was CL 113 mil-
lion, and value added CL 48 million, according to estimates by the Ministry
of Commerce and Industry.
2.08      After the 1974 events, 31% of manufacturing industries employing
at least 5 workers, and 36%o of the smaller industries were located in the
north; as mentioned above, reports indicate that there is only very limited
production in these factories and workshops at present. Moreover, the northern
area was a major supplier of raw materials and intermediate products to the
rest of the island, and this has had further serious effects on the industrial
activity in the south.
2.09      Consultants to the Government have prepared projections for employ-
ment, gross output and value added for south Cyprus for 1975 and 1976. These
figures are shown below, together with comparable 1972 and estimated 1974
figures:

The above projected  figures ( in currenit p rices), indicate the setback which
has been suffered  in industrial outlput in Cyprus.  No figures are yet avail-
able to verify the 1976 projectionis.
2.10       Annex 2 gives the structure of the manufacturing industry in Cyprus.
The main sub-sectors, in order of importance, are food, beverages and tobacco;
petroleum refining; footwear and apparel; and non-metallic products (mainly
cement). In recent years, exports lhave played a very significant role in
industry. It is estimiated that in 1975 exports represented about 25% of gross
manufacturing output.  Annex 3 gives a breakdown of the manufactured exports,
whichl are dominated by the food, beverage and tobacco industry, followed by
footwear and apparel, and by non-metallic mineral products.
2.11       The mining industry in Cyprus has been declining over the years; in
1972, its contribution to GDP was only 5%.  In 1970, there were 208 mining op-
erations employing 4,900 persons, but in 1975 only 181 operations remained,
employing 3,700. About 70% of the operations are for building materials
such as stone, sand and clay.
C. Tourism
2.12       Large-scale tourism is  relatively new in Cyprus; however it has
been very successful until the 1974 events. Tourist arrivals increased at an
average rate of 27% per annum from 1966 to 1972; in 1973, as a result of the
disturbances in the Middle East, the rate of increase dropped to 16%. In 1974,
the rate of increase was 17% during the first six months of the year, despite
the world recession, but tourist traffic essentially ceased thereafter. In
1975, there was a modest return of tourists after the new airport at Larnaca
was opened, and a further increase is expected in 1976 if there is no further
unrest in the area.
Tourist Arrivals*
1972                       228,000
1973                       264,000
1974                       150,000 (of which 145,000 before August)
1975                        47,000
1976 (projected)            87,000
*     Source:  Cyprus Tourism  Organization (Cr0).
2.13       The tourists arriving prior to 1974 staved predominantly in either
the old town of Kyrenia on the north coast of Cyprus, or in the beach resort
of Famagusta.  Both towns are now in the Turkish-Cypriot controlled area.  Of
the 13,050 hotel beds in 1973, 8,368 (64%) are in north Cyprus, as well as
all the 4,000 beds in service flats.

2.14      The Governnent wishes to stimulate tlhe tourist industry in south
Cyprus, as it is both an earner of foreign exchange and a major provider of
employment.  In particular, low interest Government loans at 5-1/2% are made
available for hotel construction. Due to the construction time required, it
will be at least two years before new hotels become available, even if such
loans are taken up now. However, it is difficult to forecast the tourism
potential of south Cyprus, which may offer less scenic attraction and ameni-
ties to tourists than the northern area. Large-scale expansion of tourism
centers in the south is likely to require considerable infrastructure expenses,
which have not yet been budgeted.
D. Financial Environment and CDB
2.15      The financial community in Cyprus includes the Central Bank, two
Greek-Cypriot banks, six international and two Turkish com-mercial banks.
Two cooperative banks, three long-term financial institutions (among which
CDB), and the Loan Commissioners complete the banking structure. 1/ After a
steady growth (10 - 12% p.a.) of the assets of the banking sector over the
past decade (until 1973 which was a year when banking resources dropped
sharply), total assets of all banks amounted to CL 304 million by mid-1975
(latest available figures) of which CL 268 million for commercial banks and CL
36 million for other financial institutions, including CDB. Advances and
loans amounted to 66% of total assets for the commercial banks, and to 81% for
other financial institutions.  Investments and other assets accounted for 12%
of the commercial banks' total assets, and for 17% of the financial institu-
tions' total assets.  Only the commercial banks had invested in government
papers (6% of their total assets). Equity funds were 30% of the total assets
of the financial institutions, compared to 20% for commercial banks.
1/   The two Greek-Cypriot banks are the Bank of Cyprus Ltd. and The Popular
Bank of Cyprus Ltd. The international banks are British-, Greek- and
partly American-owned, of which the British banks operate in the south
and north Cyprus. One of the cooperative banks is Greek-Cypriot, the
other Turkish-Cypriot owned and accordingly operate in the respective
parts of Cyprus. The Turkish banks (Turkiye Is Bankasi A.S. and Turkish
Bank Ltd.) are in the north. All other financial institutions are Greek-
Cypriot: the Mortgage Bank of Cyprus Ltd., Lombard Banking (Cyprus)
Ltd. and The Cyprus Development Bank. The Loan Commissioners is a gov-
ernment agency currently operating only in south Cyprus, and lending
directly and/or through banks to industry, hotels, agriculture, and for
village and other community projects.

2.16      Before July 1974, especially following the increase in oil, prices,
demand for bank credits continued to rise.  Accordingly, the average bank
liquidity ratio which was 35%' in mid-1973 decreased to 26% in June 1974.  Af-
ter July 1974, the situation chanlged.  Firstly, the loan portfolios of all
banks, primarily CDB, but also all commercial banks, were affected to various
degrees by the division of the country. Collection of debts was disrupted,
the level of deposits stagnated, and savings and deposits were shifted from
the Greek-Cypriot banks to local branches of international banks.  The banks
became very hesitant in granting loans, given the uncertain political and
economic outlook.
2.17      To stimulate the recovery of the economy, the Government initiated
in the fall of 1974 a reactivation program which included financing facili-
ties for priority sectors of the economy, and incentives for bank lending.
The Emergency Action Plan 1975-76 includes these financial measures. The
main measures taken were:
(a) The minimum liquidity ratio of commercial banks was reduced
to 20% and a penalty was introduced for banks maintaining a
high liquidity (mainly foreign banks which received consider-
able deposits).
(b) Three percent of the total deposits (or 15,% of the deposits
with the Central Bank) have been set aside by the Central Bank
as a Special Fund. Banks can draw on this Fund (amounting to
about CL 6 million at the end of 1975) for government-approved
priority investments, mainly in construction and manufacturing.
(In effect, the liquidity ratio required of banks is thus now
17%.)
(c) The Government agreed to guarantee up to 75%. of commercial
bank loans for approved priority investments.
2.18      CDB has a special role in the banking sector:  It lends exclusively
at long- and medium-term, but takes no deposits and must rely in part on Gov-
ernment support for its resources (para. 5.01). Until mid-1974, CDB's com-
petitive position vis-a-vis the commercial banks was weak. The commercial
banks, which at that time were very liquid, used to finance long-term invest-
ments through short-term loans which they would roll over. Their simplified
appraisal procedures, their loans based on knowledge of their customers, and
their competitive interest rates, allowed them to outbid CDB for new business.
Since mid-1974, the situation has changed considerably, and commercial banks
appear to have recognized the danger of their previous practice. In fact, the
commercial banks and CDB now see each other's roles as complementary and they
are likely to work together according to their objectives, with CD)B having
the key role in long-term financing and appraisal, and the commercial banks
providing mainly working capital and short-term loans.

E. Interest Rates
9.19      Cyprus has experienced a remarkable price stability in recent years.
During 1965-70, consumer prices rose an average of 2% annually, while in the
period 1971-73 the average increase was 4%. In 1974, however, there was a
jump of 16% in the consumer prices due to the disturbances and the general
international price increases (including oil prices). Though the data
is still tentative, it appears that, even given the economic disruption and
the Government's expansionary financial policies, inflation was maintained at
less than 5% in 1975. The 1974 events led to considerable unemployment, idle
capacity, and reduction of incomes (including the impact of the tax for
refugees). These problems are likely to persist for some years and keep rates
of inflation in Cyprus relatively low by international standards. Consumer
prices are projected to rise by about 6.5% per annum during 1976-80, taking
account of the domestic factors mentioned above and the likely rates of
international price increases.
2.20      The current interest rate ceiling of 9% p.a. for alL loans was im-
posed after mid-1974 to prevent charges going beyond what underlying conditions
could justify. It also gave some relief to debtors whose assets were affected
by the hostiLities. It has been sufficient to maintain a positive real interest
rate and avoid misallocation of resources. In the present situation, investors
in fact have a considerable incentive to design new investments, or to expand
existing investments, on a labor-intensive basis to gain a significant advantage
for exports from the low cost of labor. The Government supports the 9% interest
rate ceiling very strongly as part of its overall policy for reactivation of the
economy. It has decided to maintain relatively low cost credit conditions until
the political situation has settled, and the economy has taken off. It believes
that any action at this stage which would put an additional burden on investors
could provoke a marked setback in investments. This fear applies especially to
small investors, many of whom have lost their businesses in the north. The
Government would consider reviewing the interest rate policy when the economic
situation changes.  It agrees that, in general, a positive - though small -
spread between inflation and lending rates should be maintained.
2.21      The interest rate ceiling applies to loans in foreign exchange as
well as to local currency credits. CDB is the main provider of foreign ex-
change to industry and tourism and the question is whether CDB could possibly
require its borrowers to bear the exchange risk on foreign exchange loans made
to it. For the time being, the Government has decided to assume the foreign
exchange risk. Though the Cyprus pound has steadily lost value vis-a-vis the
US dollar over the past two years, its value vis-a-vis the currencies of
Cyprus' major trading partners is being kept stable by the Central Bank. In
the two or three years to come, this policy is expected to remain basically
unchanged given the reserves position. The Government's decision thus appears
to be the right one for investment to be stimulated in the framework of the
reactivation program.



- 8 -
2.22      For the proposed loan, the Bank recognizes that the current policy
maintains a positive real interest rate, and thiat it does not seem to induce
mis-allocation of resources. The coverage by the Government of CDB's foreign
exchange risk is necessary in order to promote investment in an extremely
difficult political and economic situation. The Bank and the Government have
agreed to review and discuss the appropriateness of present policy in these
respects in the light of future economic developments.
III. CDB'S INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
3.01      A main aspect of this appraisal is the financial situation faced by
CD)B after the 1974 events. As explained in para. 4.01, CDB would have been
unable to continue its existence after the "loss" of 47% of its assets, which
was equivalent to more than twice CDB's equity. The Government, recognizing
the vital role CDB has to play in the Cyprus economy and, allowing for the
fact that CDB had no responsibility for the events which caused its financial
problems, has agreed to undertake special measures to restore CDB's credit-
worthiness. This appraisal has taken place in parallel with the Government's
actions in this respect which, when completed, will have changed CDB ownership
and management structure as well as provided adequate financial resources to
cover past losses.
A. Ownership
3.02      CDB's authorized share capital is CL 3 million.  Its paid-in share
capital on January 1, 1976 was CL 1 million divided into 400,000 "A" shares and
600,000 "B" shares, the latter owned by the Government 1/. The "A" shares were
owned at that time by about 900 shareholders, none of them holding more than
3.75% of the "A" share capital, as shown in Annex 4. The commercial banks
in Cyprus have a small share participation, but they are prevented by CDB's
Articles of Association from being represented on the Board. The Government
guaranteed a tax-free dividend of 6% to the private shareholders for a ten-
year period, 1963-72. As a pre-requisite for indemnifying CDB for its losses
in northern Cyprus (whether or not eventually recoverable), the Government
intends to acquire all shares now in private hands. Compensation will be in
the form of non-voting preference shares redeemable at par over a 12 year
period, providing a 5% dividend (guaranteed by the Government) to the private
shareholders. This compensation is reasonable, considering that, without the
Government's financial rescue action CDB would have been unable to meet its
financial commitments (Annex 17). The take-over of the shares is expected to
take place by the end of July 1976. The shareholders will decide on the Gov-
ernnent's offer for the take-over of their slhares in a special shareholders'
meeting, which will be held on May 27 of this year; thereafter, their decision
must be ratified by the Court. Preliminary sotundings of the shareholders'
position strongly indicate that they plan to approve the above scheme on
that date.
1/   Class A shares have full voting rights.  Class B shares carry no voting
rights except in the case of special resolutions proposed by Government
directors or CLass A shareholders.



- 9-
B. Board of Directors
3.03      The Articles provide at present for a board of 11 or 14 directors,
comprising 3 or 6 Government-appointed directors, 5 private directors, and
3 public sector directors.  Annex 5 gives the composition of CDB's Board on
January 1, 1976. The present Chairman of the Board is Mr. Papadopoulos, a
private-sector Director, and the Vice-Chairman is Mr. Afxentiou, Director-
General of the Ministry of Finance.
3.04      After the proposed acquisition of all CDB shares by the Government,
a new system for electing directors will be implemented. The Government and
CDB have agreed on the following composition of the new Board:
Number of directors                                 7
Government-appointed directors                      3
Private sector directors (representatives
of industry, commerce, etc.)                   4
Chairman of the Board:  Private sector director
Quorum                :  3 directors, of which two private sector
directors and one Government director.
Appointment of the private sector directors would be made by the Government;
these directors would be selected from among experienced leaders in the
private sector.  The proposed new composition of the Board, and its quorum
system provide reasonable safeguards for an autonomous Board, seeing to it
that CDB will continue to operate on the basis of sound financial and economic
standards.
C. Policies
3.05      CDB's Memorandum and Articles of Association allow it to lend long-
and medium-term to productive enterprises in any economic sector, and to
take equity participations. Advances to a single enterprise are limited
to 20% of CDB's net worth; equity participations in a single enterprise
are limited to 5% of CDB's net worth, except when necessary to secure or
recover any advance. The total equity portfolio is limited to 40% of CDB's
net worth, which is conservative. 1/ Loans for Government or semi-Government
projects, or projects of cooperative banks or societies, are not allowed to
total more than 25% of total outstanding CDB loans.
3.06      CDB's new policy statement was approved by CDB's Board of Directors
on February 26, 1976. This statement, attached as Annex 6, is satisfactory.
Major features of the Policy Statement are: (i) emphasis on sound appraisal
1/   CDB's new Policy Statement (par. 3.06) raises the maximum equity partici-
pation in a single enterprise to 10%, and the total equity portfolio to
100% of CDB's net worth.  These figures are acceptable, and the M1emorandum
and Articles of Association will be amended accordingly.



- 10 -
and supervision standards by CUB; (ii) promotional objectives; and, (iii)
diversification of CDB's portfolio and resources.
D. Procedures
3.07      Appraisal.  CDB's technical and financial appraisal work has reached
a good standard. However, the evaluation of markets and sales prospects is
still weak, and such market studies are especially important now that the
domestic economy of Cyprus has been considerably disturbed and industriaL
exports are being fostered. This is realized by CDB's management, which in-
tends to add a marketing specialist to its staff. Economic analysis of
projects should also be improved. CDB's staff, which includes two EDI
fellows, is familiar with the economic rate of return calculation and, as
indicated in CDB's new Policy Statement (Annex 6), such calculations would be
carried out for major projects whether or not financed with Bank funds. During
negotiations, it was agreed that CDB will prepare economic rate of return cal-
culations for projects involving a CDB financing exceeding $200,000 equivalent.
3.08      Supervision.  Project supervision has been somewhat hampered by
the small size of the staff. Technical supervision is satisfactory, with
an average of four visits by CDB engineers to the site during the construc-
tion period of major projects. However, financial follow-up, particularly
of completed projects, has often been inadequate. The extraordinary circum-
stances following the 1974 events no doubt created a business climate which
partly explained the increase of CDB's arrears, but it has been proven during
the last few months that stricter control and pressure by CDB can consider-
ably improve loan collections (para. 5.03). CDB is conscious that close super-
vision of its projects is essential. CDB has agreed to strengthen its staff
in order to further improve CDB's supervision effectiveness (para 3.11).
3.09      Disbursement.  Disbursements are carefully handled, in line with the
progress of the project, and CDB insists on the sponsor providing funds pro-
rata. Payments are generally made to the suppliers on submission of invoices,
and the control procedures used appear adequate.
3.10      Procurement.  CDB requires its borrowers to submit more than one
tender for machinery and equipment, except in very small projects or in special
circumstances, and requires an architect's estimate of building costs. All
cost elements of a project are carefully checked by CDB's engineers.
E. Management and Staff
3.L1      The General Manager of CDB, in office since 1967, resigned in
September 1975.  After an interim period as joint-acting General Manager, Mr.
J.G. Joannides, an economist, with CDB since 1963 and formerly in charge of
the Economic Department (new customers, economic and technical studies), was



- 11 -
promoted to General Manager on February 1, 1976. Subsequently, Mr. L.D.
Sparsis (the other interim joint-acting General Manager), an economist and EDI
fellow, also with CDB since 1963 and formerly in charge of the Operations
Department (repeat customers and supervision), was appointed Assistant General
Manager and a realignment of duties followed. Both men have had extensive
experience in development banking, and are well qualified to fill their posi-
tions. The new CDB organization is shown in Annex 7. The total strength
of CDB staff as of February 1, 1976, was 16, of which 7 are professional staff.
This number includes an experienced technical adviser, provided and paid for
by the British Government, who has been working for CDB since 1973.  The
quality of the staff is good, and in particular the efforts made to have
in-house technical judgement by engaging sufficient engineers is commendable.
This small team also relies very extensively on the work and advice of outside
legal and accounting firms, and in specific case on outside technical advisers.
However, an expansion of staff is urgently required to meet the existing and
projected work load. The Government, CDB and the Bank have agreed that a
further 5 professional will be engaged during 1976 to strengthen CDB's capabil-
ities to handle the projected increase in normal business operations, while a
further 3 professionals (one of whom will have extensive prior experience)
will be engaged in 1976 or early 1976 to handle the SSI Scheme (para. 6.08).
The staffing of CDB after this extension will be 26, including 15 professionals
as shown in Annex 7; further staff increases are likely to take place to enable
CDB to cope adequately with its operations and related supervision. The
current staff expansion program seems sufficient to permit CDB to carry its
business program over the next two-to-three years.
3.12      Legal support for CDB is obtained from Messrs. Chryssafinis and
Polyvious, a well-known private law practice in Nicosia, and from Mr. Stavros
G. Ambizas, a lawyer formerly on the staff of CDB. Accounting support is
provided by Messrs. Metaxos, Christofides, Loizides & Co., an experienced
firm of Certified Public Accountants associated with the well-known auditing
firm Touche, Ross & Co.
F. Government Policies and Future Status of CDB
3.13      The Government wants to make CDB a major instrument for development.
It is intended that CDB will make loans and provide equity for economically
sound and profitable projects, with emphasis on industry (manufacturing, and
processing of agricultural products), and the service sector (including
tourism).
3.14      In order to achieve these objectives, the Government will provide
CDB with grants to offset past and present maturities of interest and princi-
pal due on loans made to projects now located in north Cyprus. Additional
grants will be made to CDB to compensate for the small equity holdings in
these projects, the value of which is now questionable. The principle of this
guarantee has been approved by the Council of MJinisters on December 19, 1975
and the signing of a formal agreement on this guarantee between CDB and the



- 12 -
Government is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. This action
will he the fundamentaL step to restore CDB's creditworthiness and the Govern-
ment hopes that CDB will thus be able to attract further outside financing in
the future, including loans from the Bank, bilateraL institutions and private
sources. The Government wishes CDB to continue to operate as an autonomous
institution.
IV. OPERATIONS
A. The 1974 Events and their Effects on CDB
4.01      In July 1974, CDB had in the now Turkish-Cypriot controlled area
outstanding loans and equity investments totalling CL 2.6 million; with
subsequent accrued interest, the total book value of these holdings amounted
to CL2.9 million by December 31, 1975 (about 2.4 times its share capital).
CDB has retained the liabilities relating to borrowings incurred to finance
its projects located in the north, and hence had to continue servicing these
liabilities. On the other hand, CDB has ceased to derive any income from
these assets after mid-1974. Clearly, it was not within the power of CDB
itself to remove the uncertainty regarding its future debt servicing capacity
and its creditworthiness. CDB's financial problem, given both its nature and
its magnitude, could only be resolved with the Government's help and within
the context of Government policies in general. The Government has been
forthcoming in providing operating funds to CDB, and has now agreed to provide
a permanent financial solution in regard to CDB's northern portfolio affected
by the 1974 events (para. 3.14).  Ilowever, many projects in the Governnent
controlled sector were also affected by the general economic upheaval follow-
ing the invasion, and thus resulted in delay in repaying CDB's loans. As
discussed later (para 5.03), a number of steps have, or will be initiated to
assure servicing of the outstanding loans in this area.
B. Operations before and after the 1974 Events
4.02      Since CDB started operations in 1963, total approvals of loans and
equity investments have amounted to CL 8 million; 62% of approvals was for
projects in manufacturing, 32% for tourism projects, and 6%O for others.  A
summary of operations for the years 1972-1975 , the period during which the
first Bank loan was effective, is given in Annex 8. CDB's annual approvals
reached a peak in 1973; based on the first half of 1974, results for that year
looked even more promising, but the hostilities led to a sharp decline in busi-
ness after mid-year. The 18 months from mid-1974 until end-1975 were essential-
ly a holding operation, pending a decision on the future of CDB; operations were
in part based on applications already under consideration in June 1974. Inves-
tors were hesitant to bring forward new projects during this period. Taking the



- 1 3 -
overall situation into account, the 25 approvals (CL 592,000) in 1974, and the
28 in 1975 (CL 556,000) indicate a commendable effort. The share of tourism
loans, which in 1973 represented 40% of approvals, has been drastically reduced
after mid-1974. In 1975 tourism loans were nearly nil. The number of approvals
of manufacturing projects was in line with those of previous years, although
the reduction of more than 50% in total value of approvals reflects investors'
perception of the uncertain prospects during this period. The time-lag between
approval and disbursement led to a peak in disbursements in 1974, and a sharp
reduction of disbursements in 1975.
C. Economic Impact of CDB
4.03       CDB's past lending operations have resulted in a well diversified
portfolio with an average size loan of CL 50,000. However, before 1974, CDB had
only a limited impact on the economy of Cyprus, and then only in the industrial
and tourism sectors. The table below shows the evolution of CDB's share in
these sectors since 1972:
CDB Financing of Industry and Tourism

1973              6,300                   224             4
1974              3,100                   439            14
1975                200                    18             9
Since 1972, when the first Bank loan to CDB was made, CDB's disbursements
have remained below 10% of total investments in these sectors, except in 1974
when, as a result of hesitancy by other sources of finance to provide funds,
and a general drop in investment following the hostilities, CDB financed
approximately 14% of total investment in both industry and tourism. The
Bank loan helped to create nearly 800 jobs, at an average cost per job of
approximately CL 10,000. Total investment in enterprises financed with
assistance of Bank funds made available by CDB was CL 8 million (US$20
million).



- 14 -
0+.i4   The factors which inhibited a more dynamic approach by CDB were
(i? competition from commercial banks, providing short-term loans for long-
term financing (para. 2.18); (ii) staff constraints, particularly after 1974
when the Board did not wish to appoint more staff as long as CDB's future was
not firmly decided; and (iii) a rather passive stance on seeking out and
promoting new investment opportunities.
4.05      With Government backing, and under new management which is promo-
tion minded, CDB is expected to play a more important role in the reconstruc-
tion of the Cyprus economy (Chapter VI).
D. CDB's First IBRD Loan
4.06        By the end of 1975, CDB had committed essentially all of the $3
million provided under the first 1972 IBRD loan (Loan 830-CY). An evaluation
has been made in Annex 9 of the application of the funds provided by the Bank
to CDB, and to ascertain how the objectives set for CDB under Loan 830-CY were
fulfilled. However, due to the hostilities, its associated losses, and the
fact that 47% of CDB portfolio could not be supervised since July 1974, the
evaluation, as given in Annex 9, is of necessity somewhat limited.
4.07       In summary, the IBRD loan of $3 million was used to provide part of
-he foreign exchange component of 17 projects, of which 13 in manufacturing,
;lnd 4 hotels. Light of the 17 projects are now in north Cyprus; two of the
projects had Turkish-Cypriot sponsors.  Of the 13 manufacturing projects, 4
w'ere for exports and 4 for import substitution, while a further 4 served both
exflorts and provided import substitution; one project was in the service
s'tor.  The total cost of these projects was $20.6 million, of which CDB
provided 19% of the total financing required. CDB provided 28% of the for-
eign exchange required, and the IBRD loan in turn provided CDB with 81% of
the foreign exchange required for that purpose. The projects for which Bank
fuinds were provided through CDB created 767 jobs, at an average cost of
S27,000 per job. This relatively high figure is due to CDB's participation in
a number of capital-intensive projects, including a large luxury hotel, and a
number of more sophisticated industries (PVC pipes, wood and paper products,
soap; see Annex 9, Table 1 and 2).

currencv 1/. The cost of CDB's borrowed resources has been rising since 1973
and reached 7.0%, in 1975.  The hulk of Local currency resources has been pro-
vided hy the Government in the form of loans he Govern-
ment at 7-1/2'N, Dartly tused to repay the then high short-term commitments.
During the fall of 1975, CDB received a government loan of CL 1 million at
5-1/2% for 12 years. To finance imports, C])B until 1972 used to make Loans
in local currencv, since it had no resources in foreign currency. These loans
in turn were converted into foreign exchange at the Central Bank. Since 1972,
however, CD)B has financed imports directly from its own resources in foreign
exchange, which have been provided essentially from bilateral sources and the
Bank. As of December 31, 1975, CDB's outstanding foreign borrowings of CL 1.4
million consisted of: CL 0.3 million from KfW, CL 0.1 miLlion from the Export
Credit Guarantee Department of the U.K., and CL 1.0 million from IBRD. In ad-
dition, CDB obtained a US$1 million line of credit from the U.S. Export-Import
Bank which it could not use due to limited procurements in the U.S.  All for-
eign exchange resources have been fully committed. As of December 31, 1975,
total resources available for commitment amounted to CL 35,000, all of them
in local currency.
5.02      CDB had to undertake part of the foreign exchange risk on its for-
eign currency borrowings. As a result, it has suffered some exchange losses
(mainlv on borrowings from KftJ: CL 29.000). The Government has agreed that
the foreign exchange risk on CDB's future foreign borrowings, including the
proposed second Bank loan will be borne by the Government (para. 2.21).
B. Loan Portfolio in Southern Cyprus
5.03      As of July 15, 1974, the CDB portfolio in southern Cyprus totalled
CL 2.7 miLlion or 53% of CDB's total portfolio. It has been badly affected by
the 1974 events, but also suffered from insufficiently close supervision.
Loans affected by arrears were 71% of the south Cyprus portfolio as of September
1975, and the arrears amounted to CL 435,000. In November 1975, Cl)B undertook
a thorough and detailed supervision of all its loans in arrears, including an
assessment of the security on these loans. As a result, by the end of 1975,
loans affected by arrears as a percentage of the southern Cyprus portfolio de-
creased to 54%. This 54% of the portfolio falls into two main categories.
First, some enterprises have faced temporary difficulties folLowing the 1974
events, but have provided CDB with adequate security and have good prospects
of recovery; they present little risk for CDB. For these, CDB has negotiated
a rescheduling of their debt; about 30% of the free area port-folio has thus
been rescheduled and this action appears justified. For the baLance (24% of
1/ Equity CL 1.2 miLlion; loans from Government CL 2.7 million; debentures
CL 2.0 million; IBRD CL 1.1 miLlion; DfW Cl. 0.5 million; UK CL 0.3 miL-
lion; Eximban Cl. 0.4 miLlion (not used).



- 16 -
tihe portfolio), and taking account of the security which in many cases is very
good, CDB has made provision of CL 111,000 on its 1975 accounts to cover any
foreseeable risk on this portion, which appears adequate.  With this coverage,
and the more active supervision CDB intends to, and can carry out on its souttern
Cyprus portfolio, CDB's financial situation is sound.
5.04      By December 31, 1975, the arrears position had thus been substantial-
ly decreased; it is however open to further improvement. The situation is
under control, but the future soundness of CDB's portfolio depends to a large
extent on CDB's ability to collect due maturities and not merely to reschedule
loans or to rely on the value of its security. If CDB supervises its portfolio
closely, as it should be able to do following the proposed increase in staff,
the arrears could be reduced to much lower levels within a couple of years.
C. Loan Portfolio in Northern Cyprus
5.05       CDB's loan portfolio in northern Cyprus amounted at the end of 1975
to CL 2.5 million (47% of the total loan portfolio outstanding), of which CL
815,000 represented current (1975) and past-due maturities (1974) of principal.
Interest due on the northern portfolio at the end of 1975 amounted to CL
332,000. All loans to projects in northern Cyprus are de facto delinquent
since July 1974. Since July 1974, it has not been possible for CDB to assess
the actual situation of these enterprises; however, it is reported that
virtually all have stopped operations. For practical purposes, CDB considers
this part of the portfolio as lost until a financial settlement between the
two communities takes place. The Government has agreed to guarantee CDB
repayment of principal., and payments of interest due on this portfolio (para
3.14); to CDB, this part of its portfolio is therefore riskless and CDB has
made no provisions for it.
D. Equity Portfolio
5.06      A list of the equity portfolio is given in Annex 12.  It remained un-
changed through 1975, with six equity investments amounting to CL 177,200 (15%
of CDB's equity). Two of the six participations (CL 55,000) are located in the
north.
5.07      The four participations in the south perform to the satisfaction
of CDB. One is paying dividends, while the others are in relatively new proj-
ects, and are expected to start payments in 1978. By 1978, CDB expects a re-
turn of 8% p.a. on its equity investments in south Cyprus.
E. Profitability and Financial Position
5.08       CDB's summarized income statements and balance sheets for 1973-1975
are given in Annexes 13 and 14. As noted earlier, in the 1975 statements tihe



- 17 -
loan and equity portfolios in north Cyprus wilL be subject to payments by the
Government eqtuivalent to (i) principal and interest due on loans, and (ii) the
total of the equity invested in the north (para 3.14). CD)B's auditors are
Metaxas, Christofides, Loizides & Co., a Cyprus auditing firm associated with
Touche Ross & Co. Over the past years, auditing standards applied by this firm
have been satisfactory. ClDB's auditors approved CHB accounts for 1975. The
only qualification is on CI)B's northern portfolio pending payments by the Gov-
ernment as mentioned above.
5.09      Interest due on loans for 1975 amounted to CL 471,000, of which
53% interest on loans for projects in the south. Interest actually received
was only CL 50,000, or 21% of total interest due on loans in the south (see
also para. 5.03). Financial expenses as a percentage of total assets did not
increase substantially as compared with previous years, and amounted to 5.5%
for 1975, (4.9% and 4.5% in 1974 and 1973, respectively). The average interest
paid by CDB on its borrowed funds was 7.0% in 1975, up from 6.7% in 1974, and
6.2% in 1973. CDB's interest spread between its loans and borrowings was 2.2%
in 1975 and remained sufficient to generate profits (see ratios in Annex 21).
With administrative expenses at a reasonable level, CD)B's profit before tax and
provisions in 1975 was CL 125,900. The large provision made for potential
losses on the southern portfolio of CL 111,000 (para. 5.03), and the provision
for exchange risk of CL 10,800, has however absorbed almost all of this poten-
tial profit. This had to be expected as the price CDB had to pay to put its
finances on a sound basis.
5.10      With the provisions set aside against losses on the southern port-
folio, and the guarantee of grants from the government on the northern port-
folio, CDB as of end-1975 presented a balanced financial situation. The
growth of total assets slowed down in 1975, reflecting the situation in Cyprus
since July 1974. The current ratio was 3.1 for 1975 (0.7 for 1974); the large
improvement in the 1975 ratio is due to the elimination of maturities and in-
terest (due and past-due) on the northern area portfolio from 1975's figures,
as payment of these will now be undertaken by the Government. CDlB's long-term
debt/equity ratio remained comfortable at 4:1, well within the limit of 5:1
agreed witlh CDB for the first Bank loan.
VI. PROSPECTS
A. The Environment
6.01       The 1974 events were followed by a relatively stable situation,
which has enabled the business community in the south to regain some con-
fidence in the economic prospects.  Wlith Governmelnt assistance, new proj-
ects are being undertaken, including the estabLishment or enlargement of



- 18 -
industrial estates in Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol and Plaphos, and the estab-
lishment of a free trade zone in Larnaca; infrastructure projects are being
planned or are in the process of execution; and, finalLy, low interest govern-
ment loans are being made available through a number of schemes under the EEAP
(para 2.06). All these plans and programs, coupled with the growing feeling
that the status quo may last for some time, appear to provide the stimulus for
resumed economic growth.
6.02      Cyprus has relatively low labor costs, and only a mild rate of in-
flation (just under 5% in 1975). With its skilled and well-educated popula-
tion, surplus labor, and government incentives, its exports should continue
to expand, particularly in consumer goods such as clothing, shoes, tobacco
and paper products, but also in certain products where proximity to the oil-
rich nations gives a natural freight advantage, for example, cement, assembly
and part-manufacture of special-purpose trucks and buses, and furniture
(Annex 3).
6.03      A further increase in agricultural production, manufactured goods
output, and a reactivation of the tourist industry are foreseen. CDB is not
willing to consider agricultural projects (as opposed to agro-industrial
projects) at this time due to its lack of knowledge - at all levels - in this
field. However, there are substantial possibilities for assisting in the
preparation, appraisal and financing of projects in the tourism and industrial
sectors.
B. CDB Business Projections
b.04      ''rojections for CDB's business volume for 1976, and in part for
1977, are based on major projects now under study and/or being actively pro-
moted by CDB, augmented by an estimate of routine business covering small
loans. Projections for the period 1978 - 1980 are based on an average increase
in loan volume of 15% per year for industrial projects, 40% per year for tour-
ism projects (hotels), and 10% for other projects. These percentages are
based on CDB's evaluation of the situation, as well as on the governmental
medium term economic development plans. These estimates, and in particular
the tourism project projections, are necessarily subject to review in case of
drastic changes in the economic or political climate of the island.
6.05      CDB's business projections for the period 1976 - 1979, are given in
Annex 15, and are summarized below:

6.06      The 1976 and 1977 investment projects under consideration are shown
in Annex 15.  The mission has reviewed major projects to determine the chance
that they might be realized, and this review has been supplemented by discus-
sions with Government officials, trade organizations, industrialists, hoteliers
and banks. These projections represent a realistic target.
6.07      In addition to the normal operations of CDB, mainly concerned with
industry and tourism, and supplemented by a small number of projects in the
agro-industrial sector, further business may develop through a scheme to as-
sist small scale industries (SSI). CDB and the Government are preparing a
detailed study which constitutes a basis for the SSI component in the proposed
loan, as described in the following.
C. Small Scale Industries (SSI)
6.08      General.  Present circumstances in Cyprus appear particularly suit-
able for the promotion of small scale industries. Not only is there in
Cyprus a tradition of operating in small, often family-controlled enterprises
employing less than 10 people (about 90% of existing manufacturing enter-
prises), but, since the 1974 events, many small-scale entrepreneurs and workers
who were displaced lost their businesses and jobs and are now eager to resume
their activities in south Cyprus. The need for adequate financing facilities
seems to be very high as indicated by the large number of applications which
the two ministries most involved with SSI (Labour and Commerce and Industry)



- 20 -
have received in the recent past. Financing, however, is not normally readily
available to small scale enterprises. Commercial banks are neither equipped,
nor inclined, to get involved on a large scale in financing operations which,
by conservative commercial banking criteria, might be relatively risky and
administratively costly. The Government has lacked, so far, a credit agency
with the requisite capability and facilities to establish an adequate program
of assistance to SSI. The Government has concluded, therefore, that CDB is
the only institution with the capability of providing useful and constructive
assistance to SSI, in close cooperation with the Government.
6.09      Having arrived at this conclusion, the Government requested the
Bank to allow a portion of the proposed loan to CDB to be used for the finan-
cing of SSI. The request was accompanied by a proposal (the SSI Scheme) for
such financing, jointly prepared by CDB and the Government, which was re-
viewed and discussed during negotiations for the proposed loan. This pro-
posal, whose main features are given in Annex 11, is based on a tentative
definition of SSI as enterprises found primarily in the manufacturing sector,
employing up to 10 persons and involving loans between CL 500 and CL
10,000 (i.e. higher than special assistance loans available to the refugees
under the Emergency Scheme and lower than loans normally granted by commer-
cial banks or CDB). The proposal outlines specific institutional arrange-
ments for CDB, such as the employment of three additional professional staff,
and a broadly defined assistance package which will draw upon Government's
staff and services both to screen SSI loan applications before they reach CDB
and to provide the SSI enterprises with technical assistance to help them plan
their projects, organize their work, purchase their raw materials and sell
their products. The SSI Scheme, as prepared by the Government and CDB also
provides for (i) soft-term financial assistance from the Government, in equal amaount
with the bank, (ii) Government guarantees for CDB on 75% of its SSI loans
outstanding, and (iii) the assurance that CDB will receive additional finan-
cial support, if needed, to cover, on a break-even basis, all administrative
expenses and reasonable provisions on its SSI program. The CDB proposal
envisages simplified procedures for appraisal, procurement, disbursement and
supervision of SSI loans; these are detailed in Annex 11.
6.10      The proposed organizational and financial measures seem sufficient-
ly sound to warrant Banlc support.  However, some aspects of the SSI Scheme
need further evaluation and exploration,   especially with regard to the fol-
lowing:
(a) Definition of SSI Enterprises under the Scheme. The broad
definition (ten people or less employed - loans within the
CL 500 - 10,000 range) has not yet been corroborated by a de-
tailed assessment of the needs and priorities of SSI sub-groups
in Cyprus. Since there are real human and financial con-
straints both within CDB and cooperating Government services,
the Scheme has to be tailored to what is realistically feas-
ible. Therefore, while using the proposed definition as an
apparently reasonable starting point, the Bank has reserved



- 21 -
its position regarding the definition of SSI to be used
under the proposed loan until the Government and CDB have
completed, on the basis of existing data, and taking into
account staff and resource constraints in both quarters,
their assessment of the type and range of enterprises and
subloans that should be given priority for financing under
the SSI scheme. Labor intensity would be among the criteria
to be used to define these priorities. Agreement by the
Bank on the definition of the SSI target enterprises under
the Scheme is a condition of disbursement of the proposed
loan.
(b)  Organization.  While the organizational scheme presented by CDB
and the Government at negotiations seems workable, details of it
may have to be modified depending on the agreed definition of SSI
under the Scheme. It was therefore agreed that the SSI organiza-
tion plan would have been reviewed and accepted by the Bank, and
that the organization would be operational, as a condition of
disbursement of the SSI portion of the proposed loan.
(c)  Resource Requirements.  It is difficult to estimate what the total
resource requirements, manageable under the SSI Scheme, will be.
Rough estimates by the Government and CDB suggest that CDB nay be
able to make loans of about $4 million to finance SSI projects over
the next 2 to 3 years. It is conceivable that resources up to $4
million, could be committed by CDB over this period. Ilowever, the
SSI Scheme is, at this stage, too experimental in nature for re-
sources of this magnitude to be firmly committed to it. Further
caution is called for, since there is a risk that CDB may get in-
volved to such a degree that the Scheme may over-tax CDB's staff-
ing and management resources. Even though CDB has some familiar-
ity with SSI projects, the organizational set-up required within
and outside CDB is untested, and it is too early to foresee how
CDB will react to a substantial involvement in this field.
6.11      A two-step approach is therefore recommended.  First, subject to a
satisfactory review of the Scheme, including the definition of the scope and
range of SSI subloans (as a condition of disbursement for the proposed loan),
the Bank would lend $0.75 million to CDB for SSI financing. This amount, to-
gether with the financing of $5.25 million identified for CDB's normal opera-
tions (para. 6.13), would justify the recommendation for a loan of $6 million.
If, however, in the course of project implementation, the Bank is satisfied
with the progress of the SSI Scheme and additional funds are needed for SSI,
say, by mid-1977, CDB would be authorized by the Bank to use an additional
amount of up to $0.75 million to bring the total of funds available to SSI
under the proposed loan to $1.5 million. CDB would have to do this at the
expense of Bank funds available for CDB's normal business, i.e. reducing
this portion of the proposed loan from $5.25 million to $4.5 million.



- 2 2 -
The main consequence would be a shorter commitment period than the approxi-
mately 2-1/2 years now envisaged for this main portion of the Bank loan; it
is unlikely, however, that the $4.5 million would be committed in less than
2 years. Under the negotiated agreement, the Government and the Bank would
lend equal amounts for SSI each under basically similar terms (i.e. repayments
period would be up to 10 years). However, while the Bank would lend its por-
tion (50%) to CDB at the Bank's current lending rate of interest, the Govern-
ment loans would be at no contractual cost to CDB. To compensate the Govern-
ment for this subsidy, CDB would agree to return any profit (after expenses
and reasonable provisions) it may generate under the SSI Scheme to the Govern-
ment. CDB's lending rate for loans under the SSI Scheme would be its normal
9% p.a.  The Government proposal to match Bank funds by an equal amount for
each SSI loan would ensure that the allocation of Bank funds would be limited
to import financing since the data available (and which will be reviewed by
the Bank together with the details of the Scheme) strongly suggest that at
least 60% of SSI loans granted would be for the purchase of imported goods
(machinery and other equipment). Disbursements under the Bank loan for the
SSI Scheme will be made against certificates of expenditure provided by CDB
(Annex 11, para 15). Supporting documentation, such as purchase invoices,
will not be submitted for review by the Bank, but will be retained by CDB and
be available for inspection by the Bank during supervision missions.
D. Resource Requirements 1/
6.12       To meet its future commitments, CDB at the beginning of 1976 had no
resources other than CL 35,000 in local currency funds in the form of Govern-
ment loans and self-generated funds; it had exhausted all its resources in
foreign exchange. CDB is anxious to mobilize resources abroad at reasonable
terms.  Given its current interest rate policy and, more importantly, the un-
certainty of the Cyprus political situation, CDB does not expect in the short
run to be able to attract loans from the international capital markets. How-
ever, it has received positive indications fom the Government of Germany that KfW is
prepared to consider a second loan to CDB of DM 10 million (about $4 million) for 30
years, including 10 years of grace, at an interest rate to CDB of 6% p.a. 2/
It is expected that this loan will be approved by the middle of 1976 to cover
part of CDB's commitments over the period 1976-1978. The availability of
1/ In this section, resource requirements are based on CDB's projected com-
mitments only for its normal DFC operations, i.e. excluding SSI operations
which have been reviewed in paras 6.08-6.11.
2/ The KfW loan would bear interest at a rate of 6% p.a. of which 4% p.a.
would be retained by CDB for special development purposes agreed between
Kfr. and CDB, such as financing SSI or promotional activities. For prac-
tic~al purposes these funds will be considered as part of CDB's resources
as a grant. They have been accounted for as "KfW interest fund" in An-
nexus 18-20.



- 23 -
funds on such terms is essential to ensure CDB's profitability and, should the
KfW loan not be concluded shortly, as expected, before presentation of the
proposed Bank loan to the Executive Directors, it will be a condition of ef-
fectiveness that CDB would have secured approximately $4 million of additional
resources on comparable terms and conditions. The Government has agreed to
protect CDB fully against the foreign exchange risk on its foreign resources
(para. 2.21).
6.13      With projected commitment needs, excluding those relevant to the SSI
Scheme, to finance imports estimated at CL 3.7 million over the
period, 1976-78 (Annex 16), CDB will have a foreign exchange resource gap,
after approval of the loan from KfW, of CL 2.1 million ($5.25 million). 1/ It
has thus asked the Bank to cover commitments in foreign currency for up to
$5.25 million. (The program envisaged for the SSI scheme (para 6.10) will
call for additional foreign exchange resources which are estimated initially
at $0.75 million.) To cover its resource needs in local currency, CDB is
relying essentially on Government funds. Pending approvals of the proposed
IBRD and KfW second loans, CDB has no resources in foreign exchange. To
bridge part of CDB's foreign exchange gap since the beginning of 1976, the
Bank loan will provide retroactive financing for the 90-day period before loan
signing up to $500,000.
6.14      For the longer run, CDB expects that the evolution of the political
and economic situation in Cyprus will permit a liberalization of interest rate
policy and will allay any apprehensions that potential foreign lenders may
have now.  CDB hopes in about two years' time to be able to start diversifying
its foreign exchange resources in order to rely less exclusively than at pre-
sent on concessionary funds. In its projections (Annexes 19 and 20), CDB has
provided for a gradual increase of such resources, starting in 1979; as of
now, however, these resources are unidentified. The projections also assume
a continuation of financial assistance from IBRD and KfW after 1978.
E. Profitability
6.15      CDB's projected Profit and Loss Statements for the year 1976-80 are
shown in Annex 18. Annex 17 spells out the assumption made in their prepara-
tion. (These Annexes do not include data on the SSI Scheme which is basically
a non profit operation). SSI forecasts are detailed in Annex 11. Thanks to
an increase in low-cost resources from the Government, CDB expects to be able
to maintain over the next five years a sufficient average spread between lend-
ing and borrowing interest rates (2.1% in 1976, 2.5% in 1977, 2.8% in 1980).
1/   Though the Cyprus pound has remained fully convertible, it is against
normal CDB policy to have recourse to conversion of its local currency
resources; this policy has been reinforced in the light of Cyprus'
balance of payments difficulties since 1974.



- 24 -
However, profits before tax will increase slightLy from Cl. 36,300 to CL 101,800
frorn 1976 to 1980 (4.97 to 11.0% of average net worth). Net profits after tax
will grow from about 3% to 6% of net worth during the period 1976-80. Hence
profitability as foreseen is acceptable for a fully Government-owned DFC.
6.16      The projections provide adequately for CD)B's staff and administra-
tion expenses, which will grow rapidly in 1976 after hiring new staff. tNever-
theless, projected administrative expenses remain quite moderate over the
period 1976-1980 (below 1.5% of average total assets). Following the reassess-
ment of CDB's portfolio at the end of 1975, the provisions for doubtful loans
at 2% of new loan disbursements seem sufficient over the projected period; ac-
cumulated provisions will remain at about 5% of total portfolio.
F. Financial Projections
6.17      CDB's projected Balance Sheets and Source and Application of Funds
for the year 1976-80 are presented in Annexes 19 and 20. They reflect the
projected disbursements shown in Annex 16. Major indicators and ratios are
summarized in Annex 21.
6.18      Overall, these projections show a sound financial situation over
the period. The liberal terms of the KfW loan, and the Government guarantee
on the northern portfolio, should enable CDB to improve its debt service
coverage considerably from a narrow 1.0:1 in 1977 to a comfortable level of
about 1.4:1 in 1980. CDB does not foresee any liquidity problem over the
next five years (Annex 20). Consequently, the projections have assumed some
prepayment of Government loans, which were basically a stop-gap measure.
6.19      The financial reorganization currently underway will allow CDB to
maintain a proper capital structure in the medium term. The debt/equity
limit of 5:1 agreed with the Bank for the first loan remains a prudent one
for the proposed loan; even more so if CDB were to make use of the Government
guarantees under the EEAP (para 2.06). The projections, through 1978, indi-
cate that CDB does not foresee any excess over the 5:1 debt/equity limit (3.6,
3.9 and 4.1 are projected for 1976, 1977 and 1978 respectively). In 1979
and 1980, when the limit would be nearly reached, two share capital increases
would permit CDB to maintain the limit.
VII. THE LOAN
A. Objectives and Strategy
7.01      The central purpose of the proposed Bank loan is assistance to
Cyprus at a time when its economy has suffered a severe setback. Recovery and



- 25 -
reconstruction of the economy through a special effort to assist the manufac-
turing, tourism sectors and SSI are an essential part of the Government's
Economic Plan, which pay special attention to reducing unemployment and in-
creasing exports. The Government has agreed to rehabilitate CDB which, as a
result of the 1974 events, was in a very weak financial situation. In turn,
it has requested the Bank and KfW to continue to assist CDB with new loans.
7.02      The proposed loan of $6 million, which would provide about 40% of
CDB's total resources, and about 60% of its foreign exchange requirements,
approximately over the next 30 months, has three main objectives. Firstly,
it will provide funds to CDB to finance medium-sized industrial and tourism
projects in accordance with its Policy Statement (Annex 6). This is CDB's
traditional business, at which it vwas quite successful until the 1974 events.
The gradual revival of investments in Cyprus should permit CDB to use up to
$5.25 million in Bank funds to finance about 50 projects. This amount, in
conjunction with other funds, will help to finance projects with a total
value of $35 million which should create some 1,250 jobs, and have a substan-
tial impact on Cyprus exports since the majority of sub-loans are expected to
be to export industries in the shoe, garment, and small manufacturing, and to
the tourism sector. Secondly, it will provide, for the first time in Cyprus,
financing and appraisal capabilities to SSI which in the current economic
situation in Cyprus are in critical need of such assistance. The portion of
the Bank loan which will finance SSI is expected to have significant effects
on employment for projects which are basically labor intensive.  Thirdly,
while the ownership structure of CDB is being resolved, the major objective of
CDB to assist the private sector industry is maintained. The focus over the
coming years will be on building up a strong institution. The Bank will,
through this loan, remain closely associated with CDB and be able to contri-
bute, as a result of this association, to common institution building goals.
B. Evaluation
7.03      There are risks.  There is a political risk, since Cyprus remains
divided and the form of an eventual political settlement is presently unknown.
Unless hostilities are renewed, it is likely that both south and north would
need to undertake important investment programs in manufacturing and tourism,
including small scale industries. The rate at which these investments will
take place depends to a large extent on the confidence of investors in the
political future. Thus, CDB's projections, although the best estimates
possible at this time for south Cyprus, have to be looked at with prudence.
7.04      Another risk, inherent to CDB itself, is its capability to process
a relatively large number of projects both under the SSI Scheme and for tra-
ditional business, within its staff constraints. In this respect, the Bank



- 26 -
will keep a close watch over CDB's volume and quality of work.  This con-
straint is perhaps the main challenge facing CDB for the next couple of
years. The Bank is prepared to provide all the training and assistance it
can usefully give CDB.
C. Recommendations
7.05      A Bank loan to CDB of US$6 million equivalent is recommended to fi-
nance part of the import component of industrial and tourism subprojects fi-
nanced by CDB over the period 1976-78. The loan includes two components;
Part A, to finance up to US$5.25 million for CDB normal DFC operations; and
Part B, to finance US$0.75 million (which may later be increased to US$1.5
million if the Bank and CDB agree to reduce the amount available for normal
operations) for the financing of small scale industries (SSI).
7.06      The Bank loan would cover about 60% of CDB's foreign exchange
commitments over a period of about two and a half years, June 1976 through
December 1978. In line with the Bank's and CDB's experience with the type of
subprojects included under the loan, subloans should be repaid over a maximum
period of 15 years, with terms expected to range between 5 and 12 years for
medium-size manufacturing normal DFC projects with an average life of about 8
years. The terms of tourism subloans would range between 10 and 15 years.
Grace periods of 1-4 years (the longer ones usually for tourism projects)
would normally apply. SSI sub-loans would normally be repaid over a period of
10 years; their terms are expected to have an average life of about 6 years.
The terms and conditions of the proposed loan should be those normally applied
to loans to development finance companies, including the standard commitment
charge. Given CDB's professional standards and the general increase of import
prices over the past three years, the free limit under Part A of the loan
should be set at $200,000; under the previous Bank loan it was $100,000. The
proposed free limit would enable the Bank to review about 25% of the number of
subprojects financed under Part A of the proposed loan. No aggregate free
limit is considered necessary.
7.07      Because of legal delays, the transfer of full ownership of CDB's
shares to the Government and the subsequent appointment of a new Board of
Directors along the lines of para. 3.04, and the issuance of the Government
guarantee on CDB's portfolio (para. 3.14) could not be completed before pre-
sentation of the loan to the Executive Directors. Implementation of these
actions is therefore conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
7.08      As under the first Bank loan to CDB the proceeds of the proposed
loan for CDB's normal DFC subloans will be restricted to the financing of:



- 27 -
(a)  100% of the CIF cost of imported equipment;
(b) 80% of the cost of imported equipment purchased in
Cyprus;
(c) 45% of the cost of civil works construction, which is
estimated to be its import component.
For SSI subloans, the Bank disbursements will be made against certificates
of expenditures provided by CDB (Annex 11, para 15). The Bank will disburse
fifty percent of CDB's disbursements for SSI subloans under the Scheme.
7.09      Understandings with CDB have been reached during negotiations on the
following points:
(a) CDB will hire five additional professional staff in 1976
for its normal operations and three more for its SSI opera-
tions (para. 6.09). It will hire additional staff as neces-
sary to cope with its operations, including monitoring the
assistance to SSI (para 3.11).
(b) CDB will maintain a debt/equity ratio of 5:1 (para 6.19).
(c) For normal DFC sub-projects for which CDB financing exceeds
$200,000, CDB will calculate the economic rate of return
and use this calculation in its investment decisions as
mentioned in para 3.07.
7.10      Should the proposed KfW loan described in para 6.12 not be con-
cluded before presentation of the proposed Bank loan to the Executive Di-
rectors, it will be a condition of effectiveness that CDB would have secured
approximately $4 million of additional resources on comparable terms and con-
ditions.
7.11      As mentioned in paras 6.08-6.11, the financing of SSI enterprises
under the proposed loan is subject to the Bank's approval of the details of
the SSI Scheme and of the implementation of this Scheme; such approval is a
condition of disbursement for the loan.

ANNEX 6
CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK LIMITED
STATEMENT OF POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
(January 28, 1976)
The Cyprus Development Bank Limited is a multi-purpose DFC which, though
owned by the Government, is established and operates in the private
sector as an autonomous public company.
A. OBJECTIVES OF THE BANK
1.  The Bank shall develop, encourage and stimulate productive enter-
prises in Cyprus whose projects it considers viable and from the
economic point of view desirable, with particular emphasis on,
but not limited to, the fields of manufacturing and industrial
processing, small-scale industries, tourism, agro-industries and
mining.
2.  In accordance with the above-mentioned policy, it shall:
i.    Assist and take the initiative in the creation, expansion
and modernization of such productive enterprises in the
private sector by providing financing in the form of medium.-
or long-terr: loans and/or in the form of share participation,
and by guaranteeing loans and obligations.
ii.   Develop, stimulate and expand the capital market in Cyprus
(share and security markets) by sponsoring and underwriting
and distributing the issues or conversion of shares and
other securities and facilitating the transfer of shares
and securities and by revolving its own investments as
rapidly as they mature and/or appears prudent.
iii. Encourage, sponsor and facilitate participation of private
and public, domestic and foreign capital, technical and
managerial skills in the development of the Cyprus economy
through joint ventures and other means.
iv.   Furnish economic, technical, managerial and organizational
advice to such productive enterprises and assist in obtaining
such advice from other sources.



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 6
To achieve its objectives, the Bank shall adhere to the following broad
policies:
B. OPERATIONAL PCLICIES
1. Eligibility
i.    The Bank is empowered to assist productive enterprises
engaged in industry and agro-industries, tourism and mining
and related activities.
ii.   Financing is restricted to enterprises operating in the
private sector. The participation of the Government or seni-
government institutions in the share capital of such enter-
prises will not necessarily preclude assistance from being
extended to them, provided the said enterprise retains its
operational independence and effectively controls its
activities.
iii.  Eligible for financial assistance are new as well as existing
enterprises.
iv.   Financing is provided for projects which are expected to make
a quantifiable contribution to the development and further
growth of Cyprus and its people. The economic viability of
the project from a national point of view is the basic
criterion for CDB assistance.
2. Investment Policy
i     The Bank shall pursue a liberal lending policy but will
concentrate on providing capital for the financing of fixed
assets and working capital of a permanent nature.
ii.   The Bank shall provide its capital assistance only to those
productive projects which mieet its criteria of technical,
managerial, organizational, commercial, financial and econo-
mic viability in the context of the development objectives
of Cyprus. These latter criteria relate to: (a) the
financial internal rate of return of a project, and (b) its

ANNEX 9
CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK LIMITED
IBRD Loan 830-CY to CDB
Introduction
Loan 830-CY, amounting to US$ 3 million, was approved by the Board
on June 13, 1972, signed on June 19, 1972, and became effective on September 11,
1972. The interest was 7-1/4%, the free limit was $100,000, with an aggregate
free limit of $750,000.
The terminal date for the submission of sub-projects was extended
to September 30, 1975, from the original date of June 30, 1974. The closing
date for disbursement is June 30, 1976.
On November 27, 1975, an amount of $84,236 of the loan was cancelled.
Per February 1, 1975, a total of $ 12, 242 had not yet been disbursed.
Policies and procedures of CDB, as well as ownership details, are
given in Chapter III of the Appraisal Report.
Objectives of the Bank Loan
CDB was established as a development bank in 1965 for the purpose of
providing medium- and long-term financing, as well as equity capital, to small
and medium-sized Cypriot firms. Commercial banks in Cyprus do not provide
such financing, but specialize in short-term financing with frequent roll-over
of loans.
In making the loan, the Bank's objectives were (i) to support the
only bank making medium- and long-term loans, (ii) encourage the development
of industries (including export-oriented industries) as well as of tourism
(hotels), and (iii) in line with the Bank's general policies, assist in
building an institution which would apply proper financial economic criteria
to project appraisals and reach such a standing in the financial community
that it would be able to attract other outside sources of funds in due course.
Attainment of Objectives
In 1974, during the time that the Bank loan 830-CY was effective,
a major upheaval in the political and economic life of Cyprus took place,
as detailed in the Appraisal Report. The performance of CDB must be judged
against these realities. In the following the three main objectives as
outlined above are discussed below.
i. Medium- and Long-Term Loans
As discussed in para.  4.03    of the Appraisal Report,
CDB's role in the economic development of Cyprus has been very
modest during the first two years of the Bank loan's effectiveness,
amounting to 7.8% and 3.5% of total investments in tourism in
1972 and 1973 respectively, and to 6.0% and 5.3% of investments
in industry in the same years. In 1974, due to a hesitancy by
the commercial banks to commit funds after July, CDB gained a
greater share of total investments, with 14.2% in tourism and 13.9%
in industry.



ANNEX g
(Page 2 of 3)
ii. Encouragement of Industry and Tourism
The proceeds of the Bank loan were used in 17 projects,
with a total cost of $20.6 million. Of the total cost (foreign
exchange and local cost), CDB financed $3.9 million (19%). The
foreign exchange cost of the 17 projects was $12.6 million, of
which CDB financed $3.6 million (38%); of this $3.6 million,
IBRD funds provided $2.9 million (81%).
The total number of jobs created by the 17 projects was
767, at an average cost of $26,835. Only part of the projects
financed are in operation, and most of them not yet at optimum
capacity; no information is available on 8 of the 17 projects now
in northern Cyprus. The attached Tables 1 and 2 summarize available
information on the 17 projects. Supplementary information is provided
in the Appraisal Report.
iii. Institution Building
CDB has now a well-qualified and experienced staff, which
is often consulted by commercial banks and the Government to advise
on the feasibility of projects. The quality of appraisal work is
good. A new management has been appointed on February 1, 1976,
following the resignation of the previous General Manager who left
Cyprus.
As CDB's future was uncertain until recently, when the
Government stepped in, the CDB Board had refused expansion of the
staff in the past. Such an expansion is now urgently needed, and
has been agreed to by the Board and the Government. The Bank will
be called upon to provide some training facilities (EDI courses)
for the new staff, and further general support and technical assistance.
Evaluation
CDB has benefited from its association with the Bank; this view is
shared by its management and Board, who clearly indicated that their application
for a second Bank loan is partly inspired by the wish to continue this association.
The main benefits derived by CDB are the improvement in appraisal techniques, as
a result of training and guidance received by CDB staff from Bank reviews of
sub-projects, through contacts with supervision missions and through EDI training
courses. In addition, CDB has been able to expand its business,thanks to Bank
financing under the first loan, and has made a useful contribution to the economic
development of Cyprus as described above.
However, certain deficiencies in CDB's operations and procedures
still exist:
In the first place, the supervision - including the
collection of principal and interest payments - of its loan
portfolio has been slack, resulting in substantial arrears in
payments by CDB's borrowers. Although CDB was badly affected



ANNEX 9
(Page 3 of 3)
by the 1974 events resulting in the loss of its northern
portfolio, staff constraints imposed by the Board, and a
change in management, CDB showed a certain slackness in
portfolio supervision even prior to 1974; the problem appears
thus to be structural rather than temporary. The Bank will
place greater emphasis on supervision in the future; CDB has
already agreed to provide sufficient manpower for, and to pay more
attention to supervision.
Secondly, even though CDB's portfolio was well
diversified, the projects financed had a high average cost
per job created. With a high unemployment rate since 1974,
a shift to maximizing employment with /available funds is warranted.
The Bank, through its support for the proposed SSI project,
is helping CDB to focus on this problem.
A third point is the attention CDB pays to the economic
benefits derived from the projects it finances. So far CDB,
mainly due to staff constraints, has not computed the economic
rate of return for its projects; however, under the terms of
the proposed second Bank loan, economic rate of return calcula-
tions will become mandatory for all projects above the free
limit.
Finally, and as already indicated in para. 3.11 of
the main report, CDB's staff is too small to cope with the existing
workload, let alone the projected workload resulting from the
foreseen expansion of operations; an expansion of staff is
urgently required.

Small Scale Industry (SSI)
Proposed Scheme
I.   Economic Background
A.   Country Data
1.        Small Scale Industries(SSI) account for about 90% of total establish-
ments engaged in manufacturing activities in Cyprus. Their proportional pre-
ponderance has declined only very marginally over the last year as shown in the
table below.
Manufacturing Sector - Size of Enterprises
Enterprises                                                              1974

2.        The contribution of SSI is of great significance to employment in
manufacturing. Enterprises employing 1-9 persons accounted for approximately
40% of the manufacturing labor force in south Cyprus in 1974, as shown in the
table below.

3.        Gross output of manufacturing in 1974 in south Cyprus was estimated
at CL 91 million and SSI (less than 10 employees) generated CL 30 million,
or 33%. The contribution of SSI to value added in manufacturing for the same
year came to 38% of the total. The evolution over the past years is shown in
the following tables (CL million).

B.   SSI Demand for financing
4.        The Government has started to make detailed studies of the SSI sector
both in manufacturing proper (including small tourism enterprises such as
catering, bar and restaurant facilities) and in services. The data available
from the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry are being
analyzed. Both Ministries have received a considerable number of applications
for assitance over the past two years. In addition, local commercial banks
are collaborating with the Government to provide the latter with information
on SSI financing relating to applications received and loans granted through
their offices. This survey, which will rely essentially on applications re-
ceived, will not be able to reflect the potential and, so far, unexpressed
demand for assistance; however, it is a necessary starting point. The Gov-
ernment expects to complete its survey early in the summer of 1976. Prelim-
inary data in the Ministry of Labor indicates that, for the period January
through April 1976, some 860 loan applications for SSI projects were received
under the Refugee Assistance Program. Out of these, 735 (for a total amount
of CL 815,000) were not eligible because they called for financing in excess
of the CL 500 ceiling on loans under the Refugee Program. It is significant



ANNEX 11
Page 3
to note that the bulk of the applications which could not be financed were for
projects of the type defined in this report, especially for financing the pur-
chase of machinery. Additional statistics received from the Ministry of Com-
merce show that 49 SSI project applications were submitted to the Ministry
of Commerce and Industgry for a total amount of CL 430,000 (average CL 9,000
per project) and could not be accommodated since there was no scheme available.
Without a more detailed analysis of these applications, it is not possible to
draw definitive conclusions at this time, nevertheless these first indicators
suggest that a considerable potential demand for SSI lending exists.
II. Organization Plan
CDB's Internal Organization
5.        CDB realizes that assistance to SSI will bring new demand on its
staff and management. In addition, CDB knows that, in spite of its experience
in the past with long-term financing and, in a few cases, with financing SSI,
a large-scale program geared to SSI requires a specific organization and ex-
pertise. To start with, CDB will assign responsibility, under the Assistant
General Manager, to a qualified officer with 3 years former experience with
CDB. He will be assisted by two new recruits. The SSI section so staffed
will be integrated within CDB's Projects Department in order to give this
section all the advise and supervision its economists, engineers and financial
analysts can provide. During the first year of operation (about mid-1976
through mid-1977) the section will have three officers; later, additional
staff will be recruited as necessary.
6.        The SSI section's main role will be to review and appraise SSI fi-
nancing applications, and make recommendations to CDB's management for finan-
cing. It will also supervise the loans under a special arrangement described
below.
Outside Support
7.        For business development, promotion, technical assistance and, in
part, loan supervision, the Government has agreed in principle to provide CDB
with staff and services under terms of reference to be reviewed and agreed
upon by the Bank, which will allow CDB to keep control over them. The main
features of these agreements are the following.
8.        Business Development and Promotion.  The Ministry of Labor has
agreed to provide, on a full-time basis, a team of professionals (at least
four to start with) which will be selected from among well qualified and expe-
rienced economists, engineers and financial analysts. These experts, though
civil servants in the Ministry of Labour, will be functionally responsible
and report to CDB. CDB will also oversee their training. These experts will
have geographic responsibilities to seek and screen SSI applications and help
potential borrowers to define their projects, to prepare their applications



ANNEX 11
Page 4
(including financial needs, market prospects and arrangements, procurement,
raw material needs, etc.) and to identify possible areas of technical assis-
tance. They will then send these applications (to be standardized along a
basic though simple format) to CDB, together with their comments and recom-
mendations. CDB would stress the importance of having the experts focus
on the qualification, experience and business reputation on the applicant
which, in CDB's view, would be the key determinants in their decision to fi-
nance SSI projects. Hence, CDB's proposal is to give the Ministry of Labour
experts geographic responsibilities to enable them to be closely linked to
the community of a given region. Regional coverage would at the outset most
likely be limited to Nicosia, Limassol, Larnaca and Paphos. The experts
would keep in regular working contact with CDB, reporting on their actions
and progress in addition to receiving instructions from CDB on their work
programs.
9.        Technical Assistance.  The Government has also agreed to provide CDB
and its SSI clients with assistance from the Cyprus Productivity Center of the
Ministry of Labor. The UNDP financed Productivity Centre, initiated in 1962,
has now a long and successful record of technical assistance and t"raining to
industry in Cyprus. It employs about 25 experts including economists, market
specialists and engineers. The Centre is able to provide CDB and its SSI bor-
rowers with specific assistance when needed in three areas:
-    Technical and management services;
-    Professional Training (The Centre has Training Workshops); and
-    Market Studies.
For the purpose of the SSI Scheme, the Productivity Center will coordinate its
action programs with CDB under terms of references to be reviewed and agreed
to by the Bank. it is too early to formalize budget and staff arrangements,
but it is expected that CDB will be able to define its needs for assistance
with the Productivity Centre before the end of 1976. The reputation, ability
and anticipated assistance of the Centre would constitute an important element
in providing the SSI Scheme with a strong development input.
SSI Loan Decisions
10.       CDB envisages a two-step approach in its approval of SSI loans.
First, at the staff level, after approving the applications received from
the Ministry of Labour experts, CDB will interview the investor and prepare a
simple standardized appraisal report (about 2 pages) which will include a
summary description of the enterprise, the project, the loan request and the
recommendation. This report will be circulated among CDB's management for
clearance. Such clearance is expected to be a short process, since all the
groundwork will have in essence already been completed by the SSI section.
Applications recommended for approval will then be presented for decision to
CDB's SSI Committee, which will consist of CDB's General Manager, the Chairman
and another member of the Board.



ANNEX 11
Page 5
Supervision of SSI and of SSI Sub-Loans
11.       As for appraisals, CDB plans to organize the supervision of subloans
using its own staff as well as staff and services from outside CDB. In the
first year or two, the workload should not be excessive and supervision of SSI
enterprises by CDB's own staff, in conjunction with the Ministry of Labour ex-
perts, every six months would be feasible. CDB plans also to ask, whenever
possible, commercial banks to keep CDB informed on a regular basis about their
experience with the financial situation of CDB's SSI borrowers as it appears
from their records. This information system could be an effective way of
keeping CDB aware of problems well in advance of severe difficulties, enabl-
ing CDB to initiate steps for corrective action and assistance.
III. Financial Aspects
A.   Basic Scheme
12.       The principles agreed to by the Government for the SSI Scheme
relies on the following understandings:
(a) CDB will have full autonomy to manage and organize the
SSI Scheme, and to lend to SSI enterprises.
(b) The Government will provide resources to CDB under the
Scheme for an amount equivalent to IBRD financing, so that
every SSI subproject will be financed 50% from IBRD funds
and 50% from Government funds.
(c)  Government funds to CDB under the Scheme will be lent for
similar terms as IBRD funds, except that the Government loan
will be at a rate of interest which would enable CDB to break
even on its SSI Scheme.
(d) The Government will cover the predominant portion of CDB's
risk on its SSI loan portfolio. The Government guarantee
scheme covering 75% of each loan (para 2.06 of the main
report) which, for commercial banks or CDB's normal opera-
tions is granted only after appraisal and is subject to
Government approval, will apply to CDB's SSI Scheme on an
automatic basis, i.e. CDB will not run the risk of seeing
appraised SSI loans being rejected at a late stage of their
processing.
(e) The additional risk of 25% will be borned by CDB. However,
particularly during the first two or three years when income
from SSI loans will not yet be sufficient to offset CDB's fi-
nancial expenses (on IBRD funds), administrative expenses and
reasonable provisions, the Government will have to provide
CDB with grants to enable it to break-even under the SSI Scheme.



ANNEX 11
Page 6
(f) Provisions to be constituted by CDB against bad SSI debts, to-
gether with the collateral on which CDB would have first claim,
should be sufficient to cover CDB's risk. The level of provi-
sions will be negotiated between CDB and the Government and
submitted to the Bank for review and approval as a condition of
disbursement of the proposed loan. It would appear that a build
up of provisions at a rate of 5% of disbursement of SSI subloans
would be satisfactory, since CDB's risk on each subloan would
not exceed 20% of its outstanding amount, and normally less than
15% of the initial cost of the project financed by CDB.
(g) After two or three years, CDB may begin to make small profits
on its SSI operations. In order to compensate the Government
for its assistance in providing grants, resources and guaran-
tees, CDB will agree to return any profit on its SSI operations
to the Government.
(h) CDB will keep internally separate accounts and records on all
aspects of its SSI financing Scheme. Accounts wil be audited
by CDB's auditors and records will be available to the Govern-
ment and the Bank for inspection. In particular, CDB will
keep invoices and other evidences of payment to SSI borrowers
for Bank supervision.
B.   Characteristics of SSI subloans
13.       The proposed loan would limit on lending to the manufacturing, serv-
ices and tourism sectors. CDB plans to remain flexible in considering fi-
nancing plans for its SSI subloans. Normally, however, these loans should
not exceed 75% of total capital requirements for SSI projects.
14.       Terms and Conditions.  CDB estimate that SSI subloans will require
financing with maturities ranging from three to ten years, depending on the
size and type of loan and the cash generation of the project. Grace periods
should not, on the average, exceed one year.
15.       Disbursement.  CDB's experience with SSI and industry in general
indicates that over 60% of its long-term loans are to finance imports; this
seems to be especially true of SSI where the needs are to buy machines, tools
and equipment which are all imported directly or indirectly. Under the pro-
posed Scheme, which must be flexible to be practical, CDB proposes to have
access to Bank funds under a simplified procedure. CDB will assure itself
that purchases under its subloans are effectively made for the capital goods
which have been specified in its subloan agreement. This check will be under-
taken principally by the team of experts of the Ministry of Labor (though
CDB's staff will undertake a portion of this work) who will assure themselves
that invoices and goods are those agreed upon. CDB will disburse only after
these experts have recommended payments, though CDB will itself verify from



ANNEX 11
Page 7
time to time these certifications through field visits. In addition, CDB
will normally pay directly to the suppliers, not to the investors. To draw
Bank funds, CDB will provide the Bank with a bi-monthly statement showing the
following information:
-    name of investor and sub-sector;
-    type of project, total amount;
-    summary list of purchases;
-    amount of CDB sub-loan, terms and conditions;
-    amount disbursed over the period, and total amount
disbursed to-date.
On that basis, CDB will ask the Bank to reimburse 50% of the amount it has
effectively disbursed over the period, the balance being obtained from CDB's
other resources (mainly Government). This would be less than the estimated
average foreign exchange costs of SSI projects.
Collection of sub-loans
16.       While for normal operations, collections of loans are on a semi-
annual basis, for SSI sub-loans, depending on the sub-sector, CDB plans to
have monthly or quarterly repayments. It also intends, to the extent possible,
to domiciliate its loans with commercial banks which will automatically collect
for CDB at maturity from the accounts of the investors with them. Such a pro-
cedure will be agreed upon between CDB, the investor and his commercial bank,
and would be stipulated in CDB's sub-loan agreements. CDB is confident that
such a procedure will be acceptable to investors and will minimize potential
arrears on its SSI loans.
C.   Financial Projections
17.       Based on the recommendations made in para. 6.13 of the main report,
two alternative financial projections are possible depending on whether CDB
obtains $750,000 or $1.5 million from the Bank. These two sets are detailed
in Attachments 1 through 7 of this Annex. Though these projections would
need to be refined as the result of the Study at present underway and referred
to in para. 6.09 of this report, the Government and CDB will undertake to meet
the conditions of disbursement for the proposed loan, they clearly indicate
that, to break-even, CDB will have to receive grants from the Government (es-
pecially over the two first years of operations). Subsequently, the SSI
Scheme may eventually be profitable and thus allow CDB to repay the Government
to some extent for its initial support.



ANNEX 11  (Page8 )
Attachment 1
SMALL SCALE INDUSTRY
Financial Projections (Attachments 1-7)
Basic Assumptions and Conclusions
I. Projected Operations
The projected operations presented in Attachment 1 and 4 are not
based on actual observation of the market. Their purpose is only to serve
as a base (i) for the computation of Attachment 2, 3, 5 and 6 and (ii) for
providing an estimate of the volume of operations to be expected under the
two alternatives of the Scheme.
As regards this second point, CDB is expecting that on the average
SSI subloans will amount to CE 5000 each. This assumption is based on data
available at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. On that basis, CDB's
approvals over the period 1976-78, totalling CE 760,000 in Attachment 1 and
CE 1,520,000 in Attachment 4 imply that CDB would approve about 150 and 300
projects respectively over this period or, an average of 1 - 2.5 projects
per week. The staffing arrangement foreseen for the SSI Scheme should be
sufficient to process such a volume of work.
In Attachment 1 and 4, it has been assumed that (i) there is a
10% casualty rate on approvals, (ii) 65% of approvals are committed in the
year of approval and 35% in the subsequent year, (iii) 70% of commimtnets
are disbursed in the year of commitment and 30% in the subsequent year.
The rate of exchange usedin the Attachment is CE 1 - $2.53.
Thus total amounts committed in 1976-78 are equivalent to $1.5 million
in Attachment 1 and $3.0 million in Attachment 4. The carry over of commit-
ments and disbursements in 1979 and 1980 are not related to the proposed
loan but would have to be considered if the Scheme is continued after the
proposed loan is fully committed.
II. Projected Income and Expenditure
Interest received are based on subloans at 9% p.a. and interest
paid on IBRD funds at 8.5% p.a. Government financing is assumed at no
interest cost. Provisions at 5% of annual disbursements are build up until
cumulated provisions amount to 5% of total outstanding portfolio.   All
profits under the Scheme are transferred to the Government. It is assumed
that such profits are not taxable. Administrative expenses are based on
CDB employing three professionals in Attachment 3 and five professionals in
Attachment 6.

ANNEX 17
THE CYPRUS DEVELOPMENT BANK LIMITED
PROJECTIONS 1976-1980
MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
I. Projected Operations
See Annex 15 for detailed discussion on CDB's pipeline. Based on
CDB's experience, the relationship between approvals, commitments and disburse-
ments is defined as shown in Annex 16.
The financial projections do not include the projectior related to
SSI operations. Those are presented in Annex 11. Depending on whether the
SSI Scheme will obtain funds from IBRD and the Government up to $1.5 million
or $3.0 million equivalent, the size of the projections will be different.
Since the SSI Saheme is considered non-profit and adequately covered by Govern-
ment guarantees and provisions, the only significant impact it could have on
CDB's overall projections is an increase of CDB's debt/equity ratio. Under
the $1.5 million equivalent funding scheme, CDB's debt/equity ratio in 1980
will increase from 4.8 to 5.3, slightly above the 5:1 limit. However, it is
expected that in such a case the proposed capital increase in 1979 and 1980
will be increased accordingly.
II. Projected Income Statements
Interest Income. Loans made by CDB are at 9% p.a. This rate is expected to
be maintained throughout the period.
Interest Expenses. New borrowings will bear interest as follows:
IBRD: 8.50% p.a.
KfW:   6.00% p.a., of which 4% will be retained by CDB as Special Fund
Unidentified Foreign Loans: 8.50% p.a.
Government Loans:             5.50% p.a.
Administrative Expenses. Staff: Reflect adjustment of salaries in 1976 in
line with Central Bank salaries. Staff is expected to increase from
in 1975 to 22 in 1976 and 26 in 1980.
General Expenses. Based on past trends and indexed for staff increase.
Provisions. Loans: 2% on new loan disbursement. No provision on occupied area
portfolio as explained in main report.
Foreign Exchange: No foreign exchange risk on new borrowings. Past
exchange risk is 2% on year-end balance for KfW I and .5% on
outstanding balance of IBRD I.
KfW Interest Fund. Under the proposed agreement with KfW, the KfW loan
will be charged to CDB at 6% interest. However, only 2% interest will be
paid to KfW, while CDB will be allowed to retain the remaining 4% interest
rate paid in a special fund to be used for agreed operations by CDB (e.g.
financing SSI, promotion, etc.).
Payments of 5% Preferred Dividend. These payments will be made by CDB if
sufficient funds are available after deduction from net profits of 10% to
free reserves. If insufficient funds remain from net profits after these
deductions, tfie Government will pay the balance directly to the shareholders.

III. Projected Balance Sheets and Cash Flow
Portfolio:  Major assumptions on portfolio follow the assumptions given above in
Section I.
Borrowing:  The following new resources are expected to be mobilized
- Local currency - None
- Foreign Exchange
IBRD II:  $5 million for 15 years (composite amortization)
KfW II : DM 10 million, for 30 years with 10 years of grace
IBRD III: Approved in 1978 with same amount, terms and
conditions as IBRD II
KfW:      Approved in 1978 with same amount, terms and
conditions as KfW II
Unidentified foreign exchange: $2.5 million to be obtained
from international capital markets. Expected
terms about 10 years.
Shareholder Equity. After the Court will authorize Government take-over of
private shares in mid-1976, the Government will hold 600,000 shares with full
voting rights; the private shareholders will exchange their 400,000 shares of
CY 1 for 400,000 preference shares also of CE 1 nominal value.  On acceptance
of this exchange offer, all voting power will rest exclusively with the
Government. The Government has agreed to purchase these preference shares
within a 12-year period at par.   No purchase schedule has been agreed upon,
but there are indications that the Government may decide to redeem all the
preference shares only at the end of the twelve year period. This solution
has served as an assumption for the projections and therefore the outstanding
amount of the preference shares remains unchanged over the period shown,
1976-1980.
