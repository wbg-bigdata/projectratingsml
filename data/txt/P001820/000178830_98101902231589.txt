LNTEqNATIONA.-, DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPOaT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA
FOR A THIkD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania for the equivalent
of US$3.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Highway
Project. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KF) and the Govern-
ment of Canada will provide co-finrincing for t.his project for the equivalent
of US$3.8 mdlllon and U3$4.5 million respectively.
PART I: THE FCONOMY
2.         Based upon the findings of an economic mission to Mauritania in
February/March 1973, a report entitled "The Cu-rent Economic Situation and
Prospects of Mauritania" (243-MAD) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 9, 1974. Country data sheets appear as Annex I.
The Country
3.         Mauritania is not an integrated economic unit.  It consists of
three isolated economic centers: the port of Nouadhibou that services the
modern mining and fish processing industries in the northwest, the capital
city of Nouakchott, and the population centers in the south where livestock
and agricultural activities take place. This latter is one of the poorest
regions in the world and forms, with the western part of Mali and the
northeastern part of Senegal, an almost entirely closed economic system.
Between the Nouadhibou region and the south, the capital city of Nouakchott,
built since 1960 in a semi-desert region with no natural resources and no
basic infrastructure, is only important as an administrative center and a
port.
4.         In the past, Mauritania's main political and economic links wer,
with France and the French speaking African countries south of the Sahara.
But recently it has established close relations with North Africa and the
Arab League countries. In June 1972, it asked for the revision of the 1961
Cocperation Treaty with France in the economic, monetary, technical, cultural,
and military fields, and a new agreement was reached in February 1973, except
for monetary affairs. As a result, Mauritania left the West African Monetary
Union and the franc zone and introduced its own currency, the ouguiya, in
June of that year. However, it still wishes to keep and develop economic



- 2 -
ties with all its West African neighbors and is a member of the West African
Economic Community, which replaced the West African Customs Union (UDEAO) in
Tanuary 1974.
5.         The factors limiting economic growth in Mauritania are many.    First,
the country is one of the poorest in terms of natural resources, except for
iron ore, copper and fish, and its climate is one of the most arid among the
Sahelian countries, as even its most southern regions (about 7 percent of the
country) only receive 400-600 mm. of rain per annum. Second, distances are
great and transport to all but a few places is arduou. and costly; for ex-
ample, freight schedules for the journey from Nouakchott (in the west) to Nema
(in the east) allow nine days each way for a journey of less than 1,500 km.
Under such circumstances, the exchange of food products between the surplus
and deficit areas is limited and production incentives are considerably re-
stricted. Third, adult literacy in the country is low, while primary school
enrollment does not exceed 15 percent of the school-age population.
Past Economic Performaace
6.         Betw2en 1960 and 1968, the Mauritanian economy grew in real terms
at 10-11 percent annually, mainly due to a rapid expansion in the enclave
mining sector. Little of the value added generation in the modern sector
spilled over into rural areas. Per capita i.ocome of the rural poor at con-
stant prices has increased at about three percent annually during that period.
From 1969 to 1972, overall economic growth slowed down to three to four per-
cent per year as mining companies reached their capacity and as a result of
a series of severe droughts, unprecedented in this century.
7.         Mauritania was particularly affected by these droughts.    Agricul-
tural production decreased by about 60 percent in 1972, while the cattle
herd was reduced by an estimated 40 percent between 1969 and 1973. This
wiped out all the progress made in the rural sector in the early sixties
and further widened the gap between per capita incomes in the traditional
(US$70) and modern sectors (more than US$500). Although rainfall in 1974 was
probably about normal, the consequences of earlier drought will be felt for
many years in the form of: (i) lower output in the livestock sector; (ii)
additional demands on the national budget for social and health services;
(iii) social problems created by the concentration of refugees around the
emergency food supply centers; (iv) malnutrition and starvation resulting in
higher death rates among children and older people and causing a marked in-
crease in the incidence of physical and mental deficiency among the surviving
children.
Strategy-for Economic Development and Public Investments
8.         The Government's economic policy in the first decade of independence
focused on the development of infrastructure in an effort to equip Mauritania
with a modern capital and the facilities needed to run the country. The
infrastructure development effort also aimed at decreasing the dependence of



Mauritania on Senegal for the transport of goods in and out of the country.
Thus, about 80 percent of public investments between 1963 and 1972 were
absorbed by projects in transport and urban infrastructure. Public invest-
ments increased at about nine percent per annum in current prices during
this period to reach an annual average of US$15 million in 1968-72, or 7.8
percent of GDP. Besides the general constraints on economic development
mentioned in para 5, Plan implementation has suffered from the limited capa-
city of government services to identify, prepare, and execute projects. The
technical ministries and the Ministry of planning are understaffed and not
adequately equipped to prepare investment projects.
9.         Future growth in the modern sector is essential to improve the
public finance situation and provide a substantial part of the revenues
needed to finance investment and recurrent expenditures for the development
of the rural sector. However, even if the contemplated substantial new
investments for the Guelbs iron ore mines are undertaken (a continuation of
the present MIFERMA operation), mining alone cannot provide employment for
more than a very small fraction of Mauritania's active population and its
indirect effects on the rest of the economy will continue to remain limited.
Similarly, establishment of manufacturing industries -- so far strongly
supported by the Government - cannot provide the answer to the question
of raising the standard of living for the mass of the Mauritanian population,
as high production and transport costs and srall local markets severely limit
poasibilities. The Government's basic strategy therefore should be to develop
the country's natural resources in livestock, agriculture, arabic gum and
fisheries. Although details of the Government's investment program for the
Third Plan period (1975-79) are not yet known, the number of projects presently
under preparation indicates that a much larger share of public investments will
be devoted to the rural sector than in the past. The development of irrigated
agriculture in particular is expectcd to play an important role in ensuring
that the consequences of a recurrence of the recent droughts would not be so
drastic. One irrigation project totalling several thousand hectares is already
underway. The Bank Croup is financing the detailed engineering studies for a
second project located on the Gorgol River. Other irrigation programs are
being considered ir the context of the development of the Senegal River Basin.
Financing Public Investment
10.        The public finance situation improved markedly in the 1960s.    From
a US$7 million deficit in 1960, budgetary savings reached a positive US$5
million in 1972 or about 15 pe-cent of Central Government revenues. Public
savings (after debt amortization) financed about 20 percent of the public
investment programs in the past three years, the rest being financed by
foreign aid (US$12 million per annum). During 1970-72, the Bank Group has
been the third largest aid donor (providing about 18 percent of Mauritania's
external capital assistance), after France (21 percent) and the European
Communities (19 percent). About 70 percent of foreign development assistancc
financed transport and urban infrastructure. Also important was technical
assistance, mainly in education, which amounted to US$5.2 million per annum
in the past three years, mostly financed by French bilateral assistance and



- 4 -
UNDP. Conditions of foreign aid have progressively hardened since the share
of grant aid decreased from 100 percent in the early sixties to about 35
percent in 1970-72, bat average terms on borrowing have continued to be con-
cessionary. Thus, the average interest rate was 3.8 percent on external debt
outstanding as of December 1973 of US$50.0 million, and the debt service ratio
remains low (3-4 percent).
Prospects
11.        Even assuming normal rainfall conditions, growth in the rural sector
will probably not exceed an estimated 2-3 percent per annum for the rest of the
decade. Therefore, the standard of living on a per capita basis in the rural
sector cannot be expected to reach its 1968 level again before the early 1980s
as the reconstitution of the herd will be a slow process and the effects of
the investments planned in the agricultural sector will only he felt after a
substantial lag. The moderr, sector rate of growth during the same period
could reach about five percent, a small decline from the performance of the
past four years. This is mainly due to the fact that mining production,
which stagnated between 1969 and 1972, but increased again in the last two
years, is expected to remain at its 1974 level until MIFERMA begins exploit-
ing low grade iron ore deposits at Guelbs. As a result, economic growth for
the countr7 as a whole could reach about four percent between 1971/72 and
1980, assuming that droughts of the past few years do not occur again during
this period.
12.        The combined effects of the drought, the sharp increase in world
market commodity prices, and accelerating world inflation have led to a
sharp increase in imports from about US$108 million in 1972, to an esti-
mated average of US$162 million in the years 1973-74. Cereal imports alone
increased from US$9 million in 1972 to an annual average of about US$30 mil-
lion in 1973-74, whlle refined petroleum imports increased from US$5 million
in 1972 to an estimated US$10 million in 1973-74.
i3.        However, this increase in the import bill was largely offset by
favorable prices for Hauritania's main exports (iron ore, copp-r, fish pro-
ducts and livestock) and a 30 percent increase in iron ore proiuction in the
last two years. As a result, the current account deficit increased by US$6
million only, or from US$26 million in 1972 (entirely financed by public and
private capital inflows) to an e-1m.ated US$32 m--'llion average in 1973-74.
Although substantial, (20 percent of total export earnings), this gap is
expected to be fully financed by additional foreign aid.
14.        Assuming normal rainfall conditions, balance of payments prospects
in Mauritania are favorable, as a result of an expected reduction in food
imports and improvement in Mauritania's terms of trade. By 1980, the terms
of trade index would reach about 120 (1972 = 100), if current projections
of increased export prices of iron ore, copper, fish products and cattle
are realized.
15.        The recent commodity price increasej and accelerating world infla-
tion could raise the cost of public investments by about 50 percent during



the Third Plan (1975-79) compared -ith estimates made a year ago. Thus,
they could reach an annual average of about US$41 million in 1975-79 as com-
pared to US$15 -million in 1970-72. This level of investment appears justified
by presently foreseen opportunities and the need to broaden the base of economic
development.  Local firancing is expected to remain limited.   Assuming tight
budgetary policies, coubined with a needed substantial increase in current
expenditures in productive sectors, public savings could perhaps reach 10-15
percent of Central Government revenues or an annual average of US$12 million
over th2 Third Plan period. However, public debt amortization will probably
absorb about 50 percent of public savings. On that basis, public savings
could not finance more than 13-15 percent of the public investment program.
16.        On these assumptions, the implementation of the public investment
program ir. the coming years would require a trebling of foreign aid capital
inflows from an annual average of US$12 million in 1970-72 to US$33-35 mil-
lion in the Third Plan period. This appears to be a feasible target with
the European Community, several Arab countries, France, the People's Republic
of China and the Bank Group expected to be the main donors. Mauritania
should be able to continue to obtain the needed foreign aid on soft terms.
The public debt serv'.e ratio is therefore projected to remain around 5 per-
cent in coming years.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MAURITANIA
17.        The Bank Group has had 8 operations in Mauritania to date.   Total
lending amounts to US$107.3 million, including one Bank loan of US$66 millior,
for the MIFERMA iron ore mining operation in 1960, six IDA credits, totalling
US$21.3 million, and one IFC operation of US$20.0 million for the development
of copper mining in 1968. Two credits were for projectr in the transport
sector (US$6.7 million in FY 1964 for the road Nouakchott-Rosso and US$3.0
million in FY 1969 for a four-year road improvement and maintenance program),
three in the rural sector (US$4.2 million for livestock development in FY 1972,
US$2.5 million for a Drought Relief Fund Project in FY 1974 and US$1.1 million
for an Irrigation Engineering Project in FY 1974), and one for education
(US$3.8 million, also in FY 1974). Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments as of September 30, 1974, and notes
on the execution of on-going projects.
18.        The Iron Ore Mining and the 1964 Road Construction projects have
been fully disbursed. The First Road Maintenance Project (FY 1969) is pro-
gressing satisfactorily. All equipment is in operation and the funds for
training are almost entirely disbursed. With respect to the Livestock Devel-
opment Project (FY 1972), the implementation of the vacciration and firebreak
components, which was delayed by about one year following the recent drought,
has now started and bids for the well component are being studied by the
Government and the Association. Hovever project implementation is expected
to remain slow, mostly as a result of Government staff constraints. This prob-
lem is presently being discussed with the Government. The Drought Relief Fund



- 6 -
Project, is progressing satisfactorily:   bidding documents have been issued
with IDA approval for the subprojects dealing with vegetable production and
small irrigation schemes, wbile the feasibility study for the cattle produc-
tion center is well underway. Effectiveness of the Education Project was
delayed by the difficulty of finding a deputy-director for the project with
the required qualifications. This problem has now been solved and effeclive-
ness is expected in the very near future. The credit for the Irrigation Engi-
neering Project, signed on June 12, 1974, is expected to become effective soon.
19.        In line with the development strategy outlined in paragraph 9, the
primary objectives of the Bank Group operations in Mauritania are-to help
the Government ti) build a baae for economic development outside the mining
sector, particularly by developing the potential of the rural sector and
decreasing its vulnerability to drought; and (ii) increase the country's
absorptive capacity, one of the major constraints to Mauritania's develop-
ment, by developing its education/training system and making it more relevant
to the country's needs. These objectives will be pursued while continuing to
support, first, the development of mining activities which are essential to
strengthen the fiscal and balance of payments positions of the country and,
second, the development of transport infrastructure which is a prerequisite
to promoting agricultural development in remo~ie rural areas. Due to the
extreme poverty of the country, its very difficult climate, large distances,
an insufficient transport network, and a lack of trained personnel at all
levels, project preparation and implementation particularly in the rural
sector has proved much more time cons!ning than anticipated. However, the
efforts made by the Bank Group are startLing to bear fruit, as indicated by
the fact that it has been posslble to present two projects to the Board in
FY 74 (besides the Drought Relief Project) and that we hope to present two
projects to the Board in FY 1975, the present Third Highway Project and the
Nouadhibou Port Extension Project. The latter will substantially increase
the participation of Mauritania in the exploitation of its fish resezves.
20.        During 1970-72, the Bank Group accounted for about 18 percent of
MIauritania's external capital assistance. This proportion is expected to
reach 20 percent by 1980. As of December 1973, the Dank Group held 22 percent
of Mauritania's external public debt (disbursed) of US$45 million. This propor-
tion is expected to remain at about that level during the rest of the 1970s.
The Bank Group iccounted for about 3 percent of total debt service payments in
1973. This ratio is expected to increase slowly in the coming years, to reach
about 10 percent by the mid-eighties.
PART III: THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
21.        Transport facilities in Mauritania are limited.   External trans-
port needs are met almost entirely by a port at Nouadhibou; a 350 m wharf at
Nouakchott; airports in each of these two cities; and a ferry service at
Rosso on the Senegal River which gives access to the Senegalese transport



system. The Nouadhibou port has specialized facilities for bulk handling of
iron ore and a general cargo and fishing port. The Association has appraised
and plans to negotiate shortly a project for the extension of the latter.
The wharf at Nouakchott handled about 153,000 tons of cargo in 1973, working
at about two-thirds of its capacity. It is expected to reach its full capa-
city in the late seventies.
22.        Intetnal transport needs are met by about 7,000 km of roads (of
which only 500 km are paved and another 1,050 km are all-weather laterite
roads), and a 740 km railway owmned by MIFERA (a private iron ore mining com-
pany) for the shipment of ore from tle deposit fields in Zouerate to the port
of Nouadhibou. The road system comprises three main axes: a north-south axis
stretching 1,850 km from Rosso on the Senegal River to Atar and the Algerian
border in the north, an east-west axis from Rosso to Nema, and a central axis
linking Boghe (on the Senegal River), Aleg and Tidjikja. Except for the first
axis, and some sections of the second, the roads have no definite alignments.
Sandstorms in the north and floods during the wet season in the south make it
necessary for the vehicles to drive cross-country. River transport was once
significant but has now dwiodled to a few small itinerant craft.     The possi-
bility of reviving this mode of transport is presently being studied by the
Organization for the Development of the Senegal River. Finally, internal air
transport has been essential in helping to alleviate the effects of the recent
drought but proved too costly to attract significant and continuous demand so
far. It may be hovever the only feasible solution for certain long d:Lstance
transport and should be given continuous attention when inter modal alterna-
tives are considered.
23.        Therefore, rransport to all but a few places in Mauritania is
arduous and costly. For example, the official freight rate from Nouakchott
to Nema, a nine-day journey over 1,400 km, is about US$O.1 per ton-km. This
is explained by the nain difficulties which beset the transport sector: large
distances, sparsity of population, difficult weather conditions, and insuffi-
ciency of the facilities and maintenance organization. The Truckers' Associa-
tion is responsible for organizing and regulating road transport except foi
tre setting of maxini transport prices for each route, which is determined
by the Government. However, the Trucker's Association suffers from ineffi-
cient management and lack of technical and administrative expertise to perform
its functions well. Therefore the proposed project will include the provision
of a transport expert to assist the Goverrnent in the training of truckers in
management and accounting techniques.
24.        A first step in improving highway maintenance operations has been
achieved by the substantial increases in the budget allocations of the
Infrastructure Department, which accompanied the implementation of the IDA-
financed Highway Mamntenance Project (FY 1969). This project included the
purchase of highway maintenance equipment, the provision of technical assist-
ance to execute a four-year highway maintenance and betterment program, and
the training of mechanics and operators. This project contributed substan-
tially to setting up an effective highway maintenance organizatior. now com-
posed of the following:



-    two central divisions (Equipment, and Road and Airport
Divisions) in t.e Ministry of Equipment (ME);
-    nine field subdivisions, in the nine administrative
regions, to carry out routine maintenance; and
-    four highway bases located respectively in the capital,
and in the northern, central and southern ragions. The
bases are mainly engaged in bettermL    works, a prere-
quisite to normal maintenance operatio.s.
The major difficulty encountered by this project was the inability of the
Government to assign a sufficient number of counterpart personnel to the team
of consultants as a result of a general shortage of middle and upper level
personnel.
Long-Term Prospects
25.       The aim of the Government in the transport field is, first, to
continue reducing the dependence of Mauritania on Senegal for its imports;
second, to link the east and the west of the country as part of a strategy
to achieve national umity and reduce the wide discrepancies in living otand-
ards between different areas; and third, to establish a reliable transport
system necessary to develop the more populated southeastern regions.
26.       These objectives are sound, although the scope and the timing of
some of the investments presently being considered by the Go-vernment to
implement these policies axe questionable from an economic point of view.
At present, priority is given to the construction of a two-lane paved high-
way from Nouakchott to Nema (1,0O0 kr), via Boutilimit and Aleg; the construc-
tion of an international airport and a deep-water port in Nouakchott; and the
construction of the RoEso-Boghe-Kaedi road along the Senegal River. From an
economic point of view, the latter only can be justified at this time, and
constitutes an important part of the project. It appears that A.-ab funds will
be forthcoming for the financing of the other projects mentionrd above. The
Government has agreed to an annual review with the Associatior, of its road
maintenance program and budget for fiscal years 1976 through 1979 (see Section
4.03 c of the draft Credit Agreement). Also, in order to e-sure that the
realization of important road projects does not affect the allocation of
adequate resources to the maintenance of the ongoing projects, the Government
has agreed to discuss vith the Association the budgetary implications uf the
construction and maintenance of such projects (see Section 4.03 d of the
draft Credit Agreement).
PART IV: THE PROJECT
27.       The project constitutes a continuation of the ongoiag maintenance
project described in para. 24. Appraisal of the proje-t took place in September
and December 1973.  Negotiations were held from September 3 to 10, 1974.    The



HSauritanian deleg.-.on was led by Mr. I. Ba, Director of Planning. A credit
and project summary is attached as Annex III. The project's appraisal report
(No. 493-MAU) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
Objective and Description of the Project
28.       The principal aim of the project is to consolidate and expand the
maintenance and betterment efforts, started under the ongoing maintenance
project.
The project would consist of the 'oll -
(a)  technical assistance tc tb   Ministries of Equipment,
Trade and Transportation .-   Planning;
(b) purchase of highway equipment for maintenance and
betterment works;
(c) a betterment program on about 365 kn of roaus; and
(d)  feasibility study and detailed engineering for the
construction of the Rosso-Boghe road (900 kr,).
Technical Assistance
29.       This component includes the provision of 350 man-months of tech-
nical assistance which Is mainly an extension of that provided under the
ongoing Road Maintenance Project. The extension is required to relieve
the shortage of qualified highway personnel. and to allow continuation of the
ongoing training program. The technical assistance team would include:
-    five mechanical experts who would be assigned to the
Equipment Divisica fo- a period varying between two and
three years to asiist in the management of operations and
to train operators and mechani(s
-    three highway experts who would be assigned !o the Road and
Airport Division for a period varying betwee- zwo and three
years to help reorganize the field subdivisiuns train their
personnel and program their activities; make the required
investigations to revise the highway recurrent budget;
prepare the necessary engineering for the betterment
program; and implemert adequate accounting procedures;
-    a senior expert specialized in training on a short-term
assignment of about 3-4 months;
-    a transport planner/eccnomist for a two-year period to assist
the Government in the analysis of transport investments and
transport organization problems; and



- ?0 -
a transport expert with good experience in the tru( _ing
industry,,for a two-year pertod, to help the Govetm.'snt
train truckers in managtner.c aud accounting techniques.
Purchase of Highway Equipment
30.        The project would provide the equipment required to continue
building up the maintenance capacity i7 seven of the nine field subdivisions
to an adequate level, the remaining two being already sufficiently equipped,
and the necessary items to complete the existing equipment fleet of the high-
way betterment bases.
Betterment Program
31.        The road sections selected for betterment total about 365 km, of
which 165 km are in the north and 200 km in the souti.east. These sections are
now mere earth tracks without definite alignments; traffic on them is often
interrupted. The works proposed include earthworks on new aliroenets to avoid
sandy or periodically flooded areas, and construction of surface courses and
of drainage and light river-crossing structures.
Feasibility Study and Detailed Engineering of the Rosso-Boghe Road (200 km)
32.        This is the most heavily trafficked of the unpaved roads.    It
crosses the flood area along the Senegal River, and is closed to traffic
for almost six months of the year. Economic and engineering investigations6
are required to determine the appropriate construction standards, rnd to
select definite alignments, the types of river-crossing structures, and the
road materials to be adopted.
Cost Estimates and Financing
33.        The total capital cost of the project net of taxes is estimated
at US$11.3 million equivalent, of which US$9.5 million are foreign costs and
US$1.8 million local costs. Details of projr:ct costs are summarized below.

34.       The total rost _f the project net of taxes would be financed by
the Association (27%), the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KF)
(33;%) and Canada through the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
(40%) under separate agreements with the Government. The financing plan
foresees that:
(a) IDA and KF will jointly finance the total costs of
technical assistance, preinvestment study and the better-
ment program (net of taxes);
(b) Canada will finance 100% of foreign costs of equipment
procurement and related services; and
Execution
35.       The Ministry of Equipment will be responsible for implementing teic
part of the project concerning highways while the 'linistries of Trade and
Transportation and Planning will he responsible for technical assistance to
thieir respective ministries.  In order to ensure that the interdependent
aspects of the projects are adequately taken into account by the co-financers,
an understanding has been reached ar.ong the co-financers to compare the pro-
gress nmade in the implementation if each part of the project, to discuss
possible re-visions of the imp7ementation sc'-.dule with the Government if
necessary, and to coordinate project supervision.    Finally, an agreement has
been reached with the Government that the Association will have access to all
data necessary to follow overall project implementation.
Procurement and Disbursement
36.       Consultants for technical azsistance and for the feasibility and
detailed engineering studies would be selected on terims and conditions accept-
able to the Association.   For the equipment purchase component of tY-    roject,
which would be financed by Canada, procurement procedures would folloa CIDA's
regulations.  With respect to the betterment program financed Jointly bv the
Association and KF, all road works would be carried out by force accoun.
River crossing structures and drainage works would be executed by contract
following international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines. Domestic contractors would be granted a mar_in of preference of
7-1/2 percent. Contracts estimated to cost less than USS100,000 equivalent,
up to an aggregate not exceeding US$500,000 equivalent, would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
local procedures, -which are satisfactory to the Bank. The project would be
implemented over a period of four years.
37.       The credit would be disbursed against 44 percent of the total costs
(net of taxes) of technical assistance, preinvestment study, and the betterment
program, with the balance being financed by the Kuwait Fund. An agreement was
reached with the Kuwait Fund according to which disbursement applications would
be sent to both the KF and the Associatior. If either the KF or the Association
considered not approving an application, they would consult each other as soon
as possible as to the appropriate course of action.

Benefits
38.       Benefits from the project will accrue almost entirely to the tradi-
tional sector of the economy. The economic return of the maintenance program
is estimated at 36 percent over the six-year expected life of the capital
investment. Road betterment works under the project are expected to extend
the seasonal use of some of the most important unpaved roads in the country,
to reduce transport coscs on these roads throughout the year, and to ensure
greater transport reliability during the wet season. The betterment project
is expected to yield an economic return of 35 percent for the Boghe-Kaedi-Kiffa
section and 16 percent for the Akjoujt-Atar-Choum s-:ction. Finally, the Rosso-
Boghe road, for which a feasibility study and detailed engineering, if feasible,
would be undertaken, is an important connection between Nouakchott and the
center of ongoing and planned agricultural and livesteck developments. Con-
struction of the road, together with1 the betterment works proposed on the
Boghe-Kaedi-Kiffa road, l-ill considerably improve access to the eastern region.
PART V:  LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Maurita.ia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Arricle V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association,
and t0- text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distribated to the Executive Directors separately.

Cr. No. 159-MAU  First Road Maintenance Project:   US$3.0 million; Credit
Agreement: June 26, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
This project is progressing satisfactorily except with respect to
the inability of the Government to assign a sufficient number of counterpart
personnel to the team of consultants as a result of a general shortage of
middle and upper level local personnel. This problem is being solved by the
training abroad (under the pro3 ct and with the assistance of UNDP) of a
number of local personnel. For the rest, all equipment is now in operation
according to appraisal schedule. The remaining funds for training are now
almost fully disbursed.
Cr. No. 273-MAU Livestock Development Pro_ect: US$4.15 million; Credit
Agreement: December 17, 1971; Closing Date: December 31,
1976
The project provides for (i) construction and maintenance of qIells,
(ii) operation of animel health campaigns and (iii) firebreaks in an area
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understauding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengt'.s and
weaknesses in project execution.

covering about half of Mauritania's population.   The start-up of project
items (ii) and (iii) was postponed to the fall of 1973 or by about one year
following the recent drought since animals temporarily left the project area
and pastures were destroyed. The iplementation of these items has naw
started and is technically progressing satisfactorily. Calls for
tender for the major contract for well repairs and reconstruction were opened
on July 24, 1974. However, project implementation remains slow mostly because
of staff constraints: (a) the Project Manager who is also the Director of
Livestock has other duties, which take up much of his time; (b) there have
been senior staff dismissals and departures in the Hydrology Department which
is responsible for the larger part of the project; and (c) the Technical Aid
Advisor on accounting was inadequately qualified; he is now being replaced
by a competent man. We are presently discussing with the Government possible
solutions to these problems.
Cr. No. 444-MAU Drought Relief Fund Project: US$2.5 million; Credit
Agreement: December 7, 1973; Closing Date: November 15,
1976
The project objective is to contribute to the re-establishment cf
the country's productive base. It includes four subprojects: the rehabili-
tation and extension of small rice irrigation schemes, (b) the development
and improvement of irrigated vegetable production, (c) the establishment of
a fodder and cattle production center in Rosso, and (d) technical assistance
to the Ministry of Rural Development. Equipment for the subprojects (a) and
(b) has been ordered and is expected to arrive in November 1974. Draft con-
tracts for technical assistance fo. the subprojects (a) and (d) have been
approved by IDA; they still have to be signed by the Government. Works for
the subproject (a) will take somewhat longer than anticipated due to delay
in contract signature. The vegetable subproject (b) will start this fall.
The feasibility study for subproject (c) is underway and is expected to be
completed in December 1974.
Cr. No. 459-MAU  Eci         Pject: US  38 million; Credit Agreement:
February 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This project provides for (a) the establishment of a vocational
training center in Nouakchott to meet training needs for clerical, mechanical
and construction workers; (b) the establishment of a technician training
program in Nouadhibou; (c) equipment and technical assistance for the National
Pedagogical Center for the upgrading and counseling of teachers through edu-
cational broadcasting and related teaching materials; (d) the establishment
of a pilot farmer training center in the irrigated rice perimeter, of M'Pourie;
(e) the establishment of a farmer radio programming center at Kaedi; (f) an
experimental study of the feasibility of introducing basic education (reading,
wri'ing, arithmetic) in the Koranic school system; (g) technical assistance
for the Directorate of Planning to help develop better indicators of manpower
demand. The effectiveness of this credit was delayed by the difficulty of
finding a deputy-director for the project with the required qua:.ifications.
This problem has now been solved and effectiveness is expected in the very
near future.
