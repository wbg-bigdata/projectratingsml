INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO INDIA FOR THE
GORAKHPUR FERTILIZER EXPANSION PROJECT
1.     I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India for the equivalent of US$10 million on
standard IDA terms for a fertilizer project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.     Since 1949 the Hank has made 40 loans amounting to US$1,111
million and the Association 37 development credits amounting to US$1,571
million (both net of cancellations) to India. Of these amounts, US$493
million has been repaid, and US$566 million is still undisbureed.
3.     The share of agricultural projects in Bank/IDA operations has
increased substantially in the past two years, reflecting the high
priority which the Government of India accords to agriculture in the
current Fourth Five-Year Plan (1969-74). Agricultural lending is
expected to account for a large share of future Bank Group assistance,
although finance of infrastructure and industry will continue to be
important. Support to education and family planning is also planned,
but here the scope for lending is limited. A report and recoimendation
on a proposed credit for the Mysore Agricultural Credit project is being
distributed on the same date as this report. In the near future I expect
to present a railways project, a further agricultural credit project in
Maharashtra, a marketing project in Bihar and a shipping project.
4.     Past Industrial Imports Credits have provided foreign exchange
for imports of raw materials needed for fertilizer manufacture. The
proposed credit will be the second IDA operation in direct support of
fertilizer production in India, the first being Credit No. 264 for the
Cochin II Fertilizer Project. Two other fertilizer projects (Nangal
in Punjab and Trombay in Maharashtra) are under active consideration by
the Association. IFC has participated in two fertilizer proJects in India
(Indian ExpIosives in Uttar Pradesh and Zuari Agrochemicals in Goa) and is
currently considering a third (Dharamsi Morarji in Maharashtra).
5.     Since 1957, IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling
US$42.3 million, of which US$3.3 million has been repaid, US$5.9 million
sold and IIS$6.3 million cancelled. Of the US$26.8 million held as of
October 31, 1971, US$15.6 million represents loans and US$8.2 million
equity.



6.     A summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of October 31, 1971, is attached as Annex I. Comments
on the status of disbursements are given in paragraphs 4-7 of my
recent Report and Recommendation on a Loan to the Industrial Credit
and Investment Corporation of India Ltd. (P-988), dated October 13,
1971. There have been no significant changes since that report.
7.     The proposed project was appraised in May and July of 1971.
At negotiations in Washington during the week of November 8, 1971, the
Borrower was represented by Mr. V. N. Kasturirangan (Chief Projects
Officer, Ministry of Petroleum and Chemicals, Government of India) and
Mr. S. Guhan (Special Assistant to the Minister of Planning, Goverrment
of India). The Fertilizer Corporation of India was represented by
Mr. S. K. Mukherjee (Director of Production) and Mr. S. Venkataraman
(Chief Engineer).
8.     The economic situation is summarized in my report and recommend-
ation on the proposed credit for the Mysore Agricultural Credit Project
of the same date. An economic report entitled "Economic Situation and
Prospects of India" (SA-25a), dated May 11, 1971, was distributed to the
Executive Directors on May 24, 1971, and a memorandum entitled "India :
Major Economic Issues"(R71-249, dated November 9, 1971) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on November 9, 1971. A country data sheet is
attached as Annex II.
PART II - THE PROJECT
9.     A report entitled "Appraisa] of Gorakhpur Expansion Project,
Fertilizer Corporation of India"(RI-12a dated November 22, 1971) will
be distributed to Executive Directors separately. A Credit and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III.
10.    Fertilizer availability is essential to sustained growth of India's
agricultural sector. The development of a domestic fertilizer manufactur-
ing capacity has received particular attention in Bank economic reports
and staff studies. The Bank is currently reviewing again long-range
supply and demand forecasts for India, and these data will be available
early next year. According to infonration just received, actual nitrogen
consumption in 1970/71 is unofficially estimated at 1.6 million nutrient
tons, while production was only about half this amount. Even taking into
account all the India nitrogenous fertilizer capacity which is now under
construction or is likely to be built, domestic production wil] remain
below consumption at least through this decade.
11.    The proposed IDA credit would provide financing in support of
an expansion of the Gorakhpur Unit of the Fertilizer Corporation of
India (FCI) from its present capacity of 180,000 tons of urea per year
to about 314,000 tons per year. The financing required for the project
is estimated at US$16 million equivalent (Rs 120 million), incluiing
contingencies, working capital requirements and interest during construction.
Of this total, the amount of the proposed credit (US$10 million, or
Rs 75 million) would be relent to FCI by the Government of India (GOI)
in several tranches following the progress of disbursements, each tranche
with a maturity of 13 years, including 3 years of grace, at 8.5 percent



-3-
interest, the exchange risk remaining with the GOI. The balance of
Rs 45 million would be provided by the GOI in equity funds. The GOI
would also provide any overrun financing required, at least half as
equity. Prospective currency adjustments are not expected to exert
more than a minor influence on project costs  and the financing plan
proposed is considered to be adequate.
12.    The Gorakhpur plant, located in Uttar Pradesh in north-eastern
India, was conceived in 1962 and started production in 1968. It is one
of the best operating divisions of FCI and frequently attains 100 percent
of design capacity on a daily basis. In FY 1970, its second year of
production, the plant produced an average of 88 percent of capacity, and
in 1971 production averaged 82 percent. The shortfall was due largely
to factors outside Gorakhpur's control - a shortage of naphtha feedstock
resulting from a railroad strike, power loss due to a strike at the Uttar
Pradesh State Electricity Board (SEB) and other power interruptions.  To
minimize the recurrence of these problems in the future, FCI will double
naphtha storage capacity at the plant as part of the expansion project,
and in separate projects the SEB is increasing generating capacity and
plans to complete a new 220 KV transmission line to Gorakhpur in 1973.
13.    Financed with a Japanese credit and funds from GOI, the Gorakhpur
plant was built by Toyo Engineering Corporation of Japan at a total
project cost of Rs 338 million (about US$45 million), about half of which
was foreign exchange. The plant was designed very conservatively and
contained considerable oversized and spare equipment, a practice not
uncommon a decade ago. This fact, together with the lengthy completion
time, contributed to the high cost forits size of the original plant.
14.    The plant sizes employed at Gorakhpur are small by today's
standards, and operating costs are high because the process (partial
oxidation of naphtha) requires high power consumption and high-cost
feedstock. When the project was planned in 1962, however, it represented
the best available proven technology. Installed equipment and other spare
capacity form the basis for the expansion project, for which the incre-
mental capital requirements are low. Although power and fuel costs will
remain relatively high, the expansion should not require any increase in
the labor force, and incremental operating costs do not include any labor,
overhead or selling costs. As a result, operating costs of the expansion
project compare favorably with the costs of other large, modern urea
factories in developing countries.
15.    The expansion project's profitability is very satisfactory, due
to the modest capital costs and the low incremental operating costs in-
volved as well as to the high sellirg prices for fertilizer in India.
The internal financial rate of return of the expansion is about 30 percent,
which improves the overall financial. return of the Gorakhpur unit from
8 percent to 11 percent. The economic return for the project islabout
19 percent, based on estimated future import prices for urea of US$65
per ton. Net annual foreign exchange savings from the expansion project
are estimated at $6.5 million at the expected production level of 95 percent
of capacty.



-4-
16.    FCI has developed a Critical Path Schedule for project implement-
ation which calls for its completion by August 1974, allowing several
months for contingencies. Engineering and design work will be carried
out by the Planning and Development Division of FCI with the assistance
of Toyo, who will also provide process guarantees and a guaranteed dai]y
production rate. Design conditions require that the proposed project be
based on the same technology as is now used at Gorakhpur; therefore, no
difficulty is expected in its execution.
17.    The India-wide nitrogenous fertilizer production deficit was
mentioned above in paragraph 10. Since Gorakhpur's primary marketing
region (eastern Uttar Pradesh) is a high fertilizer consumption area
and is relatively protected due to high transport costs of other producers,
the increased urea production can be easily marketed.
18.    FCI, the beneficiary of the proposed credit, is the largest
fertilizer producer in India, accounting for 30 percent of the country's
nitrogen and 10 percent of its phosphate capacity. It is wholly owned
by the GOI and has at present five plants in operation. To help narrow
the gap between domestic prod&ction and consumption, FCI is engaged in
a large expansion program, with six plants under construction and seven
(including this project) under consideration.
19.    FCI is managed by a 12-member Board of Directors, designed to
function as a policy-making body and as a liaison and coordinating group
between FCI and the Gavernment. Each of the five operating units (plants)
is managed as a separate cost center and day-to-day production functions
are controlled by unit General Managers. FCI has appointed a Project
Manager who will have full responsibility for the execution of the project
and adequate staff and facilities to fulfill this responsibility.
20.    Although the Gorakhpur unit itself is quite profitable and
FCI as a whole has made a profit in all recent years but one, the
Corporation's earnings have been low, due to low capacity utilization
levels and delays in bringing new plants into operation. Principal
due on outstanding debt rises sharply in FY 1972 and succeeding years,
and increased net profits will be necessary if the company is to service
its outstanding debt. During the next two yeaiS three new plants are
scheduled to start production; if they operate well, this will lead to
increased cash generation. The GOI has given assurances that it will maintain
FCI in a satisfactory financial position: all the funds necessary
to complete FCI's expansion program will be provided in a way which will
result in a debt:equity ratio no greater than 50:50, and FCI will maintain
a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.2:1.



21.    The GOI has indicated that about $0.3 million of equipment
would be reserved for domestic suppliers and financed out of GOI
funds. The proposed IDA credit of US$10 million would finance two-
thirds of the total project cost of US$15.26 million (excluding
interest during construction). The credit would be disbursed in
major part against US$6.8 million in equipment and materials which
will be subject to international competitive bidding, and an estimated
US$0.4 million for proprietory items required for standardization with
the existing plant. Another US$2.2 million would be disbursed against
local and foreign exchange costs for engineering, design, erection and
commissioning; US$0.6 million would be unallocated.
22.    The foreign exchange component of the proposed credit will depenid
on the outcome of the international bidding process, since Indian suppliers
are expected to bid on a large nunber of internationally tendered equipment
contracts. There will be a 15 percent preference for domestic suppliers;
the prevailing duty is now 30 percent. On the basis of a comparison of
relative prices, it is expected that Indian suppliers will win about one-
fifth of those contracts. In that event, the foreign exchange costs to
be financed under the proposed credit would be about US$8.7 million and
the local currency costs about U3$1.3 million.
PART III  - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANDAUTHORITY
23.    The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and
FCI, the Recomnmendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution
concerning the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
24.    The draft Development Credit Agreement and the draft Project
Agreement follow the pattern of the earlier agreements for the Cochin
fertilizer project in India.
25.    I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART IV - RECOMMENDATION
26.    I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
