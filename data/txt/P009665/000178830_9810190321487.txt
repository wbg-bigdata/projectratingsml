SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a proposed expansion project of the Gorakh-
pur unit of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI), the largest fertilizer
producer in the country, and wholly-owned by the Government of India (GOI).
Gorakhpur, located in eastern Uttar Pradesh in northeastern India, has a
design capacity of 180,000 tons of urea per year and the proposed expansiou
will increase capacity to 314,000 tons of urea per year. This increased
production of 134,000 tons per year will contribute to India's efforts to
increase domestic fertilizer production, one of the most important inputs
in its efforts to attain self-sufficiency in future food production.
ii.       Total financing required for the project is estimated at $16 mil-
lion (Rs 120 million) of which $8.7 million is required in foreign exchange.
The proposed International Development Association (IDA) credit of $10 mil-
lion (Rs 75.0 million) would be relent to FCI by the Government which would
provide the balance of the financing of $6 million (Rs 45.0 million) in
equity funds. Terms for the on-lending to FCI are 8.5Z interest per annum
to be amortized over ten years after a grace period of three years.
iii.      FCI is engaged in a large expansion program with several new urea
plants currently under construction and others in advanced stages of plan-
ning. While these have been financed on a conservative 50:50 debt equity
ratio, FCI's earnings record has been poor and it may have difficulty in
servicing its debt in the immediate future. Net earnings in recent years
have averaged about Rs 11 million per year, which represents about 1% return
on capital. This report, without appraising FCI in depth, focuses primarily
on the Gorakhpur unit and its proposed expansion, and a more detailed analy-
sis of FCI, including future financial projections, is being included in the
current appraisal of FCI's proposal for a new urea plant at Nangal, Punjab
State.
iv.       Gorakhpur, which began operations in 1968, is one of the most pro-
fitable divisions of FCI. Although its existing plant has a high capital
cost, it has provided a return on invested capital of about 5% thus far,
which is much higher than for FCI as a whole. The proposed expansion is
expected to increase return on capital for the combined Gorakhpur plant to
an estimated 12%.
v.        FCI has appointed an experienced project manager who will be
responsible for the expansion. Engineering and design will be carried out
by the Planning and Development Division of FCI with the assistance of Toyo
Engineering Corporation of Japan who will provide process guarantees as
well. The proposed project is based on technology identical to that used
in the existing plant and no difficulty is foreseen in its execution.
Adequate steps are incorporated in the project to minimize the effect on
the environment.



- ii -
vi.       The project is proposed to be completed in 30 months.  While prev-
ious FCI projects have been delayed, much of this project duplicates existing
equipment and FCI should be able to complete it in the time allowed. The
assistance of Toyo Engineering in design and procurement is expected to help
in completing the project on time.
vii.      With the exception of a small amount of equipment reserved for
Indian suppliers (about 4% total value of equipment), and a small amount of
proprietary equipment, all other equipment will be bid competitively under
international tender with assurances given by GOI that all import licenses
required will be issued promptly.  If any items to be supplied by India,
either reserved items or those won by international competition, are delayed
and would affect timely completion of the project, GOI has assured that they
can promptly be secured from other sources and will promptly issue any
additional import licenses.  About 22% of the equipment and materials to be
bid competitively should be won by Indian suppliers.
viii.     The proposed IDA credit will be primarily used to finance inter-
nationally bid equipment with a portion of it to be used for foreign engi-
neering costs, process licenses, and part of local engineering and erection
costs.
ix.       Forecasts of fertilizer production and consumption in India indi-
cate a continuing shortage in nitrogenous fertilizer production which must
be met by imports. The Gorakhpur unit now sells most of its urea output in
a relatively small area in eastern and central Uttar Pradesh. Supply and
demand data for Uttar Pradesh show that a shortfall in nitrogenous supply
will exist through the 1970's. Gorakhpur's primary market region in eastern
Uttar Pradesh is relatively protected from competition due to high transport
costs of other producers and no difficulty is seen in Gorakhpur's disposing
of its increased output in its marketing area.
x.        While the existing plant has high operating costs, production costs
of the expansion project are substantially below the equivalent cost of im-
ported urea. These low unit costs reduce the overall ex-factory operating
cost at Gorakhpur to a level almost comparable to imports. Operating costs
in the expansion are also comparable to the ex-factory costs realized in
other fertilizer projects financed by IBRD.
xi.       The project provides a satisfactory economic rate of return of
19.2% based on estimated future import prices for urea. The financial rate
of return for the project is 29.8%, which improves the overall return for the
Gorakhpur division to 11.3%. The project's economic and financial returns
are sensitive to changes in selling prices and, to a lesser degree, changes
in raw material prices, operating level, and delays in project completion.
A combination of a reduction in selling prices by 10%, reduction in operating
level by 5%, and a project delay, would still provide a satisfactory economic
return of 10.3% and a financial return of 18.7%. Net annual foreign exchange
savings at normal production are estimated at $6.5 million.



- iii -
xii.      IDA has recently made a credit to India for expansion by the Gov-
ernment owned enterprise Fertilisers and Chemicals, Travancore Limited (FACT)
in Cochin and IFC lhas participated in two private sector fertilizer projects
in India - Indian Explosives Ltd. in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh and Zuari Agro
Chemicals Ltd. in Goa. Indian Explosives, a competitor of Gorakhpur, is op-
erating and Zuari Agro is expected on-stream in mid-1972. IDA is now apprais
ing the Nangal expansion project of FCI and IFC is presently evaluating a
similar urea project for Ilindustan Lever Ltd., both in Punjab State. In ad-
dition, the bank is Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed phosphate mining
project study in Rajasthan.
xiii.     Based on the assurances obtained during negotiations, the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of $10 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Governmnent of India (GOI) has requested financing from the In-
ternational Development Association (IDA) to expand facilities of the Gorakh-
pur Unit of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI). The expansion project
would increase design  capacity from 179,500 metric tons per year (TPY) urea 1/
to 313,500 TPY.
1.02      Gorakdipur, located in eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), is one of five
presently operating units of the company (see Maps 1 and 2). FCI is wholly
owned by the Government, and the largest fertilizer producer in India. The
company began production in 1948 2/ and has been incorporated in its present
form since 1961. It is expanding rapidly with six other projects now under
construction and several additiornal projects, including the Nangal Project,
under consideration.
1.03      Tlhe project was suggested by an IDA mission in late 1969 as a ra-
tionalizatinn or "debottlonecking" program to utilize spare capacity built
inte the ori-inal plant. FCI and the plant constructors, Toyo Engineering
Corporation of Japan (Toyo) evaluated IDA's proposal and concluded that the
optimum scherc Was to incorporate all spare equipment with additional equip-
ment and expand production by about 75%. IDA agrees with the project scope
as now envisaged.
1.04      The appraisal treats Gorakhpur as a separate entity with analysis
of PCI limited to its overall operations and its present financial position.
'[le Naangal Project, which represents a imuch larger investment, is currently
being appraised and will include a more comprehensive evaluation, including
long-range projections. In view of the large number of projects under con-
struction and beinrg planned, additional study is needed to determine fully
the company's future operations and financial prospects. Given the benefits
to Inhdia [rom expandin1g production at Corakhpur, this small project should
not he delayed while thie overall appraisal of FCI is being completed.

Pex L. Bosson of the Industrial Projects Department based on missions to
India in May and July 1971.
II. ECd'S EXISTINIG OPERATIONS
A.  iHistory and Org,anization
2.01      FCT was incorporated in 1961 under the Companies Act of India, rep-
resentin,g a merger of two existing public sector companies - Sindri Fertiliz-
ers and Chemicals Ltd. at Sindri, Bihar and Hindustan Chemicals and Fertiliz-
ers Ltd. at Nangal, Punjab.  These two companies began production in 1948 and
1/   Urea, a solid fertilizer material containinig 46% nitrogen, is used ex-
tensivelv in fertilizing rice and wheat.

1961, respectively. The autliorized shiare capital is presently 1's 2,00)0i l1i 1-
lion ($267 million) with Rs 1 ,155 million ($154 million) ini sih:ares otut;sLand-
ing; all owned by GOI.  Sales have grown steadily to Rs 73½ 1ojliion ($97
million) for the last fiscal year.  FCT is the largest producer of fertilizer
in India with 30% of nitrogen and 10% of phosphate capacity.  ,ihis market
share will grow substanitially through tihe 1970's.
2.02      The operating uinits (or divisions) are (1) Trombay, (2) Nangal, (3)
Gorakhpur, (4) Sindri and (5) Namrup.  Another division, Planning and Develop-
ment (P & D), is responsible for engineering, research and developnment. In
addition, the company has several major projects under construction: (1)
Durgapur, (2) Barauni, (3) Namrup Expansion, (4) Ramagundam, (5) Talcher,
and (6) Sindri Rationalization. Several other projects are being actively
considered, namely (1) Gorakhpur Expansion, (2) Nangal Expansion, (3) Trombay
Expansion, (4) Trombay Debottlenecking, (5) Haldia, (6) Korba and (7) Sindri
Expansion.  These divisions and projects are described in Annex 1 inclucling
capacities and sources of financing.
2.03      Existing employment is approximately 19,000 people, which is high.
This figure includes operating personnel and ancillary employment for company-
operated schools, hospitals, townshins and training programs at each factory.
B.   FCI Management
2.04      FCI is managed by a 12-member Board of Directors of whiich four are
senior managers from rCI, tlhree from government ministries, two from govern-
ment-owned corporations and three from other industries.  Present Board m!ewl-
bership is given in Annex 1 and includes the Chairman, Mr. 1. N. Sethna; andl
Managing Director, Dr. K. R. Cha1cravorty.  Most Board members are in the In-
dian Administrative Service (IAS) and the influence of GOI is felt strongly
in the company's management. Tenure for Board members averages about two
years for present membershiip, and its effectiveness is likely ir:paired as
a restilt.  The Board is designed to function as a policy-raking body anic as
a liaison and coordinating group betWeen FCI and the Covernment.
2.05      The Managing Director and three Functional Directors (t'roduction
and Mlarketing, Projects, and Finance) direct the company's overall policy,
growth and operations through a Committee of Management.  Theso executives,
who are on the Board, are in effect selected by GOI although formally they
are appointed by the Board.  These posts are now filled by managers with
substantial industrial experience in FCI and improvenent in corporate manage-
ment since the IDA mission in June/July 1969 is evident.  -lowever, further
improvement is needed in marketin-,, project implemientation, management re-
porting, and correcting operating problems.
2.06      Eachi Operating TJnit is managed as a separate cost center and dny-
to-day production functions are controlled by the unit General M1anagers.
The company's rapid growth has created a shortage of experience(d managers
and unit General Ifanagers have been changed more often than desirable.  [he
Gorakhpur General Manager was recently transferred and was replaced by the
former Deputy General Manager who is capable and experienced. FCI has
agreed to inform IDA before making further changes.

C.   Financial Analysis of FCI
2.07      Financial management of such a large and growing company is under-
standably complex. Each unit prepares monthly statements which are available
within a few days from the end of the month. From these statements monthly
and quarterly reports are prepared for individual units. FCI prepares an
annual budget for the following year which sets production and profit goals
as well as forecast of capital needs. However, budgeted goals are often
optimistically high and budgets are not periodically adjusted to reflect
actual operating conditions. The company's annual report is audited by pri-
vate auditors and then by Government auditors and is published about eight
months from the end of the fiscal year.
2.08      Historical income statements for the company are given in Annex 2
and summarized below:

/1   The above adjustments are taken from the succeeding year's published
accounts and reflect expenses charged to subsequent years.  However,
FCI does not restate earnings for the affected year and net reported
income for the period greatly exceeds its actual income after adjust-
ments.
2.09      FCI has made a profit in all but one recent year, but its earnings
have not been satisfactory. This difficulty is due pririarily to delays in
bringing new plants into operation and to low production levels. As seen in
Annexes 1 and 2 performance and profitability of individual plants have varied
considerably. Nangal and Gorakhpur nave consistently operated quite well al-
though Nangal has recently experienced a power shortage and had to curtail
production. The profitability of Sindri has declined due to small and anti-
quated plants, and in recent years, Sindri has experienced heavy losses. FCI
has had difficulty in operatirng Troabay and Namrup and these have severely
affected FCI's profitability.

Company growth has been rapid in recent years and much of the increase in
total assets represents construction of new projects. New projects are cur-
rently financed 50% in debt and 50% in equity and as a consequence, the com-
pany is in an acceptable financial position.

2.11      Gorakhpur Unit is a medium-size urea factory located in Gorakhpur
district in eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP).  Plant capacity is 179,500 TPY urea
(82,500 TPY N) in two trains. Ammonia is produced from cracked naphtha 1/
received by rail from the Barauni refinery of Indian Oil Company. The plant's
power requirements (40 MW) are obtained from power stations about 350 km
away. Employment is high, totaling about 2,000 personnel including staff
for schools, hospitals, and township operation. Installed spares for exist-
ing equipment form the basis for the expansion project. The technology and
plant size employed are not competitive with present modern day designs, but
1/   Cracked naphtha is a petroleum (middle distillate) fraction containing
about 25-30% unsaturated hydrocarbons. It is a refinery by-product and
there is no shortage in India as there is with straight-run naphtha.



-5-
wuen planned in 1962 it represented the best available proven technology.
The orThinal plant was desicned and erected by Toyo with assistance of FCI's
P & D Division and has been producing, since 1968.  It is over-designed in
terms of equilpmcnt size, layout and spare capacity.  However, basic design
is good, as is maintenance, and the plant regularly produces 100-105% of
rated daily dlesi;.-T capacity. It is now fully managed and operated by FCI
staff with no outside assistance.
2.1'       Corakhour product-d 82% of its design capacity last year despite
pouer and equipment failures and a naphtha shortage caused by a rail strike.
Power generation and transnission facilities are being steadily improved in
eastern UP and power interruptions should decrease (see Annex 1).  Gorakhpur's
management is adept at understanding and solving production problems and can
reasonably be expccted to achieve and maintain current budgeted production
goals.
2.13       Most of its uirea output is sold in eastern and central UP.  This
reginn is  intinsely. crop-pedl in rice, wheat, sugar cane and maize, and is a
aijor fertilizer consuming area.  MTarketing, which is discussed further in
Chapter VI, iz not a pro,l-em.

In its three years of operations Gorakhpur has performed well. Plant utiliza-
tion is considerably above the average of FCI's other fertilizer operations
and net income as a percentage of sales was 18% and 10% in the past two years.
The principal reason for this drop was an increase in power and fuel costs.
Net income for FCI was 1.4% and 1.3% of sales in these years.
2.16      Existing Gorakhpur facilities were financed with funds from GOI
at a debt:equity ratio of 68:32. Interest rates varied from 6-7% per annum,
depending on GOI policy at the time of loan withdrawal. Foreign exchange
costs were covered in part by a Japanese yen credit of Rs 143 million equiv-
alent ($19.1 million) to GOI at 5.75% interest with a total maturity of 15
years. FCI's debt for Gorakhpur to GOI is expressed in rupees with the gov-
ernment assuming the foreign exchange risk of the Japanese credit.
2.17      Debt borrowed by FCI is allocated to the divisions as used.  ILow-
ever, the repayment from the division to FCI is based on a nominal schedule,
usually ten equal annual repayments from start of commercial production.
Since this repayment schedule may not correspond to the actual terms on which
FCI obtained the loans, the aggregate debt schedule for the divisions does
not necessarily correspond to FCI debt. Cash generated above normal require-
ments is transferred to FCI Head Office. FCI may treat this surplus cash as
a credit to the division or as a pre-payment of debt owed FCI by the division.
For the past three years Gorakhpur has generated excess cash which has been
used primarily to prepay its debt. Had this cash been retained in Gorakhpur,,
its current ratio would be much higher than the existing ratio of 1.1:1. At
present Gorakhpur has a conservative debt equity ratio of 53:47 and last
year's operation provided a debt service coverage of 1.6:1.

2.18      FCI has agreed to improve its accounting procedures, where
necessary, in stating separately and clearly the financial position of
Gorakhpur (and other units) and FCI as a whole. Source and application
of funds for Gorakhpur including funds for the proposed project will be
stated separately. Quarterly projections and budgets will be included in
Gorakhpur's quarterly financial reports. Working capital at Gorakhpur
will be maintained at an adequate level and cash will not be transferred
to the company if Gorakhpur's current ratio would be reduced below 1.1:1.
III. PROPOSED GORAKHPUR EXPANSION PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
3.01      The proposed project will increase urea design capacity from 544
metric tons per day (TPD) to 950 TPD. Corresponding annual capacities are
179,500 and 313,500 TPY urea, respectively. Daily production rate will be
guaranteed by Toyo (see para. 5.03). Design capacity for ammonia, an inter-
mediate product, will be increased from 116,000 to 188,000 TPY.  The opera-
tion will continue to be based on cracked naphtha from Barauni. Required
facilities are ammonia and urea plants to be based on designs from Toyo, who
supplied the original plant. The expansion project will utilize installed
spare equipment as well as spare capacity in existing equipment. Offsite fa-
cilities, such as steam, power, and water supply and storage require only
iinimal expansion since excess capacity was installed originally.
B.   Project Description
3.02      Production plants at Gorakhpur are small by today's standards and
design condlitions require the relatively high production cost technology of
existing designs to be used also in the expansion project. Ilowever, the
process plants and equipment are conventional and commercial designs. Capi-
tal costs are low enough to offset these high operating costs and make the
project economically attractive (see para. 7.07).
3.03      Ammonia will be produced in several steps beginning with partial
oxidation of naphtha.  The resulting carbon monoxide and hydrogen is further
reacted to carbon dioxide and additional hydrogen. Carbon dioxide is removed
froml the process gases wlhicli are purified by washing withi liquid nitrogen.
Additionial nitrogen is added and the gases are compressed and converted into
ammonia. N,itrogen and oxygen requirements are supplied by an air separation
plant.
3. 04     Aiiiiiioni;a is combined with the carbon dioxide produced above and re-
acLed undcr pressure Lo form ammonium carbamate and tlhen further processed
inito tirea.  I'lMiS solution is concentrated to an anhydrous melt wlhichi is sol-



- 8 -
idified into spheres or "prills". The urea process to be used is Toyo's
"Improved Total Recycle 'C' Process", which has a lower utility consuluption
than the existing plant.
3.05      After expansion Gorakhpur will require 50 MI power (as against 4()
NW at present) from the UP State Electricity Board (UPSUB) stations at lilhaind
(hydroelectric) and Obra (thermal). FCI has a letter of intent from UlPSEl
agreeing to provide additional power requirements as an extensioni of tile ex-
isting power contract. This region is on a power grid and additional gener-
ation and transmission facilities are being installed and will be in opera-
tion before the urea expansion project. It is therefore expected that ade-
quate power will be available. A more detailed project description is given
in Annex 6.
C.   Ecology
3.06      Ammonia/urea plants are relatively free from pollution problems
with the only significant potential concern being discharge of free ammonia
in liquid effluents. Aquatic life is sensitive to small quantities of un-
neutralized ammonia. Water requirements are obtained from tubewells and a
nearby lake. Gorakhpur recycles much of its water requirements by use of
cooling towers and collects any discharged water in closed lagoons. Ammonia
either evaporates or is neutralized before discharging outside the plant en-
vironment. Total nitrogen involved is small and insufficient to lhave any ef-
fect on algae growth or other related ecological problems. These practices
are normal design and are considered adequate. All necessary pollution con-
trol facilities are included in the existing plant and no further capital ex-
penditures are required.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCIAL PLA.i
A.   Capital Costs
4.01      Total estimated capital required for the project is Rs 120 million
($16.0 million) including interest during construction. These costs are given
in detail in Annex 7 and are summarized below:

Total Financing Required  54.8        65.2   120.0   7.30    8.70   16.00 100.0
4.02      These estimates were prepared in early 1971 by Toyo and FCI and were
based on current prices plus escalation of about 10%.  Engineering fees in-
clude some contingency and FCI is now negotiating a fixed price contract with
Toyo that should be less than the fees given above. The project is well-
defined since most equipment is duplication of existing designs and the phys-
ical contingency given, 8% of direct project costs or 14% of equipment, ma-
terials, and freight, is adequate. Recent changes in world currency values
indicate the project could incur increased foreign exchange costs of about
$0.2-0.5 million. FCI and Toyo are evaluating several possible cost reduc-
tions (Annex 6) that will not affect capacity and guarantees, therefore no
revisions in project costs were made at this time. With the small increase
expected it does not appear that any change in the financial plan will be
needed.
4.03      Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $8.7 million based on about
4% of equipmenit being reserved for Indian procurement and the expectation that
22% of internationally bid equipment will be won by Indian suppliers. For-
eign exchange costs would be $9.3 million if Indian suppliers win only 10%
of the internationally bidl equipment, and $8.0 million if they win 35%.  About
$0.4 millioni in equipnment should be supplied from Japan due to proprietary
designs. Engineering services to Toyo are about $1.8 million.



- 10 -
B.   Working Capital Requirements
4.04      Working capital requirements (Annex 8) are estimated to increase
from Rs 42 million to Rs 55 million as a result of the expansion project.  Iii-
ventories of raw material, product and spare parts will increase proportion-
ately less than the capacity increase.  Substantially all additional working
capital is for accounts receivable and storage and about 752 of these funds
are carried as commercial bank credit. Working capital includes accounts re-
ceivable of 30 days which are adequate since Gorakhpur sells rmost of its pro-
duction to co-operative dealers and agricultural credit organizat[ons (see
Chapter VI on marketing) that pay on delivery. The farmning area lhas two crop
seasons and distributors take delivery uniformly.  Variations in monthly re-
tail sales are largely absorbed by dealer storage capacity and his working
capital. Marginal or permanent working capital requiremanents for tlhte project
are estimated at Rs 3.2 million.
C.   Financial Plan
4.05      The Rs 120 million ($16.0 million) financing needed for the project
will be provided by GOI with Rs 75.0 million as debt and 1s 45.0 msillion in
equity.
4.06      Proceeds of the proposed IDA credit of Rs 75.0 million ($10.0 mil-
lion) would be relent by the Government to FCI. The on-lending interest
rate for the IDA credit has been agreed at 8.5% per annum. GOI's normal pol-
icy is to approve funds for the entire project and then disburse in semi-
annual or quarterly installments. Each disbursement constitutes a separate
loan with a three-year grace and ten-year repayment period. Final disburse-
ment for the project is expected in the third year and the last maturity in
the fifteenth year (Annex 9). The loan to FCI is expressed in rupees and ex-
change risk remains with the Government.
4.07      To protect against an unexpected overrun in project costs (both
foreign exchange and local costs) GOI has agreed to provide additional funds
as necessary to complete the project. These funds would be contributed with
at least half as equity as part of GOI's normal lending to FCI.
D.   Allocation of IDA Credit
4.08      Proceeds of the IDA credit would be used as follows:

The IDA credit will cover CIF cost of imported equipment and ex-factory price
(excluding taxes) of locally procured equipment that is internationally bid.
It will also include part of foreign exchange costs of process licenses and
consultants' services and a portion of FCI's local costs for engineering and
equipment erection. The project's foreign exchange content is about $8.7
million as discussed in para. 4.03. Projected disbursement schedule for the
IDA credit is given in Annex 9.
V. PROJECT EXECUTION
A. Project Management
5.01      Project management for FCI projects has not been clearly delineated
with responsibility for project execution divided between P & D and the
General Manager of the division involved. FCI has agreed to modify its pro-
cedures for the Gorakhpur Project and an experienced Project Manager has been
appointed from FCI's staff. He will report to Gorakhpur's General Manager and
through him to FCI's Director of Projects and have overall responsibility for
budget and schedule. P & D will provide required engineering, design, and pro-
curement services and construction by the unit's General Manager with all of
these functions controlled by the project manager. FCI has prepared a
detailed plan of project implementation through commercial production giving
responsibilities of the project manager, General Manager and P & D. FCI
has agreed to give IDA due notice before any change is made in the position
of the Project Manager.
5.02      P & D Division has considerable design experience in ammonia-urea
plants through FCI's urea projects including the existing Gorakhpur plant.
The expansion project is virtually a duplicate of existing design and no dif-
ficulty is envisaged in FCI and P & D completing it satisfactorily. Manage-
ment is described more fully in Annex 1.
B. Technical Assistance
5.03      Toyo will do basic engineering for ammonia and urea designs and ad-
vise P & D on engineering work and assist in erection and commissioning.
Toyo's responsibility will permit them to guarantee daily capacity perform-
ance in a seven-day test run. Toyo's guarantees are limited primarily to the
process design. Final contract terms, including penalties have not been com-
pleted, but the guarantees are considered adequate. Other process licensors
involved are Shell and Benfield, with which FCI has prior agreements.
P & D obtains required know-how from these firms and then completes the en-
gineering. It has sufficient experience in these areas to execute designs
for Gorakhpur properly. During the project's early stages FCI and Toyo will
evaluate several additional design changes (described in Annex 6) that could
possibly reduce the plant costs further.



- 12 -
C. Project Schedule and Procurement
5.04      FCI has prepared a critical path schedule showing a project comple-
tion time of 30 months, based on information from Toyo and including three to
four months contingency. This schedule should be easily attainable due to
equipment duplication and its small size and simplicity. Schedule will be
the project manager's responsibility with the assistance of P & D and Toyo's
role in execution should permit them to exercise some influence on maintain-
ing schedule. The chart in Annex 10 shows completion time of major events
in the project's schedule.
5.05      Most equipment will be bid on international competitive tender in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Indian suppliers will be given a 15% cost
preference in bid evaluations (prevailing duty is now 30%) compared against
the CIF (without duty) India price on bids. About 4% of total estimated
equipment value will be reserved for procurement from Indian suppliers
which is not critical and not likely to affect the project schedule or
quality. Also about 5% of total equipment is proprietary designs to be
procured in Japan. GOI has given assurance that any required import
license will be issued promptly. GOI has also given assurance that, if
delivery of locally procured equipment (either from reserve list or won by
international competitive tender) becomes critical, then GOI will permit
procurement to be expedited from other sources. In collaboration with Toyo,
PCI will prepare suitable bid packages which will permit qualified Indian
suppliers to compete on smaller packages but still maintain project schedule
and equipment standardization requirements.
VI. MARKET AND MARKETING
A. Present Situation in India
6.01      At present India has insufficient production capacity to meet fer-
tilizer demand. Details of the present fertilizer situation and recent his-
torical data for supply and demand of nitrogen fertilizer are given in Annex
11. Current plans propose increasing reliance on fuel oil and coal as feed-
stock for nitrogen fertilizer production. Delays in plant construction and
low capacity utilization of existing plants have caused the production de-
ficit to remain.
B. Market Forecast for India
6.02      Supply and demand projections of nitrogen for India are shown below.
Supply forecasts are IDA estimates based on information obtained from GOI with
details shown in Annex 11. All major fertilizer plants are shown on Map 1,



- 13 -
including phosphate as well as nitrogen facilities. Demand forecasts are
taken from a report recently prepared by the Bank and GOI. 1/

FY79         5100          4300            800
6.03       These data indicate a substantial nitrogen deficit throughout the
po'riod ranging from 540,000-910,000 TPY.  The forecasts assume nitrogen con-
sumption will grow at 13.5% compounded annually until FY74 and at 12% tlhere-
after. There is a discrepancy between the FY71 figures given above and re-
cent GO1 publislhed figures which indicate consumption of only 1,425,000 tons
of N.  This inatter is now being reviewed to reconcile the difference and de-
termine its effect on future demand projections. Supply forecasts are
based on a realizable but optimistic schedule for new projects and on all
plants achieving 90% capacity utilization, which is considerably above the
overall levels achieved in the recent past. This represents IDA's estimate
of maximum fertilizer production India can be expected to achieve.  If
assumptions on capacity utilization and schedule of projects are not ful-
filled, then estimated supply could be 10-20% below forecasts. Although
there is a degree of uncertainty in the forecasts, IDA expects a deficit to
exist througlhout the 1970's.
C. Fertilizer Market in East India 2/
6.04       The principal marketing zone for Gorakhpur is eastern and central
UP witlh sales becominig increasingly concentrated in eastern UP. However, con-
siderable urea production capacity is under construction in Bihar, Assam and
West Bengal in other FCI plants. Supply and demand for East India is shown
in detail in Annex 11.  Most new capacity is urea and it is assumed that urea
can supply 70% of nitrogen demand with the balance being required as ammonium
sulfate or mixed fertilizers.

D. Brown (IBRD) Mlay, 1971.
2/   States of Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar.



- 14 -
6.05      There is currently a nitrogen deficit in East India which is expec-
ted to remain and increase except for 1974/75 when an apparent balance be-
tween supply and demand will exist. The 70% market allocation Lo urei slhows
a small urea surplus from 1974-76 but with a widening deficit tlhercafter.
This small surplus will most likely be shipped by broad gauge rail to North
India since the additional transport cost relative to the increased distances
involved is less costly to the producers than the expense of trans-shipment
to the meter gauge rail serving Corakhpur's principal marketing zone. Supply
forecasts do not include the proposed Sindri or Hlaldia urea projects aIs this
additional capacity is not needed until the late 1970's. In planning further
expansion, it is recommended that GOI and FCI should study regional demand
for fertilizers to assure the most economic plant locations and to minimize
regional supply/demand imbalances. Also more consideration should be given
to products otlher than urea.
D. Gorakhpur Marketing
6.06      Gorakhpur sells its production in UP through Apex Agencies, co-
operatives, and private dealers. Apex Agencies are credit institutions
that provide credit and other services on a state level to co-operatives and
farmers. Four institutions operate in UP which are described in Anne. 12
along with other details of Corakhpur's marketing system. The Apex Agencies
are structurally sound and are supported financially by the State, GOI, and/
or Reserve Bank of India.  At present Gorakhpur does not provide credit fa-
cilities but as fertilizer consumption increases, the company miglht have to
take a more active role in provision of credit.
6.07      FCI's marketing program for the Eastern region is coordinated
through its Eastern Marketing Zone Division headquartered in Calcutta. Go-
rakhpur has a marketing manager for its output and the program includes
such activities as advertising, demonstrations, soil testing and dealer de-
velopment and supervision. Marketing is the responsibility of the Director
of Production and Marketing.  FCI has plans to establish a Northern M-larket-
ing Zone which will include the Nangal and Gorakhpur regions.  This will
help to separate Management rexponsibilities for production alnd marketing;
nevertlheless, given the magnitude of FCI's production potential, it should
place more emphasis on long-range planning of its mar'.eting effort antd
should consider the use of outside assistance in marketing.
6.08      Estimated market allocations for Gorakhpur are shown below based on
1976 production and consumption forecasts from FCI, whiiclh are imore conserva-
tive than IDA forecasts.

/1   Includes total production of GorakhDur, IEL, and DCMI, although all pro-
ducers sell in other states.
By supplying only 64Z of the projected demand in its immediate area where it
has a distinct freight advantage and 18-27% in the other regions, Gorakhpur
can sell its entire outout within UP. At present the Government Fertilizer
Pool sells about 10% of the fcrtilizer consumed in the area since local pro-
ducers cannot mneet demand. Although Gorakhpur may continue to sell urea in
lwestern Bihar the market analysis above (Para. 6.05) suggests that the major
effort should be away from areas to be supplied by other FCI urea plants.
Goralkihpur should be able to sell all of its production in Eastern UP in 1979
and still only provide about 73% of the market. Thus no difficulties are
foreseen in Gorakhpur's marketing program.
EI. Sales Prices and Competition
6.09      Fertilizer prices in India are generally based on prices set by
the Government Fertilizer Pool. Urea has an official ceiling price and,
while other fertilizer materials have no official control prices, the Pool
handles a large enough fraction of sales to set prices effectively. Since
FCI is a wholly-owned government corporation, there is no likelihood that it
will deviate from GOI pricing policy. Retail urea price in UP was reduced
R's 20/ton in may 1971 to 1zs 923/ton which inclu(les dealer margin of I's 80/ton.
A 1(), excise ta- of Is 75/ton and average freiglht of Rs 25/ton provides Gorakh-
pur with an ex-factory pricc of Rs 743/ton ($99/ton) urea whichi is consider-
ably above tlhe cost of imported urea of Rs 555/ton CIF Gorakhpur (at an ex-
cliange rate of Rs 7.5/$1.0).  iowever, since all urea is imported by the Gov-
eriimenit whiclh resells to dealers at the same price as Gorakhpur (Rs 843/ton)
Goraklhpur's ex--factory price is not affected by imports.  Operating costs for
urea in the (ex-.ponsion project are Rs 478/ton, assuming a 10% return on gross
investment, which tnhdicates that no protection is needed to ensure the viabil-
ity oF thoe (I);ansion.  Onh the same basis operating costs at Gorakhpur after
cxpal.nionl Wi 1  1 II(' "g r26)/ton wlicih indicates a small protection level of about

6.10      Principal competitors are Indian Explosives Limited (Il.) in IKanpur,
UP and Delhi Cloth Hlills Ltd. (DCM) in Kotah, Rajasthaii.  However, 1.astern
UP is somexwhat isolated from  these and other competitionl by its meter jaugo
rail system that connects the region witli Lucknow and Assamn (see ,!al 2).  I.i .,
DCM, and FCI-Barauni, are all located on broad gauge rail lines aind tihe re-
quired transshipment, in addition to the distance involved, mal-es thleir freight
charges to the Gorakhpur area much higher.  Since the increased freight cost
must be absorbed by the producers they will tend to ship to are;.s witlh tile low-
est transport and handling costs.  Thus, Gorakhpur is somewhat protected in its
immediate marketing area.
VII. OPERATING COSTS

are shown in Annex 13 and are summarized below:

7.02      Full capacity is assumed at 330 days/year operation, which thie
plant should be able to maintain as power problems are correctedl. Ilowever,
operating costs were determined based on '315 days/year operation and income
statements are based on this production level.  Operating costs of the ex-
pansion are incremental costs and do not reflect any labor, overhead, or
selling costs since these will be provided by the existing labor force anid
facilities.  Operating costs are lower than existing costs due principally



- 17 -
to savings in labor and overhead (Rs 106/ton), lower depreciation (Rs 65/
ton) and improved process efficiency (Rs 30/toni).
7.03      Naphtha is delivered to Gorakhpur at a cost of Rs 233/ton ($31/ton)
from the Barauni refinery of Indian Oil including Rs 60/ton freight and Rs
13/ton excise tax. ilaphtha costs set by GOI are based on cost of imported
crude oil. The world market price for naphtha is about $20-24/ton CIF Cal-
cutta. FCI has an existing contract for naphtha supply from Indian Oil which
has agreed to provide expansion requirements also. The Barauni refinery has
sufficient capacity to supply the additional Gorakhpur requirements.
7.04      Coal is purchased under contract from two nearby collieries at
Rs 67.5/ton ($9/ton) which is a reasonable price. Gorakhpur has exper-
ienced no difficulty in coal supply although availability of rail wagons
has been critical at times.
7.05      Power requirements (50 MW) will be purchased under contract from
UPSEB at a cost of Rs 91/MWH (12 mils /KWH) which includes Rs 10/MWH excise
duty. The power cost compares to 6-9 mils /KWH in most industrial countries.
Increased power requirements will be met through an additional transmission
line now under construction, which will be completed before the Gorakhpur
project.
7.06      Operating costs of the existing plant are high due to excessive
capital costs and high power consumption required by the process technology
used. The expansion project uses the same technology but capital costs
are significantly lower. Although the plants are small, incremental operat-
ing costs for the expansion project compare favorably with costs of a large,
modern urea factory. Ex-factory operating costs are compared below for sev-
eral recent Bank group urea projects:

3.02      The internal financial rate of return (financial return) for the
project is 29.8% and it improves the overall financial return of the Gorakh-
pur Unit to 11.3%.  Further details, including sensitivity tests, are given
in Annex 15. The project's profitability results from the high selling
price for urea and the relatively low capital costs. Average increTnental
income before taxes for FY76-81 is Rs 35 million ($4.7 million) compared to
Rs 14 million ($1.9 million) for existing facilities.
3.03       Taxes are difficult to calculate since income taxes are paid only
on consolidated income statements. FCI has not paid any income tax due to
low profits and tax benefits accruing from expansion projects, and capital
expansion over the next few years will continue to give the corporation a
low tax liability. Taxes, however, were calculated on a notional basis and
for Gorakhpur would begin in FY78 (Annex 14).
3.04      Profit breakeven level for the existing plant is currently about
80% of capacity and reduces to about 58% for the expanded plant. Respec-
tive cash breakeven levels are about 55% and 52% and rapidly decrease as
debt is repaid. A breakeven chart for profit and cash is shown in Annex 16.
B. Economic Analysis
8.05       The internal economic rate of return (economic return) for the
project is 19.2% based on urea at $65/ton CIF India plus Rs 70/ton inland
freight and handling. Details including sensitivity tests are given in An-
nex 15. The economic return for existing facilities would be much lower on
the same basis but it should be noted that the imported price for urea was in
the order of $100/ton when the present plant was being planned. A major con-
tributing factor to the relatively low economic return of urea projects in
India is the high cost of feedstock based on imported crude oil. In most
other locations (U.S., 'lid-East) nitrogen production is based on natural gas
which is plentiful and cheap. The economic return for the Gorakhpur Project
is relatively high because it represents an incremental expansion which uti-
lizes already installed (but unusable) capital assets as well as the exist-
ing labor force.
8.06       Indirect economic benefits are difficult to describe quantitative-
ly.  There shIould be no increase in employment at Gorakhpur but the project
will permit some factory workers to be upgraded.  Related industries such as
marketing and transportation will be expanded as a result of the project.
P & I) is doing most of the engineering, thereby saving foreign exchange and
building up dlomestic engineering experience.
C.  Sensitivity Tests
8.07       Sensitivity of the project's financial viability was determined
for several factors.  A 10' reduction in urea selling price reduces the
financial return to 23.2P  and a 10% increase in operating costs decreases
the financial retturn to 26.3%.  A six-month project delay decreases the
financial return to 26.1%. At 90% capacity utilization the financial re-



- 20 -
turn is 28.0%.  The combined effect of a six month project delay, 90% oper-
ating level, and a 10% decrease in price would give a return of 18.7%'. TIhis
is considered the worst likely turn of events. A cost overrun of 10% decreases
the return to 26.9% but is not considered likely since further design changes
should give lower capital costs than now estimated. These sensitivity anal-
yses show that the most critical variables are product prices, capital costs,
and naphtha and power costs. Prices of urea and naphtha are set independently
by Government policy and there is no relationship between changes in the two.
8.08      The economic return is much more sensitive to these same variables
than the financial return,  the most critical being urea sales price.  The
economic return is 12.5% if assumed urea sales price decreases 10% to $57.5/
ton CIF India. The economic return decreases to 18.0% for 90% operating
level and to 17.7% for a six-month delay. The combined effect of a 10%
price decrease, 90% operating level and a six-month delay gives a return
of 10.3%. World urea prices have dropped drastically over the past few
years from over $100/ton to about $50-70/ton and delivered prices to India
have decreased accordingly. Worldwide excess capacity has been installed,
particularly in the Hlid-East and some urea has been offered at distress
prices. Future world urea prices are therefore difficult to predict, but
are expected to average about $65/ton CIF India.
D. Foreign Exchange Savings
8.09      Net foreign exchange savings (shown in Annex 17) for the expan-
sion project are estimated at $6.5 million annually at normal production
(95% capacity). Annual local costs required to achieve these savings are
Rs 38 million ($5.1 million), indicating an efficient import substitution.
IX. FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION OF FCI AND GORAKIIPUR UNIT
A. FCT
9.01      Provisional statements for FY71 show that FCI had a debt:equity
ratio of 44:56 and current ratio of 1.4:1. In that year FCI realized a net
profit of Rs 10 million and had a debt service coverage of 1.1:1. Princi--
pal due on outstanding debt rises sharply in succeeding years and greatly
increased net profits will be necessary if FCI is to cover its debt. It
is unclear whether net income will permit FCI to cover its debt service re-
quirements in the next two years and some refinancing may be necessary.
FCI's cash generation should increase as production builds up in existing
plants. One new plant (Durgapur) is expected to start production this vear
and two more next year. Success of these plants in going into production
rapidly will have a marked effect upon the company's cash generation, and
ability to service debt.
9.02      GOI arrangements for financing of projects now under construction,
which represent about 36% of company's assets and 75% of its potential ferti-
Iizer output, will have a large effect on the company's future financial



- 21 -
position. Capital funds, if supplied by GOI as 50% debt and 50% equity,
should keep FCI in a conservative financial position. FCI is currently pre-
paring a projection of the company's operating and financial position through
1979. An analysis of FCI's performance and future outlook will be included
in the Nangal appraisal.

Gorakhpur, along with Nangal, is the most profitable of existing operating
divisions. Surplus cash generated, from these units including the Gorakhpur
expansion project, will greatly assist FCI in improving its financial via-
bility.

but cash surpluses are shown as a separate account since they would be
transferred to FCI's head office accounts and not retained by Gorakhpur.
Debt service coverage increases from 1.4:1 at present, to 2.26 during 1975-
79 and increases rapidly thereafter. This coverage is considered reasonable.
9.08      Based on expected cash generation, Gorakhipur could pre-pay its
debt to FCI at a rapid pace. In view of heavy obligations by FCI for new
projects in the future, FCI has agreed not to prepay debt or pay dividends
to GOI If consolidated company accounts indicate a current ratio  Velow
1.5:1 after making such payments. GOI has given assurance that it will
maintain FCI in a satisfactory financial position, with equity at least equal
to long-term debt, a current ratio of at least 1.2:1, and provide necessary
funds to complete all projects.

ANNEX 1
FCI: Gorakhpur Expansion Project
Fertilizer Corporation of India
A.   Existing Operating Divisions
T'here are five presently operating units, plus the P & D Division,
which are described below. Basic data of these operating units, along with
the expansion projects are summarized in the table, page 8 of the annex.
IHistorical performance for the operating divisions is given in the tables
on pages 9 and 10 of this annex which indicates the production capacity and
actual production of the units. On an overall FCI basis, capacity utiliza-
tion has averaged 727 for nitrogen production and 57% for phosphate produc-
tion over the past 3 years. An analysis of the tables, however, indicates
that Gorakhpur and Nangal have had relatively little difficulty (except
Nangal's power problems in 1971) and have consistently operated at high
levels of efficiency. The other three plants, Sindri, Trombay and Namrup
have continuing operating problems with the result that they operate con-
siderably under the levels for FCI as a whole. The result of these levels
of output is reflected in the table indicating the net profit of each unit,
whichi is shown in annex 2, page 2. This table indicates that the Nangal
unit has earned more than twice as much over the last seven years as FCI as
a whole. Gorakhpur's contributions to earnings are significant for the
three years it has been in operation and are likely to grow in the future
as its power problems are solved. Sindri's operations, as its plant be-
comes older, are becoming increasingly less profitable and it has operated
at losses for the past three years. Trombay and Namrup have operated at
losses in all of the years in which they have been operating, with the ex-
ception of a small profit tentatively indicated for Trombay for 1971. It
should be noted, however, that Trombay has, in all recent years, charged
off in subsequent years some additional expenses which should have been
charged in tne previous year, and it is not yet clear whether Trombay in
fact made. a profit of the level indicated.
1.   Trombay (Nlaharashtra)
The Trombay UJnit produces primarily urea and nitrophosphate plus
several additional chemicals such as methanol.  Initial production was begun
in 1965 after considerable delays in project implementation. The plant was
financed with funds from  r.S. AID and GOI.  The major plant units are ammonia
(Chemico), uirea (Chemico), nitric acid (C & I Girdler) and nitrophosphate
(C & I Girdler) with design contractors listed in parenthesis. The plants
have high construction costs and technical difficulties have occurred. FCI's
operations of the plants have been at a relatively low output level reflect-
Ing both technical problems and inefficient plant management. At the present
time FCI is un(lerstood to be involved in legal action against the contractors.
The plants operated abouit 50-60% capacity and have unusually high maintenance
costs. Th1e in-itial fiancial plan was much heavier in debt than normal for
FCl - 707 - and the high debt service has also contributed to the poor prof-
it performance of Troinbay.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
The company has takeni steps to improve performance iii this dlivi sion.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (USA) sent a team of experts in 1907 whio made
certain recommendations.  As a result of a Bank missioll in 19)(9 thle Bank at
tempted to work with FCI in obtaining outside consultants to hielp FCI imp1rove
the technical problems in the plant; however, FCT hias not followed thlrous!;h
on this, presumably because of the lef,al problems withi contractors.  ihe
future profit levels will be affectedl by FCI's efforts to overcome these
technical and managerial problems.
2.   Gorakhpur (Uttar Pradesh)
This division, whiclh produces urea only, began production iTn early
1968. The project was begun in 1962 and experienced many delays before com-
pletion.  Gorakbpur, financed with Japanese credit plus funds from GOI, was
built by Toyo Engineering Corporation of Japan at a total project cost of
about $45 million. This cost is excessive for this size plant (179,500 TPY
urea) with much of the high cost due to over-sized and spare equipment. The
project represented Toyo's first urea contract outside Japan and they were
very conservative in the design. Also, the lengthy project schedule contrib-
uted to the high cost.
However, the plant operates very well and can easily exceed 100%
of design capacity on a daily basis. As power reliability improves in east-
ern UP the annual performance of this division should steadily increase to
100%. The Gorakhpur division is, along with Nangal, one of the best operat-
ing divisions of FClr and its profit performance should grow as its power
problems are overcome. In FY71 the plant's third year of production, 148,000
TPY urea was produced, or 82% of capacity. The shortfall was due to unavail-
ability of naphtha due to a railroad strike, power loss due to strike at the
UP State Electricity Board, equipment failure and to power interruptions.
The plant obtains naphtha from the Barauni refinery of Indian Oil
Company; at a distance of 250 km. The naphtha is shipped by rail and even
over this short distance a change in rail gauge is involved. Naphtha stor-
age capacity is about 8,500 tons or 30 days capacity. Rail transport is not
always reliable and this storage capacity will be doubled in the expansion
project. The total quantity of naphtha required after expansion is 148,000
TPY and this amount can easily be supplied by Indian Oil. The quality is not
suitable for many other applications of naphtha and the grade used by Gorak-
hpur fits well with the refinery operations. In addition, the Barauni re-
finery is being expanded by 50% (by 1974). Indian Oil has assured FCT that
sufficient naphtha will be available. The pricing of naphtha and other petro-
leum products is set by GOI which has just posted an increase of about Rs 33/
ton which has been incorporated into the evaluation of the expansion project.
Power reliability, as indicated above, has been a serious operating
problem. The plant was being commissioned in 1968 and the excessive power
interruptions then caused considerable difficulty in plant performance. Re-
cently, however, the power situation has improved as a result of a detailed
study made by UPSEB, FCI, and IEL.  The recommendations made by this study
group are now being implemented. During 1971 there were only 18 failures and



ANNFX 1
Page 3
9 voltages dips. The major cause in lost production was a labor strik-e ait
UPSEB as indicated above. The present 132 MI line to Gorakhpur is fully
loaded and sensitive to other users. The recent switch to a 220 KV line over
a portion of the distance dramatically improved power supply. A new 220 KV
line under construction (to be completed in 1973) should minimize power prob-
1 lems.
The plant units at Gorakhpur are ammonia and urea. The ammonia
plant is designed in two steams, each with a capacity of 175 TPD NH3. The
plant uses electrically-driven reciprocating compressors and has a relative-
ly high operating cost as a result. Operating costs are also high because of
the high cost of feedstock and the processing steps required by the use of
cracked naphtha. A technical description of the processes used at Gorakhpur
is included in Annex 6.
3.   Nangal (Punjab)
The Nangal Division produces heavy water (for use in atomic energy
production) and calcium-ammonium nitrate (257 N) fertilizer (CAN). The pro-
cess units are (1) Electrolysis, (2) Heavy Water, (3) Air, (4) Ammonia, (5)
Nitric Acid, and (6) CAN. Initial production began in 1961 with a rated
capacity of 80,000 TPY nitrogen.
The ammonia process technology employed is expensive and is seldom
used today in producing ammonia, primarily because of the high power consump-
tion.  The Nangal design requires about 12.5 MWH/ton of ammonia, compared to
1.83 '¶VH/ton of the Corakhpur design, and 0.2 MtXJ/ton for a typical modern
process design. Power is obtained from a hydroelectric station at the near-
by Bhakra dam at about Rs 22/WIH. This power rate is low when compared to
the cost of power elsewhere in India or the costs of power to other indus-
trial users in the area and thus, Nangal's profits are, in a sense, over-
stated. The process is, however, simple and Nangal can easily operate at
100% of capacity. D)uring recent months the area has had a power shortage
due to low water level in the Bhakra reservoir, so the plant has been oper-
ating only at about half capacity. Also the State Electricity Board is ap-
plying pressure to increase power rates since it can sell the power to other
consumers at higher rates. Continuing disputes with the Bakra Power Authori-
ties have occurred in recent years and a settlement in 1969 resulted in a
charge for power costs from the beginning of 1966 through that date in the
amount of Ks 16 million. While FCI charged these increased power costs
direct to capital, the Income statements for Nangal in Annex 2 have been
adjusted so that effective power costs are reflected in the year in which
power was purchased.
The low power rates paid by Nangal cause the profits of the unit to
be inflated. The plant will be completely depreciated by 1974 so profits
w i I1 i nprovo Ftirthc r.  A furthier advantage is that ammonia is produced from
W;Itl'l-r aInd 8il, ;lIbe it eXpeCnSively; but IIo foreign exchange is rcquiired since
no pot roleu m p rO(iuCt is needed.



ANNEX I

4.   Namrup (Assam)
The Namrup factory produces urea and ammonium sulfate.  The plant
went into commercial production in January 1969 and has never aclhievedi normal
production. The factory was designed by Chemico and contains small process
units for ammonia, urea and ammonium sulfate production. The plant has ex-
perienced many equipment failures and in FY71 operated only at about half
capacity with a loss of Rs 16 million for the year. Ammonium sulfate sales
are low due to competition from Hindustan Steel which produces by-product
ammonium sulfate at a lower price than Namrup can.
A detailed evaluation of Namrup was not made but it is doubtful if
this division can ever be very profitable without major revisions. The plant
is being expanded (330,000 TPY urea) with the new units expected on-stream in
late 1973 (see below). However, the total market for fertilizer in Assam is
low so most of the increased production must be shipped into Bihar and then
north, south and west to consuming areas.
5.   Sindri (Bihar)
The Sindri division produces ammonium sulfate, urea, and double
salt (ammonium sulfate - ammonium nitrate) plus industrial chemicals. 'lost
of the existing production facilities are old, inefficient units with high
maintenance costs. The plant operates at about 70% of capacity with major
causes being power and equipment failures. The ammonium sulfate plant
at Sindri which operates with high cost gypsum as feedstock has proven proble-
matic.  As a result the division lost about Rs 15 million in FY71 even though
its outstanding debt is low.
A rationalization program is underway including adding production
facilities for phosphoric acid and triple superphosphate (TSP), improving
ammonium sulfate production and possibly shutting some of the older facili-
ties. All of these improvements will take time and the performance of Sindri
is not expected to improve although FCI forecasts a net profit of about Rs 5
million in 1972 (the current fiscal year).
6.   Planning and Development Division (Bihar)
The P & D Division is the engineering and research and development
arm of FCI. It is located adjacent to the Sindri Unit in Bihar. Total staff
of P & D is about 2,000 with about 700 engineers and designers working direct-
ly on engineering projects, planning and technical service functions for the
existing units.
In addition to engineering duties, the division develops and manu-
factures catalyst for use in ammonia plants and has extensive pilot plant ancl
ieQa0;rch atid development facilities.  The catalyst manufacturing program is
.wlki ir.41 IVl utnldt ntlid Some cattnlyst has been sold and used in plants in India.
i.owevex , F(A I las not kept detatled accounting records of the costs involved
fn the development of this catalyst and thus there is no way to estimate when
it will break even on this venture. Over the next few years as catalyst con-
sumption grows in the country, catalyst production should become profitable.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
P & D has several license agreements with international process
engineering firms; the most notable being:
Montedison   -  Italy            -  ammonia and urea
Lurgi         -  Germany         -  Rectisol C02 removal
Shell        -  Netherlands    -  fuel oil gasification
Koppers       -  Germany         -  coal gasification
Nissan        -  Japan           -  phosphoric acid
Licensing arrangements for other process technology are obtained when needed
for other projects.  P & D has also developed its own process know-how for
such teclnology as ammonium sulfate, ammonia synthesis gas purification and
others. In all of the present ammonia-urea works in progress P & D is re-
sponsible for engineering, design, project schedule and procurement based on
process design packages from the various licensors. Where supplier's credits
are involved, the foreign process collaborator handles most procurement from
outside India.
Project implementation in FCI is not clearly defined and the re-
sult has been that a number of new projects have been delayed in completion
as long as ttwo or three years. There is no one project manager with overall
responsibility; instead, the functions are divided or shared between the
general manager of a particular unit and P & D. Project construction and
supervision of work at the site including subcontractors for unit works,
some procurement, and plant commissioning is the responsibility of the Gene-
ral Manager of that unit. Although P & D is responsible for project sched-
ule, its completion time can be greatly affected by the General Manager's
staff. Budget control is another critical area of split responsibility with
P & D responsible for design and procurement and the division management re-
sponsible for construction costs. P & D appoints a project coordinator to
supervise its activities and maintains liaison with the unit management.
Major decisions on design and procurement are made by a committee consisting
of the top level management of P & D so the project coordinator does not have
full responsibility for project management. The general engineering capabil-
ities of P & D are quite good. Typical design drawings and specifications
were reviewed for the several projects now in the design stage and they ap-
peared to be thorouglh and professionally done.
The overall responsibility of P & D in executing the several am-
inonia-urea projects is greater than heretofore generally recognized by IDA.
The responsibilities of the process licensors appear to be the initial pro-
cess package, a limited amount of checking, and supply of construction and
commissioning advisors. The guarantees offered are process guarantees and
are not likely to be enforceable to any significant degree. FCI as a whole
has total responsibility for project management, project schedule and budget.
It is in these areas where P & D (FCI) is most lacking. Project
coordinators and newly appointed General Managers are not always experienced
in the complex task of designing, assembling and erecting the vast quantity
of equipment, materials and manpower required for these projects which have
capital investments of $50-100 million. Many delays are outside P & D con-

trols due to such factors as license restrictions, supplier's credits limi-
tations, and domestic difficulties such as transport and fabrication.  rhe
presence of such problems, however, requires muclh more attention to a proj-
ect's critical path schedule, more advanced planning, and leaves less room
for error than in more typical industrialized nations.
The procurement procedures agreed to for ID)A projects will hlelp re-
move some of these factors, and the straight-forward design of Corakhpuir and
the assistance of Toyo should reasonably permit P & D to execute the small
Gorakhpur project successfully. However, the much more difficult task of a
new $100 million project involving many process sub-contractors, extenisive
civil works, and complicated process technology will present an exceedingly
challenging assignment for P & D.
B.   FCI's Expansion Program
FCI has six major projects under implementation at present. The
capacities, costs and expected on-stream dates are given in the table below
(page 8). All these projects are being executed by FCT's P & D Division with
the assistance of various other process and engineering firms.
Iurgapur, Nanrup (expansion) and Barauni are substantially dupli-
cate plants based on process designs obtained from Montecatini Edison (Italy),
and include process units for ammonia and urea. These projects are being fi-
nanced with Italian credits and funds from GOI. The Sindri Rationalization
Project is a triple superphosphate (TSP) unit which includes facilities for
sulfuric and phosphoric acid as well as TSP. Much of the engineering pro-
curement is domestic, including a subcontract with FACT. GOI is providing
all funds including foreign exchange from Belgium and Bulgarian credits.
Talcher and Rmmagundum are large ammonia-urea projects withi ammonia
being produced by coal gasification.  Montedison is the major engineering
collaborator with additional assistance from Koppers (Cermany), Lurgi (Cer-
many), and Technoexport (Czechoslovakia). Coal gasification is relatively
unproved technology and the projects are ambitious undertakings by GOI and
FCI. GOI is also providing the project funds including Italian and Czech
credits. The projects are in the early design stage and because of antici-
pated design problems, are not expected to be completed before 1976.
All of the above projects have been financed half as equity and
half as debt and represent approximately 40% of the total assets of the cor-
poration. All expenses including interest during construction are being
capitalized, so the company performance will not be affected by these proj-
ects until production starts or unless the projects are delayed. The proj-
ects now under actual construction, Durgapur, Namrup and Barauni, have ex-
perienced excessive delays. Durgapur is already two years late in commis-
sioning with procurement and poor project management being major causes.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
In addition, FCI has several projects under active consideration
which are also given in the table below. These projects are in various de-
velopment stages and it is difficult to predict their ultimate disposition.
The dates given are FCI's estimates. IDA is currently considering financing
two projects, Corakhpuir and Nangal.  These data indicate the growing influ-
ence of FCI and the public sector on the fertilizer industry in India.  If
FCI maintains its capital expansion program on schedule then in 1979 the
company will have 54% of India's nitrogen capacity and 24% of phosphate ca-
pacity compared to 30% and 10% respectively for the current capacity.
C.   FCI Board of Directors
The membership of the Board is given in the attached table. Of
the 12 total members, four are from FCI, three from government ministries,
two from other public sector enterprises and only three are from outside
private business. The influence of GOI, particularly the Ministries of Fi-
nance and Petroleum & Chemicals is seen very strongly in the company's man-
agement and operation. Excluding the Board Chairman, the average term is
quite short, about 2 years, and it is doubtful if long range company policy
and management can be effectively directed by the Board.

1/  Net Profit figures shown in published statements are before expenses relating to past periods, and also do not take
into account write-off of development expenses.  Since these expenditures occur every year, the published profit figures
consistently overstate actual profit, and the adjusted figures are considered to more accurately represented profits (losses)
of FCI. For the 8 year period, 1964-71, profits are overstated by 51%.
2/ A prolonged dispute over power tariffs was settled in 1970, requiring that FCI pay increased rates retroactive to January 1,
1966. The power rates have now been settled and no further adjustments are anticipated in the near future.
3/  Debits relating to past periods. 3mall adjustments related to FY1971 can be expected to show up in the FY1972 accounts.
:/  Includes write-off for the Korba Project of Rs. 2 million in each of the years 1968-71.                                                           'd

ANNEX 6
FCI: Gorakhpur Expansion Project
Teclnical Description
The expansion project will utilize installed spare equipment and
excess capacity in the existing plants. The existing facilities are describ-
ed below:
Ammonia Plant
Plant capacity equals 350 TPD Ni'3 in two trains. The process steps
and equipment presently installed are given below:
1.        Naphtha is partially oxidized using Shell gasifiers operating at
23 atmospheres (atm) followed by carbon scrubbing and removal. Three gasi-
fiers (one spare) and two carbon scrubbing units are installed.
2.        The process gas is converted to carbon dioxide (C02) in a shift con-
vertor using high temperature shift catalyst (manufactured by FCI). Two units
are installed.
3.        CO2 is removed in three different stages with two complete trains
installed. This step separates the C02 from the process gas stream for use
in the urea plant.
(a) hot potassium carbonate scrubbing
(b) monoethanol amine (MEA) scrubbing
(c) caustic soda scrubbing to remove final traces of C02
'4.       The nitrogen wash unit removes all remaining impurities from the
process gas by scrubbing with liquid nitrogen at low temperature (-170°C),
and the air separation plant provides the oxygen for the partial oxidation,
nitrogen for nitrogen wash unit and for ammonia synthesis. Two complete
units are installed including a spare nitrogen compressor.
5.        Synthesis gas is compressed to about 360 atm using reciprocating
compressors driven by electric motors. Gas from the nitrogen wash unit is
hydrogen which is mixed with nitrogen from the air separation plant in the
correct ratio to produce ammonia. Three compressors are installed with one
being a spare.
6.        Ammnonia synthtesis is achieved by reacting the compressed gas in the
presence of a catalyst. After reaction, ammonia is removed by cooling and
condensing and the remaining gases are recycled to the synthesis step. Two
converters are installed.
Urea tlant
The urea plant has dual units in most areas and has a rated capac-
ity of 600 TPD urea except for prilling which is rated at 544 TPD urea.



Ar!NNTX 6
Page 2
1.        Urea synthesis is carried out by a non-catalytic reaction of am-
monia and CO2 to form ammonium carbamate at about 20() atm. Five reactors
(918 TPD total capacity) are installed including one spare unit whiclh lhas
design capacity of 318 TPD urea.
2.        Urea is recovered by decreasing the pressure and decomposing the
ammonium carbamate solution. Two reactors are installed.
3.        The urea is concentrated by evaporating, crystallizing, centrifug-
ing, drying and melting to obtain an anhydrous urea melt suitable for pril-
ling.
4.        Prills are produced by spraying the melt through a nozzle into a
tower about 50 meters high. The droplets fall against a counter-current
stream of air which cools and solidifies the urea into spheres called prills.
Two towers are presently installed with a design capacity of 545 TPD urea.
5.        The urea is then bagged and stored for shipment.
Utilities and Storage
The present power requirements are 40 MW with sufficient electrical
equipment installed to handle 50 MW. Power is received from UPSIB at 132 KV
and transformed to 11 KV in substations provided by FCI.
Water requirements are 26,500 cubic meters per day obtained from
tubewells and a nearby lake, Chilwa Tal. The plant has three coal-fired
steam boilers with a total steam capacity of 135 tons per hour.
Storage capacities of materials based on existing facilities are:
Storage           Annual Rate
Tons                TPY
Naphtha               8,500               90,000
Coal                 15,000               90,000
Urea                 30,000
The expansion facilities required are:
Ammonia Plant
The ammonia plant will consist of three separate trains after ex-
pansion. All of the existing spare units will be utilized.
1.        Gasification unit.  The present three gasifiers will be used.  Onhly
minor modifications to burner tips are required.
2.        An additional carbon scrubber unit is required.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
3.        An additional shift converter is needed.  FCI and Toyo will eval-
uate switching to BASF catalyst or othet means of reducing CO leakage. Re-
sults of this study may show that the third shift converter is not needed
and/or result in reductions in size of nitrogen units and air separation
plant.
4.        An additional C(2 removal system is planned.  However, the results
of FCI's study should prove that existing units are large enough. Principal
modifications are to change tower packing to a more efficient type and to
switch to a process called modified Benfield.
5.        Additional nitrogen unit and air separation plant are to be pro-
vided with the exception of an existing spare nitrogen compressor. The re-
sults of the study in (3) above will determine the actual requirements.
6.        Another synthesis gas compressor is not required since the instal-
led spare will be used.
7.        An additional ammonia converter will be added.
Urea Plant
The urea capacity to be added is 350 TPD in all sections except
prilling which will be 400 TPD. The size of the urea expansion is based on
utilizing all of the expanded ammonia capacity.
1.        Urea reactor capacity is sufficient for 918 TPT  including the fifth
reactor, so a small supplemental reactor is proposed. FCI will evaluate the
need for this supplemental reactor. It is required for a guaranteed output
of 950 TPD but the design may prove to be sufficient without it.
2.        A spare CO2 compressor is available but a small booster compressor
is required. Existing spare ammonia pumps will be used but an additional
pump is required.
3.        An additional urea decomposer is required.
4.        A direct urea concentrator will be included in the expansion de-
sign.
5.        Urea prilling.  An additional prilling tower of 400 TPD capacity
will be added.
Utilities and Storage
The following facilities will be added:
1.        8,500-ton naphtha storage tank.
2.        ACditional coolfng tower section for urea plant.
No new facilities are required for urea storage, power supply and
water supply.

Nitrogen Fertilizer Market for India
A.   Present Situation in India
Fertilizer production is a major part of India's program to become
self-sufficient in agriculture. Currently about half of the required nitro-
gen fertilizer is imported but steps have been taken by GOI to increase domes-
tic production. Nitrogen is now produced in India primarily as ammonia and
urea based on naphtha from imported petroleum feedstocks. Current plans pro-
pose increasing reliance on fuel oil and indigenous coal as raw materials
to produce nitrogen fertilizer. Several projects have been sanctioned based
on imported ammonia but few such additional projects are expected. A major
problem h-ias been the length of time required to get a production facility
commissioned so capacity has not expanded as rapidly as desired.
Nitrogen supply and demand for recent years are shown below based
on data from the Fertilizer Association of India, GOI and IDA.
Nitrogen Fertilizer Consumption and Production in India
(thousands of tons)
Consumption         Production          Deficit
FY65                 580                240               340
FY66                 530                240               290
FY67                 660                310               350
FY68                 920                400               520
FY69               1,200                560               640
FY70               1,450                720               730
FY71               1,760                850               910
Statistics for 1971 are higher than data recently released by GOI (1425 TPY N).
This discrepancy is currently being studied and an effort made to discover the
reasons therefor and to ascertain what effect any slowdown in consumption might
have on future demand. In the meantime the FY71 consumption of 1,760 tons as
estimated by Messrs. Brown of IBRD and W. B. Donde of COI has been used.  Ni-
trogen consumption increased at an average annual rate of about 20% and produc-
tion increased at about 28% per year, hut production still lags behind con-
suimption. Delay In projects now in construction and low production levels
(about 6O,' of capacity) In existing plants have contributed to these deficits.
B.   Forecast of Nitrogen Supply in India
The nitrogen supply forecast through 1979 is given in the following
table. These data are compared with demand forecasts in Para. 6.02. The
forecasts are obviously subject to large error since there is disagreement
on current consumption data and there is a large discrepancy between IDA and
Goi forecasts of future supply.



ANNEIX 11

C.   Comparison of Fertilizer Consumption
Nitrogen consumption varies widely throughout the world depending
on availability of land resources and the intensity of cropping. recent
data taken from FAO Production Yearbook 1969 are as follows:
Nitrogen Consumption
(kg/hectare)
Country                         Rate
Taiwan                          177.9
Japan                           131.4
Netherlands                     153.4
United Kingdom                   46.5
United States                    13.7
Pakistan                          8.2
India                             7.8
Canada                            5.2
Uttar Pradesh (India)            15.0
Food grain production, particularly high yielding varieties, is a
function of the fertilizer application rate and India is well below optimum
rates. Fertilizer usage in UP is substantially higher than the average for
all India. Nevertheless, the table indicates clearly the room for growth in
fertilizer usage that exists in Indian agriculture.
Regional forecasts for India (Assam, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar
Pradesh) are given in the following table (page 4).  These data show a small
urea surplus in the region in 1974-76, but the Gorakhpur marketing area should
not be affected. (see paras. 6.04, 6.05).

lion) with the second largest area (29.5 million hectares). Area under cul-
tivation is about 12.5 million hectares with 4.8 million hectares being crop-
ped twice in a year to give a net cultivation area of 17.3 million hectares.
About 6.3 million hectares, or 36% of the cultivated area is irrigated. Ir-
rigation from canals and tubewells has been growing at an average rate of
about 4% per year and by 1974 could reach a total of 7.5 million hectares.
With this high percentage of irrigation, there is less likelihood of a major
crop failure compared to other areas of India. The principal crops in UP
are wheat, rice, sugar cane, barley, and maize.
Sugar cane is an important cash crop for the area and requires
heavy dosages of nitrogen. Present farming practice in UP represents about
48 kg N/hectare against a recommended rate of 168 kg N/hectare. UP plans
to increase the application rate to an average of 86 kg/hectare by 1974.
Thus, the potential growth rate of fertilizer usage in sugar cane is quite
large.
Other major crops are being developed through high yielding varie-
ties programs. These programs began in India in 1967 with about 25% of the
program area being in UP. Adequate water and fertilizer are the two impor-
tant factors in the growth rate of high yielding varieties. Area under cul-
tivation with high yielding varieties is growing at a rapid pace and ferti-
lizer consumption will grow accordingly.
For purposes of market analysis, FCI divides UP into three regions
which are shown on Map 2. The nitrogen and urea consumption for these re-
gions is shonm below based on 1970 data:

Urea consumption is assumed to grow to 70% of nitrogen usage in eastern UP
and 65% in the other regions.  Total nitrogen demand for 1973-76 is FCI's
estimates and is about 10-15% below GOI and IDA forecasts.  The 1979 projec-
tions are based on a nitrogen growth rate of 12%.
The market allocation of Gorakhpur is shown below based on FCI's
1976 forecast:

/1   Total output from IEL, DCM, Gorakhpur although a large part of IEL and
DCM capacity is marketed outside of UP.
The entire Gorakhpur output could be marketed in eastern UP by
1979 with FCI obtaining 73% of the market. The above calculations are based
on FCI capturing 80% of the market in an area where their freight advantage
exceeds Rs 10/ton, and lesser portions where Gorakhpur's freight advantage is
smaller. At present Gorakhpur markets 82% of its sales in UP. Sales outside
UP are controlled by FCI's overall marketing plan ance its need to establish
and maintain markets in other states.
At present, FCI, DCM, and IEL market urea at the dealer level at
the same price. This situation is expected to prevail as long as demand ex-
.ee.lds  Stspply. lhese prices are based on Pool prices which are delivered
c4-4t.;, thetrefore, freight savings are being taken by producers.

Distribution System
Most agricultural supplies including fertilizer are sold through
cooperatives. The cooperatives are banded together on a state level in an
agency (called Apex Agencies) that provides storage, credit and other central
facilities. Most states have only one such agency but in UP there are four.
These agencies, with pertinent data for each, are described below. In addi-
tion, there are private dealers who are assuming an increasing portion of
the market.

Agro-Industrial Corporation was formed in 1968 with a subscribed
capital of Rs 50 million, equally divided between the Governments of India
and UP. The corporation handles all agricultural inputs such as fertilizer,
chemicals, equipment and seeds. Operating loans are secured from commercial
banks with a State Government guarantee. Sales volume and market share of
this organization is expected to increase rapidly over the next five years.
UP Cane Union Federation is a collection of 132 cooperatives lo-
cated in 32 districts of UP where the predominant crop is sugar cane. It
has over 2.2 million farmer members. Capital is subscribed by the member
cooperatives with an additional contribution of Rs 50 million by the Reserve
Bank of India.
Provincial Co-operative Federation consists of 52 District Co-
operative Federations, 161 Primary Co-operative Societies and 7 Processing
Societies. Operating capital is subscribed from members, and Reserve Bank
of India made available Rs 250 million in 1971. Loans are obtained through
co-operative banks that are federated into the UP Co-operative Bank on a
state level. At present, it is the largest Apex Agency but FCI does not
market its fertilizer through this organization since FCI has had difficulty
in obtaining payments from them.



ANNEX 12

Agricultural Supply Organization is a branch of the UP Directorate
of Agriculture. Its financial requirements are met by the state government
with loans granted to the cultivators by the state government. This organ-
ization will probably be absorbed into Agro-Irldustrial Corporation.
FCI has placed considerable emphasis on developing a network of
private dealers. At present there are about 127 private dealers in Gorakh-
pur's marketing network and this number should grow to 300 by 1975.  These
dealers now handle about 33% of Gorakhpur's output and 20% of the total UP
market. Their market share has been growing and it is anticipated they will
continue to do so.
Structually, the Apex Agencies appear to be sound but overdue ac-
counts are historically a problem as apparent with the Provincial Co-op Fed-
eration now. To date FCI has not had to carry much of the burden of agri-
cultural credit but may have to do so in the future.
Urea Pricing and Competition
The Government Fertilizer Pool sets a ceiling price for urea sold
in India. This price represents the wholesale price to dealers at railhead
and allows the dealer Rs 80 to cover his costs of distribution. The Pool
sells all imported fertilizer so at present plays a large role in marlceting.
Although there is no official duty on imported fertilizer the Pool prices
are substantially higher than world market.

* 10% excise tax became effective April 17, 1969.
The Pool Price cannot be exceeded by anyone legally and there is little in-
centive to sell underneath the price in most cases due to shortage of supply
and high operating costs for urea production in India.
Gorakhpur has a relatively simple pricing strategy since it markets
only urea and has only two competitors in its main marketing area; neither
one of which has any difficulty selling its production at the established
Pool Price. The Pool Price is equivalent to a freight equalized price at
destination so there is an incentive to sell in nearby areas. Also the bulk



ANNEX 12
Page 5
of fertilizer sold in UP goes through government owned or supported credit
institutions, so little price competition is expected to develop here al-
though private dealers may attempt some price cutting as a means of increas-
ing their market share.
Distribution
Hlost urea in UP is transported by rail but trucks are also used.
The bagging, storage and handling facilities at the Gorakhpur factory are
adequate. Availability of rail wagons is critical at times and occasionally
there is an insufficient number available. This shortage also affects raw
material movements as well. The railroad serving the factory is a meter
gauge system which works to Gorakhpur's advantage in the immediate marketing
area since other producers are on broad gauge lines (Map 2). For short
distances movement by truck is used and this type distribution is handled
by private contractors.

COMNENTS ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
A. Financial Rates of Return
1.        The project forms an integral part of the Gorakhpur Unit, hence
financial rates of return were calculated not only for the expansion
project, but also for the total Gorakhpur Unit, both with and without the
expansion project. The project increases financial return for the unit
from 7!Q-8;a to a more acceptable level of lC-ll\%; with the project
itself having very satisfactory rates of return (25-30%).  The expansion
project strengthens the unit by lessenirng its sensitivity to fluctuations
in sales prices and operating costs. The cause for the large disparity
between the rate of return on the project and that on the total expanded
plant is the large capital base of the existing plant (Rs 340 million),
compared to the Rs 120 million capital investment required for the project.
Excessive delaye in construction of the existing plant also contribute to
the lower rates of return.
2.        Cases (a):-  changes in the level of operating efficiency -
have little effect on either the returns of the project or on the total
Gorakhpur Unit, and in the unlilkely event that the plant only reaches 85%
Capacity (a level lower than its current operating rate) the project still
shows very acceptable returns.
3.        Cases (b):-  a 10% increase in operating costs - is not likely
since the prices used in the projections are considered conservative and
the prices of the major inputs are controlled by G.O.I. The test indicates
that the financial return is reasonably insensitive to changes in operating
costs, which could increase considerably before endangering the rate of return.
4.        Cases (c):-  a 10% decrease in selling price - although not con-
sidered likely is a possibility due to indirect Government control over the
urea price. The test indicates that prices could decline considerably with
increased competitiQn and the project still show acceptable returns.
5.        Cases (d):-  a combination of cases (b) and (c) - represent an
effective decrease in the profit margin (in real terms) by some 30%. This
condition is considered very improbable and the test was run to indicate how
the project and the expanded plant will stand up in the face of extremely
adverse conditions.
6.        Cases (e):-  a 15% capital cost over-run, and a one year delay in
the start-up of the expansion project - is considered most unlikely since it
is expected that the capital costs will actually be reduced below the $16.0
million. The test was run to indicate how the project will stand up in the
face of extremely adverse conditions.
7.        Cases (f):-  a six month delay in project implementation - is
considered a more likely event than case (e).



ANNEX 1'5
Pa ge l.
8.        Cases (g):._  a combination of decrease in sales price and
6-month delay in construction - is included as the realistic "worst t'un
of events."
1. Economic Rates of Return
9.        Economic rates of return computed. for the project, indlicate that
a very acceptable level is attained, but that the economic rate is much
more sensitive to changes in operating costs and price levels than the financiLl
rate of return. However, under any adverse conditions considered possiole,
the rate of return remains acceptable.
10.       Reductions in the price of urea (CIF Calcutta), from the $65/ton
used in the basic calculations to $60, and $55 reduces the economic rates of
return for tte project to 16% and 11% respectively. An increase of the CIF
price to $75/ton would increase the economic return to about 30%.
11.       It is impossible at this time to reconstruct with any reasonable degree
of accuracy what the economic rate of the existing Gorakhpur plant was at the
time the decisions to proceed (1962-63) were taken. Nevertheless, the process
design represented modern competitive technology at the time, although, since
then the scaling up of annnnia plants and the use of more efficient compressors
render the existing plant non-competitive today. While $65/ton CIF India has
been used in the computations for the expansion plant, a suitable long-term
price in 1962-63 for the existing plant would have been in excess of $100/ton.
The book cost of the Gorakhpur plant was affected by delays in project completion,
overdesign and the Indian currency devaluation in 1966 and thus, does not
reflect the expected capital cost at the time the economic decision was made.
IDA staff judgment is that the Gorakhpur plant was a reasonable decision nf FCI
at the time, and the iniputation of currently known facts tothe Indian judgment
of 1962-63 would be misleading.  It is apparent, however, from staff calculationc
that, given the investment already made in the existing Gorakhpur plant, or
given the debt still outstanding on that plant, the production of fertilizer at
Gorakhpur renders a substantially positive economic rate of return to In(lia at
this time.
