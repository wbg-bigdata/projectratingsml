                         Program Development Objectives
                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The overarching objective of the operation is to strengthen the banking sector, which is a critical pre-condition for sustainable economic recovery and private
                         sector-led growth.

                          The proposed loan supports a comprehensive program of measures to strengthen the banking sector, with a view to mitigating the impact of the global
                         financial crisis and increasing the resilience of the sector to possible future shocks. The FSDPL would also support the Government#s goals of maintaining a
                         stable macroeconomic framework, including sustainable budget deficit and debt levels. The specific reforms proposed to strengthen the banking sector are in
                         the following areas: (i) maintaining market confidence; (ii) strengthening bank liquidity framework; (iii) assessing and addressing banking sector vulnerabilities;
                         (iv) enhancing regulatory framework for banking sector; and (v) problem bank restructuring.
