F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The Project Development Objective is to assist government in the creation of capacity,
institutions and systems for improved and sustained utilization of human and financial
resources of the Yemen civil service. To this end, the project would help put in place core
personnel and financial management systems, establish a mechanism to reduce the
number of unqualified civil servants, and initiate a restructuring process in individual
ministries. To make this foundation as solid as possible, another objective of the project
is to upgrade the management capacity in the civil service.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, mainly taken from the CAS, PAD, it is not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The country background at appraisal is characterized by a fragile environment and daunting
challenges, but a strong political will for reforms. As one of the poorest countries in the region with a
GDP per capita of US$ 320, and a poverty rate of 25% of the population in 1998, Yemen faced enormous
development challenges, including very low levels of social indicators such as for poverty, illiteracy,
morbidity, malnutrition; continued depletion of scarce water resources; combined with a high growth rate
of the population, much of which was underserved by modern infrastructure and by public services; and a
high dependence on a single and rapidly depleting commodity, oil.
The country faced further challenges, as the Republic of Yemen was a relatively new and fragile State in
the process of nation building since the reunification of North and socialist South Yemen in 1990 and the
end of the civil war in the South in 1994. The government's actions and authority were further challenged
by political tensions, insurgencies in the North-East province, secessionist sentiments in the South and
prevalent security threats, as evidenced by a spate of riots, bombings, and kidnappings in 1998.
Despite these circumstances, the political will to address these daunting challenges and the Government's
commitment to reform were high and yielded encouraging results, according to the Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS 99-02). The Government completed successfully a first round of macro-
economic and structural reforms ranging from cuts in fuel and food subsidies to measures of trade
liberalization. It succeeded in stabilizing its economy, hard hit by the economic and social consequences
from the civil war and the Gulf war, and secured a substantial debt cancellation from the Paris Club,
reducing its debt to GDP ratio from 176% to 68.5% in 1997. Despite a short set back due to a sharp
decline in oil prices in 1998 (which halved the growth rate and reduced government revenues by 20%), the
Government engaged in a second wave of reforms to enhance economic growth, private sector
development, privatization, and revenue mobilization, with support from the IMF.
However, further progress on the ambitious reform agenda and development efforts were severely
constrained by the public administration's limited capacity and skills, as well as by a bloated, poorly paid
and managed civil service. Acknowledging these limitations and the unsustainable wage bill, the
Government committed to thoroughly reform and reengineer its administration and civil service.
The World Bank responded favorably and made improving governance and public administration
modernization its overarching goal and top priority in the 1999-2002 CAS. The Bank committed to
increase its engagement both in financial terms (with a 25% increase in lending per annum. compared to
the previous CAS) and in the scope of interventions, combining a programmatic series of Public Sector
Management Adjustment Credits (PSMACs) with an Civil Service Modernization Project (CSMP), a
Legal and Justice Development project and support to the creation of an Independent Commission against
Corruption. The CSMP was thus part of a comprehensive response strategy to the Government's
challenges and reform program. The range and scope of this assistance strategy reflected the reform
momentum and optimism at the time.

At appraisal, the public administration and civil service was plagued by a number of weaknesses
which rendered the system largely inefficient and impeded the government's ability to deliver
essential public services. The size of the civil service was bloated with extremely low pay scales, low
capacity, opaque hiring and promotion practices, and virtually absent enforcement mechanisms.
The public administration was further characterized as an environment where nearly all the core systems
were inadequate and paper-based (ranging from personnel and financial management, to budgeting,
procurement, and property management), organizational structures and work flows were duplicative and


                                                     1
unnecessarily complex, and human resource-management was virtually absent. Human resources data was
fragmented, incomplete, and not up to date. The personnel data creation, management and reporting
processes were unclear and uneven across spending units.

Many of the main weaknesses stemmed notably from the fact that during the 1990s, Yemen's civil service
was a central element of the reunification process, began to act as an employer of first resort, and served
as a central component in the government's social safety net. Consequently, the civil service doubled in
the 1990s. By 1999, civil servants represented about two percent of the population (17.6 million) or eight
percent of the labor force active, which in 1999 was estimated at 4.4 million. Additionally, employment in
public enterprises was over 83,100. In total, public sector employment accounted for four percent of the
population or 14 percent of the labor force. Due to the size of the civil service, the wage bill represented
14 percent of GDP and 35 percent of total government expenditures in 1999. This is high by any
international standard. The decline in oil revenues further reinforced the need to reduce the wage bill to
stimulate growth by ensuring that scarce resources could be dedicated to investment or operational costs,
that government does not unwarrantedly and excessively interference in private sector economy through
its inflated civil service, and ensure that government spending is in a social equitable manner.

Past efforts to contain the financial impact of the civil service increase led to a dramatic reduction in
wages and had dire consequences. By 1996, the average real wage was only 15 percent of the 1990 real
wage level. Wages were also seriously compressed, with senior managers earning only 3 times the lowest
level civil servant (against an international compression rate of 6-7) and only about 11% of the wages of
their private sector contemporaries. These low wages resulted in the inability to attract high quality
workers as well as in lack of motivation and effort of existing staff, which translated in short working
hours, high absenteeism, and low productivity. To compensate for the loss of revenue, many civil servants
took up parallel jobs in the public sector (double dippers) or in the private sector (ghost workers), and
relied increasingly on petty corruption to top-up salaries, and further reinforced the notion that wages paid
to a civil servant are nothing more than a safety-net. The public administration's organizational structure
was complex and heterogeneous. It comprised 28 ministries and over 80 "departments" with a great
difference in size and capacity, ranging from a ministry such as education (over 150,000 staff) to the
Social Security Fund (8 staff). The organizational structures of many of these departments was a spider-
web of complexity. And, despite the intricate structures, the chain of command generally passed upward
with little ability of lower level managers to take decisions or be held accountable for activities even as
mundane as approval of staff's annual leave.

This shared assessment, guided the Government's comprehensive reform agenda and the Bank's
intervention rationale. The Government adopted in 1998 a Strategic Framework for Civil Service
Modernization, to: (i) streamline government entities and increase the transparent and consistent
application of procedures, (ii) improve budgeting and financial management systems, (iii) restructure
public employment and establish a transparent personnel management system, and (iv) establish effective
controls on staffing levels and reduce the number of redundant workers. This program was expected to
take ten years, although slippage was anticipated. The Bank committed to support the implementation of
this holistic strategy, through the above mentioned comprehensive assistance strategy, of which the CSMP
was the flagship project. As stipulated in the PAD, this very ambitious civil service reform agenda was to
be pursued in phases, with CSMP as the first phase to establish the foundation for the Government's long-
term reform strategy for modernizing the civil service.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The Project Development Objective is to assist government in the creation of capacity, institutions and
systems for improved and sustained utilization of human and financial resources of the Yemen civil
service. To this end, the project would help put in place core personnel and financial management systems,


                                                     2
establish a mechanism to reduce the number of unqualified civil servants, and initiate a restructuring
process in individual ministries. To make this foundation as solid as possible, another objective of the
project is to upgrade the management capacity in the civil service.

The Project Key performance indicators are: (i) the production of consolidated financial statements in a
timely manner, and (ii) employment based on positions and merit with transparent application of civil
service law.

The Component objectives and key performance indicators are as follows:

Component output objectives            Output indicators

                                       core systems.

Even though the project's logical framework does not include outcome indicators and targets at
component level, the Government's Policy letter requesting the credit does. It foresees the following
expected results, which shall be considered for the present assessment:

    1. Removal of 12 000 overdue pensioners by December 2000;
    2. Removal from the payroll of all double dippers and ghost workers within 4 month of their
       identification through the biometrics system;
    3. Transfer to the Civil Service Fund of workers identified through the restructuring process;
    4. Significant overall reduction in the number of civil servants over the project period;
    5. Adoption of a Wage and employment policy by June 2001, that is fiscally affordable and that
       permits the gradual decompression of wages;
    6. Restructuring of 4 agencies by December 2000 and 4 more by September 2001;
    7. Introduction of revised, computerized personnel management, payroll and AFMIS systems in
       Sana'a and gradual expansion to all administrative units;
    8. Design and carry out of training programs for personnel in the restructured departments.

Likewise, the logical framework does not include a specific baseline but the project document details the
situation of the civil service at project start, as mentioned under section 1.1 above.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved) and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

The project's development objectives and key performance indicators were not revised during its two
restructuring, respectively in 2005 and 2007. In March 2008, the KPI were specified and enhanced in the
context of an additional financing credit (4391-YEM). However, as the latter did not reach effectiveness,
the initial PDO and KPI remain the basis for this evaluation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
            The project's main direct beneficiary is the Government of Yemen, through a better and more
            sustainable utilization of human and financial resources in public administration.
            Eventually, further expected beneficiaries are: (i) the qualified civil servants, to be rewarded for
            good performance with higher salaries, and (ii) the population, which can expect higher quality,
            more efficient delivery of public services.

1.5 Original Components (as approved in the PAD and legal agreement)
The original project had four thematic components and one for project management and administration.

1. The first component ­ Improve Core Systems (US$ 14.1m1)- aimed to improve the Government's
   financial and human resources management systems. It supported: (i) the modernization of the human
   resources management framework (policies and practices), (ii) the establishment of personnel
   information systems, through a census and verification of personnel records, a computerized employee
   database (EDB) and a Biometric Information System (BIS), the introduction of transparent hiring and
   job descriptions, (iii) the standardization and streamlining of payroll procedures and processes as well
   as the planning of payroll computerization, (iv) the development of an accounting and financial
   management information system (AFMIS).

2. The second component ­ Civil Service Fund (CSF) (US$ 4.9m), aimed at supporting the
   rationalization and strengthening of the Civil service, through the: (i) enforcement of retirement rules,
   (ii) removal from payroll of ghost workers and double dippers, through the improved core systems,
   (iii) the identification and transfer of surplus workers to a newly established CSF, and (iv) the design,
   implementation and monitoring of assistance packages to redundant workers, through the CSF.

3. The third component ­ Streamline and Rationalize (US$ 1.5m) aimed at (i) reviewing the
   mandates, responsibilities and objectives of pilot agencies, based on a functional analysis (ii)
   removing duplications and overlap, realign agencies' missions and functions and develop new policies,
   including decentralization initiatives, and (iii) analyze staff requirements and introduce job
   descriptions. This was essentially done through horizontal studies (Government mandate, institutional
   performance indicators) and agency specific studies for the Ministry of Civil Service and Insurance,
   the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Tax Authority and the Central Office for Control and Audit
   (COCA). In tandem re-engineering of other Ministries (such as the Ministry of Health, Prime
   Minister's Office, Ministry of Labor) would be supported through other donors' involvement (EU,
   UNDP, ILO). This component included also the set up of an innovation fund to support, in a flexible
   manner, the testing of new ideas and "quick fixes" to support the reform momentum.

4. The forth component- Capacity building (US$ 3.9m) supported two dimensions of capacity
   building: (i) skills and activities to sustain the reform in the long term and (ii) skill development for
   the management and administration of a modern public service. Under the first dimension, the project
   will provide support for managing, monitoring and evaluating the overall reform program. This also
   includes support for public information and internal communication programs. Under the second
   dimension, training would be provided for mid and high level management levels to start developing
   an effective management framework, users of new core systems (component 1), and project
   management teams within ministries.

5. The fifth component was dedicated to program management and administration (US$ 2.5m) to
   set-up and operate a fully functioning program management structure, with a Project Implementation
   Unit (PIU) both within the Ministry of Finance (to support AFMIS) and the Ministry of Civil Service
   to cover the other components.

1.6 Revised Components
A project restructuring in December 2005 led to a formal revision of project components, with a
reallocation of 27.6% of the total budget from the capacity building and the civil service components to
the AFMIS component. The reallocation financed essentially additional IT equipment for AFMIS as well
as technical assistance to the project management and the functional design of AFMIS. In order to
compensate for the substantial budget reduction of the capacity building component, from US$ 3.9m to
US$ 620,000, the training activities were transferred to a larger Dutch Trust Fund. The financial
reallocation increased substantially the resources allocated to IT systems.

1.7 Other significant changes
The project's initial closing date of 31 December 2005 was extended twice, respectively to December 31,
2007 and to June 30, 2010, thereby doubling the implementation period of the project from 5 to 10 years.

The Bank financing was complemented by two Dutch Trust Funds (TF). The first TF (nb: 24755), was
approved in August 2001, with a budget of US$16 m intended to finance the IT and office equipment of
MOCSAIs Regional Information Centers. However, due to delays in implementation, the funds could not
be disbursed and were canceled after expiry of the Trust Fund on December 31, 2003. The second TF (nb:
53570), for training and capacity building in Yemen, was approved in February 2005, with a budget of
US$ 6 m. It notably financed the innovation fund as well as the project's capacity building activities after
the 2005 restructuring. It closed end of December 2007 with a disbursement rate of 65%.

Initially the biometrics data capturing was limited to the core civil service. However, following a
presidential decree in 2004, the Military, Security and Judiciary sectors were included, thereby doubling
the size of civil servants to be captured in the project and delaying the completion of the BIS.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Positive key factors:
    A timely and long preparation phase. The project preparation was timely as it coincided with the
    FY 99-05 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) preparation, ensuring cross-fertilization and strong
    coherence between both. The CSMP was considered the flagship project of the CAS's governance
    pillar. Project preparation lasted nearly 3 years, building on an IDF grant which supported
    consultations on the Government's "Strategic Framework for Civil Service Modernization", the initial
    set up of the EDB, based on the consolidation of personnel files in 1998. An important project
    preparation facility, of US$ 2m, supported analytical work such as a study on the public sector
    management building blocks in Yemen (January 2000). It also financed the set up of the project
    management units and implementation framework, prior to project start. The project also built on the
    preparation of the Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit (PSMAC), approved by the Board a
    year earlier in March 1999. The CSMP was thus part of a comprehensive assistance strategy. The long
    preparation phase enabled to establish strong relations between the reform champions on both sides,
    and the initiation of a dialogue based on data from the civil service census.



                                                     5
      The scope and depth of stakeholder consultation aimed to build understanding and consensus on
      the civil service reform and the supporting project. According to the CAS 99, the proposed
      governance and civil service projects were endorsed during the two rounds of stakeholder
      consultations organized in March and September 1998, both in Sana'a and in governorates. These
      consultations included government services, civil society, academe, donors, parliament, and tribal
      leaders. The supported Strategic Framework for Civil Service Modernization, was discussed in a high
      level national conference held in 1998, under the auspices of the President. The project preparation
      was based on a social and institutional assessment including qualitative focus group discussions in
      four Governorates and quantitative household surveys covering 600 households, which underlined the
      priority public services expected as well as the perceived problems in the public/civil service. IEG's
      2006 country strategy evaluation confirmed the project's participatory process of consensus building,
      in line with best practices at the time.
However, as detailed under sections 3 and 4, the impact of these positive factors on project
implementation and outcomes was less than expected and/ or offset by the following negative factors:
Negative key factors :
      The scope and ambitions of the CAS 99 and the project reflected the high optimism at the time
      and were based on the assumptions that the positive outlook and reform momentum persists. The
      appointment as Minister of Civil Service, of the former Minister of Finance, who successfully
      implemented the first structural adjustment plan, was seen as an indicator of the Government's strong
      commitment to the civil service reform. However, the degree of optimism and commitment
      diminished, as evidenced by the less ambitious CAS 02, but the CSMP remained unchanged.
      The overambitious and complex project design both in terms of scope (5 components and 15
      subcomponents) and sophistication (development of complex human resources and financial
      management IT systems, such as AFMIS, EDB, BIS). The project was seeking to address at the same
      time major legislative and regulatory reforms, civil service downsizing, institutional and
      organizational restructuring, new core management information systems, as well as intensive capacity
      building. This strained limited Government management and implementation capacity and increased
      resistance from major constituencies affected by these numerous and simultaneous reforms. The bleak
      findings of the World Bank's evaluation of two decades of support to Civil Service Reforms (CSR),
      published on April 27, 19992, might have warranted a stronger consideration of the operation's
      risks and a more prudent and gradual approach in order to mitigate these. The evaluation found
      "that Bank supported CSRs were largely ineffective in achieving sustainable results in downsizing,
      capacity building and institutional reform, in part due to significant political difficulties in
      implementing CSRs". These were also the objectives and results of the Yemen CSMP.
      The absence of an initial public finance management reform strategy and MoF reengineering
      underpinning AFMIS, affected the system's relevance, as it automated old processes and was lacking
      important functions. A functional design, undertaken after the project's extension, enabled to review
      core processes but the MoF and AFMIS are still lacking cash management function. A public finance
      management reform strategy was finally adopted on August 9, 2005, through Cabinet Resolution No.
      253 of 2005.
      Insufficient integration of in-country lessons learned in the project design. The PAD included a
      review of the main lessons learned from: (i) project implementation in Yemen, suffering from weak
      ownership, project management and M&E; (ii) TA projects, relying too much on supply driven,
      international expertise and suffering from unrealistic timeframes; (iii) public sector reform projects,

   advocating for component specific and adaptable work programs; (iv) labor force adjustment
   programs, suggesting excessive severance packages, adverse selection problems, rehiring and
   inefficient training programs; (v) the CSMP project preparation, highlighting the need to put in place
   implementation capacity. However, the project design did not fully reflect these recommendations, as
   evidenced by the weaknesses in the project's implementation framework and M&E, the lack of
   specific and adaptable work programs and the unrealistic timeframes.
   The project design and implementation framework overstretched weak inter-ministerial
   coordination capacity. The holistic project approach and the horizontal nature of the civil service and
   financial management reforms required a strong coordination mechanism between the numerous
   ministries and stakeholders involved and affected by these reforms. The situation was worsened by the
   numerous donors supporting notably the reengineering and capacity building reforms (UNDP,
   DFID, EU, Dutch cooperation, ...).
   Donor coordination was an issue, particularly in the field of government agency streamlining
   and capacity building. The PAD acknowledged it and the innovation fund was supposed to test the
   feasibility of establishing a trust fund to pool all donors resources for reengineering. However, the
   much delayed innovation fund did not achieve this objective and the absence of a donor coordination
   framework weighted negatively on the reform and project implementation.
   The absence of a full fledge socio political analysis, weighted negatively on the design of a project
   supporting a very sensitive and inherently political reform program, such as civil service and public
   administration restructuring and streamlining. Socio-political analysis was at its infancy at the time,
   and the underpinning analytical work focused mainly on the formal regulatory and institutional set up.

   Important risks were underestimated in the project and the mitigation measures turned out to be
   insufficient. The following risks materialized and affected the project most (i) the deterioration of the
   political and security situation which impacted the Government's reform program and authority in
   parts of the country; (ii) the prevalence of weak governance, with corruption and patronage
   undermining the civil service streamlining and reform; (iii) the discontinuation of the concomitant
   Civil Service policy loans and IMF program; (iv) the strong pressure from regional/ tribal
   constituencies on public sector employment, in the context of unfavorable labor market conditions and
   regional tensions; (v) the resistance and influence of strongly decentralized Governorates and
   spending units on the establishment of central civil service management systems and databases.

2.2 Implementation
Since its approval in March 2000, and despite the important preparatory work, the project's start
was very difficult, uneven and slow. Until the end of 2004, the project performance was very poor, with
a disbursement rate of 25% after 4,5 years of implementation and 22 months in problem status, among the
longest in the Bank's overall portfolio. The project also had the highest number of problem flags (5)
including for procurement, project management, and financial performance. The implementation of the
AFMIS component was particularly problematic, as it was lacking a conceptual design, considered mainly
as a computerization project with little ownership and was suffering from serious project management
issues. The civil service component was also experiencing important procurement delays (BIS contract
signed only in the end of the year 2004).

Given the bleak prospect of achieving the project development objectives in the remaining year, the
Bank engaged the Government at high level to resolve these issues or cancel the credit. Following a
request for the project's extension and a substantial budget reallocation to the non-performing AFMIS




                                                    7
component, the Bank substantially increased its supervision and involvement in the project in an attempt
to turn it around. In 2004, 4 missions were carried out, including at director level, three management
review meetings, chaired by the Vice President were held 3 and a high-level dialogue was engaged with
the Yemeni authorities to save the project. By end of 2004, an agreement was reached on important
corrective actions to improve the project's implementation and outcomes. These measures included the
development of a budget classification consistent with GFS 2001, necessary for the development of
AFMIS, the recruitment of an advisor for the development of AFMIS's conceptual design, the recruitment
of an international project manager supporting the AFMIS PIU and an independent firm to test the AFMIS
system before implementation. It further led to a revised AFMIS work program and budget reallocation.

The Mid-term review, produced by the project in October 2003 failed to provide an accurate overview of
the project's performance and output and did not mention the serious issues raised during the different
supervision missions at the time. It focused on activities and inputs and provided an unrealistic and over
optimistic outlook for future project implementation.

The project was revised and extended two times:

The first revision took place on December 15, 2005, on the background of a renewed Government
commitment and initial improvements in project implementation. Following the intense dialogue with the
Bank in 2004, the Government agreed on an action plan to achieve the project development objective, on
the above mentioned corrective measures as well as on the set up of a high-level steering committee, to
improve project guidance, appropriation and coordination. Project execution showed some signs of
improvement with an increase in disbursement and the exit of the project from problem status. Given these
positive developments, the Bank agreed to a project revision comprising: (i) a two-year extension of the
project closing date, to December 31, 2007; (ii) an important budget reallocation (27.6% of total) from the
non performing civil service and capacity building components to AFMIS, and (iii) the transfer of the
capacity building component to a Dutch Trust Fund (TF-24755). As a result the project increased its focus
on the improvement of core systems such as AFMIS and the Biometric Information System.

The second revision took place on December 21, 2007, based on sustained efforts to improve project
implementation and a request for additional financing. The project's closing date was extended to June 30,
2010 and a proposal for additional financing of US$14 million was approved by the Board on April 3,
2008. The additional financing (IDA 4391-YEM) was seeking to finance the costs associated with the
scaling up of activities to enhance the project's impact. It was supposed to: (i) provide support for the
continuation of the reengineering process in selected line departments; (ii) assist with the expansion of the
Human Resource Database beyond the civil service to include employees in the armed forces, judiciary
and the security services, the establishment of a comprehensive Human Resource Management System
and the roll out of AFMIS to all ministries and agencies in Sana'a; and (iii) support the revision of all
current relevant legislation to strengthen the rule of law, meritocracy and performance orientation in
public employment. Eventually the additional financing failed to reach effectiveness. Consequently, the
formal and long overdue revision and strengthening of the projects results framework, with the adoption
of detailed performance indicators, which was part of the additional financing package, did not
materialize. The revision was thus limited to the extension of the project closing date to June 30, 2010 and
the project's component and logical framework remained unchanged.




3 Missions took place in March, September, November, and December 2004 as well as in June and September 2005. Management reviews were
held in July, October and December 2004



                                                                  8
Key factors affecting project implementation:
Factors outside the control of Government or implementing agency:
    The deterioration of the security situation affected cooperation and project implementation since the
    beginning, with stronger disruptions by security and terrorist related incidents in 2000, 2002-2003,
    2007-2009. The repeated wars in the north created further political and security tensions, affecting
    reform and project implementation.
    The strong fluctuation in oil prices and government revenues, with a surge in 2000 and 2008 adversely
    affected the acceptance of the civil service streamlining and restructuring reforms and fuelled
    resistance. Likewise, the deterioration of the economic and employment situation in the non-
    hydrocarbon sector increased pressure on the civil service.
    The important brain drain and high rotation of trained staff further strained the public administration's
    capacity, already suffering from a wage policy and structure not attractive for qualified staff. This also
    strongly affected the effectiveness of capacity building and training activities.
    Lack of appropriate technical expertise and qualified contractors in Yemen adversely affected contract
    and project implementation. This was particularly the major IT contract to develop and implement the
    AFMIS system.
Factors subject to the control of Government or implementing agency:
Positive factors
    The direct involvement of some senior government officials in project management and
    implementation, which compensated to a certain extent the lack of capacity and appropriation by the
    middle management and deficiencies at the PIU level. This was particularly the case after the 2005
    project revision, as evidenced by the AFMIS component turn around and by the BIS expansion to the
    military and security sectors.
Negative factors
    The absence of sustained commitment of the Government to the sensitive but crucial elements of
    the civil service and public administration modernization reforms, such as public service streamlining
    the removal of ghost workers, the revision of the Government mandate and agency reengineering.
    This was already considered a very high risk during project appraisal. It materialized sooner than
    expected on the background of a softening of the fiscal constraint with the increase in oil prices, the
    resumption of tensions and conflict in the northeast and southern provinces and mounting resistance
    from vested interests affected by the reform.
    The limited ownership of the proposed reform implementation modalities, such as the
    development of core information systems, such as the complex EDB, BIS and AFMIS, which at the
    time were proposed in many Bank funded public administration reforms, with very limited success,
    according to IEG's evaluation in 1999. As mentioned, these complex and sophisticated solutions
    appeared to be inappropriate for the country's situation and capacity. The high-tech solutions, such as
    the biometrics system, were seen as a solution to overcome the prevailing governance and patronage
    issues and strong resistance to the civil service streamlining. It raised very high expectations, did not
    succeed in countering resistance and current practices and overshadowed more basic and fundamental
    HR organizational and management deficiencies, such as lack of organigrams and clear reporting
    chains, uneven enforcement of HR policies, lack of documentation, deficient HR and payroll data
    recording, reporting and verification processes. Until 2004, and the consideration of its cancellation,
    the ownership of AFMIS by the Ministry of Finance was also very limited, as evidenced by the
    important delays and disconnect with the Ministry's reforms.




                                                      9
    The size and scope of the biometric system and employee database implementation was
    expanded during project implementation to include the military, judiciary and security sectors,
    and thereby almost doubling the scope of work. These additional sectors were later added through
    a presidential order in 2004. The significant expansion of the system both from a biometrics and
    employee database perspective greatly complicated implementation. To date data capturing of military
    and security forces is still incomplete.
    The authority and mandate of MOCSAI regarding human resource management was challenged
    by some Governorates and spending units. This is evidenced by the very uneven cooperation with
    MOCSAI and the limited contribution of HR data to the compulsory central repository. The law
    43/2005 on employment, wages and salaries, reasserted in art. 20 the obligation to report all HR
    related administrative and financial data to MOCSAI's EDB, but with limited effect. HR and payroll
    data exchange is also limited among central ministries and within MOCSAI. This situation strongly
    undermined the civil service reform and the feasibility of the spported central HR information systems.
    The low capacity of the Yemeni public administration with overall poorly paid and performing
    staff lacking skills and motivation had a strong adverse impact on the project implementation and
    disbursements. Most activities, foreseen in the initial procurement plan slipped 2 years, in a five year
    project. Capacity was particularly low in IT expertise and project management, both of critical
    importance for this broad and complex project, as shown by the delays and difficulties experienced
    with the AFMIS and BIS contracts.
    The absence of a detailed and time bound action plan outlining the Strategic Framework for Civil
    Service Modernization adopted in 1998 negatively impacted the project implementation. At project
    level, while the PAD outlined the project's main activities, there was no specific, time-bound, and
    measurable CSM implementation plan. The project included an initial procurement plan, which soon
    turned out to be unrealistic and suffered a 2-3 years delay. AFMIS's initial implementation plan, was
    mainly focusing on the software development and lacked of realism. It was revised during the project
    restructuring, with more detailed steps and time bound verifiable outputs, which could be verified and
    tested by an external company. This situation affected negatively reform and project implementation.
    Inadequate overall project coordination within the Government due to overlapping mandates,
    high information asymmetry and fragmented implementation arrangements proved detrimental for a
    project with such a broad scope and strong inter-linkages between the different components/ activities.
    This weighted particularly on the civil service component, and the development of core information
    systems, which required a close coordination with the Ministry of Finance and the cooperation from
    the Governorates, spending units and the security Ministries. The latter participated only at a very late
    stage in BIS, HR data exchange remained very limited, and the coordination of civil service
    streamlining efforts and data reconciliation between MOCSAI and MoF was formalized only very
    recently with the creation of a joint committee chaired by the two ministers in march 2009.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The project's M&E design was limited by the absence of a detailed results framework with
appropriate objectively verifiable performance indicators, related to a reform action plan. The
project did not provide for component specific and time bound implementation plans, which was essential
given the project's scope and complexity. This was to be developed during the project inception phase but
did not materialize. Thus, the contract specific implementation schedules could not be linked to a
component and project implementation plan. Furthermore, in the absence of a detailed Government action
plan and a monitoring system, the project implementation could not be linked to reform milestones. The
absence of this results chain from reform to contract implementation, made it extremely difficult to
implement the PAD's two tier M&E system, which foresaw: (i) the set up of a computerized monitoring
system, supposed to track the implementation of key indicators in the logical framework and (ii) semi-


                                                    10
annual external performance audits of all project activities supposed to evaluate the performance of
project management as well as output delivery and quality.

The M&E implementation and utilization are considered highly insufficient, as evidenced by (i) the
failure to establish a functioning computerized monitoring system by the end of the project, (ii) the
absence of regular progress reports produced by the PIUs (only financial reports were submitted), and (iii)
the absence of external performance audits. Only one "performance audit" was carried out by an
independent consultant, in the context of a supervision mission in July 2003. This report made a very
candid and realistic assessment of the reform and the project's weaknesses in light of the CSMP's poor
implementation so far and the lessons learned from many similar unsatisfactory projects. It made strong
recommendations, such as scaling down the AFMIS and capacity building components, strengthening the
underlying PFM reforms, adopting a more incremental and participatory approach to agency reengineering,
enhancing project supervision and dialogue both within the Bank and with the counterparts, strengthening
Government and donor coordination. This report informed the high-level dialogue and supervision in 2004
and the project revision that followed. No further performance audit was undertaken.

The project's M&E system was insufficient given the scope of the project, its numerous stakeholders, as
well as the sensitivity and complexity of its activities. Lack of M&E is part of the reason why the project
failed to promptly detect and prevent unnecessary delays and diversions in the various components.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Weak procurement capacity was an issue both in the administration and in the PIUs. It adversely
affected the pace of project implementation, despite the preparation of tender documents before the
project's effectiveness. Tender and contract approval was protracted, reflecting the cumbersome decision-
making processes and limited capacity and efficiency of the civil service. The initial project procurement
plan was delayed by 2 years. The contract to develop the AFMIS software was signed only end of 2004,
one year prior to project end. Important deficiencies in procurement filing as well as the absence of assets
control increased risks. An independent procurement review carried out in 2010 confirmed these
deficiencies and noted insufficient awareness and compliance with procurement rules and procedures by
program management as well as by the Bank's task teams.

The project's financial management system was stringent and closely monitored by external auditors
and by the Bank. The PIUs FM capacity has been built throughout the project implementation, in a
cooperative and iterative process with the Bank. The project produced quarterly financial monitoring
reports (FMRs), automatically generated the project's accounting software and reviewed by an external
auditor, it submitted annual audit reports, of acceptable quality with reasonable delays (5 months). The
issues identified by the auditors were closely monitored and most of them followed up, including by
COCA, when relating to Government expenditures. Even though, the project experienced delays in
payments it managed to honor all outstanding claims during the project closure phase.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The AFMIS component will be taken forward by a new Bank financed Public Finance Modernization
Project, scheduled for Board discussion in December 2010. The project notably supports the expansion
of AFMIS's scope, by including the following functions: Cash Management, Commitment Controls,
Arrears Management, and Final Accounts. It also supports the expansion of its coverage to cover all the
spending units in the country up to the level of Governorates and Districts. This should contribute to
consolidate the impact and sustainability of AFMIS component's outcomes under the CSMP project.



                                                     11
The other components of the project (including the reforms through MoCSAI such as the biometrics,
HRM and re-engineering) are, at the moment, not scheduled to receive any follow-up support. Other
international and bilateral donors are expected to take forward some of the reforms with agencies such as
the Customs Authority and COCA.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance of objectives

The project's development objective is overall relevant but overambitious. The objective to "assist
government in the creation of sustained utilization of human and financial resources in the administration,
by putting in place core personnel and financial management systems, establishing a mechanism to reduce
the number of unqualified civil servants, and initiating a restructuring process in individual ministries,
while upgrading the management capacity in the civil service", is relevant to address the persistent acute
capacity constraints of the public administration and the civil service's severe quality, effectiveness and
affordability issues, hampering the Government's development and reform efforts. However, these
objectives were too ambitious for a fragile State like Yemen, challenged by political tensions and security
threats, and dire economic and social conditions. The PDO did not sufficiently take into account: (i) the
high sensitivity and long term of the reforms pursued, (ii) the country's political economy and governance
situation, (iii) the administration's significant capacity constraints, or (iv) the lessons learned from the
Bank's unsatisfactory experience in similar projects. While the sustainable management of human and
financial resources was a very relevant objective, the means to achieve this were less, particularly the set
up of new HR and financial management systems. The gradual improvement and modernization of
existing processes and systems might have been more appropriate. The PDO appears excessively
ambitious for a single investment project and the limited time frame foreseen, as evidenced by its limited
outcomes and the two project extensions. The objectives seem more appropriate for the CAS 99'
Governance and public sector reform pillar than for the CSMP, which was only one element of this
comprehensive assistance strategy.
The project was in line with the Government's Civil Service Modernization Strategy. However, the
AFMIS component was less relevant for this strategy, which required rather the consolidation and
modernization of the payroll system, necessary for an integrated HR information system as well as for the
implementation of the new wage structure. The support to the payroll reform was foreseen in the early
stages of project preparation but eventually scaled back, but the elaborate EDB and BIS were maintained.
While streamlining the project was necessary, this arbitrage can be questioned and has adversely affected
the effectiveness of the EDB and BIS, as detailed below.

The project was consistent with the Bank's strategy and focus on public sector reforms at the time.
In FY 98, more than 72% of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategies had a component on public sector
reform, many of which contained civil service reform operations. Yemen's CAS 99 had a pillar focusing
on public sector modernization, of which the CSMP was the flagship project, complemented by a
programmatic series of public sector management adjustment credits, aimed at supporting the policy
dimension of the reforms. However, it did not fully take into account the lessons learned from twenty
years of, largely unsuccessful, support to civil service reforms, as highlighted in IEG's thematic evaluation
in 1999.




                                                     12
Relevance of design

The project design was overall relevant and reflected the CAS's optimism and holistic approach to
public sector modernization. However, it proved to be overambitious and complex considering the reform
implementation context and capacity.
As mentioned under section 2.1, the project's design was too ambitious and complex both in terms of
scope (5 components and 15 subcomponents involving directly more than 12 agencies) and sophistication
(development of complex human resources and financial management IT systems, such as AFMIS, EDB,
BIS). The holistic and integrated approach towards civil service and public sector reform reflected the
views at the time and aimed to mitigate risks and maximize positive inter-linkages between project
component and activities. However, these inter-linkages played against the project when the commitment
towards downsizing faded and institutional resistance grew. They significantly increased the project's
risks. This was evidenced by the disconnect between the new wage policy and increases with the civil
service streamlining and reorganisation, reinforced by the delays in the establishment of an operational
employee database and biometric information system. The core systems' (including AFMIS) lack of
integration with the payroll, itself fragmented is another example of failed inter-linkages.
The overambitious design with inadequate sequencing and phasing strained limited Government
management and implementation capacity, limited sustainable outcomes and increased resistance from
major constituencies affected by these numerous and simultaneous reforms.
The project's coherence and relevance suffered also from the fact that AFMIS, was de-facto a stand-alone
project, with its separate project implementation unit (PIU) reporting to the Ministry of Finance. AFMIS
proved very demanding in terms of technical and management skills both for the Government and the
Bank as it covered the entire budget process and required strong inter-ministerial coordination.
Despite a long preparation phase and extensive stakeholder consultation, the complex and politically
sensitive reforms supported by the project seem to have paid insufficient attention to the Country's
political, economical, and social specificities, and overestimated the political clout and technical capacity
of the still young and weak central Government. The sophisticated IT solutions proposed to build core
information systems did not sufficiently take into account the existing formal and informal institutional set
up and organizational arrangements in place. For instance, the complex and largely informal management
and reporting chains, the lack of consistency, documentation and enforcement of existing human resources
and financial management policies and processes, the important autonomy and influence exerted by
regional and tribal constituencies and by the security sector were not sufficiently taken into account in the
project design. The latter was added much later through a presidential executive order but compliance is
uneven and slow, and biometric data capturing is still incomplete. The very decentralized, fragmented and
heterogeneous human resources and payroll management system across 1400 spending units with uneven
reporting lines to central ministries was not adequately incorporated in the project design and ultimately
negatively weighted on the planned central HR management information systems.
The country's socio-political and governance situation was insufficiently reflected in the project design
and affected adversely the reform process and the project supporting it. For instance, the politically and
socially very sensitive, civil service streamlining and agency restructuring reforms did not sufficiently
take into account the civil service's welfare, cohesion and patronage functions, which created strong
resistance against downsizing. As a result, no ghost worker has officially been identified and removed and
most redundant workers identified and referred to the Civil Service Fund came from defunct State
enterprises and not from the administration.
The Bank's Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP), in 2009, considered the design
arrangements at entry as moderately satisfactory considering "the sound institutional knowledge of the
Yemeni institutional environment as well as on its adjustment to complex and evolving external
environment". However, it also noted that the design was too ambitious and the addition of the AFMIS


                                                     13
component inappropriate for a fragile, post-conflict and low capacity state like Yemen. Furthermore, the
risk assessment and mitigating measures were considered insufficient, notably with regard to the strong
involvement of other donors and the project's high dependence on policy reforms supported by the
parallel Public Sector Management Adjustment Credit. The programmatic PSMAC series was seen as a
means to support the political decisions and policy measures of the civil service reform, thus
complementing the more technical and capacity building role of the CSMP.
However, the Bank's internal Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7) rated the project's quality at
entry unsatisfactory, based on a similar assessment and questioning the relevance of going ahead with
such an ambitious and complex project in the Yemeni context. It found that the Government's
commitment and significant ownership were not sufficient conditions for success of such a complex and
sensitive project.

Relevance of implementation

The relevance of the project implementation framework suffered from the ambitious and complex
project design as well as from phasing and sequencing issues. It did not adequately address the very
demanding coordination required by this holistic reform approach, the high number of stakeholders
involved and affected by these reforms as well as by the numerous donors supporting these reforms. The
implementation framework reflected the large scope and complexity of the project design and exacerbated
already limited management and coordination capacity within the administration. The decentralization of
implementation responsibility to up to 12 agencies and the absence of a program coordinator with overall
responsibility posed important coordination, reporting, and accountability challenges.

The project's logical framework was not sufficiently detailed and operational to facilitate project
implementation and monitoring. It was not built on a Government results framework, nor complemented
by effective PIU monitoring systems. The numerous project subcomponents and activities as well as their
strong inter-linkages and potential synergy warranted a much stronger project monitoring and evaluation
system. As mentioned under section 2.3, the project's M&E was weak and insufficiently implemented.

The reform timing and phasing proved to be an issue, as shown by the implementation of the new
wage structure and increases, without a consolidated and accurate human resources and payroll
information system. Likewise, the timing of the wage increases was suboptimal. While the strong social
pressure and expectations can explain why the Government went ahead with the first general wage
increase it had announced in its strategy, the second increase should have been linked to the agencies'
reengineering and cooperation with the central HR database. This would have permitted to leverage these
two essential and difficult reforms, which in turn could have generated savings partly offsetting the wage
increase. Further, the introduction of complex IT solutions without prior institutional and organizational
clarification and consolidation of HR processes and management is questionable and partly explains the
persistent difficulties encountered by the EDB. The phasing and linkage between the personnel
information and management systems and payroll was particularly problematic. The project focused
attention on the development of an autonomous EDB and BIS within the Ministry of Civil Service, on
which eventually an integrated and computerized payroll would be based. Expected project output for the
payroll were limited to the development of new payroll practices and a plan for its computerization. Given
the dire state of personnel record keeping and the strong decentralization of personnel and payroll
management, the lack of integration of the payroll with the EDB and BIS from the start, strongly affects
the credibility and usefulness of these new databases for civil service streamlining and management. At
present the discrepancies between the payroll (400 000), the BIS (489 000) and the EDB (540 000) will
make reconciliation and integration extremely challenging.

The ICR would rate the project's overall relevance, from today's perspective, as unsatisfactory, based on
the project design and preparations' strength and weaknesses specified under Section 2.1 and 3.1.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
At project outcome level:

The project is rated moderately unsatisfactory. There were significant shortcomings in the
achievement of the project's very ambitious development outcome objectives as well as in its efficiency.
The project's contribution to the broad objective to assist the government in the creation of capacity,
institutions, and systems for improved and sustained utilization of human and financial resources in
Yemen's civil service was very limited, as evidenced by: (i) the increase in the civil service and the wage
bill, (ii) the administration's continued severe capacity constraints, (iii) the limited progress in the
institutional reengineering reform, (iv) the absence of an operational new human and financial resource
management systems. The project efficiency was also limited considering the two restructuring and
extensions, stretching its implementation over 10 years and the project high preparation and management
costs, exceeding 17% of the budget4.

Apart from the AFMIS, the sustainability of project outputs and outcome is subject to significant risks,
such as (i) the limited implementation of the new civil service legal framework, (ii) limited progress of
labor redundancies through the Civil Service Fund, (iii) limited implementation of re-engineering of
ministries, and (iv) the non-completion of the facilitating processes and systems (EDB and data
verification) that make the BIS non-operational.

The PAD two outcome indicators reflect only partially the PDO. The first project outcome indicator,
"the production of consolidated financial statements for budget execution in a timely manner", fails to
capture the objective to create operational HR and financial management systems, which go beyond the
timely production of consolidated financial statements and also include the HR systems (EDB BIS)
representing a central element of the reform and the project. The second outcome indicator "employment
based on positions and a transparent application of civil service law", fails to address the sustainable
utilization of human and financial resources, which was the main rationale for the reform and project and
as such a central part of its objective. For instance, this indicator does not capture the civil service
streamlining and agency reengineering efforts. The capacity building dimension is not covered either.

In order to address these limitations, the project's outcome assessment will also look at the PDO and the
component specific outcomes, notably based on the more comprehensive results indicators included in the
Government's development policy letter annexed to the PAD.

The project's two above mentioned outcome indicators are rated moderately unsatisfactory. The
first objective can be considered partially achieved, based on the last Public Expenditures and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) report, published in June 2008, confirming that the Government prepares
consolidated financial statements, on average 10 months after the budget closure, which is considered
timely. However, it also notes, under indicator PI 25, that these statements do not include payment or tax
arrears and are not based on the international COFOG/GFS standards. This should be the case once the
new accounting and financial management information system is finalized and rolled out.

The project's second objective cannot be considered as achieved, given the fact that: (i) the integrated
and standard system of employment description and evaluation, required by art. 29 of the law n°43/2005
on employment, wages and salaries, is not yet fully in place, and (ii) the core human resource information

    Project operating costs represented US$ 2.74 m and WB management cost (BB) reached US$ 2.41 m.




                                                                    15
systems, which would enable to correlate staff and positions and ensure a consistent and transparent
implementation of civil service law are not yet operational.

The civil service legal and regulatory framework has been substantially revised, with the adoption of the
new national salary strategy, the law n°43/2005 and its numerous bylaws. This comprehensive law is a
cornerstone of the civil service modernization reform, introducing notably a simplified and modernized
wage structure, consolidated allowances, increased wages and a link to performance, some wage
decompression, and providing for a more integrated and harmonized human resource management system,
linked with the payroll and employee database. However, its full and effective implementation is very
demanding and challenging, considering the following important institutional and organizational
prerequisites. For instance, it requires the set up of specific technical units in all agencies and governorates
to ensure the correct transfer of staff to the new wage structure, the preparation and adoption of integrated
standard systems of job profiles and evaluation, directories and head counts for each of the 1400 spending
units, integration of the payroll. Furthermore, the law obliges, in its art. 20, all spending units to regularly
update EDB with accurate data, which is necessary for the effective and transparent implementation of
this law. Compliance and data accuracy are still very uneven. In sum, most of these prerequisites are not
yet in place, limiting greatly the effectiveness and the expected benefits of the reform.

The holistic approach to civil service modernization adopted in the Strategy aimed at reducing the wage
bill by compensating the wage increases with savings form streamlined and efficiency gains. However,
compliance with the removal of all double dippers and ghost workers (art. 19) is partial. The restructuring
process has largely remained limited to studies with little implementation, which was initially foreseen for
the second phase. Most studies did not translate in restructuring plans and the second phase did not
materialize. Thus, the expected savings and efficiency gains from the reengineering process remained very
limited. Likewise, the biometrics system is not yet operational, further hampering the project's objective
to identify and subsequently remove all double dippers and ghost workers. Finally, the envisioned linkage
between the salary reform and restructuring has not been adhered to in practice and wage increases were
not conditioned by savings accomplished through re-engineering. The former proceeded independently
from the latter. Wage and allowances increases contributed to a near doubling of the wage bill, from YR
281 billion in 2005 to YR 597 billion in 2010i, with savings estimated at YR 100 billion over the same
period. Thus, the original aim of the reform and project to address the unsustainable wage bill was not
achieved.

In order to assess the project's effectiveness and complement the limited outcome indicators at the
component level, it seems important to also consider the Government's result indicators and targets
mentioned in its policy letter, annexed to the PAD.

Result indicators/ targets                   Achievements / Results

8. Design and carry out of training Numerous training have been provided, two have been

   restructured departments.

Out of the eight performance indicators above, six warrant negative ratings at project end. Only two
objective were somewhat achieved and can be rated moderately satisfactory (AFMIS and training).

This outcome is slightly higher than IEG's assessment in its 2006 Country assistance evaluation, prior to
the substantial wage increases. The Governance pillar of the two CAS (99-05), of which this project was
the cornerstone, was rated unsatisfactory, considering that "little progress has been achieved, public sector
employment has continued to increase, notwithstanding overstaffing and an unaffordable wage bill; pay
reform and restructuring of key ministries have been delayed; service delivery standard remain low and
financial management has improved slowly". While most of these findings remain valid, progress has
been made on the Accounting and Financial Management Information System (AFMIS).

At component outcome level, based on outcome and outputs detailed in annex 2:
1. The Core Systems component is rated moderately unsatisfactory, considering the uneven and
   incomplete achievements of AFMIS, EDB and BIS. The component's objective was to have core
   systems improved, measured by operating manuals written and approved by cabinet resolution and
   computerized systems in place where appropriate.
    Unlike the civil service component, AFMIS did not benefit from an overall public finance
    management reform strategy or plan at project appraisal, and as such suffered, at least initially, from
    limited visibility and appropriation by the Ministry of Finance. Despite a late and difficult start, the
    AFMIS sub-component has made significant progress since 2004. Its operating manuals have been
    adopted. By project closure a computerized system with the core modules has been developed, tested,
    and rolled-out to the four envisioned pilot ministries (Finance, Education, Health Care and Population,
    and General Operations and Works). In addition, the project has started the roll-out to five additional
    institutions: Customs Authority, Tax Authority, Ministry of Water and Environment, Ministry of Oil
    and Minerals and the Ministry of Electricity. The project developed the following modules: (i) budget
    preparation, (ii) budget execution, (iii) account payable, (iv) fixed assets, (v) revenue, (vii) final
    accounts. The core modules (budget preparation, execution (safe commitment and procurement
    controls, and final accounts) have been finalized and are currently pilot tested in the Ministry of
    Finance and the above-mentioned three line ministries. The budget preparation module is used by the
    Ministry of Finance since 2007, for the 2008 budget, although based on the uploading of budget
    proposals from spending units in the form excel spreadsheets, as the module has not yet been rolled


                                                     17
out. The budget execution and the final accounts modules are pilot tested since 2008 in all four pilot
ministries, representing a substantial part of the budget (60%). The other modules (accounts payable,
fixed assets and revenue) are currently being finalized, based on the external verification done by
KPMG and will then be tested in the four pilot ministries before being rolled out. The data exchange
module with other systems, notably HR and payroll, needs further important work and cooperation
with the other agencies. The cash management module has been postponed, in the absence of a
treasury function at the Ministry of Finance, despite recommendations since the beginning of the
project that this function, presently carried out by the Central Bank be transferred to the Ministry of
Finance, in accordance with international practices. Likewise, the commitment control module has
been postponed to the second phase and will be covered by the follow up project. The system does not
currently support the verification of intended commitments against available resources. In sum, the
three core modules have been successfully developed and are currently being implemented in pilot
ministries. Three out of the nine modules are been further finalized before being pilot tested. And
three modules have not been developed yet. The further development and rolling out of AFMIS will
be supported by the upcoming public finance modernization project.

The development of the civil service core information systems is still faced with concerns and
challenges. Even though the operation manuals have been adopted, as evidenced by the resolution of
council of Ministers n° 18/2008, the computerized systems are not yet operational. The Employee
Database (EDB) has been developed during project preparation, based on the review and
consolidation of personnel files in 1998 but its maintenance has not been directly supported by the
project. To date it is not fully operational for the following reasons: (i) the database is incomplete and
not up to date. Some personnel records are incomplete and missing basic information, such as
employees' age, length of service, unit of employment or pension contributions. It has not been
consistently up dated and many personnel changes (departure, transfer, retirement) and changes to
personnel details (life events/ dependants,...) have not been recorded, as evidenced notably by the
much high number of entries than the BIS and payroll databases. This limits greatly the accuracy and
usefulness of data. (ii) EDB is not fully connected / integrated with the human resources databases for
the Military, the Security sector and the insurance sector (retirement), nor with the fragmented and
decentralized payroll applications, despite the provisions of the civil service law 43/2005.
Notwithstanding important efforts to improve data collection and reporting, through the set up by
MOCSAI of 22 Regional Information Centers (RICs), HR data ownership and reporting deficiencies
from spending units remains an important issue. A clear, standardized and documented process for HR
and payroll data creation, collection, reporting, updating and control still needs to be put in place and
effectively and consistently enforced. This should have been a priority for the project.

Likewise, the establishment of a biometric information System (BIS) is well advanced but not
yet operational. A significant work program remains for the Government to operationalize and
institutionalize the BIS within its HR operations. First of all, the capturing of biometrics data is not
complete yet for the military and security forces, with both showing a completion ratio around 80%.
Second, only 50% of the captured data has been uploaded into the biometrics system, and the rest
remains stored on temporary files (computers, CDs,...). The main bottleneck in loading and printing
ID cards is the linkage between BIS and the EDB. The EDB plays a critical role as it would provide
demographic and administrative data (such as name, function and location of work) to the BIS to be
printed on ID cards. However, as mentioned above, details of changes to employee data have not been
systematically recorded in EDB. Data is submitted to the "central" HR database in paper form and
most of the paper is simply stored, without the details being entered into the database. In essence,
what this approach has resulted in is an obsolete data set, which compromises the integrity and
accuracy of data in EDB. Therefore, before EDB be used and before any new fingerprint ID card can
be printed from BIS, EDB must be up dated and its accuracy reviewed and ensured, to prevent
printing cards for people that no longer work in the civil service or contains inaccurate information.


                                                 18
    The project to date does not have in place adequate plans and has not secured funding to undertake
    this revision and completion. Nevertheless, the process of capturing biometric data had an incidental
    positive effect as many civil servants holding several positions came forward voluntarily and
    relinquished one position fearing of being caught by the new system.

    The project put little emphasis on the payroll system consolidation and modernization. Despite
    MOCSAI's efforts to develop a uniform MS Access based Payroll database, presently tested in 10
    sites, the current Payroll system is still fragmented, not harmonized. It suffers from a wide
    heterogeneity of applications, ranging from sophisticated Oracle database at the Ministries of
    Education and Oil to paper ledgers in remote spending units. It is fragmented among the 1400
    spending units, which report only line items to the Ministry of Finance and with uneven consistency to
    their sectoral ministries and MOCSAI. As mentioned above, this situation weights negatively on the
    establishment of a comprehensive and accurate HR management information system.
    Progress has been made on the modernization of the civil service legal and regulatory framework,
    with the adoption of a new law (No 43/2005) on employment, wages and salaries system, as well as
    its numerous bylaws on: (i) transfers to the three employment scales, (ii) rules for allowances, (iii)
    more transparent recruitment and employment procedures, (iv) the set up of a Civil Service Fund, to
    process redundant employees, and (v) the establishment of civil service directories. This numerous
    legislation is detailed in annex 2. However, as mentioned above, its enforcement is only partial.

2. The second component, Civil Service Fund, aiming at rationalizing the size and capacity of the
   civil service is rated unsatisfactory, considering the component's objective "a workforce
   streamlined and becoming more efficient", and the evaluation criteria foreseen in the PAD: "the
   reduction of the number of civil servants on the payroll and the retention of high quality workers".
   The reform and the project did not achieve the objective, as evidenced by the important increase
   (24%) in the number of civil service employees on the wage bill, raising form 330 000 in 1998 to 410
   000 in the budget 2010. Likewise, the payroll increased steadily during the last decade, with a 26%
   increase in 2007, after the introduction of the new wage bill. However, the bill did not enhance the
   civil service effectiveness or attractiveness for high quality workers as it did not improve the prospects
   of wage progression (wage compression of 1 to 4), resolve the problem of patronage, lack of
   transparency and uneven application of the civil service law (no ghost worker has been officially
   removed) or introduce performance orientation/ compensation. Most structural weaknesses of the civil
   service remain, with few but notable exceptions, such as MOCSAI's transparent and competitive
   selection of its management. It has yet to be replicated elsewhere and lead to a performance based
   framework.

    The National Wage and Salaries Strategy, adopted in 2005, was partially implemented, resulting
    in an important increase in the wage bill, which was already not sustainable, without correcting its
    structural weaknesses nor improving the efficiency of the civil service. The strategy provided for (i)
    an important wage increase (between 20-40% across the board), (ii) a revised employment, and wage
    scale, only partially addressing the compression problem, and (iii) a revision of the numerous
    allowances. However, it did not fully take into account the major recommendations of the National
    Salary Strategy Report prepared under the project, such as the move from an education to a job
    centered pay structure, a greater pay progression to enhance motivation, undertaking a unit based
    headcount and EDB update before the transfer to the new scale, and delinking, initially, the increased
    wages from pension benefits to avoid important deficits. Furthermore, the report suggested
    introducing the Full Time Equivalent as HR unit, in order to take into account the limited working
    hours in the Yemeni civil service (5/ day on average) and increase flexibility in HR management and
    restructuring. This proved too complex for the existing administrative structures and monitoring
    systems. Due to the overall wage increase, the wage compression improved only slightly, from 3-1 to
    4-1 and thus did not really address the lack of incentives from low wage progression. The allowances,


                                                     19
    initially 65, have been significantly consolidated in a common work nature allowance and the general
    allowances have been integrated into the basic salary. Rules and procedures for allowances have been
    clarified, making their attribution more transparent. But, this reform has not led to a reduction in the
    amount of allowances, even if their relative share to the basic salary has decreased due the wage
    increase. Regional hardship allowances remain insufficient to attract competent civil servants in
    remote areas. Technical assistance was provided for the development of standard job descriptions, but
    they have not yet been implemented. Thus, salaries remain solely based on administrative grades and
    education levels, which is not conducive to performance evaluation and compensation.
    Even if initial savings could be made by referring employees to the pension and the civil service funds,
    these savings remained modest due to the delayed restructuring agenda and limited results in
    removing double dippers and ghost workers from the payroll. They only partly offset the substantial
    wage bill increases in 2007 and 2008, estimated respectively at +26% and +15%ii.

    Some results have been achieved with the enforcement of retirement rules. From 2006 to 2009,
    28 097 employees, who had served past retirement age, were retired. This improvement is the result of
    MOCSAI's census and identification work, as well as of the strengthening and enforcement of
    existing retirement rules. A Cabinet decree (211/2007) and a circular from the Prime Minister were
    passed to specify actions to be taken to enforce retirement in the public service. Furthermore, since
    2000 a total of 44 703 civil servants have retired, on average 4500 persons per year. However, this
    number represents merely 0.5% of the total civil service and is well below the normal retirement ratio
    of 3% noted in other civil services with similar population age. This could be partly due to weak
    information in existing HR databases (an estimated 7% of EDB population has no birth/starting date)
    and probably to an uneven application of the rules.

    The removal from payroll of ghost workers and double dippers has achieved modest results.
    Despite initial public announcements of 60 000 double dippers and ghost workers in the civil service,
    at the beginning of the reform, only 3792 double dippers were removed from payroll as of end 2009.
    From this total number 3767 employees came forward on a voluntary basis to relinquish one of their
    jobs and only 25 double dippers were identified based on the HR databases. No ghost workers have
    been identified and removed from payroll in official records. These results were validated by a joint
    working group co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and Civil Service to evaluate the benefits of the
    reform. A similar exercise is underway to complement the 2009 and 2010 figures.

    The contribution of the Civil Service Fund (CFS) to the streamlining reform was effective but
    modest, notably constrained by limited referrals and financial resources. The CSF was established
    with the enactment of Law 1/1999 and Law 314/2000 and was gradually set up, with branches in four
    Governorates. However, due to legal intricacies with the existing legal and regulatory civil service
    framework and delays in its organizational set up, the Fund became operational only by the end of
    2004. It processed 14,127 redundant staff, notably from defunct or privatized state enterprises, during
    Phase I from April 2006 to March 2009. 2,250 employees received their statutory pension, 1 100 were
    redeployed to other public services and 10,777 taken care of by the CSF. Among these, 93.7% opted
    for early retirement and were transferred to the pension authority, and 6.3% opted for severance
    packages (10,300 USD av.). The total cost to the Fund was US$ 17.8m. However, as no budget
    allocation was foreseen to offset the resulting pension contribution deficit, exacerbated by the wage
    increase, the Pension Authority refused new referrals. New redundant workers are expected to be
    processed in 2011, based on budget availability.

3. Under the project's third component on Government agency reengineering many studies have
   been completed, but there is little evidence of implementation. Thus, in light of the stated objective
   "to streamline operating procedures in selected agencies" and performance indicator "workflow
   delivery improved against service standards, in restructured agencies", the results are considered


                                                    20
unsatisfactory, as there is very little evidence of outcome in terms of restructured agencies or
improved workflows/ service delivery. However, it must be noted that the project' s activities focused
on the reengineering studies and that their implementation was supposed to be supported during a
follow up project, which never materialized. Despite the project's two extensions, no support has been
provided for the implementation of approved studies.
A study was conducted in 2006, to review the Government's mandate in order to clarify the
responsibilities of ministries and main agencies, identify overlaps, and propose measures to rationalize
and streamline ministries and agencies. However, after completion of the study at the end of 2006,
there was no evidence that the Government approved or started implementing this inherently political
and sensitive study. A study on the introduction of standard job classification in the civil service was
conducted in 2006. A Cabinet order n°146/2009 regarding the new job classification has just been
adopted and needs to be implemented. Further, a related study was conducted to develop performance
indicators, trying to link them directly to the mission, the vision and the strategic goals of nine
ministries and agencies. However, the final report raised important quality issues and lacked specific
and operational recommendations. It was thus not implemented.
Over the course of the project, approximately US$ 4.17 million have been spent on a number of "re-
engineering studies" of individual government agencies and departments. The methodology followed
to implement these studies aimed to increase local knowledge and appropriation. Most studies were
conducted in close collaboration with focal groups of officials set up in the respective agencies.
Nevertheless, the studies did not always benefit from the necessary involvement and commitment
from the agency leadership and thus did not translate in internal reform action plans. There are
however some exceptions, like COCA and the Custom authority, were the studies appear to have
played a useful catalytic role in crystallizing reform initiatives that were developed by agency staff. A
restructuring plan is being elaborated in both agencies.
However, apart from MOCSAI, who has started a formal reorganization with the adoption of
Republican resolution No 235/2007, and the President resolution n°5/2010 on internal audit, there is
limited evidence of the project funded studies' impact on the restructuring and streamlining of
Government ministries and agencies. Anecdotal information suggests that the Customs authority
started restructuring, supported bilaterally by Jordan. However, contrary to the initial objective, none
of these agencies have referred redundant workers to the Civil Service Fund, which seems to confirm
the limited restructuring and streamlining of their workforce, at least at this stage.

This component included an innovation fund aimed at providing (i) short term, innovative and
visible benefits to the citizens to sustain the reform momentum, (ii) to test the idea of creating a
common fund to channel donor financing for agency restructuring, and (iii) to leave room for
changing circumstances and opportunistically capture reform initiatives by other agencies. Based on
the limited information available these objectives do not seem to have been achieved for the following
reasons. First, it took seven years until six projects were selected and approved and between one to
two years to implement them, which does not qualify as "quick fixes". Second, while most selected
projects were geared towards the citizens, their degree of innovation varied. For instance, the set up of
a help desk at MOCSAI or an information center at the Airport, can be considered innovative
compared to existing administrative practices, the installation of three ATMs for the postal office or
medical equipment for the Republican Hospital's emergency services might be less innovative. Third,
in the absence of any information on these projects' outcomes, it is not possible to assess the
effectiveness of the intended benefits to citizens. Fourth, as the innovation fund has been entirely
managed by an external consulting company with very limited interaction with the reform teams, it
does not seem to have informed the reform process or support its acceptance/ momentum, as intended.
For instance, it has not contributed to the set up of a common fund to channel donor financing for
agency restructuring, which does not exist.

4. The capacity building component can be rated moderately unsatisfactory, as its objective "to
   enhance the capacity to sustain reforms and manage the public administration", was only partially
   achieved based on the project's indicator : "an effective program plan for follow-on reforms developed.
   Civil service training program implemented with agreed number of civil service servants trained in
   management of public administration and specialist work skills for operating core systems". Even
   though an important number of training activities were delivered, there is no evidence of
   comprehensive qualitative assessment or impact evaluation. The quantitative information available
   indicates that a total of 27 training programs have been delivered to approximately 1,500 civil servants,
   including 5 management training programs for approximately 600 senior Government managers. The
   Dutch Trust Fund financed also the development and set up of a master for business administration
   (MBA) and a master for public administration (MPA) at Sana'a University. The MBA and MPA, were
   part of the sample of the Trust Fund's final external evaluation, finalized on January 28, 2008. While
   providing interesting insights and lessons learned, the evaluation's contribution to this assessment is
   limited as it covers only two projects. The evaluation noted notably that the training project's
   relevance depended strongly on the degree of local ownership, which was overall limited, but better
   for the two courses set up at Sana'a University. Further, it found the MBA effective both in terms of
   institutional development and human capacity building, while the MPA less effective in institutional
   development. It also highlighted the generally negative impact of brain drain on the effectiveness of
   such training programs.

3.3 Efficiency
The above-mentioned efficiency criteria are not applicable for an institutional capacity building project
like this one. Nevertheless, the project's efficiency is limited considering (i) the limited output and
outcome specified above and in annex 2, (ii) the two restructuring and extensions, stretching its
implementation from 5 to 10 years and (iii) the project's high preparation and management costs,
exceeding 17% of the budget. The addition of the AFMIS component required the set up of a second and
separate PIU, thus increasing management and supervision costs. WB management and supervision cost
(BB budget) for this project totaled US$2.41 m or 8% of the total project budget.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory, based on the assessments under sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 and
particularly considering the AFMIS outcome.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development: N/A

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The AFMIS resulted in important institutional changes, reinforced by the technical assistance on the
systems' conceptual design. The iterative development of the AFMIS application and its conceptual
design was an opportunity to review, clarify, and specify the responsibilities and functions across the
budget cycle both at the Ministry of Finance as well as in the four major pilot Ministries (Education,
Health care and Population, and General Operations and Works). It highlighted the functions that need to
be further developed, such as treasury and cash management, debt and project management, etc....).

Even if the work on restructuring has not yielded many benefits at this stage, some of the reengineering
studies were accepted and applied by the corresponding ministries. For instance MOCSAI revised and
clarified its organization with the adoption of Republican resolution No 235/2007 and undertook a
competitive external selection of its top management.


                                                    22
Training efforts supported by the project and the Dutch Trust Fund, both locally and internationally, have
contributed to build expertise and long-term capacity at the country level, as evidenced by the MBA and
MPA introduced at Sana'a University.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Positive:
 As most service contracts under the project were awarded to local companies (AFMIS software
    development trainings, ....), there were positive externalities in terms of capacity building and transfer
    of know how to local consulting firms.

Negative:
 The project was instrumental in the development of the Civil service modernization reform and the
   National Wage and Salaries Strategy adopted in 2005. However, as this strategy has been only
   partially implemented, it further increased the un-sustainable wage bill without addressing its
   structural weaknesses.
    The project's high visibility and strong ambitions in terms of civil service streamlining and removal of
    double dippers and ghost workers, has substantially exposed the project and the reform champion to
    fierce internal resistance and opposition, as evidenced by the removal of the Minister of Civil Service,
    at the beginning of the project.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops: N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: significant
In line with the IEG methodology, this risks assessment combines their impact and their likeliness of
occurence. The overall sustainability risk to the project development outcome can be considered
significant and not high, because the impact of the below specified risks is commensurate with the modest
project outcome even if their likeliness of occurrence is high. Especially the wider civil service reforms
and the biometrics system are at risk. The BIS needs to be fully institutionalized and adequately
maintained for the sustainability of data collection, storage and updating, as well as for future card
printing. Furthermore, the AFMIS, which is the project's main outcome will receive continued support
under the forthcoming public finance modernization project is less exposed to risks. In the civil service
component, most risks have already materialized and translated in very limited outcomes. The few
remaining outcomes, such as the reengineering of MOCSAI or Customs or the new employment structure
and payment scale introduced by law N°43/2005 are thus less exposed to risks.
At the time of this evaluation the main risk to the project development outcome are the following:
    The political and security risks are high, considering the fragile truce with the northern tribes, the
    increased discontent and secessionist aspirations of the southern communities and the increased
    terrorist threat from Al Qaida of the Arabic Peninsula (AQAP). This risk is further increased by the
    prospect of upcoming presidential elections in such a tense situation.
    The governance risk is high, as highlighted in the country's Governance indicators and CPIA and
    Transparency international ratings. The prevalent corruption and patronage, notably in public finance
    management and civil service appointments are the biggest risk to the project's development outcome.
    The risk of reduced government ownership and commitment is considered significant but not
    high, mainly because the AFMIS seems to have reached a critical mass of support. It is presently


                                                     23
    rolled out to core ministries representing more than 60% of the budget. As most risks affecting the
    civil service component have already materialized, outstanding sustainability risks are limited.
    The risk of lack of institutional support is considered moderate to significant for the same reasons
    as above. It might, however, be more important for the accounting and control dimensions of AFMIS
    given the high number of civil servants involved/ affected, notably in the Governorates and their
    potentially diverging interests.
    The economic risk is considered moderate. The likelihood that the current fiscal crisis has strong
    adverse economic consequences is high. The impact of worsening fiscal and economic conditions on
    the project's main output, AFMIS, is unclear, as a difficult fiscal situation might also strengthen the
    political will and public acceptance of structural public finance management reforms.
    The social risk is significant, considering the limited employment and revenue generation
    opportunities, at least in the short and medium term, until the social safety net and private sector
    reforms underway bear some fruits. In the meantime the pressure will remain strong on the current
    welfare and income distribution functions of the civil service and of public expenditures.
    The financial risk is significant, because of the partial and fragile outcome of the civil service
    component. The continued financing, from scarce budget resources, of the biometric information
    system's completion and maintenance represents a significant risk.
    The overall technical risk is significant. It is high for the finalisation and maintenance of the BIS
    and EDB, considering the very limited IT capacity in MOCSAI (staff reduced from 10 to 4) and the
    dismantling of PIU and contractor teams. It is moderate for AFMIS, given the strong ownership and
    continuation of support.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The project preparation was thorough (3 years), timely (along with CAS and WB/ IMF CS budget
supports) and in line with the Bank's focus on governance and civil service reforms at the time. It was
consistent with the Government's strategy, supported by an earlier IDF grant.
As noted above, the project was too ambitious and complex for a low income, low capacity, fragile state
like Yemen, plagued by weak governance and severe security issues. It did not sufficiently take into
account the existing formal and informal institutional and organizational set up prevailing at the time. The
risks and lessons learned were reviewed in the PAD but not sufficiently reflected in the project design, as
they would have warranted for a more prudent, gradual and sequenced approach. The project design also
suffered from weaknesses in the timing and phasing of certain reforms/ activities, such as the introduction
of new human resource policies, while developing HR management information systems and processes
and conducting reengineering studies. Likewise, the introduction of complex IT solutions, somewhat
disconnected from the country's realities, and without prior improvement of the basic HR processes and
management proved to be questionable. The integration of the AFMIS component, which was a project of
its own, substantially added to the overall complexity and strained limited management, coordination, and
monitoring capacity.
The results framework was too succinct and project specific, in the absence of a Government reform
implementation and monitoring framework. The project's two outcome indicators, "the production of
consolidated financial statements for budget execution in a timely manner, and employment based on
positions and a transparent application of civil service law", only partially reflect the PDO, as they do not



                                                     24
capture the objective to create operational HR (EDB and BIS) and financial management systems nor the
objective of sustainable utilization of human and financial resources (streamlining and restructuring).

The Bank's internal quality assessment was mixed. In its Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7) the
project's quality at entry was rated unsatisfactory. Whereas, the 2008 Quality Assessment of Lending
Portfolio (QALP), rated the project's quality at entry as moderately satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision rating: Unsatisfactory

Overall, the Bank has invested heavily in project supervision (total of US$2.4 m), with mixed results:

    Despite important efforts to get the project back on track, the project revision failed to fully integrate
    the lessons learned from the problematic project implementation and to streamline the project
    accordingly. An external review in July 2003, highlighted the project's over ambition, great
    complexity and lack of integration with the political and social realities. It recommended "to consider
    substantial modifications of the over-ambitious problem components, AFMIS, human-resource
    management, and training". The Bank considered canceling the AFMIS component, but the
    sophisticated and challenging EDB and BIS were not questioned. The training component was later
    transferred to a Dutch trust fund financing training capacity building in Yemen. Likewise, the project
    results framework and M&E, whose weaknesses were acknowledged in the 2004 management review
    meetings, was not strengthened. Nor was the PDO revised.

    The frequency of supervision and reporting varied. Supervision missions and reporting (ISR) took
    place on a regular basis until the first project restructuring was completed, in the middle of 2005 and
    the project showed initial improvements. ISR reporting became much less regular until end of 2009,
    with lags of up to 1.5 years between two ISR, although there were supervision missions in between (ie
    September 2005). There is little evidence of management comments on the ISR.

    The missions' skills mix was overall appropriate for the projects' scope and complexity,
    considering existing expertise and resource constraints. Most missions included the following
    expertise: public sector, AFMIS, financial management and procurement. In July 2009, an external
    consultant was recruited for a thorough assessment of the core human resources information systems
    supported by the project. Testing/ validation of AFMIS was entrusted to KPMG, who undertook 4
    field visits between 2005 and 2009. These two missions provided very specific information on the
    core systems' progress or lack thereof.

    The candor and quality of ISRs and aide memoires varied greatly between the different teams and
    did not always reflect the accurate status of project implementation and results. Information collected
    during supervision missions was not always appropriately verified and assertions about project
    performance and outputs were sometimes too optimistic and unsubstantiated.

      19        07/04/2010       Moderately Unsatisfactory               Unsatisfactory

The complexity and broad scope of the project, the difficult working environment characterized by strong
information asymmetry and security issues, and the absence of an effective monitoring and evaluation
system in place, made the supervision of this project particularly challenging.

The very high turnover of project TTLs (7 during the project life) and teams weighted negatively on the
consistency, effectiveness, and quality of project supervision.

The project revision and important reallocations from the civil service and training component to the core
IT systems has not resulted in a revision of PDO and performance indicators. Excessive attention seems to
have been devoted to the development of core systems, whose budget allocation rose from 50% to 75%. It
was to the detriment of the more difficult but necessary institution building and revision of processes. Too
little attention has also been devoted to the employee database despite the fact that it is the core HR
system and indispensable for an operational BIS.

The Bank internal Quality of Supervision Assessment (QSA7) rated the Bank supervision overall
moderately satisfactory, with the candor and quality of ISR rated moderately unsatisfactory. The QALP
2008 rated the quality of bank supervision as moderately unsatisfactory. The ICR shares this assessment,
based on the missed opportunity to considerably streamline the project after the mid-term review in 2003,
the lack of continuity in project management and weaknesses in reporting, while taking into account the
challenges and the efforts made to turn the project around in 2004. However, the Borrower's negative
assessment of the Bank's performance and attitude in the attached self-assessment, warrants and overall
unsatisfactory rating

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance rating: Unsatisfactory

The Bank's overall performance is rated unsatisfactory, based on the above-mentioned weaknesses both in
terms of quality at entry and supervision, while considering the important governance and security
challenges, which strongly affected this highly sensitive reform and project.

The Bank showed important efforts and commitment, at the highest level, during the two project revisions
in 2004/2005 and 2007, with some success, as evidenced by the turnaround of the AFMIS component, the
project's main outcome.

It is however questionable, why an additional financing of US$ 14 million was processed and approved in
April 2008, given the overall poor track record of project implementation so far, the difficult governance
and security environment, and the limited implementation time left (2 years). The project's past
disbursement rate did not support the expectation that the substantial additional funds could be disbursed
within the last two years (the additional financing assumed that this 8 year-old project could multiply 11



                                                    26
times the disbursements made in the last nine month). The additional financing never reached
effectiveness creating unnecessary frustration on both sides.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

The Government showed strong commitment and involvement at project preparation and design stage,
particularly on the civil service component. It enacted a comprehensive and ambitious Strategic
Framework for Civil Service Modernization, on which the project was based. This process was very
participatory, culminating with a National Conference, opened by the President in 1998. However, due to
various internal and external reasons mentioned above, the commitment was not maintained on the most
difficult and sensitive aspects of the civil service reform, particularly on the streamlining and restructuring
component, which were only partially implemented. The implementation of the National Wage Strategy,
prior to the restructuring of government agencies and the streamlining of the civil service, led to an
important increase in the wage bill, contrary to the reform's objective.

During the first four years of project implementation, the AFMIS component made very little progress and
was poorly managed. This situation resulted in an official request from the Bank to change the project
manager and take critical mitigating measures to save this component, which the Government did, with
some success, as evidenced by the positive development of the AFMIS component.

Despite Government efforts and an elaborated project oversight and implementation framework,
coordination and reform phasing issues adversely affected the project. For instance, the AFMIS
component proceeded with hardware acquisition before the identification of critical PFM reform actions
and prior to the conceptual design of the system. The human resources information systems and databases
supported under the project still suffers from coordination, cooperation, and integration issues both at
central government level and with local spending units. The set up in March 2009 of a joint working group
co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Civil Service and Insurance, was a welcome
step to enhance cooperation and data exchange, notably on civil service streamlining and corresponding
adjustment to the payroll. Such a coordination mechanism should have been in place since the beginning
of the project. This enhanced cooperation was particularly necessary to address the lack of integration
between the Government's HR and financial information system.

Strong capacity constraints in complex project management and in very specialized IT skills, negatively
affected the Government's performance. The planned capacity building and training did not sufficiently
address this issue.

The reform led, with the support of the project, to a substantial revision of the Government's civil service
legal and regulatory framework. More than 30 laws, regulations and Council resolutions were passed. The
challenge now lies in their effective, consistent, and transparent implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Until the change of the program manager of the AFMIS component in 2005, the performance of the PIU
was poor and led to significant implementation and disbursement delays. Recruitment of PIU staff and
procurement did not always comply with Bank procedures. The situation improved with the new
management team and technical assistance to the PIU.

The overall Civil Service PIU's performance was better but uneven across components and not sustained
over time. Performance in terms of management, supervision, and reporting was better for the core



                                                      27
systems and streamlining (Civil Service Fund) than for the reengineering, innovation fund and capacity
building components, as evidenced by the limited information provided by the project on the status and
outcome of these activities. Lack of pro-active problem resolution caused undue delays, as evidenced by
the near paralysis of biometrics data processing for almost two years, when new ID cards had to be
purchased for quality reasons.

The project implementation suffered from considerable procurement delays at the beginning. The initial
procurement plan was delayed by two years, and some contracts, like for the BIS were signed only one
year before the initial end of the project. An independent procurement review noted generalized poor
procurement filling and contract management in both PIUs. Asset control was almost non-existent. In the
AFMIS PIU there was no procurement staff appointed for a long time.

Financial management was an issue particularly at the beginning of the project and suffered also from
staff turnover, but improved gradually and was considered satisfactory at project end.

The monitoring and evaluation system foreseen in the project document was not fully implemented, as
evidenced by the absence of an automated M&E system and independent performance audits. The absence
of a genuine M&E system at project level, combined with an incomplete results framework and no
detailed reform implementation plan, affected negatively project supervision and the possibility to take
remedial actions in due course.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

Despite a strong initial commitment from the Government to the comprehensive and participatory reform
agenda, its implementation was uneven and adversely affected by strong capacity constraints and
coordination issues.

PIU's performance was uneven across components and suffered from the lack of an operational
monitoring and evaluation system, thus influencing the overall rating.

6. Lessons Learned

The following lessons can be learned from the ICR's findings:

    The project reflects the numerous and often painful lessons learnt from now 30 years of Bank support
    to civil service reforms: projects of this kind need to be much more focused and in line with the
    country's context and administrative capacity. The phasing of reform needs to ensure that the basic
    human and financial resources management functions and processes are in place or addressed before
    envisaging complex IT solutions. The approach needs to be more incremental and opportunistic, thus
    requiring more flexibility.

    Given the highly political nature and sensitivity of government reengineering and civil service
    reforms, their feasibility needs to be based on a thorough analysis of the country's political economy,
    governance, and corruption situation. Whenever, public employment plays an essential welfare
    function, like in Yemen and many other countries, credible alternatives, such as social transfers or
    safety nets need to be envisaged to alleviate the social impact of streamlining and thus opposition to
    the reform.

    As evidenced by this project, appraisal needs to focus on the effective demand as much as on the
    need for reforms and avoid the supply of conventional technical solutions. For instance AFMIS



                                                   28
    suffered from the lack of demand for public finance management reforms. Technical solutions alone
    cannot appropriately address public sector management deficiencies as they fail to capture the human
    dimension and the related bounded rationality affecting the decision making process (ref. D. North).
    The set up of an HR information system was a necessary but insufficient condition to improve HR
    management, which is strongly influenced by socio-political considerations and informal rules and
    procedures. Therefore, much more attention must be paid to the "soft" nature of public administration
    reforms as well as to the informal institutional rules and organizational arrangements.

    At operational level, this project highlights the importance of a specific and realistic results
    framework, based on a reform strategy with a detailed and time bound implementation plan and
    informed by an appropriate monitoring and evaluation system at project level. The M&E
    arrangement need to be clear from the start.

    It further, shows the importance of a detailed and candid risk analysis and a realistic assessment of
    the mitigating measures. The project's ambitions and scope need to reflect this risk assessment.

    It also shows the need for continuity in project management and an ongoing dialogue with the project
    counterparts and main stakeholders. This requires a strong and clear involvement of the field office.

    Finally, two lessons learnt that could be useful for the upcoming public finance modernization
    project are: (i) the importance to address the payroll fragmentation and lack of integration with
    AFMIS and the HR systems and databases, and (ii) the need to systematically include HR and
    Payroll controls in internal control and external audit of spending units (not limited to the financial
    flow as it is currently the case).

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower's comments on the Bank's performance have been taken into account and warrant
an unsatisfactory rating.

The data on wage bill evolution has been modified and replaced by data from the approved IMF
art. IV reports.

The impact of the Wage strategy on the wage bill increase has been qualified. The role of
increased allowances has been added. The baseline has been changed from 2006 to 2005 as
requested.

The new personnel referred to the Civil Service Fund in 2010 and expected to be processed in
2011, beyond the project's time frame, are mentioned but cannot be taken into account in the
assessment. The origin of the referred workers has been qualified.

Regarding the reengineering studies, the report mentions that the project activities focused on the
first phase, i.e. conducting the studies, and that implementation was foreseen in the second phase,
after 2006. It also mentioned that these studies were delayed and that their implementation has
not been supported, despite the project's two extensions.

The statement about the declining number of IT personnel at MOCSAI has been corrected. The
17% spent on project preparation and management includes the project preparation costs.

The ICR considered the statistics on retirees, double dippers and ghost workers removed from the
payroll mentioned in the comments and decided to keep the official data produced by the
Government in the 2009 joint report from the Ministers of Civil Service and Insurance and
Finance, confirmed by various Bank assessments and external reviews. All supporting documents
are listed in annex 7.

Most comments provide useful additional information on the country context and reform
implementation. They are summarized in annex taking into account the information already
provided in the self-assessment.

                                 Annex 2. Outputs by Component

After more than 10 years of implementation and two restructuring, the project achieved the following
modest outputs:

1. Component ­ Improve Core Systems

    1.1. Human resources management framework
        Advice and technical assistance for the National Wage and Salaries Strategy. The project
        financed the National Salary Strategy Report prepared by ARADO and Ernst&Young. The
        Strategy was adopted in 2005, providing for (i) a substantial wage increase across the board
        (between 20-40%), (ii) a revised employment and wage scale, only partially addressing the
        compression problem, and (iii) a revision of the numerous allowances. However, it fell short of
        taking into account the report's major recommendations on the necessary wage decompression,
        the consolidation of the wage scale, the integration of basic allowances into the wage, and job
        description based pay. As mentioned under component 2, the wage and salary increase was
        general and not linked to agencies reengineering and streamlining, thus resulting in a strong wage
        bill increase.
        Advice and technical assistance for the revision of the corresponding legal and regulatory
        framework for civil service. It includes notably the adoption of a new law No 43/2005
        concerning employment, wages and salaries system, its' executive regulation issued by
        Republican resolution No 99/2007, and the following bylaws:

            Resolutions of the Council of ministers Nos. (165-237-238) in 2005 specifying the rules of
            transfer to the general scale of employments, wages and salaries for the higher authority, civil
            servants the military;
            Resolutions of the Council of ministers Nos. (239, 273,287) between 2005 and 2007,
            providing for the executive procedures for the first phase (increase) of the wages and salaries
            national strategy;
            Resolutions of the Council of ministers Nos. (136,137, 144) in 2006, specifying the bases and
            rules for awarding the different allowances ;
            Cabinet Decree No 397/2007 providing for the executive procedures for the second phase
            (increase) of the wages and salaries national strategy
        Input for the revision of civil service recruitment and employment rules and procedures:

            Cabinet decree No. 278/2004, No 143/2006 and No 302/2007, as well as Prime Minister
            Circular No 1/2004 pertaining to the procedures governing new recruitments and the
            adherence to the new automated recruitment system.
            Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 413/2006 concerning the appointment system in
            public employment;
            Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 161/2007 related to the approval of the Civil
            Service Fund Program for the period 2008-2010.
        Assistance for the reorganization of the Ministry of Civil Service and Insurances (MOCSAI),
        through the Republican resolution No 235/2007, based on the reengineering study.




                                                    32
   Technical assistance on the civil services directory, resulting in the adoption of initial procedures
   for the establishment, adoption and dissemination of government services directories, with the
   adoption of Cabinet Decrees No 51,184, 256/2006; 123/2007 and 126/2008.

1.2. The Employee database (EDB)

   A civil service census was completed and an initial Employee Database (EDB) was established,
   based on the existing personnel data in 1998 with an IDF grant, during project preparation. This
   Database was developed by MOCSAI, based on Oracle and initially excluded the defense and
   internal security personnel (around 50% of employees).

   EDB is not fully integrated. Despite the law 43/2005, providing for the establishment of a central
   EDB within MOCSAI and regularly updated by all Ministries/ Spending units, the Database is
   still not fully connected / integrated with the 3 Databases for the Military, the security sector and
   the insurance sector (retirement).

   EDB is incomplete and not up to date. The data populating the original database is a snapshot of
   the civil service in 1998, with the addition of new employees. Partial information was provided
   for employees' age, length of service, unit of employment, pension contributions, as well as on
   retirements, head count/ grade, .... The data accuracy is not guaranteed given the missing data (cf
   retirement dates), unrecorded personnel changes (departure, transfer, retirement) and changes to
   personnel details (life events/ dependants,...). The database also suffers from insufficient verified
   documentation substantiating benefit claims and the absence of systematic data correlation. EDB
   data presents some major consistency issues. For instance, it records only 693 pensioners, 21
   transferred and 16 dismissed employees, for the whole civil service, but more than 11 647 on
   overseas study, representing 2% of the total employees.

   HR data ownership issue and reporting deficiencies from spending units. The HR data is
   largely created and "owned" by the 1400 spending units, managing their respective payroll. Many
   of these units report primarily to the 333 Districts, organized in 23 Governorates, with only a
   dotted reporting line to the ministries. Consistent, timely and accurate data collection and
   verification is thus a particular challenge. In an attempt to improve this, 22 Regional Information
   Centers (RICs), reporting directly to MOCSAI were established in order to update directly the
   central EDB, based on the data they collect from the spending units. To date, equipment, training
   and capacity building of these centers is still ongoing. 18 are in principle "connected" to the
   central EDB, but IT infrastructure and connectivity remains an issue. 3 RICS still have to be
   established at the Ministries of Education, Defense and Interior, representing ¾ of civil servants.
   The acceptance and cooperation of service units with the centers vary, so does the consistency,
   format and accuracy of data provided and flowing into the central EDB. Thus, there was no
   evidence at this stage of a significant improvement of EDB.

   The EDB is not connected to the fragmented Payroll system, managed on an aggregate level by
   the Ministry of Fnance, based on line item inputs from the 1400 spending units. MOCSAI has
   developed a MS Access based Payroll database, which is presently being tested in 10 sites.
   However, this work has not been completed by project end nor have the main constraints affecting
   the EDB been resolved.

   The following issues regarding the HR MIS and EDB seem outstanding: (i) MOCSAI's mandate
   and its acceptance, (ii) a clear, standardized and documented process for primary HR and payroll
   data creation, collection, reporting, updating and control, (iii) clear, timely and effective
   functional reporting and control lines between the spending units and line Ministries, (iv) the full


                                                33
    connectivity/integration between EDB, Payroll, HR databases from the Ministries of Education,
    Defense and Interior, as well as with Pension and CSF databases, and (v) IT infrastructure and
    connectivity constraints both at the central and decentralized levels.

    There is no evidence that ministries and spending units use the EDB based data and reports for
    HR management nor HR policies or decision making, probably due to the above-mentioned
    limitations.

1.3. Biometric information System (BIS)
The project has supported the establishment of a biometric information system, capturing employee
number (ID), signature, fingerprints and pictures for each individual employee within the civil service,
along with the Military, Judiciary and Police (added by presidential decree in 2004). As off project
closure, work on the BIS is well advanced but the system is not yet operational. Following activities
remain outstanding for the completion of BIS:
        Biometrics data remains to be captured for more than 173 950 civil servants;
        Half of the data captured is still on CDs or temporary storage solutions, and needs to be
        uploaded in the BIS;
        Data in BIS has to be verified and reconciled with the data hold in the EDB, and correlated
        with payroll data, before the ID cards can be printed. Currently, there is an important
        discrepancy between different HR datasets. The EDB has 540 000 entries, the BIS has
        projected 489 000 entries, MOCSAI's 2010 budget is based on 424 000 employees, MOF's
        2010 budget 421 000 employees and the payroll includes 400 000 employees. These datasets
        need thus to be verified and reconciled.
        As mentioned above, the EDB data is partly obsolete (1998 snapshot) and of limited accuracy.
        It needs a complete verification and update, before BIS data can be validated.
        An institutionalized process and adequate capacity needs to be maintained for the
        sustainability of data collection, storage, and management, as well as for future cards printing,
        given the project closure and MOCSAI takes over these functions from the contractor. An
        appropriate maintenance contract needs to be concluded for the BIS and funded from the GoY
        budget.
In conclusion, while valuable work has been done, it did not result in an operational system at this
date and sustainability is a matter of concern.

1.4. Transparent hiring and job descriptions
The project provided advice and technical assistance for the modernization of civil service
recruitment and employment process, which resulted in the following output:

        Cabinet decree No. 278/2004, No 143/2006 and No 302/2007, as well as Prime Minister
        Circular No 1/2004 pertaining to the procedures governing new recruitments and the
        adherence to the new automated recruitment system.
        Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 413/2006 concerning the appointment system in
        public employment;
        Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 161/2007 related to the approval of the Civil
        Service Fund Program for the period 2008-2010.




                                                34
       A pilot project for merit-based recruitment and remuneration was launched by MOCSAI in
       October 2008. By March 2009, 3 heads of sector (deputy minister) and 16 general managers
       were recruited through a competitive procedure. However, the two-tear remuneration system
       envisaged has not yet been put in place.
       A study on standard job classification was prepared by Team International. However, the new
       job classification and description have not yet been implemented.
       Republican Decree of 2007 (in the context of the CSF action plan) regulates new hiring and
       links it to identified needs and job descriptions. The latter still need to be developed and
       implemented.

1.5. Payroll modernization

    The project put little emphasis on the payroll system consolidation and modernization. At project
    end, the payroll system is still fragmented and heterogeneous:
       MOCSAI has an Oracle database and has just developed a MS Access based Payroll database,
       which is presently being tested in 10 sites.
       The Ministries of Education and Oil run a more sophisticated and up to date payroll system,
       based on an Oracle database.
       Fragmented data production and ownership by the 1400 different spending units.
       Spending units use a variety of different payroll applications, developed or adapted internally
       and report just line item carry forward data. Some more remote spending units still use
       manual payroll ledgers.
       No standardized system is in place for payroll data input, validation, reporting, modification
       or control.
       Payroll controls seems limited to the verification by MOF that the monthly drawing of each
       spending unit does not exceed 1/12th of annual allocation and that total annual ceilings are
       respected.
       Payroll database is not linked/ integrated with other HR and financial databases/ information
       systems, such as EDB, BIS, AFMIS.

1.6. Accounting and financial management information system (AFMIS)

    Despite a late and difficult start, the AFMIS sub-component has made significant progress since
    2004. By project closure, a computerized system with the core modules has been developed,
    tested, and rolled-out to the four envisioned pilot ministries (Finance, Education, Health Care and
    Population, and General Operations and Works). Its roll-out to five additional institutions started:
    Customs Authority, Tax Authority, Ministry of Water and Environment, Ministry of Oil and
    Minerals and the Ministry of Electricity. The following outputs were achieved:

        Development of the following modules: (i) budget preparation, (ii) budget execution, (iii)
        account payable, (iv) fixed assets, (v) revenue, (vii) final accounts. The core modules (budget
        preparation, execution (safe commitment and procurement controls, and final accounts) have
        been finalized and are currently pilot tested in the Ministry of Finance and the above-
        mentioned three line ministries.




                                                35
           The budget preparation module is used by the Ministry of Finance since 2007, for the 2008
           budget, although based on the uploading of budget proposals from spending units in the form
           excel spreadsheets, as the module has not yet been rolled out.

           The budget execution and the final accounts modules are pilot tested since 2008 in all four
           pilot ministries, representing a substantial part of the budget (60%).

           The other modules (accounts payable, fixed assets and revenue) are currently being finalized,
           based on the external verification done by KPMG and will then be tested in the four pilot
           ministries before being rolled out.

           The data exchange module with other systems, such as HR, Customs, Taxes, Payroll, Debt,
           LGMIS for externally funded projects, needs to be developed.

           The cash management module has been postponed, in the absence of a treasury function at
           the Ministry of Finance, despite recommendations since the beginning of the project that this
           function, presently carried out by the Central Bank be transferred to the Ministry of Finance,
           in accordance with international practices.

           The commitment control module has been postponed to the second phase and will be covered
           by the follow up project.
           AFMIS has been tested four times (December 2005, April and December 2007 and
           December 2009) by KPMG and most findings/ issues have been acknowledged and
           addressed. Work is notably ongoing to develop functionalities for the expenditure module,
           the revenue module, the accounts payable module, the fixed assets module and the budget
           closing/ opening function. Bank statement reconciliation and reporting is also under
           development.
           IT infrastructure capacity constraints remain, as the current hardware/ servers do not support
           the number of envisaged users. It does not guarantee business continuity or integrity in case
           of server failure (ref. KPMG tests).

       In sum, the three core modules have been successfully developed and are currently being
       implemented in pilot ministries. Three out of the nine modules are been further finalized before
       being pilot tested. Three modules have not been developed yet. The data exchange interfaces with
       other financial management systems (still needs to be developed.

2. Component ­ Civil Service Fund

   2.1. Enforcement of retirement rules and removal of ghost workers and double dippers from
        payroll,
          The CSMP's reengineering studies and HR databases (EDB/BIS) did not result in the
          identification of many redundant employees nor the ghost workers and double dippers on
          payroll. Most of the redundancies, referred to the CSF, came from defunct state enterprises
          and only 25 double dippers and no ghost worker were identified through the biometric
          database. 3767 employees voluntary departures were also recorded. These figures came from
          the conclusions of a joint working committee between the MOF and MOCSAI on 03/09/2009.
          A Cabinet decree (211/2007) and a circular from the prime minister were adopted to
          strengthen the existing legislation and specify actions to be taken to enforce retirement in the
          public service.


                                                  36
           A MOCSAI circular was passed authorizing individual agencies to hire new staff conditional
           upon their phasing out redundant employees. Agencies are only allowed replacing 40-60
           percent (depending on qualifications) of employees that are declared redundant. However,
           there is no evidence of redundant employees reported by agencies, other than the ones referred
           to the Civil Service Fund.
           From 2006 to 2009, 28 097 employees, who had served past retirement age, were retired.
           However, this number is a small percentage of the total civil service. Furthermore, since 2000
           a total of 44 703 civil servants have retired, on average 4500/ year, representing 0.5% of the
           total civil service. This is well below the normal retirement ratio of 3% noted in other civil
           services with similar population age. This confirms, as mentioned above, the serious
           shortcomings in HR data (7% of EDB population has no birth/starting date) and suggest that
           retirement rules are not consistently enforced.

   2.2. Civil Service Fund (CSF)
           The legal framework to set up the CSF has been developed during project preparation. The
           Fund was established with the enactment of Law 1/1999 and Law 314/2000. However, legal
           intricacies with the existing Legal and regulatory framework governing the civil service and
           budget constraints prevented the Fund from being operational before end of 2004.
           The CSF set up and equipment of branches in four Governorates was supported by the project.
           Its staff was trained under the capacity building component ­ 4 and the Dutch Trust Fund.
           CSF policies, rules and procedures were prepared under the project.
           The CSF processed 14 127 redundant staff, mainly from defunct or privatized state enterprises,
           during Phase I from April 2006 to March 2009. 2 250 employees received their statutory
           pension, 1 100 were redeployed to other public services and 10 777 taken care of by the CSF.
           Among these, 93.7% opted for early retirement and were transferred to the pension authority,
           and 6.3% opted for severance packages (10 300 USD av.). The total cost to the Fund was 17.8
           m USD.
           A complaints system was put in place and reviewed 800 complaints of which 300 were
           approved.
           A second phase was launched end of 2009 to process 3626 employees, identified mainly from
           State enterprises (Yemenia airlines) and from political parties. However, it stalled in the
           absence of financial compensation by the MoF of the extra cost incurred by early retirement,
           the most common option chosen by employees referred to the CSF.
           The public service units prepared preliminary lists of the redundant employees for
           12,000 employees to be reviewed by the CSF in 2011

3. Re-engineer Government agencies

   3.1. Government's mandate study
   A study on the Government's mandate was completed in 2006 by Yeoman Ward (US$268,000). It
   compiled the current roles and responsibilities of ministries and main agencies, identified overlaps and
   ambiguities in roles and responsibilities, develop recommendations to rationalize and streamline
   ministries and main agencies, identified areas for Government disengagement and enhanced private
   sector role and outlined new roles and responsibilities of ministries and main agencies.




                                                   37
The set up of a Presidential Commission on the Government's mandate was foreseen to review and
approve the study's recommendations with the support from the project's technical secretariat. The
presidential decree setting up this commission was not by the end of the project.

3.2. Introducing job classification in the Civil service

A study was conducted on standard job classification by Team International (US$296,000). A Cabinet
order n°146/2009 regarding the new job classification has just been adopted and needs to be
implemented. This activity aiming at introducing the building blocks for a merit based civil service
and for which substantial training was foreseen has thus to achieve the expected results.

3.3. Performance indicators study
The study, realized by Scientific Council for Applied Sciences (US$200,000) was completed in May
2007 for selected ministries and agencies by engaging focal teams in the process of defining the
objectives of monitoring and evaluating performance, using performance measurement criteria within
and across institutions. Performance indicators were developed, trying to link directly to the mission,
vision and strategic goals of the following nine ministries and agencies: (1) General Secretariat for the
Cabinet; (2) Ministry of Finance; (3) Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; (4)
Ministry of Local Administration; (5) Ministry of Oil and Minerals; (6) Ministry of Public Works and
Highways; (7) Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology; (8) Public Authority for
Electricity; and (9) Yemen Standardization, Metrology & Quality Control Organization.
However, the final report raised important quality issues, as the performance indicators were not
objective, focused, measurable nor practical. They were mainly internally oriented and not focused on
the performance of the ministry or agency in terms of service delivery, quality or value added for
users. Furthermore, the study was lacking specific recommendations on how to develop these
performance indicators.

3.4. Re-engineering studies

Five reengineering studies have been completed between 2006 and 2007 for the following agencies:
(i) COCA (US$1,261,250 by PWC), (ii) Taxation Authority (US$758,000 by PWC), (iii) Internal
Audit Agency (US$555,000 by PWC), (iv) Customs Authority (US$1,098,173 by WSP), (v)
MOCSAI (US$493,900 by Yeoman Ward). The study on COCA was concluded only in September
2009, after contractual and financial issues were resolved.
The studies followed a participatory SWAT methodology involving key internal and external
stakeholders of each ministry and agency through workshops and surveys and made recommendations
on: (i) human resources management policies, (ii) organizational charts and job classifications leading
to right-sizing, (iii) streamlining of selected back-office and front-office processes, (iv) service quality
improvements through simplified processes and increased transparency, (v) required legal and
regulatory changes, (vi) implementation strategies, output and impact indicators, (vii) the adoption of
international auditing standards for COCA and Internal Audit.
Based on these studies the following actions were taken :
 Service guides were developed, including description of the procedures required under applicable
 laws and regulations, and the fees payable for individual procedures. Guides are posted in visible
 places of central and local offices, and published on the agency website.
 Cabinet Decree No. 5 of 2009 approved the guiding model and terms of reference for the
 reengineering and restructuring process in Government agencies.




                                                  38
      Cabinet Decree No. 125 of 2008 provided the widespread utilization of the outputs of the CSMP
      reengineering activities for streamlining administrative reforms in ministries and other agencies.
      Cabinet Decree No. 127 of 2008 approved the Draft Republican Decree on the rearrangement of the
      roles and responsibilities of Internal Auditing in Government agencies.
      Republican resolution No 235/2007 on the reorganization of MOCSAI.
      President resolution n°5/2010 on internal audit.
    However, the restructuring process of these agencies has remained limited to date, notably due to
    internal resistance, change in leadership (Customs and Tax Authorities), disagreements with the
    consulting companies (COCA, TAX authority studies), and pending changes to the legal (MOCSAI,
    COCA) and regulatory framework to implement key recommendations of the reengineering studies.

    3.5. Innovation fund

    The Fund, with an initial budget of 2.34 m USD was managed by the Government, who contracted the
    Arab Administrative Development Organisation (ARADO) to review the proposals submitted to the
    Fund. It experienced important implementation delays, as it started only in June 2004 and signed the
    contracts for the 6 selected projects by end of 2007. The Fund aimed at providing (i) short term,
    innovative and visible benefits to the citizens to sustain the reform momentum, (ii) to test the idea of
    creating a common fund to channel donor financing for agency restructuring, and (iii) to leave room
    for changing circumstances and opportunistically capture reform initiatives by other agencies. Based
    on the limited information available these objectives do not seem to have been achieved for the
    following reasons:

           It took seven years until six projects were selected and approved and between one to two years to
           implement them, which does not qualify as "quick fixes".

           While most selected projects were geared towards the citizens, their degree of innovation varied.
           For instance, the set up of a help desk at MOCSAI or an information center at the Airport, can be
           considered innovative compared to existing administrative practices, the installation of three
           ATMs for the postal office or medical equipment for the Republican Hospital's emergency
           services might be less innovative

           In the absence of any information on these projects' outcomes, it is not possible to assess the
           effectiveness of the intended benefits to citizens.

           As the innovation fund has been entirely managed by an external consulting company with very
           limited interaction with the reform teams, it does not seem to have informed the reform process or
           support its acceptance/ momentum, as intended. For instance, it has not contributed to the set up
           of a common fund to channel donor financing for agency restructuring, which does not exist.

4. Capacity building:
    Activities under this component have been transferred to the Dutch Trust Fund (TF-24755) after the
    project's mid-term review in October 2003. The Trust Fund was closed on December 2007. 27
    training programs have been delivered to approximately 1,500 civil servants, including 5 management
    training programs for approximately 600 senior Government managers, of which the following:

Republic of Yemen
Ministry of Civil Service and Insurances
Civil Service Modernization Project




                       Report on
      The Outputs, Outcomes and Effects of the Civil
             Service Modernization Project

                Submitted to the Higher Council of Civil Service

The level of implementation of the project activities per components:

Component 1's level of implementation: Apply systems and policies to strengthen the basic
systems:

a. Building units for archive in 1154 main and subsidiary units and preparing the functional file
   (a file of documents) for every employee. A fixed and a mobile file have been prepared for
   every employee. The number of those who had files used to be 20 thousand employee only.
   This task has been carried out based on the unified documentation and archiving system. The
   percentage of employees whose functional files have been supplied with the basic legal
   documents is 100%.

b. Implementing the first statistical survey of the administrative body units and the public and
   mixed sectors (the Functional Survey, Census and Public registry August 1998-January 2000).
   Towards the achievement of all strategic and procedural objectives of this survey, the project
   secured and provided all the requirements for the successful implementation (financial,
   human and training). For the purposes of this report, we will only refer to the key factors that
   enabled the project to succeed in survey implementation with high level of efficiency and
   effectiveness.

c. Supplying the civil service officer in the Capital Secretariat and the governorates with the
   systems and programs through which the employees' data and information can be provided at
   the local decentralized level. The capacity of the local authority has been further enhanced by
   information centers that contain a database and sub-information related to the employees of
   public service units at the level of the local authority and is networked with the main
   information center and the central database of the Ministry's HQs.


                                               44
d. Setting up the central database of the State employees which contains all the employees and
   affiliates to the civil, military, security and judiciary bodies along with the retired employees.
   The main database lists the employees of each sector alone with sub databases that represent
   the sub unit at both the central and local levels in civil service, military body, security forces,
   judiciary and retired employees.

e. Rationalizing the employment policies and consolidating the principle of equity and
   equal opportunities through the following tasks;

         Adopt a number of policies and procedures that aim at getting rid of the reasons
         leading to deficiencies and corruption in public office, on top of which are;
              Placing strict controls over the recruitment process.
              Regulate the transfer movement among units.
              Address the conditions of employees who get paid without running a job.
              Opening the allowed time period for the unpaid leaves.
              Connecting between staying in office and performing the job.
              Unifying the entry point to the public post so that MOCSI becomes the sole
                 and main gate to new recruitments.
         Developing a new policy and an e-recruitment system to be circulated over all the
         administrative units and public service units.
         Developing a unified scheme for salaries and wages and applying it in all units of
         public service.
         Preparing and applying the appointment system which contains the basis, criteria and
         specifications for occupying each public post.


f. Strict implementation of the retirement law through the following:
        Revising the Insurances and Pensions Law No. 25 of 1991 in accordance with Law
           No. 1 of 2000 which lifted the minimum retirement pension to match the minimum
           wages. The law also stipulates that allowances shall be covered by the insurance
           deductions and the retirement pension shall be linked to the last salary.
        Simplifying the retirement procedures.
        Setting up a database and an e-system for retirement.

g. Developing an electronic system and implementing a comprehensive plan to replace the non-
   Yemeni employees with Yemenis. This process has resulted in the replacement of over five
   thousand employees.

h. Networking the sub information centers in the Capital Secretariat and governorates with the
   Main Information Center to constantly and timely update the functional developments in later
   stages.


                                                 45
i. Issuing the payrolls of local authority units through the information centers.

j. Implementing the fingerprint and photo system:
   The biological fingerprint and photo system constitutes an entry point towards building a
   valid and updated database as well as to plan and manage the human resources. Such system
   will revoke all cases of repetition or shadow employees. The progress made until mid
   February has been as follows:
            97% of the Civil Sector;
            98% of the Judicial Authority;
            50% of the Military Sector and
            65% of the Security Sector.

Progress made in the second component- rationalizing the number of employees- Civil
Service Fund:

Within the CSMP, the Civil Service Fund proposes a number of solutions to mitigate the
economic and social impact of rationalizing the number of public employees who will be leaving
the public office due to the restructuring processes and due to the reduction in the number of
employees to fix the deficiencies in the payrolls under the administrative reforms. The following
outcomes have been realized as a result of the Fund's work:
            The redundancy made under the first chapter (employees' wages and
               compensations) of 4,684 employee in a total annual cost of 1,848,915 YR (only
               one billion eight hundred forty eight million nine hundred and fifteen thousand
               YR) including 978 employees with an amount of 294,763 (two hundred ninety
               four million seven hundred and sixty three thousand YR).
            Redundancy made under the third chapter (subsidies, grants and social benefits) of
               9,101 employees with an annual cost of 3,542,429 (three billion five hundred and
               forty two million and four hundred twenty nine thousand YR) including the
               autonomous units of 291 employees with an annual cost of 88,672 (eighty eight
               million six hundred seventy two thousand YR). These units used to pay the wages
               on their own.

The progress made in the third component: rationalizing and restructuring the
governmental apparatus:
The strategic objective of restructuring is all about regulating and rationalizing the State
apparatuses through achieving ancillary objectives of; reforming and developing the civil service
setup, reorganizing and structuring the administrative processes and service provision through a
high-scale restructuring of guiding governmental bodies as well as a detailed organizing process
of the various civil service sectors.

The restructuring process goes through two phases; the first is when the project carries out a
mission of reorganizing and structuring in order to minimize the aspects of deficiency and
organizational flaws. Upon finalizing the restructuring of the guiding governmental bodies, the



                                                46
second phase starts with enough expertise and knowledge to carry out a massive restructuring
process of all governmental bodies and institutions.

Through the project's activities, 11 studies have been conducted to form a benchmark for any
change to take place at the legislative and organizational levels and shift in work approaches at
the state's level.

The progress made in the fourth component: building the institutional capacities and
training:
Within this component, a number of training events have been held to achieve the specific goals
defined in the project document particularly provision of the training needs to keep up with the
project's other components in restructuring, basic systems, project management and preparation
adaptation of the targeted bodies and institutions for the second phase. During the project, 29
training programs have been implemented in various relevant fields and specializations such as
strategic planning, change management, human resource management, computers...etc. with the
participation of 1,685 administrative manager and public servants.

The National Strategy of Wages and Salaries:
GOY adopts a comprehensive program for economic, financial and administrative reform in
conditional partnership with donors to meet the obligations of the Yemeni government to rectify
deficiencies, dry up the sources of corruption and conduct a radical review of the laws, policies
and regulations in connection with the good governance principles. Among the components of
the Government's general program are reforming the jobs, salaries and wages system and
improving the livelihoods of employees and retired people by drafting a national Strategy for
wages and Salaries.

The financial effects of applying the first and second phases of the National Strategy for
Wages and salaries on the State's general Budget:

The National Strategy for Wages and Salaries was aimed at improving the conditions of public
servants and granting them a decent life through improving the incomes gained through public
office .And to a large extent, protecting the civil servants from the negative influence. However,
the high inflation rate that has accompanied the implementation of the first and second phases of
the Strategy has swallowed the increases obtained in the public employee's salary.

Moreover, the National Strategy for Wages and Salaries has addressed a number of deficiencies
and made some reform to the payrolls at the level of public service unites including the
following;
    1. Correct and clean the payrolls from any illegal positions revealed such as;
        Downgrading all the employees who had reached one of two terms (retirement age or
           end of service) dead or permanently disabled after transferring them to the public
           setup and retiring them.
        Inventorying the entire abundant workforce and transferring them to the Civil Service
           Fund.
        Downgrading the double, discontinuous and shadow employees.
    2. Replacing the non Yemeni employees with Yemenis.

                                               47
   3.    Lessening the financial redundancies that had been illegally disbursed from the budgets
        and allocations as a result of implementing reforms or removing deficiencies that
        reflected on the State's general budget and preparing the budgets based on the actual
        implementation of the Strategy.

The reforms made and related to the implementation of the law and the strategy have reflected
positively on the State's general budget and the budget of the economic, autonomous and annexed
units and the private funds through the following;
    1. Making financial redundancies that have been cut down from the State's general budget of
        55,034,373 thousand as a result of downgrading 99,894 employees as follows;
         70,021 employees were retired in an annual cost of 26,788,000 YR.
         14,210 employees were transferred to the Civil Service Fund which in turn has
             handled their conditions either by early retirement or the financial compensation in an
             annual cost of 5,108,175 YR including an amount of 3,453,757 YR that has been
             reduced from Chapter three for 8,810 employees.
         Downgrading 15,663 double and discontinuous employees and shadow and fake jobs
             in an annual cost of 19,387,000 YR.
         Reducing an amount of 3,751,198 YR as a result of replacing the non Yemeni
             employees with Yemenis and other redundancies.
    2. Making financial redundancies from the unclassified units' budgets after processing the
        retired double and shadow employees numbered 818 employees.

   3.    Making financial redundancies from the budgets of the economic, autonomous and
        annexed units along with the private funds as a result of reducing the cases of deficiencies
        and illegal positions for 5298 employees as follows:
         4,015 employees were retired.
         291 employees were transferred to the Civil Service Fund
         992 double, discontinuous and shadow employees were cut down.

The key outcomes of the Project's first phase:

It must be noted that the project, within the limitations of its basic budget, has implemented
additional tasks that weren't mentioned in the main plan. These tasks were rather prioritized in the
government program and the President's electoral program leading to the Project being entitled to
fulfill these tasks without any extra costs on its basic budget.

The tasks undertaken by the project in the first phase have had direct and indirect positive
impacts on development of the public management system, administrative reform and combating
corruption and consequently the State's general budget.

We can say that the Project, thanks to the support of the President, has managed to achieve
substantial results that made the government and its partners of the international organizations
and donor countries proud.



                                                48
On top of these achievements are; diagnosis of the current situation and administrative
malfunctions, corruption manifestations and the wrong culture in dealing with public posts. A
consensus has been reached of the importance to fix this situation by highlighting the risks of it.
Today, the good governance programs and public management systems have become a priority
for the government, the political parties and across the entire society.

This was a necessary access point to implement the administrative reform program by changing
the culture and attitudes towards public posts and getting rid of the wrong practices in order to
fulfill a combination of strategic and procedural tasks.

           a. Results achieved by the project that contribute to the reform and
              development of the public management system:

   1. Unifying the documentation systems to become one system under which archive units
      have been built in 1154 main and ancillary units along with the preparation of a fixed and
      mobile file for each employee after having only 20 thousand files.

   2. Enabling the government to own the necessary digital tools as an objective and scientific
      basis to implement the reform programs.

   3. Providing the employees data and information at the local and central level and
      strengthening the local authority's capacity through the information centers that involve
      an ancillary database for the administrative unit's employees that is networked with the
      main information center and the central database Ministry's HQ.

   4. Building a central database and main databases for the judiciary, military sector and
      security and later on for retirement and social welfare.

   5. Installing and applying the system of bio-fingerprint and photo in the State's
      administrative units, the public and mixed sectors, judiciary, military and security sectors.

   6. Building a comprehensive database for job applicants from the graduates of secondary
      schools that enabled the study of supply and demand and to define the specializations that
      need to be reviewed in the high education institutions and those to be targeted leading to
      the introduction of new specializations and restricting the enrollment in others.
   7. Approaching the educational and functional characteristics of employees and their
      geographic distribution to enable channeling employment towards the specific
      specializations, public service units and governorates.

   8. Applying the principle of equity and equal opportunities in obtaining a public post and
      getting rid of all the reasons leading to malfunctions and corruption along with largely
      linking staying in the office to performing the job. This is a radical change as retention,



                                                49
   promotion or salary used to be taken for granted as every one used to consider the public
   post a right in itself and not a duty.

9. Rationalizing the number of employees by ending the rapid increase in public posts due to
   an average of 35 thousand new employees per year as from 1990 to 1997. Employment
   through substitution has also been revoked with strict application of retirement for 62,415
   employees in addition to replacing the non-Yemeni employees with Yemenis for in 5,793
   of cases. 27,856 double and shadow employees were downgraded with 14,501 of the
   redundant workforce through the Civil service Fund. Other employees have been
   redeployed from the central authority units to the local units.

   In general, the rationalization procedures have led to downgrading a total of 100,185
   employees which resulted in having redundancies that reduced the general budget by
   55,736,455,000 YR and covering about 40% of the increases that have been paid in the
   first and second phases of the National Strategy for Salaries and Wages.

10. Tightening the monitoring over the inputs and outputs of public posts and the changes at
    the level of the administrative unit and the employee while rationalizing the expenditure
    over wages and salaries which has led to cleaning the payrolls from the double and
    shadow employees. And this will help in preventing this from happening in the future and
    control the additions and omissions to the payrolls as well as the premiums and
    deductions from the employees' dues.

11. Improving the relationship between the job and the labor market while creating an
    objective relationship between the salary and the position along with building a unified
    setup for wages and salaries based on lifting the minimum wages to match the poverty
    line and mitigating pressure between the minimum and maximum limits. The salary is
    also linked to the actual exercise of the job and the type of it with all the cadres and wage
    systems are enrolled in the same system within unified groups, categories, degrees and job
    titles after revoking anything else. Any new cadres or allocation changes have been
    suspended by integrating them within the main salary upon transfer to the general setup
    while keeping the accommodation, appearance and rural areas allocations.

12. Ending the application of the functional degrees system and shifting to the position
    system.

13. Wiring the employees' salaries to their workplace and ending all the illegal deputation,
    seconding, part-time and unpaid leaves and the educationally stumbled people in and
    outside the Republic.

14. Studying the State's organizational and functional setup and defining the aspects of
    repetition and overlapping in competencies among the public service units. This is


                                             50
   accompanied with identifying the structural and organizational deficiencies and proposing
   solutions by specifying the roles and functions the government is going to keep
   (allocating competencies between the central and local authorities and proposing the
   number of ministries and institutions and the roles and functions for each public service
   unit) and identifying the roles to be given up by the state for the private sector and CSOs.
   A higher committee is also formed to study the results thereof.

15. Finding public service unit that can be treated as a guiding model for restructuring the
   rest of public service units.

16. Setting a system and a complete manual for internal audits based on the latest criteria and
    the best practices.

17. Setting a system for the institutional performance evaluation and preparing the
    performance indicators for 9 guiding units as an introduction to doing the same in all the
    State's institutions.

18. Simplifying the service provision procedures to citizens and investors and easing
    information acquisition in timely manner through a process of inventory and
    documentation of the services and then including them in published governmental
    manuals containing all the data and conditions for service acquisition in 63 governmental
    bodies and 1800 service. These will be issued and published on the internet, through the
    media outlets and in printed manuals and guiding boards to be installed in the entrances of
    these units. Moreover, the organizational frameworks in the governmental bodies are set
    with bylaws and mechanisms along with an ongoing process of revising and developing
    the service provision procedures for those that are described as complicated and
    overlapping.

19. Setting the foundation for an ideal experience in administrative excellence, quality and
    creativity awards in development of government services and urging the spirit of
    competitiveness. The experience was about preparing and implementing six creative
    projects to improve public services. Such will provide a model in the future for other units
    to follow and compete.

20. Building the institutional capacities and equipping employees with modern sciences while
    introducing them to the successful experiences and practices along with the latest theories
    in administrative systems and organizational development. In addition, the visions of the
    senior and middle administrative leaderships are unified regarding the reform and
    development tracks to be taken and the requirements for such reform in their units
    through the workshops and training implemented by the Project.




                                            51
21. Qualifying 197 of the members of the Parliament, deputy ministers, directors of
    institutions and general directors in the public service units in the Executive Masters
    Program and other certificates of specialty.


       b. Benefits of the Project that contribute to the State's General Budget:

   Upon planning the project, it was anticipated that the successful implementation of the
   Project's activities will lead to reducing some of the budget expenditures in subsequent
   phases. However, the success of the project in the first phase and its expansion to absorb
   extra tasks within its approved budget has actually diminished some repeated expenses in
   the general budget especially with regards to rationalization of wages and salaries as a
   result of controlling and reducing the employment process by over 50% in average from
   1990-1998. This is in addition to activating the retirement system, downgrading the
   functional duplication cases and discontinuation and replacing the foreign labor force with
   a Yemeni one while implementing the Strategy of Wages and salaries. This has enabled
   the improvement of the financial situation of the State employees and security and armed
   forced personnel through the increases of the first and second phases of the strategy with
   direct and indirect redundancies made as follows;

a. Direct financial redundancies:
   1. Financial redundancies as a result of reforms made at the first phase of the National
      Wages and Salaries Strategy: in implementation of law No. 43 of 2005 regarding the
      jobs, wages and salaries regulation which took effect as of the second half of 2005,
      and in light of the Strategy's stipulations of substantial increases in salaries with these
      increases being linked to the implementation of a package of administrative and
      institutional reforms, a joint mechanism has been set between MOCSI and the
      Ministry of Finance that guarantees that such reforms are being reflected in a timely
      manner in the State's general budget and upon the development of proposals for the
      public service units budgets for the years 2006, 2007 and 2008. The total redundancies
      made and included in joint minutes of both ministries has been 55,736,453,000 YR.

   2. Downgrading 27,856 double, discontinuous and shadow employees with an
      annual cost of 19,387,000,000 YR

   3. Redundancies made as a result of replacing the non-Yemeni employees with Yemenis.
      5,793 foreign teachers were replaced with an amount of 5,365,058 YR per year.

   4. Financial redundancies made as a result of the reduction program:

   The program has made significant financial redundancies by considering the difference
   between the cost of the employees' retention in the public office and the remedial costs


                                             52
        (buying the service years + financial compensation) which are on the Fund. The total
        financial redundancies made from the reduction process are 27,073,704 YR with an
        average of 2,676 YR. this will be explained further later on.


   b. Indirect financial redundancies as a result of reforming the jobs' system:

        Making indirect financial redundancies of 32,5 billion YR as a result of suspending the
        employment by substitution and reducing the number of annual recruitment from 35
        thousand to 12 thousand in addition to controlling the process of income tax collection
        and insurance subscription along with using modern systems in human resources.

   c. Increasing the salaries and wages tax revenues and alike charged on the workers in the
      State's administrative units by over 23,000,000,000 YR.


   Effects of Civil Service Modernization on the Governmental Management Issues and
                               Administrative Development

The success of the administrative reform programs is usually measured by the effects they bring
about to the regulations, laws, attitudes and work methods more than the results or outputs.

In terms of our situation and with taking into account the tasks and roles of the governmental
bodies that are concerned with reform and administrative development, the CSMP has caused
deeply rooted effects on the governmental administration unlike any other project. We can
consider the laws, Republican decrees and Cabinet resolutions that have been issued in response
to the outputs and requirements of the CSMP, assuming that these have been enforced through
the administrative practice, the Project's effect. These are as follows;

   1.   The effects made through the Republican laws and decrees:

       and local levels on e-systems.
       Addressing the larger sum of deficiencies and illegal conditions of the payrolls by
       revoking the functional duplication.
       Providing considerable amounts of money to the State's general budget as a result of the
       major operations to develop and activate laws and regulations that govern the public
       positions. For example, an amount of 19,387,000,000 YR has been saved as a result of
       handling 23,269 cases of double and discontinuous employees.
       Making redundancies of 12,022,000,000 YR due to the implementation of the fingerprint
       and photo e-systems and the Wages and Salaries Strategy.
       Activating the laws upon budget preparation with the involvement of the MOCSI and
       MoF achieving redundancies in the State's general budget by 88,617,000,000 YR.

Resistance of Change in the Project Life:

Despite the large-scale preparations that preceded the Project and was demonstrated in a
comprehensive national meeting over the modernization of civil service in the Economic
Conference of 1998 as well as the implementation plan of the CSMS which had taken into
account a number of potential risks, the Project faced several forms of resistance to change which
negatively affected the early phases of the project. In order not to indulge more in the theoretical


                                                55
issues of change resistance, we will review some forms of resistance either through some
exercises of the administrative leaderships or from the dominance of the cultural inheritance over
public posts or even through the applied regulations and procedures;

        The attempt to adapt the activities of CSMP to fit in rigid templates by focusing the
        project on partial issues with which the administrative leader feels comfortable.
        Maintaining the inherited and current practices in the public post system and fearing
        change even by the potential beneficiaries of it.
         Short integration between the State's apparatuses which leads to repeating the task and
        sometimes refusing the idea by one party and accepting it by another which hampers the
        implementation of certain civil service schemes.
        Unlike many international experiences, the task of following up, affecting and directing
        reform is handled by a high level governmental party that follows the Prime Minister of
        the President of the Republic which gives it the necessary power and influence to affect
        administrative reform. However, change in this project has been run at the level of
        ministries.
        For immanent and objective reasons, responsiveness with the comprehensive change has
        been reluctant sometimes and even repellent as long as change has become an urgent
        requirement from the government.
        The financial conditions and policies were not so helpful to make change in spite of the
        obvious support offered by the political leadership which has led to freezing some reform
        procedures or taking decisions that negatively affected the reform process.
        The unavailability of a comprehensive set to manage and coordinate the tendencies of the
        various state bodies in the fields of reform, institutional, organizational, administrative
        and financial development as there are sporadic attempts that don't make use of the local
        accumulations of successful reform and change experiences. Therefore, loans and
        support has been directed to State parties that work in isolation from other bodies despite
        the central and focal role of MOCSI and CSMP as an umbrella of the development and
        modernization processes.
        The multiplicity and repetition of the monitoring and evaluation process and sometimes
        lacking the clear M&E indicators and criteria lead to the overlapping of the monitoring
        process of the donor parties with the executive work while ultimately leads to loosing
        ownership and then the project could be directed towards issues other than the actual
        priority requirements of the local needs.
        The lack of a definite body that exercises monitoring and accountability over the
        leaderships of the governmental bodies that benefit from the loans and grants allocated
        for reform, development and restructuring so that the potentials for such important
        activity are not to be wasted.
        All these factors and phenomena have threatened the life of the project since its early
        stages and led sometimes to hampering the execution of its specific plans. The project
        couldn't overcome some local constraints until in a later stage.


                                               56
The tasks and roles of the governmental bodies:

It is taken for granted that the reform and change process in the governmental bodies is a
comprehensive process that integrates and harmonize within the activities, roles and tasks of the
various governmental bodies. On that basis, the tasks accomplished by the CSMP are linked to
the defined tasks and objectives and in this field the project has achieved results that are worth
appreciation.

Therefore, the evaluation of the CSMP is supposed to be relying on the specific tasks and
objectives and not to the modernization of the public administration system or even the
elimination of all forms of corruption and deficiencies as these are governmental and community
goals that require the implementation of a multi-phased reform process with all sectors involved
(judicial reform, security reform, financial and economic reform...etc.).

This emphasizes the importance of the State's bodies performing their tasks and roles within the
State tendencies, strategies and programs. CSMP and MOCSI are part of the governmental set
that undertakes specific objectives in the administrative reform track.

The outputs of the CSMP have provided several change elements through the republican laws
and decrees and the resolutions of the Cabinet along with the revocation of many hurdles facing
the public posts. This has made a foundation for change that is supposed to be implemented by
the bodies concerned with such laws and resolutions while making use of the successful
experiences of other government bodies.

In addition, this report will also include drafts for resolutions to benefit from the outputs of the
CSMP and use them as basis for a new phase of practical implementation.

Lessons learned:

The track of the CSMP is an experience to benefit from due to the long lifespan and the various
fields included in addition to being the last and most profound project in administrative reform
and public posts since the administrative reform is the axis and force behind the comprehensive
development.

The lessons learned could be shown as follows:
   1. Resistance to change:

       The administrative reform processes usually confront fierce resistance since it is related to
       the employee and the public post. This pushes the public employee to try to maintain the
       current situation and fight any change especially in light of the short administrative
       methods and lack of accountability. Therefore, administrative reform has failed in
       defeating the challenges more than its successes as it is being fought even by the potential
       beneficiaries from the administrative reform outcomes.




                                                 57
   Therefore, it is important to consider the resistance to change as one of the biggest threats
   in administrative reform especially with the failure of the M&E processes and the
   principle of accountability.

   The Project experience has shown that preventing the resistance to change and unifying
   the visions of the administrative leaderships through training and workshops have left a
   positive impact but it wasn't a radical solution to this problem.

2. The sense of ownership:

   The frequent and sometimes the contradictory interventions with multiplicity of
   supervisors by the World Bank, the level of expertise and knowledge of some of them and
   the repeated unjustified visits as well as the commanding nature of some of them have
   caused the local staff to lose their sense of ownership and ability to influence. The
   international experts who want always to show their boss their ability to unveil the
   deficiencies and flaws in every visit and to provide advice and guidance to the Yemeni
   side, are under constant pressure and that sometimes takes away some objectivity.

   In Yemen, there is a local cadre that is capable of managing and implementing projects
   with no interventions of the WB experts who are not always working in favor of the
   projects.

3. The influence of the supporting parties:

   There are many ways to describe the relationship with the World Bank based on the
   amount of interest paid by the beneficiary. In our case, the interventions of the WB
   personnel suggest that they directly run the loan unlike the other forms of relationship
   when the WB provide the entire loan to the beneficiary in return of a higher interest but
   minimum interventions by the WB experts which makes the beneficiary country fully
   responsible for making the project works.

   The disbursement operation takes 11 approvals from the WB including 5-6 prior consents.
   We may imagine the period of time it takes to obtain ant service or special goods if we
   take into account the time space between one procedure and another. Therefore, we may
   make a comparison between the relationship forms with the WB.

4. The Project phases and overlapping:

   The CSMP was featured by the various implementation forms:
   1. Some activities were prepared and initiated such as; the database, bio-fingerprint and
      photo, the National Strategy for Wages and Salaries, the Renovation and Creativity
      Program and the Civil Service Fund.
   2. There are other activities for which studies have been prepared in order to implement
      them in the State bodies (11 studies).




                                            58
       There aren't enough funds to initiate the activities of the second group as they have to
       be put into practice.
       This requires that the allocations to implement the outputs of CSMP are made
       available. The future studies shall include the field implementation process in order to
       make use of any study in direct development and change. In addition, the evaluation
       of the quality or appropriateness of any study may only be seen through the successful
       practical implementation.

5. Integrity of the roles of the externally funded projects:

   It is noted that the relationship between the managements of the externally funded
   projects is almost absent. There are no regular meetings, workshops or exchange of
   experiences except for the ones arranged by the donors in rare occasions. This situation
   doesn't contribute to integration and benefitting from the accumulated expertise. It rather
   gives contradictory information about the projects leaving a space for the personal
   impressions on which the attitude of the international expert may be built.

   It is important to create a mechanism that enhances the integrity and coordination of roles
   between the leaderships of the externally funded projects, exchange of knowledge and
   experiences and sharing of support for the success of each project.

6. Benefitting from the projects' outputs:

   It is well-known and taken for granted that projects are there for a specific period of time-
   the project lifespan- after which the project achieves its goals with the launch of a new
   phase which is the implementation of the projects' outputs as a new task for other parties.

   For instance, the outputs of the CSMP are a number of laws, republican decrees and
   Cabinet resolutions which represent a new task for the State apparatuses which are to
   implement them.

   Thus, it is important to have a clear mechanism to move the projects' outputs to the day to
   day reality in the beneficiary bodies and under the supervision of the body responsible for
   following up and evaluating the administrative reform processes. The success of the
   implementation expresses the success of the reform and change objectives.

   Preparation and calculation of risks:

   The government and community preparation and the extent of agreement around the
   importance of change and reform have been unprecedented in all projects implemented in
   Yemen. The Project's plan which represented a tool for implementation of the CSMS has
   envisaged many potential risks either in implementation or objectives. However, the
   practical implementation faces several difficulties not only at the local level but also and
   largely by the funding agency.




                                            59
       Hence, many unaccounted for risks will always emerge produced by the local reality or
       made up by the funding agency and these shall be taken into consideration upon planning
       and specification of objectives.


The cumulative summary of the Project's implementation level:

Over the past period of time, the Project has managed with efficiency and effectiveness to
implement the tasks listed under its first phase and even managed to carry out extra tasks as
follows;
    a. Tasks of the first phase: the Project was able to implement all tasks with a 100%

Summary of Borrower's comments on draft ICR

This section provides a summary of the comments received from the Project Unit at the Ministry
of Civil Service and Insurance on the draft ICR documents. To the extent feasible we have tried
to incorporate the project unit's comments (as addressed in section 7 of the ICR).

The borrower points out that the Project has created direct and indirect impacts on the
management, employees and the administrative leaderships in strengthening the reform,
development and change orientations, through the individual reform initiatives in various
organizations, ministries and through the Republican laws and resolutions as well as the
resolutions of the Council of Ministers in a number of about (20) laws and resolution all
supporting the reform and change process. All these are considered outputs of the Project in
addition to the fact that the Project has realized savings in the budget of the State equivalent to
the value of the loan.

The project unit felt that certain conclusions and opinions were very rigorous and did not observe
the circumstances, stages and impediments the Project faced neglecting taking into account the
complicated and difficult situations existing before the start of the Project and the new situations
ending up to mid 2008.

The lack of activating monitoring and evaluation by the Bank and the multiplicity of supervisors
of the Project during the life span of the Project renders evaluation through the final report short
of conceiving the developments and tracing the multiple activities and outputs of the Project.

COMPONENT ONE: CORE SYSTEMS

National Wages and Salaries Strategy




                                                62
ONE: The total cost of the increase of the salaries and wages bill during the years 2006 until the
end of 2009 reflected in the estimates of the year 2010 amounted to YR 392 billion in a
percentage of 134% compared to the year 2005. This cost is opposed with financial decreases due
to administrative reforms and treatments of a number of imbalances, illegal situations and the
review process of the salaries statements carried out during the implementation of the strategy
and when the budget drafts were prepared. This has entailed net increase in the wages bill of an
amount of YR 293 billion.

TWO: The implementation of the national strategy of wages and salaries and the granted
increases were linked to the implementation of a package of reforms and treatment of numerous
imbalances and illegal situations. Without the reforms and remedies implemented before and
during the implementation of the strategy and the law for a number of imbalances in the system
of employments, salaries and wages and in the salaries statements those savings could not have
been realized. Examples include:

         Elimination of all employees who have reached either term, the deceased and the
         permanently disabled after being transferred to the general scale and referring them to
         retirement in a number of 70,021 employees.
         Limit all redundant workforce and referring them to the Civil Service Fund in a number
         of 14,210 employees.
         Elimination of the double dippers, those who discontinued employment and the ghost
         employees who were unveiled with a number of 15,663 employees.
         Replacement of Non Yemeni employees by Yemeni nationals
         Deduction of the financial amounts which were disbursed illegally from the budgets and
         authorizations of agencies resulting from the implementation of reforms and removing
         imbalances reflected on the public budget of the State and preparation of the budgets of
         agencies based on the actual implementation of the strategy.

Three: Double dippers and ghost employees:
Reforms and remedies performed before and after implementation of the national strategy of
wages and salaries and the correction of those imbalances and illegal situations (double dippers
and ghost workers) resulted in exclusion and elimination of the majority of those cases from
salaries lists and monthly authorizations. This appeared as actual financial savings (in number
and cost) in the budgets of the agencies. These savings off-set increase in wages and salaries as a
result of (i) the implementation of the wage strategy, additional allowances such as the grant of
work nature allowance to a number of sectors (education, health, information and COCA), (ii)
other increase of wages and salaries such as new employment, and continuous employment by
replacement of double dippers, those discontinued and dismissed, ghost employees, retirees.

In this respect it is important to keep in consideration various factors (prevailing economic
condition, social dimension/entitlement to public employment, trade union pressure) impacting
the application process and hampering the required reforms and limit the wages bill.




                                                63
BIOMETRICS, INFORMATION SYSTEM AND DATABASE
The consolidated salary system statement was prepared and circulated to all central and local
public service units where all salaries statements are now issued in accordance with the
consolidated system but difficulties exist in networking with the public service units.

The biometric system is a continuous process and matching shall be performed when the highest
percentage of biometric system is achieved in a percentage of approximately 99% and then
matching shall be carried out between different civil, military and security sectors.

In regards to obtaining the database of the sectors pursuant to the Republican Resolution no. (1)
of the year 2004 related to the establishment of a central database and establishment of the
necessary databases (demographic data) of which the basic columns for the issue of employment
cards to all sectors we have prepared them and they are perfectly ready.

In regards to unveiling the double dippers and ghost employees on the pay statements the
Ministry of Civil Service represented by the information technology center was not lagging in
unveiling and treating such cases and report to the Ministry of Finance to abolish them and
consequently clear the salaries statements of such cases.

The most notable impediments facing the Ministry in the process of networking the public
service units as well as quality training of technicians to cope with the technological
developments is that some systems and devices use systems not being taught in universities.

COMPONENT TWO: RATIONALIZATION OF EMPLOYEES SIZE:
ONE: With regard to the establishment of the Civil Service Fund, a law was effectively issued
establishing the Fund under no. (1) of the year 1999 and its executive bylaw no. (14) of the year
2000. Upon preparation and drafting the technical, financial and organizational operation bylaws
and systems during the subsequent period to the issuance of the Fund law assisted by a
specialized technical team and getting assistance of certain international expertise and experience
of the World Bank it became evident that some gaps and shortcomings exist in the Fund law.
Based on this the law of the Fund and its executive bylaw were amended by issuance of law no.
(1) of the year 2004 and the Republican Resolution no. (184) of the year 2004 related to the
executive bylaw of the Fund law and thereby the Fund moved to actual operation commencing
the year 2005 after completion of all legislations, systems and executive instructions and
procedures necessary for operation.

TWO: The Fund work strategy was not limited to the reduction of the redundant employees of
the ailing economic units only but is seriously ongoing to reduce the redundant employees of
different standing public service units mainly those of the public administration units which is
currently under progress. In view of the level of implementation of redundant employees
reduction strategy until the year 2010 we confirm the following:

1- Phase one implementation is finalized by completion of treatment and reduction of redundant
   employees in the ailing economic sector units as well as employees referred from the public
   and partisan organizations with the public administration units whereas a number of 16807
   cases of employees were treated as follows:
      Referral of 2636 employees who reached retirement age

                                                64
         Reduction by early retirement and financial compensation of 13071 employees
         Early retirement of 12122 employees in a percentage of 92.7% in a financial cost of YR
         2,643,403,331 equivalent to USD 12,294,899
         Financial compensation to 949 employees in a percentage of 7.3% with a financial cost
         of YR 2,107,289,545 equivalent to USD 9,801,346
         Redistribution to the public service units of 1100 employees of those redundant with
         experiences and qualifications

2- The second phase of the redundant employees' reduction program is initiated during the 2010
   through the following:
   a- Counting the redundant employees existing in the standing public service units who are
       not filling any positions in light of the first and second phases results of the wages and
       salaries strategy by obligating the public service units to submit the names of those idle.
       The public service units prepared preliminary lists of the redundant employees for 12,000
       employees.
   b- Preparation of documents for the criteria and procedures of referring those employees to
       the Fund and application of the referral shall be launched in the year 2011 following
       approval of the competent authorities.
   c- During the year 2009 - 2010 the number of redundant employees was reduced in a
       number of standing public sector units which completed the re-building and restructuring
       process namely:
      National Shipyard Company for 167 employees
      Yemen Airlines Company for 1000 employees
      Public Corporation for Fisheries Services and Marketing for 120 employees
      Public Corporation for Coastal Fishing for 370 employees

THREE: The low acceptance by redundant employees of the severance pay compensation
package (less than 8%) and preferring early retirement can be large explained by (i) the
characteristics of the reduced employees (average age is 45 - 50 years and average service is 25
years, and 65% are unqualified and holders of preparatory school certificate or below), the
economic circumstances represented by low economic standards and continuous rise of the prices
and depreciation of the currency and high rate of dependency as the average number of
households is 7 members. Consequently, most employees avoid the risk of receiving
compensation amounts and seek private enterprises in order to gain a fixed income through
retirement pension.

By consequence, reducing more than 17,000 employees until the year 2010 has certainly led to
decreased inflation of the government apparatuses. In view of the financial savings realized for
the budget the reduction of the number of employees resulted in the decrease of the salaries bill
by an amount of YR 5,112,077,380 equivalent to USD 23,777,104. The total realized savings
resulting from the reduction of the cost of their stay in the public employment (for the remaining
period in the employment until reaching retirement) is an amount of YR 44,266,864,462 an
equivalent to USD 205,892,392.




                                                65
COMPONENT THREE: RE-BUILDING AND RESTRUCTURING COMPONENT:

In different documents of the Project the studies were forming a preliminary stage for the
application of the re-building and restructuring in pilot agencies. One may refer to the contracts
with consultancy firms based on which the studies approved by the World Bank were
implemented to have the studies applied in a subsequent stage.

Whenever the Project finds an opportunity for application it proceeds the same such as the
procedures for simplification of the government services delivery progressively applied by the
Project in the State apparatuses.

In the outputs of this component, there are achievements that could not be easily measured as the
activities of this component have created a state of awareness to the importance of the strategic
planning in a number of government agencies. Those agencies initiated preparing their targets,
messages and strategic plans and adoption of the rebuilding and restructuring process as a method
to create the change. Those agencies received direct technical assistance from the Project and a
support through a set of resolutions of the Council of Ministers.

These results represent the start to transfer the leverage of the development and change process to
the government agencies themselves by incorporating the development and reform process within
the components of their activities contained by their annual plans.

COMPONENT FOUR: CAPACITY BUILDING:
Through the component of capacity building (29) training programs and workshops were
implemented targeting the leaderships of the ministries and the government apparatuses and
participants in different activities of the project. All activities implemented through this
component overseen by numerous supervisors of the Bank were approved in advance without any
objection to any proposed training program in the Project.

Finally, the implementation of those programs has created a substantial leverage on
transformation and change of opinions and practices of the higher leaderships towards
understanding the fundamentals and bases of the strategic planning and adoption of the rebuilding
and restructuring methodology as a tool for change.
