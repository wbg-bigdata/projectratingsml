                         As part of the additional financing, the main activity consisting in rehabilitating the Rikoti Tunnel has started well. The tunnel bypass road is completed and the contractor has
                         achieved most of the works scheduled for 2010 on time (the tunnel needed to be opened for traffic during winter) and works resumed on April 15, 2011.
                         This project also has an institutional component support which is linked to the other roads projects.
