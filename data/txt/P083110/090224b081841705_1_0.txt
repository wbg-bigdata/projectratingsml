                         As part of the additional financing, the main activity consisting the rehabilitation of the Rikoti Tunnel has almost been completed, but some of remaining works are delayed. It is
                         unlikely that the completion of works will be achieved by the end of December 2012. It is likely to happen early in 2013 with the last equipment (ventilation and electromechanical)
                         currently being shipped to the site.
