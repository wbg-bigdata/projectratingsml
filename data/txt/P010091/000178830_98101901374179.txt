APPRAISAL OF THE KULEKHANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project which
is needed to meet the rapid growth of power demand for the Central Power
System in Nepal. The Project will consist of a dam, a headrace tunnel, a
surge tank, a penstock and an underground powerhouse containing two 30 MW
generating units and associated 66 kV transmission line and switchyard
facilities. The Project will be the key element of the Fifth Five-Year Plan
of his Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMG) to provide adequate power supply
for agricultural, industrial as well as commercial development. It would
meet the system requirement up to 1985/86.
ii.       The total cost of the Project is estimated at about US$68.0 million
equivalent including a foreign exchange component of US$56.5 million. The
Japanese Government has approved in principle a loan of 3.0 billion Yen (about
US$10.0 million equivalent) to finance the foreign exchange cost of electrical
and mechanical equipment. The proposed IDA credit of US$26.0 million would
be applied against the foreign exchange cost of civil works for main dam and
spillway. The Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (The Kuwait Fund)
has approved in principle a loan of Kuwaiti Dinars (KD) 5.0 million (about
US$17.5 million equivalent) to assist in financing the cost of preliminary
works, hydro-mechanical equipment and civil works other than main dam and
spillway. UNDP has approved a grant of US$3.0 million equivalent to finance
the consulting services. Any balance of foreign exchange and local costs would
be financed by HMG.
iii.      The Borrower would be HMG.  The Electricity Department (ED) of
the Ministry of Water and Power would be the Executing Agency and the Nepal
Electricity Corporation (NEC), the Beneficiary, which would take over and
operate the Project upon its completion. The proposed credit would be the
first by the Bank Group for the power sector in Nepal.
iv.       ED is responsible for the planning and construction of generation
and transmission facilities in Nepal. NEC, a government-owned corporation,
is responsible for the operation in the Central System comprising Bagmati
(Kathmandu Valley) and Narayani Zones. The Central System is the largest
and most developed electricity supply system in Nepal, accounting for 73%
of Nepal's installed capacity.
v.        By December 1974 NEC had a total generating capacity of 39.9 MW,
comprising 31.6 MW of hydro and 8.3 MW of diesel. Maximum demand in 1974/75
was 30.4 MW. It has been increasing at an average rate of 22% per annum over
the past ten years. The latest load forecast indicates that maximum demand
would increase to 93.5 MW in 1983/84, an average annual rate of growth of 14%
over the next decade.



- ii -
vi.       ED's future expansion program for the Central System includes the
construction of the 15 MW Gandak Hydro Project, the 14 MW Devighat Hydro
Project and their associated transmission lines and substations. The Gandak
project is presently under construction assisted by the Indian Government.
The technical and financial assistance for the Devighat project is being
sought from the Indian Government. The proposed Kulekhani Project is the
next logical project. Total capital investments of the Central System are
estimated at US$123 million over the 1975/76 -1982/83 period. The proposed
Project would account for 56% of this total.
vii.      The proposed Project is the least cost solution for discount rates
up to 13% when compared with the best thermal alternative (1-30 MW coal-
f ired unit plus 2 - 15 MW gas turbines). Two additional power stations,
Kulekhani No. 2 (35 MW) and Kulekhani No. 3 (17 MW) could be constructed
downstream, utilizing the regulated flow from the reservoir. There are also
other benefits such as downstream irrigation (about 10,000 ha.), fisheries
and recreation.
viii.     The civil works contract to be financed under the proposed credit
would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Nippon
Koei Co., Ltd. of Japan (NK) has been engaged to provide consulting services
for field investigation, engineering design, procurement and construction
supervision of the Project with the Bank acting as the Executing Agency for
UNDP.
ix.       A large part of NEC's plant has been donated by Nepal's neighboring
C.ountries, and transferred by HMG as equity capital. As a result NEC is free
from long-term debt, it pays only token dividends and its annual cash flow,
despite low tariffs presently averaging 23.9 pais per kWh (USd1.9), has
been able to finance its distribution requirements. Power programs have not
been carried out according to schedule and in the interim period until the
Kulekhani Project is completed, NEC's existing plant will not meet demand even
with considerable high cost diesel generation and substantial load shedding.
x.        NEC pays royalty (7.5 pais per kWh) and is subject to tax at about
60% of net income (after interest). Its rate of return in FY 1974/75 was a
negative 1.4%. Substantial tariff increases will be required to meet a
rate of return of 2.5% in FY 1975/76 rising to 6% by FY 1980/81.
xi.       The proposed Project would be a suitable basis for a Development
Credit of US$26 million equivalent.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of the Kulekhani Hydroelectric
Project for which HMG has requested financial assistance. The Project
consists of a dam, a headrace tunnel, a surge tank, a penstock and an under-
ground powerhouse containing two generating units of 30 MW each and the
associated transmission line and switchward facilities. The first unit is
scheduled for completion by the end of 1979/80 and the second unit within
12 to 24 months.
1.02      The total cost is estimated at US$68.0 million equivalent of which
US$56.5 million is the foreign exchange cost and US$11.5 million equivalent
the local cost. HMG has requested financial assistance from the Japanese
Government, the Association, the Kuwait Fund and UNDP. The Japanese Govern-
ment has approved in principle a loan of 3.0 billion Yen (about US$10.0 mil-
lion) for a term of 30 years including ten years grace with interest at 2.75%
per annum to finance the foreign exchange cost of electro-mechanical equip-
ment, associated transmission line and switchyard facilities. The proposed
credit of US$26.0 million, would be applied against the foreign exchange cost
of civil works for the main dam and spillway. The Kuwait Fund has approved
in principle a loan of KD 5.0 million (about US$17.5 million) for a term of
32 years including 7 years grace with interest at 3% per annum to apply to
the cost of preliminary works, hydro-mechanical equipment and civil works
other than main dam and spillway. UNDP has approved a grant of US$3.0 million
equivalent to finance the consulting services. Any balance of local and
foreign exchange costs would be covered by HMG out of its own resources.
1.03      The proposed credit would be the Association's eighth to Nepal
(total commitment for the previous seven credits is US$32.7 million equiv-
alent net of cancellation) and the first for the power sector.
1.04      This report is based on a feasibility report (September 1974)
and a report on geological investigation (July 1975) prepared by Nippon
Koei (NK), HMG's Consultants, on information provided by the Electricity
Department of HMG (ED) and Nepal Electricity Corporation (NEC) and on the
findings of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. K.C. Ling and S.S. Scales,
which visited Nepal in November/December, 1974.
II. THE COUNTRY, THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      The Kingdom of Nepal is located between 26.200 to 30.10° North
Latitude and 80.150 to 88° East Longitude.   It has an area of 140,797 Km2.
The average length from east to west is about 880 km and average width
from north to south about 190 km. Its northern boundary merges with the
Tibet region of the People's Republic of China. On the east it borders
the States of Sikkim and the northern part of the State of Bengal in India.
On the southern and western sides it touches the Indian states of Bihar and
Uttar Pradesh.



-2-
2.02      High mountains and rolling hills account for about 83% of the
total area; the remaining 17% is occupied by the flat land of Terai. There
are five well-defined regions extending from south to north: the Terai
plain; the Siwalik Hills; the Mahabharat Range; the Midland and the Himalayas
Range.
2.03      The population in Nepal is presently estimated at 12.3 million,
growing at about 2.2% per annum. Population distribution is closely con-
trolled by topography and is very irregular. More than one-third of the
population lives in the Terai. The Western Terai has a population density
of about 374 people per km2, while the Eastern Terai has 1,380 and the
Central Terai, 741.
2.04      Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least developed countries. GDP was estimated at US$1,280 million in
1973/74 and is growing annually at about 2.2% in real terms. Per capita
GDP is about US$90-100. The principal economic activity is agriculture
which accounts for 70% of the GDP and provides employment for over 90% of
the labor force. The main cash crops are rice, jute, sugar, oil seeds and
tobacco, largely produced in the Eastern Terai. There is also some timber
logging in the central and western areas. Industry, which is concentrated
in the Eastern Terai aand the Kathmandu-Hetauda-Birganj corridor, consti-
tutes about 10% of GDP (including 7% for cottage industry). Tourism,
growing at 30% per year, is beginning to assume importance in the country's
economy and foreign exchange earnings.
2.05      Serious efforts towards development have been underway only since
the late 1950's. Development expenditures have increased rapidly from
NRs. 232 million in 1964/65 to NRs. 930 million in 1974/75. The great bulk
of the resources available for development have been invested in infrastruc-
ture, particularly road, power and irrigation facilities. About half of the
expenditures for development during this period have been financed with
external assistance, notably from India, the United States and the People's
Republic of China. About 80% has been in the form of grants. Nepal's ex-
ternal debt service has remained very low (US$1.5 million in 1974). Gross
external reserves as of November 1974 stood at US$139 million which declined
to US$94 million by September 1975.
The Power Sector
2.06      There are at present four organizations in the field of public
power supply in Nepal:
(a) The Electricity Department of the Ministry of Water
and Power (ED);
(b) The Nepal Electricity Corporation (NEC);
(c) The Eastern Electricity Corporation (EEC); and
(d) The Butwal Power Company (BPC).



- 3 -
2.07      ED is responsible for electric power development throughout the
Kingdom of Nepal. It plans and constructs new generation and transmission
facilities and controls privately-owned utilities. At present, apart from
Sunkosi HE plant (10 MW), it also operates the small government-owned
facilities and distributes electricity in Pokhara and in about fifteen newly-
electrified towns.
2.08      NEC, a government owned corporation, is responsible for generating
and distributing electricity in the area of the Bagmati Zone where the
Kathmandu Valley is located and, since April 1973, the Narayani Zone.
2.09      EEC, established in October 1974, has since taken over two private
entities, the Morang Hydro Electric Supply Company (MHESC) and the Dharan
Electricity Corporation (DESC). It is owned up to 25% by NEC and the
remainder by HMG. The Butwal Power Company (BPC) is entirely a private
company.
2.10      There are about 64,200 consumers in Nepal, representing less than
3% of total population. Out of these, 56,000 are in the Central System,
comprising 1.3% industrial, 98.5% domestic and 0.2%' commercial and other
consumers. Per capita generation in 1973/74 was only 10 kWh compared to
20 kWh and 120 kWh in Bangladesh and India, respectively. On the basis of
actual consumption per capita, the figure would come o'wn to 7 kWh.
2.11      The sector has a labor force of about 2,370, representing about
0f.05% of the country's total, and creates about 0.2% of GDP.
Existing Facilities
2.12      The total present installed generating capacity in the entire
sector is 54.2 MW, of which 33.4 MW is hydro, 17 MW diesel and 3.8 MW steam
(Annex 1). Public service accounts for 46.0 MW or about 85%; the remaining
8.2 MW are captive generating plants. The largest unit sizes are 3,350 kW
hydro, 1,490 kW diesel and 1,600 kW steam.
2.13      The Central System operated by NEC is the largest and most
developed electricity supply system in Nepal. Power is supplied by five
hydro and four diesel stations with a total capacity of 31.6 MW and 8.3 MW
respectively (see Annexes 2 and 3 for details). Transmission is carried
out at three voltage levels: 66 kV, 33 kV and 11 kV, with a total length
of 276 km. A 150 km, 132 kV transmission line is now under construction
between Gandak and Hetauda financed under an ADB loan.
2.14      The second most important area is the Kosi zone around the city
of Biratnagar operated by EEC. The present total installed capacity in this
area is about 6 MW which represents 43% of the power facilities outside the
Central System. The power in this area is supplied mainly from diesel and
thermal generating units supplemented by a micro hydro plant at Dhankuta
(240 KW) and by power exchange with India.



- 4 -
2.15      The principal power facilities in the country are shown in Annexes
2 and 3 and their locations indicated on Map 1. During the past three years,
about fifteen cities or townships have been supplied with electricity by ED
through the installation of micro hydro plant and diesel units (about 3,065
kW in total, some of which were relocated from the Central System), extension
of 33 kV transmission lines and through exchanges of power with India along
the southern border.
Energy Resources
2.16      Nepal has no known indigenous sources of commercial energy with
the exception of hydro. Stretching between the Himalayas and the Gangetic
Plains, Nepal is one of the few countries in the world with a very high,
but still undeveloped hydroelectric potential. Estimates exceed 80,000 MW.
Only Karnali River Basin has so far been systematically explored. A UNDP-
financed study undertaken during 1963-1966 identified ten possible schemes
ranging in potential capacity from 18 MW to 1,800 MW, with a total of 6,600
MW for the entire basin.
Development Strategy
2.17      The Government's basic strategy for development of the sector
is based on hydroelectric power. In early years when the load is too small
to permit the economic development of large hydroelectric schemes, local
requirements will be met by micro hydro or diesel installation or, in the
case of border areas, by importing electricity from India. This strategy
is sound.
2.18      In the Fifth Five-Year l'lan (1975/76 - 1979/80), the major objec-
tives of power development are:
(a) to further develop hydroelectric resources to meet the
increasing power demand;
(b) to extend electric services gradually to new areas in
the country;
(c) to bring about regional balance in the production and
distribution of electric power.
PFower Development Program
2.19      ED's future expansion program (Annex 4) for the Central System
includes the following:
(a) the Gandak Hydro Project (3 x 5 MW) presently under
construction by the Government of India to be completed
in 1976/77;



(b)  a proposed hydro project (14 MW) at Devighat downstream
of the existing Trisuli power station with technical and
financial assistance to be arranged with the Government
of India;
(c)  the Kulekhani Hydro Project (2 x 30 MW) to be
completed by end 1979/80 for the first unit and
1981/82 for the second unit. This is the project for
which a development credit is proposed; and
(d) associated transmission lines and substations.
2.20      For purposes of future project preparation, ED is seeking UNDP
assistance to undertake:
(a)  the preparation of a master plan for the hydro
power development of the Gandak river basin and
the completion of a feasibility study of the most
promising scheme;
(b)  a preliminary study of hydroelectric schemes on
the Seti river;
(c)  a preliminary study of the Bagmati High Dam
Hydroelectric Project; and
(d)  a feasibility study of the Sarda river hydro-
electric scheme.
2.21      The first three are for the development of hydro potential in
central Nepal while the last one is for the development of the Far Western
Region. They are the logical schemes to be studied.
Rural Electrification
2.22      Since 1970, NEC provided supply to about 13,600 rural households in
the Kathmandu Valley. So far, NEC bears all the distribution costs, the
consumers pay only a connection charge and costs for interior wiring. NEC
plans to spend a total of about NRs. 30 million to electrify 30,000 more
households during the next 10 years, but in view of inadequate generating
capability and financing constraints, this program will have to be deferred
until the completion of the Kulekhani Project.
III. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      HMG would be the Borrower, and the ED would be responsible for
constructing the Project. Upon completion, the facilities would be trans-
ferred to the NEC, the beneficiary, which would operate and maintain them.
A development credit agreement would be entered into between the Association
and HMG.



-6-
Organization and Management
3.02      NEC is now operating in the Bagmati and Narayani zones.  With
the construction of 132 kV transmission line from Hetauda to Gandak and the
extension of 33 kV transmission system to Butwal, Tansing and Krishnanagar,
the Lumbini Zone will be interconnected to the Central system by 1977.
HMG is negotiating a second power loan with ADB for the financing of a
132 kV transmission line from Bharatpur to Pokhara scheduled for completion
in 1979. The Gandaki Zone will then be interconnected. All these facilities
will be turned over to NEC for operation. During negotiations, it was agreed
that the Association will be consulted on any proposed changes in the insti-
tutional organization of the power sector which relates to NEC.
Electricity Department (Executing Agency)
3.03      ED is headed by a Chief Engineer, who reports to the Secretary of
the Ministry of Water and Power, He is assisted by a Deputy Chief Engineer
who is mainly responsible for operational and administrative matters. In
the head office in Kathmandu, there are five sections covering: investiga-
tion, design and planning, finance, procurement stores and workshop, and
administration. There are also three regional construction, operation and
maintenance offices: the Kathmandu (Central) region, the Dhankuta (Eastern)
region and the Pokhara-Surkhet (Western) region. The organization chart is
shown in Annex 5. ED has 615 technical and 254 administrative staff out
of which 60 technical and 14 administrative staff are senior officers.
Nepal Electricity Corporation (Beneficiary)
3.04      NEC was established under the Nepal Electricity Corporation Act
1962 as a corporate body, having perpetual succession, and power to acquire
and hold property, and to sue and be sued. It has an authorized capital of
NRs. 300 million in shares of NR.s. 100 each. By the end of FY 1973/74,
294,488 shares represented paid up capital wholly owned by HMG. NEC has
received additional assets valued at approximately NRs. 106 million for shares
to be issued to HMG. The authorized share capital will be increased to
enable NEC to issue shares to HMG in respect of generation and transmission
plant to be transferred in the near future. NEC's powers and duties are set
out in Annex 6.
3.05      NEC's Board of Directors has an Executive Chairman and five other
members. The Chairman is the General Manager. The members consist of the
Chief Engineer (Electricity Department), representatives of the Ministry of
Water and Power, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of
Finance, the Kathmandu Town Council. Under the General Manager, there are
four executive positions for Planning and Generation, Transmission and
Distribution, Administration and Commercial, and Finance and Economic
Analysis (see Annex 7). NEC also has a branch office at Hetauda which is
responsible for the operations in the Narayani Zone.



3.06      The existing management of 4 managers and 27 engineers most of
whom are graduates of Indian Universities is competent. Together with an
additional 268 technical staff and 963 others, the total of 1,262 employees
is excessive for a utility which has a capacity of only 30 MW and about 56,000
consumers. ED and NEC together own 43.5 MW generating plant and have 2,100
employees, or 48 employees per 1,000 kW of plant. The transfer of Trisuli
HE Plant will require NEC to take over additional operating staff which
the Government of India, as donor of the plant, had hired and trained. As
the number of employees is excessive a ceiling was discussed during negotia-
tions. HMG and NEC recognized that the present overall staff is excessive
and would endeavor to make use of excessive staff in operating the expand-
ing facilities. The problem will be kept under review and followed up
during supervision.
3.07      HMG agreed during negotiations to transfer to NEC Trisuli (2nd
Stage), Sunkosi and Gandak. These would be transferred as equity. Other
plant, constructed with its own funds and with funds provided on concessional
terms, would be transferred as debt. Debt would represent the cost of the
plant to HMG less any amount NEC had contributed towards its cost. HMG
agreed that the Project would be transferred to NEC in two stages upon com-
pletion and commissioning of the 1st and 2nd units and that the part of the
Project financed with IDA funds would be transferred as debt repayable over
25 years at 8-1/2% interest. The equivalent of the Kuwait Fund loan would
be transferred as debt repayable over 25 years at 6%. HMG intends to use
the same terms for the balance of the cost of the Project.
System Loss
3.08      NEC's system loss is exceptionally high, about 32% of gross genera-
tion in 1972/73 and 34% in 1973/74. This is one of the reasons for the
high tariff increases required to put NEC on a sound financial basis.
The need to reduce system losses was discussed during negotiations.
HMG will engage a consultant under the Second ADB Power Loan to study ways
and means of doing this.
IV. THE PROJECT
The Project
4.01      The Project, located about 30 km southwest of Kathmandu, will
consist of the following:
(a)  a 107 m high rockfill dam on the Kulekhani river with
a total embankment volume of about 3.5 million m3;
(b) an open channel spillway controlled by two radial
gates;



-8-
(c) an intake structure connected to a headrace tunnel
of about 2.5 m in diameter and 5.8 km long;
(d) a surge tank;
(e) a penstock about 1.6 m in average diameter and
1,340 m long;
(f) an underground powerhouse equipped with two 30 MW turbo-
generating units;
(g) a tailrace tunnel of 1 km in length;
(h) a switchyard equipped with two 35 MVA power
transformers and associated switching and protection
equipment;
(i) a 66 kV 200 m long double circuit transmission line
to connect with the existing line between Kathmandu
and Birganj; and
(j) extension of the existing substation at Kathmandu
with two 35 MVA transformers and switching and
protective equipment.
(Annex 8 provides project details and Map 2 shows the plan and profile of
the Project.)
4.02      The Project will provide 60 MW of dependable peaking capacity and
generate 165 GWh of primary energy and 46 GWh of secondary energy annually
which would replace use of energy in one form or another equivalent to about
65,000 tons of oil per annum.

The physical contingency allowance on civil works of about 11.5% represents
about 50% for foundation treatment, 10% for dam and spillway, 20% for under-
ground works and 5% for the remainder. On hydro-mechanical and electro-
mechanical equipment, the physical contingency allowance averages 3.5%. The
price contingencies were derived by applying the following rates of escalation:
for civil works 16% in 1975, 14% in 1976, 12Z in 1977-79, and 10% after 1980;
for equipment 12% in 1975, 10% in 1976, 8% in 1977-79 and 7% after 1980.
This amounts to about 58% of the basic cost plus physical contingencies for
civil works and 40.5% for equipment. A detailed cost estimate is given in
Annex 9.

Financing Arrangements
4.04      The Japanese Government has approved in principle a loan, to be
made through the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF), of
3 billion Yen (about US$10 million) to finance the foreign exchange cost
of electro-mechanical equipment (turbines, generators, cranes, instrumentation
and control, etc); associated transmission line and switchyard facilities.
The proposed IDA credit of US$26.0 million would finance the foreign exchange
cost of civil works of main dam and spillway. The Kuwait Fund loan of KD
5.0 million (about US$17.5 million) would finance the foreign exchange cost
of preliminary works, hydro-mechanical equipment (gates, hoists, screens,
penstock, valves, etc) and civil works other than main dam and spillway.
UNDP's grant of US$3.0 million (US$2.7 million in foreign and US$0.3 million
equivalent in local currency) would finance the consulting services. The
local cost of approximately US$11.2 million equivalent and any balance of
foreign exchange cost not covered by external financing would be financed
by HMG.
4.05      The proposed financing arrangements are summarized below:

4.06      Effectiveness of the loan agreements between HMMG and OECF and between
HMG and the Kuwait Fund is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
The Project document between HMG, UNDP and the Bank for the consulting services
was signed on October 31, 1975.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.07      Preliminary works and resettlement will be carried out by HMG's
own task force, supplemented by local contractors. Civil works to be
financed by the proposed credit will be procured in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines on the basis of international competitive bidding while
procurement under the Kuwait Fund loan wiLl follow Kuwait Fund procedures.
Due to the magnitude and nature of the works, which requires experienced
foreign contractor(s), the question of domestic preference for the local
contracting industry does not arise. There are opportunities, however,
for local subcontractors on such works as access road, construction camp
and living quarters. Prequalification will be carried out for all civil
works to be financed under the proposed credit and the Kuwait Fund loan.
If all of the bidders prequalified for the parts to be financed by IDA
are also prequalified for civil works to be financed by the Kuwait Fmnd loan,
then bids will be invited for the total works from all prequalified bidders.
Procurement guidelines established by OECF will be used for items financed by
it; these are on the basis of LDC untied procurement including supply and
erection. Disbursements from the proposed credit will be made against
100% of foreign expenditures of civil works for main dam and spillway. Any
balance remaining after completion would be cancelled unless there are good
reasons for applying the savings to related works. A disbursement schedule
is shown in Annex 10.
Consulting Services
4.08      The feasibility study was done by NK under technical assistance
provided by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. NK has been retained
as Consultants for field investigation, detailed design, preparation of
specifications and tender documents, procurement and construction supervision
of the Project with the Bank acting as the Executing Agency for UNDP. On-the-
job training both during the design and construction stages will be provided.
Implementation Schedule
4.09      A detailed implementation schedule is shown in Annex 11, which
allows about 16 months for phase I work including field investigation,
engineering design, preparation of tender documents and tendering and 41
months for construction (phase II). Tenders for civil works will be issued
by July 1976 and awarded by the end of 1976. Construction will be started
in March 1977 and completed by mid 1980. Tender documents for major equip-
ment will be issued by October 1976 and awarded by March 1977. The first
unit will be ready for commissioning by end 1979/80 and the second unit
about 12-24 months later. This schedule is reasonable.

Hydrology
4.10      Hydrology is based on a ten-year period of flow record (1963-1972)
measured at the damsite and two tributaries. A correlation study was made
between the runoff and rainfall which confirmed the reliability of the flow
records. The preliminary spillway design flood of 1,300 m3/sec may be on
the low side due to the short duration of the flood record as Creager's
equation would give a peak discharge of about 2,000 m /sec for a drainage
area of 126 sq. km. ED agreed that the adequacy of the spillway capacity
will be confirmed by further study during detailed design by the Consultants.
4.11      The annual sediment at the proposed damsite is estimated by NK
at about 700 m3/sq. km., which corresponds to a sediment inflow of about
88,000 m3/year. ED agreed that this will be checked by the flow duration
and sediment rating curve method based on actual measurement, that debris
dams will be considered in the future to intercept the bed load and that
provision will be made in the design of the intake structure to allow the
plant to be operable even if the silting level should raise higher than
originally envisaged. (Further details are provided in Annex 12).
Geology
4.12      19 drill holes and seven seismic exploration lines with a total
length of 667 m and 1,600 m respectively were made at the damsite and 5
drill holes with a total length of 315 m at the underground powerhouse
site. The present project layout has taken the engineering geological
conditions into consideration. However, to provide necessary information
for detailed design and to enable prospective bidders to prepare realistic
tenders, ED agreed to carry out the following investigations with Consultants'
assistance:
(a) Foundation grouting test at the damsite;
(b) Investigation of talus and fractured rock
zone on the right abutment of dam by adits;
(c) Drilling in the surge tank and under-
ground powerhouse area.
(Further details are given in Annex 13.)
Ecology
4.13      The proposed Kulekhani reservoir will inundate a total area of
about 220 ha, of which 150 ha is cultivated. There are no noteworthy
infrastructure, mineral or forestry resources, nor subjects of archaeological
interest in the reservoir area. According to a recent survey conducted by ED,
there are about 235 houses in the reservoir area and 1200 inhabitants to
be resettled. As the area of land being cultivated by each family is small



- 13 -
and living conditions poor, no resettlement problems are foreseen. A sum
of US$0.6 million or about US$500 per inhabitant has been included in the
cost estimate. To ensure the satisfactory execution of resettlement, it
will be essential that the Ministry of Water and Power, in cooperation with
other relevant government authorities, prepare a detailed resettlement plan
by December 31, 1976. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
the detailed plan will be submitted to the Association no later than
March 31, 1977.
4.14      A field survey of surface erosion conditions in the Kulekhani
basin was made by Japanese experts in 1963. According to the report, only
moderate erosion of mountain slopes in the catchment area of Kulekhani can
be expected. This was confirmed during appraisal. HMG has enforced a
forestry protection program in the watershed area and vegetation cover has
been improving.
4.15      Malaria is unknown in the watershed area and people are generally
healthy. There are no irrigation or water supply facilities in the down-
stream reach of the Kulekhani river. The diversion of water to the Rapti
river basin, an adjacent watershed, will not affect the population living
downstream of the Kulekhani damsite. Nevertheless the Consultants will
examine the environmental, health and ecological consequences of the Project
further during field investigations which must be completed prior to final
design.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The Power Market
5.01      At the end of 1963/64, NEC served a maximum demand of 3.5 MW and
generated 13.7 GWh. Ten years later, in 1973/74, maximum demand had in-
creased to 25.5 MW and generation to 96.7 GWh. In the ten-year period there
was a sevenfold increase in power and energy requirements. Average annual
growth rates were about 22% both for maximum demand and energy generation
as shown in Annex 14.
5.02      The load forecast for the next ten years is based on the expected
increase in both of the number of domestic consumers and in demand per con-
sumer for the residential load, on known agricultural and industrial develop-
ments and the Government's Fifth five-year plan for the industrial load, and
on the number of tourists expected in the coming years for the commercial
load. The interconnection of the Western Zone after completion of the 132 kV
Gandak-Hetauda transmission line and the 33 kV transmission system by 1976/77
has also been taken into consideration. It is forecast that the maximum de-
mand for the combined system would increase from 30.4 MW in 1974/75 to 93.5 MW
in 1983/84, and energy requirement from 117.3 GWh in 1974/75 to 426.0 GWh in
1983/84. The average annual rate of growth would be about 14%, gradually
levelling off to 9.3% in 1983/84. Annex 15 demonstrates the operating statis-
tics of NEC in the past years, Annex 16 gives the load forecast for the com-
bined system and Annex 17 shows the system capability to meet the load



- 14 -
requirements in accordance with the power development program outlined in
paragraph 2.19 and shown in Annex 4. This forecast is adequate as a basis
for investment and revenue projections.
5.03      Peaking capability in the dry seasons from 1975/76 through 1978/79
will not meet system demand and load shedding will result (Annexes 4 and 17).
Even if a further 10% reduction in peak demand results from tariff increases,
Kulekhani's first unit would still be needed by the system by 1980. The
Project is therefore a key element in NEC's system expansion program and
HMG's Fifth five-year plan to provide adequate power supply to industrial,
commercial as well as agricultural development in the Central and Western
Zones. The Chitwan Valley Irrigation Project, presently under construction,
alone would utilize about 7,000 KW or 12% of the Project's total generating
capacity.
The Least Cost Solution
5.04      The existing hydro power plants in the Central System (31.6 MW
installed) are either run-of-river or pondage plants without any seasonal
regulation. Therefore, dependable peaking capacity during the dry season,
November through May, is reduced to only 26.6 MW. The operation of the
system would be greatly improved after the completion of the Kulekhani
Project. The Project will contribute ultimately 60 MW in dependable peak-
ing capacity, 165 GWh in primary energy and 46 GWh in secondary energy
annually. The second unit will be mainly a peaking unit.
5.05      Since no other hydro schemes have been sufficiently investigated
to replace Kulekhani for completion by 1980, the only possible and real-
istic alternative is a thermal development. Five alternatives consisting
of different types of thermal units were compared with Kulekhani. On the
main assumptions, the equalizing discount rates were found to range from
12.9% to 18.5% indicating that Kulekhani would be the least cost solution
for discount rates up to at least 12.9% (Annex 18).
5.06      The sensitivity and probability analysis between Kulekhani and
the best thermal alternative (1 - 30 MW coal-fired unit plus 2 - 15 MW gas
turbines) were tested for variations in capital costs and fuel costs. As
shown in Annex 18, the range of equalizing discount rate with 95% probability
varies between 11.2% and 14.7Z.
5.07      Two additional power stations, Kulekhani No. 2 (35 MW) and Kulekhani
No. 3 (17 MW), could be constructed downstream of the Rapti river, utilizing
the regulated flow from the Kulekhani reservoir. Other benefits such as
downstream irrigation (about 10,000 hectares along the valley of Hetauda),
fishery and recreation would result from the Kulekhani reservoir. These
benefits would be much greater than the losses resulting from inundating
the reservoir area.

Return on Investment
5.08      Based on the present tariffs, the average revenue obtained from
domestic sales is about USJ1.9 per Kwh. Revenue from energy exported to
India is based on the existing agreement of power exchange between India
and Nepal at US41.5 per Kwh. As shown in Annex 19 the internal rate of
return of the Project, or the discount rate at which the present worth of
costs attributed to the project is equal to that of the benefits from it
over its life, is about 6% in constant prices. This confirms that the
present tariffs are low. Incremental system cost of energy, based on the
power development program from 1977 through 1985 including three hydro-
electric projects and associated transmission and distribution, is esti-
mated to be USO3.8 (Annex 20). The projected tariff increase, expected to
reach USi3.5 per Kwh in real terms by 1980/81 will mean that it will
approach gradually to the incremental system cost and be able to make an
internal rate of return on the Project of about 10.7% in constant prices.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01      A large part of the generating plant in the Kathmandu Valley was
donated to HMG by India, China, Russia and the USA. Part of this plant has
been transferred to NEC as equity. As a result, NEC has no debt and despite
its low tariffs and high system losses, its annual cash flow has financed
moderate distribution expansion.
Past and Present Earnings
6.02      In 1971 NEC's domestic tariff for Kathmandu Valley was reduced
from 35 paise to 20 paise per kWh. In the following three years to FY 1973/74
its rates of return on average net fixed assets in operation were 0.3%, 1.0%
and 0.3% respectively.  Sunkosi HE Plant (10 MW), donated by China and oper-
ated by HMG since April 1972 has supplied energy to NEC without charge because
HMG has not determined an appropriate rate for the supply. NEC did not con-
sider this a deferred liability, hence the increase in the return to 1% in
FY 1972/73. Despite the continuing "free supply" of energy, NEC's rate of
return dropped again to 0.3% in FY 1973/74. This was due to a substantial
pay raise to employees and a 50% increase in royalty from 5 paise to 7.5
paise per kWh sold. In FY 1974/75 NEC had a deficit of NRs. 1.77 million
corresponding to a negative rate of return of 1.4%.
6.03      During negotiations, HMG agreed to continue to provide NEC with
energy generated by Sunkosi HE Plant up to the date of its transfer to
NEC. HMG indicated its intention to treat as an equity investment the
cost of energy supplied by Sunkosi during the period from FY 1971/72 to
FY 1974/75 assessed to NR 7 million, subject to deduction of unpaid bills
amounting to NR 3.8 million for electricity supplied by NEC to various
government departments up to July 1975 (para 6.19).

Present Financial Position
6.04      NEC's financial position at July 15, 1975 (the end of FY 1974/75)
shows no debt, a current ratio of 2.7, an operating ratio of 108% due to
failure to raise tariffs in the face of rising costs, a cash flow just
sufficient to finance modest distribution expansion, and no call on earnings
to finance generation or transmission plant.
Tariffs
6.05      The present tariff schedule has seven categories:  domestic,
transport industry, manufacturing and processing industry, commercial and
service industry, irrigation and water supply, street lighting, and temporary
supply. In addition, supplies are exported to India under a power exchange
agreement which provides for Nepal importing 5.8 MW from India and exporting
5 MW to it at a common price of US41.5 per kWh.
6.06      NEC operates a two part tariff (Annex 21) consisting of a demand
(kW) charge and an energy (kWh) charge for industrial and commercial consuxmrs.
Its present tariffs, averaging 23.9 paise per kWh (USd1.9) are low, but in
the past, because it has no debt, were sufficient after meeting operating
expenses to meet increased working capital requirements and finance moderate
distribution system expansion. This low average tariff compares to USJ2.4
per kwh in Andhra Pradesh State in India in FY 1973/74. Recently, Bank
staff examined the tariff levels and structure in Andhra Pradesh and found
that marginal cost based tariffs should be about US45 per kWh or double the
existing average. The incremental cost of energy in Nepal is estimated at
USU3.8 per kWh on a constant price basis excluding taxes (para 5.08).
Future Earnings
6.07      One objective of the proposed credit would be to improve NEC's
financial performance. Internally generated funds after meeting operation,
maintenance and management expenses, (including taxes) should be sufficient
to cover debt service, reasonable increases in working capital, dividends
(if any), and a reasonable proportion of the cost of construction. A rate
of return of 8% (net income before interest expressed as a percentage of
average net fixed assets in operation) would accomplish this. However, as
illustrated in Annex 22.3, extremely high and unrealistic tariff increases
would be required to achieve this return unless tax and royalty were waived.
This was discussed with HMG during the summer of 1975 and EMG decided to
exempt NEC from royalty, but not tax. In view of this, it became clear
that a conventional 8% return would be inappropriate in the short run. There-
fore, during negotiations it was agreed that, as a condition of effectiveness,
tariffs would be increased to produce a 2-1/2% return for FY-1975/76 (with
the return calculated as if the increase were effective for the entire year).
This will require about a 74% increase in the average price per Kwh sold,
bringing this to about US43.3 per kWh. Agreement was also reached that
further tariff actions would be taken to reach a 4% return for FY-1977/78,
rising to 6% by FY-1980/81. After this target is reached the situation
will be jointly reviewed by HMG and the Association with a view to reaching
8% as early as possible thereafter.

6.08      Annexes 22.1 and 22.2 assume that surplus power from Kulekhani
would be exported to India at existing low rates of approximately USO1.5
per kWh, until the load within Nepal builds up to fully utilize Kulekhani's
power. In the three years FY 1980/81 to FY 1982/83, the revenue from this
source is estimated at approximately 13% of NEC's total revenue from sales.
These assumed prices are substantially lower than the prices in India across
the border and it is reasonable to expect that there will be no difficulty
in exporting the power as assumed. A formal undertaking from the Indian
states adjoining Nepal for the purchase of this power is not proposed as
it would be unrealistic to expect a formal agreement for short term power
supply, five or six years in advance.
6.09      Tariff increases are not expected to affect demand significantly.
If however, demand were reduced by about 10%, NEC's diesel generation could
be discontinued with a resultant savings on imported fuel. The savings would
more than offset the reduction in revenue in FY 1976/77 and FY78/79, although
they would be slightly less in FY 1977/78 and FY 1979/80. In any event,
NEC's diesel operation would be discontinued when Kulekhani HE Plant begins
operations in 1980, and tariff increases slightly higher than forecasts
would be necessary to satisfy the 6% return covenant.
6.10      In connection with a December 1972 loan by ADB, HMG agreed that
NEC would achieve a rate of return of 8% on its "total assets after covering
operational expenses, charges and interest payment" not later than December
31, 1977. As no substantial adjustment to the tariff schedule will be made
until about March 1976, this return is unlikely to be achieved. ADB has been
advised of this.
Proposed Financing Plan
6.11      The following statement consolidates NEC's sources and application
of funds (Annex 23.1). The transfer to NEC of the Gandak Transmission and
Kulekhani HE Project on their commissioning is assumed.

6.12      Internal cash generation is based on sales forecasts considered
adequate for investment planning (para. 5.02) and on tariff increases to
achieve target rates of return discussed in para. 6.07. Although NEC is
not presently responsible for construction of its generation and trans-
mission plant, it should nevertheless be expected to finance a reasonable
proportion of the cost of such plant constructed by others. NEC should
advance reasonable funds each year to HMG towards the cost of Gandak Trans-
mission and Kulekhani HE Projects and other plant being built by H1MG in its
behalf. These advances would reduce the subsequent debt when the completed
plants are eventually transferred. During negotiation discussions, H1MG concurred in
principle that NEC would make such advances each year from its surplus funds.
6.13      NEC's internally generated funds would finance 13% of construction
cost (4% for distribution and 9% as advance toward the cost of the above
projects). Debt would finance 87% of which the Association credit would
represent 36%.
6.14      Revenue is projected assuming rates of return targets for FY
1975/76 through FY 1982/83 will be met (para. 6.07). This would result
in: (a) operating ratios of 93% in FY 1975/76 reducing to 77% in FY



- 19 -
1979/80 before falling to 61% by FY 1982/83; and (b) provided the in-
vestment program remains as currently forecast, a cash flow to finance
13% of construction expenditures (excluding donated plant) over the period
FY 1975/76 to FY 1979/80.
Future Finances
6.15      Condensed balance sheets at July 15, 1974 through July 1983
(Annex 24) show that NEC's gross plant value would increase eleven-fold
from NRs. 148 million (US$12 million) in July 1974 to NRs. 1,648 million
(US$132 million) by July 1983.
6.16      Assuming donated plant is transferred as equity, and additional
plant as loan, NEC's debt would be NRs. 780 million (US$62 million) after
transfer of the first 30 MW unit of the Kulekhani HE Project at the end of
FY 1979/80. Debt/Equity ratios would be 53/47 at the end of FY 1979/80
reducing to 48/52 at the end of FY 1982/83. Internal cash generation would
cover debt service by over 1.8 times in each of the FY 1980/81 through FY
1982/83.
6.17      The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) would
increase from 2.4 in FY 1973/74 to 7.1 by FY 1982/83.
Accounts Receivable
6.18      At July 15, 1974, consumer accounts receivable amounted to NRs.
5.28 million, of which NRs. 3.19 million was owed by HMG departments. The
following table shows the age of the accounts:
FY73/74     FY72/73    FY71/72    FY70/71        Total
.DMG                    0.50         0.40        0.10       2.19        3.19

Other consumer receivables FY 1973/74 represent about seven weeks billings
but current collections show some improvement.  However, collections from
HMG are unsatisfactory.
6.19      During negotiations HMG agreed to settle its arrears and also
agreed that its departments would pay their current bills promptly. Settle-
ment of the unpaid bills would be made by deduction from NEC's liability for
energy supplied by Sunkosi HE plant (para. 6.03).
Dividends
6.20      Agreement was reached during negotiations that NEC would not
declare dividends on HMG's equity for any fiscal year until the Kulekhani
Project is completed.



- 20 -
Audit
6.21      NEC's books are audited by the Auditor General of Nepal, who is
appointed by His Majesty.  The Auditor General's powers and duties are
contained in the Constitution.  He normally employs a professionally qual-
ified independent auditor to assist him with the NEC audit and this arrange-
ment is satisfactory.
6.22      NEC's financial organization requires strengthening by the appoint-
ment of an internal auditor, accountable directly to the Chairman, to verify
cash balances, inventories, assets and liabilities, and to ensure that the
systems of accounting are efficient. This was agreed during negotiations.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following points
and appropriate covenants included in the agreement for the proposed credit:
(a)  institutional organization changes (para. 3.02);
(b)  transfer of Kulekhani and other plants to NEC
(para. 3.07);
gc)  resettlement plan (para. 4.13);
(d)  tariff increase (para. 6.07);
(e)  settlement of arrears (para. 6.19);
(f)  dividends (para. 6.20);
(g)  appointment of internal auditor (para. 6.22).
7.02      Effectiveness of the loan agreements between HMG and OECF and
between HMG and the Kuwait Fund and implementation of tariff increases of
about 74% in FY1975/76 are conditions of effectiveness of the proposed credit
(paras. 4.06 and 6.07).
7.03      The Project is suitable for a Development Credit of US$26.0 mil-
lion equivalent.

KULEKHANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Project Description
General
1.        The Kulekhani river originates in the Mahabarat mountain range
about 5 km west of Palung and 30 km southwest of Kathmandu. It flows
generally in an east-southeast direction and joins the Bagmati river
about 20 km south-southwest of Kathmandu.
2.        The catchment area above the damaite is about 126 sq. km.  In
the upstream reach, the valley is rather open and the slopes are generally
stable with good vegetation cover. From the damaite to Kitini, the river
flows through a gorge section; the valley is narrow and deep due to down-
ward erosion.
The Dam
3.        The dam to be built will be a rockfill structure with an inclined
impervious core, about 107 m in height and with a crest length of about
420 m. The crest elevation is 1,534 m which will provide a free board of
4 m above the normal full water level of 1530 m. The total embankment of
the dam has an estimated volume ofabout 3.5 million m3, of which 2.6 mil-
lion m3 is rockfill, 0.4 million m3, filter zone and 0.5 million m , imper-
vious core.
4.        According to the results of seismic exploration and test drilling,
the rock foundation on the right abutment underneath the talus deposit is
intensively fractured. The thickness of the fractured rock zone (20 m -
45 m) decreases toward upstream. The only conceivable type of dam at the
site is a fill-type dam. As sufficient granite is available in the vicinity
of the dam and earth material is limited, a rockfill dam has been chosen.
The inclined core type is adopted because it requires less excavation than
the center core type to set the foundation of the core portion on the firm
rock. The dam will have an upstream slope of 1:2.5 and downstream slope of
1:1.7.
Spillway
5.        The spillway will be located on the left abutment.  It will be an
open channel chute type structure with a flip bucket provided at the lower
end. Two radial gates 11 m high and 9 m wide will be installed to control
the discharge. The spillway is presently dimensioned to pass a flood of



ANNEX 8
Page 2
3
1300 m /sec, but this will be checked in the detailed design stage through
the study of maximum probable flood by the unit hydrograph method and through
flood-routing of the reservoir.
Intake Structure
6.        The intake will be located on the right bank about 200 m upstream
of the dam. It will have a bellmouth intake structure equipped with trash-
rack, stop-log groove and a roller gate. The entrance sill will be set at
El. 1471 m. In view of the difficulty in estimating reservoir sedimenta-
tion, provision will be made so that the plant could still be operable even
if sedimentation would raise higher than the expected deposit level.
Headrace Tunnel
7.        The pressure headrace tunnel, about 5.8 km in length, will be of
circular cross section with an inside diameter of 2.5 m, about the practical
minimum size for effective construction. It will be concrete-lined. No
problem is expected during construction with the exception of the upstream
600 m and a downstream portion near the surge tank where the tunnel may
cross a fault; heavy support may be required.
Surge Tank
8.        The surge tank will be a chamber type with upper, lower and middle
chambers and a surge shaft. The upper chamber will be a circular tank and
the lower chamber, two circular tunnels. The surge shaft will have an in-
side diameter of 2.0 m and be about 74 m high.
Penstock
9.        The total length of the penstock will be 1,335 m, of which the
upper and lower portions of 170 m and 255 m respectively will be in tunnels;
the middle portion of 910 m will be on grade. The inside diameter of the
pipe will decrease gradually from 1.9 m at the upper end to 1.25 m at the
lower end. The lower penstock tunnel will also be used as the cable duct
and the ventilation shaft for the underground powerhouse.
Powerhouse and Switchyard
10.       The underground powerhouse is designed to house 2 units of 30 MW
each. It will be 43 m long, 14 m wide and 26.2 m high, consisting of main
machine room, control room, repair workshop, storeroom and station service
units. The inlet valve will be located in the main machine room for ease
in erection and maintenance.
11.       The switchyard, located on a terrace near the entrance of the
lower penstock tunnel, will have the station control room so that the power
station will normally be operated from outdoors.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
Generating Equipment
12.       The turbine will be of the vertical-shaft pelton type with four
jets, rated at 41,035 hp (30,600 kW) under a head of 550 m and a discharge
of 6.55 m3/sec. The rated speed will be 600 rpm. The runner center will
be set at 916 m.
13.       The generator will be an 11 kV, 3-phase vertical-shaft revolving-
field type, rated at 35 MVA.
14.       The main transformer will be forced oil and forced air-cooled type
rated at 35 MVA. The high voltage windings will provide 66 kV and 132 kV
terminals. It will be installed in the outdoor switchyard.
Transmission Line and Substation
15.       The existing 66 kV double circuit transmission line between
Kathmandu and Birganj via Hetauda will be utilized to transmit Kulekhani
output. The outdoor switchyard will be connected to the existing line by
a 200 m long branch.
16.       Two 35 MVA transformers will be added at the existing
substation at Kathmandu consistent with the installation of generating units.
Tailrace Tunnel
17.       The tailrace outlet will be located at the left bank of the Mandu
river about 500 m upstream from its confluence with the Rapti river. A
tailrace tunnel about 1.0 km in length will be constructed between the
underground power station and the outlet.
Tributary Diversion
18.       A tributary intake will be constructed to divert the flow of Sim
river from a catchment area of about 7 sq. km. It will consist of an intake
weir, an inlet, a desilting basin and a vertical shaft into the headrace
tunnel. Design will allow free air passage.
19.       The Chakhel river, another tributary of the Kulekhani river with
a catchment area of 23 sq. km., will be diverted to the Kulekhani reservoir
through a connecting tunnel, about 2 km in length. The tunnel will be free
flow, 1.8 m in height and in width.
Schedule of Implementation
20.       The Implementation Schedule is outlined in Annex 11.  1975 is the year
for the appointment of consultants and the commencement of detailed investi-
gation and construction of the access road to the damsite. Engineering design
and preparation of tender documents for civil works will be started in



ANNEX 8
Page 4
January 1976.  Tender documents will be issued by July 1976 and contract
awarded before the end of 1976. Excavation of diversion tunnel will be
commenced by March 1977 which will allow about 39 months to complete the
main dam. Excavation of headrace tunnel, tailrace tunnel and the access
tunnel leading to the underground powerhouse should be started about the
same time as the diversion tunnel. About 3 years will be required for the
headrace tunnel including excavation, concrete lining and grouting.  Excava-
tion of the underground powerhouse will be started in late 1977 and install-
ation of the electromechanical equipment by mid 1979. Tenders for hydro-
mechanical and electro-mechanical equipment should be issued in September/
October 1976 and contracts awarded in early1977.  The first unit is scheduled to
be commissioned by end 1979/80 and the second unit by end 1981/82 or possibly
at an earlier date with a view to providing adequate system reserve capacity
and to save project investment as a whole, if financing could be arranged.

ANNEX 12

KULEKHANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Hydrology
General
1.        The Kulekhani river originates in the Mahabarat mountain ranges.
It is a tributary of the Bagmati river. The catchment area at the damsite
is about 126 sq. km. Two downstream tributaries will be diverted into the
reservoir or the headrace tunnel directly: namely the Chakhel river and
the Sim river with a catchment area of 23 sq. km. and 7 sq. km. respec-
tively.
Climate
2.        The climate of the project area is under the general influence
of the sub-continental climate pattern and has two distinct seasons: the
wet summer monsoon season which lasts from June to September and the dry
winter season. During the wet season, the SW monsoon prevails, bringing
a stream of warm humid air from the Indian Ocean, and rainfall is abundant.
During the dry winter season, the area has little rainfall.
3.        The annual mean temperature, monthly maximum temperature and monthly
minimum temperature at Kathmandu are 18.3'C, 30"C and 2"C, respectively. The
temperature reaches maximum in May, occasionally rises up to about 35'C. The
coldest time is the period fron December to January, when temperatures some-
times fall below freezing.
4.        The annual rainfall in the Kulekhani river basin is about 1550 mm
in the upper reach (based on eight years record at Daman) and 1350 mm in
the downstream reach (rainfall record started since 1943 at Kathmandu).
About 80% of the rain falls in the months from June to September.
Runoff
5.        The runoff of the Kulekhani river has been observed since 1963
at the proposed damsite. There is also a gauging station in the vicinity
of the project area at Chobhar on the Bagmati river. Its observation
records cover the period of 10 years from 1962 to 1971. The runoff record
at this station has been used to check the reliability of the runoff observa-
tion at Kulekhani damsite. In addition, the runoff of the tributaries, the
Chakhel and the Sim, were measured from 1966 to 1973 at the proposed intake
weir sites.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
6.        The average annual runoff at the"damsite over the observation
period is about 123 million m3 or 3.9 n3/sec in annual mean. The specific
runoff is calculated at 3.1 m3/sec/100 sq. km. The rating curve established
is considered to be reliable.  The correlation between the annual average
runoff and annual average rainfall within the catchment area is also'good.
7.        The runoff records of the Chakhel and the Sim rivers have been
extended for the period from 1963 to 1972 by correlating the measured flow
data with the corresponding records at the Kulekhani damsite. The average
annual runoff for these two tributaries are estimated at 22.4 million m3
and 11.8 million m3, or corresponding to an annual mean discharge of 0.71
m3/sec and 0.37 m3/sec, respectively.
Flood Flow
8.        The largest recorded flood at the Kulekhani damaite is 572 m3/sec
which occurred on July 16, 1970. Based on the past recorded annual flood
peaks over the period from 1963 through 1972, the probable flood peaks for
different intervals of recurrence are projected as follows:

9.        The spillway design flood of 1300 m3/sec adopted by Nippon Koei
corresponds only to the 200-year flood by Iwai's probability method which
is rather low, especially taking into consideration the short duration of
the flow record. ED agreed that at the time of detailed design, the adequacy
of the spillway capacity will be checked by a study of the maximum probable
flood and a flood routing through the reservoir by the consultants.
Sedimentation
10.       The annual sediment at the proposed damsite is estimated by
Nippon Koei at about 700 m3/sq. km., which corresponds to a sediment in-
flow of about 88,200 m3 per year.  With a dead storage of 12,000,000 m3

it will provide enough capacity over the project's estimated life of
100 years.
11.      ED agreed that the above estimated figure be checked agsin by the
flow duration and sedi*ent rating curve method based on actual moeasurement,
before finalizing the detailed design of the intake structure.

KULEKHANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Geology
General
1.        The geology of the region can be divided into three formations
according to the chronological order:
(1) metamorphosed sedimentary facies;
(2)  granitic rock intruding into the said sedimentary
facies; and
(3) sedimentary rocks of the Tertiary Siwalik formation.
2.        Metamorphosed sedimentary facies consist of sandstone and sandy
semi-schist, quartzite, slate, phyllite, biotite schist, graphite schist,
calcareous schist, crystalline limestone and their alternation. These
rocks are generally bluish or graying dark colored, except for white
quartzite or highly siliceous sandstone, and strongly bedded. Most of
quartzite, siliceous sandstone, slate, crystalline limestone and sandstone
are fairly hard, whereas others are moderately hard. The Kulekhani area
in the northern side of the granite ridge is composed of rather thin alter-
nating sandstone and slate groups and partial calcareous rocks, showing a
general strike of NNW-SSE and a dip of NE. The southern area of the
granite ridge is mainly composed of metamorphosed sedimentary facies of
lower Paleozoic Age, showing a general strike of NNW-SSE, but dipping
N-S (an indication of foldings). The rock between the granite ridge and
the proposed underground powerhouse consists mainly of thick sandstone,
sandy semi-schist and alternation of sandstone and slate. The metamor-
phical sedimentary facies is terminated with the Tertiary Siwalik forma-
tion by a thrust fault running WNW-ESE along the line of Kiseri Khola
located about 3 km north of Hetauda.
3.        Granitic rock mass is mainly composed of biotite-muscovite granite
with large crystals of potash feldspar. It forms the ridge of Daman, rising
2,500 m high above sea level. Tertiary Siwalik formation is composed of mod-
erately consolidated sandstone and shale alternation. However, it is not
present in the proposed project area.
Reservoir Geology
4.        The geological formation in the Kulekhani reservoir area is com-
posed mainly of metamorphosed sedimentary facies of alternation of sandstone,
sandy semi-schist, slate, biotite schist, siliceous sandstone, quartzite,



ANNEX 13
Page 2
calcareous sandstone and slate, phyllite, crystalline limestone, etc. Two
faults, striking nearly parallel to one another and parallel to the course
of the Kulekhani river in the lower reach of the reservoir area from
Bazarmath to Burichaur strike NW-SE and dip NE. These faults run along
the boundary between sandstone and the alternating formation of sandstone
and slate.
5.        Two problems are important in reservoir geology, one is the
stability of bank slope and the other, the possibility of leakage through
the basal rock of the reservoir. Due to the geological structure, the
right bank is more viable to landslide than the left but only small-scale
landslides can be observed. There are many small talus 'eposits along
both banks. As a whole, the possibility of large-scale landslide is low.
6.        About 1 - 2 km upstream of the damsite, there is a bank of crys-
talline limestone. As it outcrops in the Chakhel river downstream of the
dam less than 1 km away and the fault which appears on the right bank of
the Chakhel river might be associated with the fault system in the reser-
voir, there could be a possibility of leakage through this formation.
Further investigation carried out by ED indicates that there is no loss of
water along the river bed, no sink holes or solution cavities are found,
water leakages by pressure test are of normal magnitude through cracks of
ordinary rock formation and the fractured zone of the fault is only 50 cm
to 100 cm in width.
Damsite Geology
7.        The foundation rock of the Kulekhani damsite is composed of sandy
semi-schist, biotite schist and phyllite, strongly bedded with a common
strike of NW 25-30' and a dip towards upstream at an angle of 30-40' NE.
Along the newly-located dam axis, the river is about 50 m wide and the
right bank rises at an inclination of 1:1.2 to 1:1.7, whereas the left
bank forms a very steep cliff inclining at 1:0.3 to 1:0.6 up to El. 1530 m
where the rock bed outcrops. On the right bank, rock is exposed in the
lower part and overburden is thin at higher elevation. The inclined im-
pervious core will be set on the firm rock in a semi-oval shape to avoid
deep excavation.
8.        The right abutment is covered with 2.5 m - 3 m thick of talus
deposit composed of earth and rock fragments and a fractured rock zone of
various thicknesses. Four test adits will be excavated in the detailed
investigation stage, three along the foundation of the impervious core
and one in the downstream area of the right abutment.
9.        River deposit at the damsite ranges from 2 m to 6.5 m and biotite
schist underlying the river deposit is partly sheared and weathered to a
depth of about 13 m. 5 grouting holes with a total length of 300 m will
be drilled and tested during further investigations along the foundation of
the impervious core.



ANNEX 13
Page 3
Spillway
10.       At the left bank where the spillway is to be located, the top
layers of 'the base rock are covered'by a talus deposit of 5 to 10 m. These
top layers are intensively weathered to a depth about 10 m, underneath which
the rock is fresh and sound.
11.       The construction of the spillway requires a deep cut, thus in-
volving a large volume of excavation, but a large portion of the excavated
rock can be utilized as embankment material of the dam.
Intake
12.       The intake site is composed of sandstone and sandy schist covered
with a layer of fractured sub-angular rock fragments and talus deposit.
Headrace Tunnel
13.       The headrace tunnel will pass through slaty rock and sandstone -
slate alternation for the upstream portion of 600 m, then through granite
for the middle portion of 2400 m, and finally through metamorphosed sedi-
mentary facies consisting mostly of sandstone and quartzite for the down-
stream portion of 2800 m.
14.       In the upstream 600 m where the tunnel route is close to the
fractured zone on the right bank of the damsite, heavy support will be
required. In the middle section of 2400 m, no problem will be encountered
through the massive granite formation. In the downstream portion of 2800 m
also no problem will be expected except in the downstream-most portion near
the surge tank where the tunnel may cross a fault and heavy support will be
necessary for a length of about 300 m.
Surge Tank
15.       The last stretch of the headrace tunnel will pass through an
alternating formation of sandstone and slate. A fault runs just upstream
of the surge tank site, about WNW-ESE. Although this fault is not large,
it will be advisable to locate the surge tank downstream of the fault in
the sandstone formation. The location of this fault will be confirmed by
seismic exploration and drilling in the detailed investigation stage.
Penstock
16.       The penstock line will be situated on the sandstone formation
above El. 1300 m, and on the sandstone and schist alternation below El.
1300 mn. The rock is covered by a few meters of talus deposit. Generally
sound rock condition is expected except at the top of the slope.



ANNEX 13
Page 4
Underground Powerhouse
17.       The proposed underground powerhouse site is situated among the
alternating sandy semi-schist, sandstone, biotite scliist and slate. Sandy
rocks are generally hard to moderately hard. Biotitg schist and slate are
moderately hard and rather friable with intensive foliation. Nevertheless,
the bedding of the sandstone is much thicker and dominating than that of
slate. The beds in the vicinity of the area show strike trending NW-SE
and dip 30 - 400 to NE in the southern part and to SW in the northern part,
which suggests the existence of gently warping syncline. The underground
powerhouse will be located in the northern side of the syncline axis, dip-
ping gently to SW.
Tailrace Tunnel
18.       The upper half of the tailrace tunnel will be situated in the
alternating formation of sandstone and schist and the lower half mainly
in the solid sandstone formation, dipping 250-45° NE. Though the rock
beds form a wing of folding in this part, no fault or any serious dis-
turbance is observed at the outcrops on the ground surface.

KULEKHANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
The Least Cost Solution
Alternatives to the Prolect
1.        The alternatives to the Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project would be
either a thermal development or a different hydro facility providing the
same service. However, no other hydro projects have advanced to such a
stage that could be completed within the time frame to replace Kulekhani.
Based on a study made by Nippon Koei (Master Plan of Hydroelectric Develop-
ment in Nepal, September 1974), the optimum sequence of hydroelectric devel-
opment for the Nepal Central System which gives the least cost solution is
Kulekhani No. 1 Project (60 MW), followed by Kulekhani No. 2 Project (35 MW)
and then Dev-Ghat Project (150 MW). Kulekhani No. 2 Project cannot be built
without the Kulekhani No. 1 Project and Dev-Ghat is still in the early in-
vestigation stage, the feasibility study of which would not be ready at
least two years from now.
2.        The alternative to Kulekhani is therefore a thermal development
located at Birganj near the border with India. To confirm that Kulekhani
is the least cost solution, the following alternatives based on the instal-
lation of different types of thermal generating units and different combi-
nations were compared with the Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project with two
units in sequential construction.
Alternative (1)  -  1 - 30 MW coal-fired thermal unit
followed by 2 - 15 MW gas turbines.
Alternative (2)  -  1 - 30 MW heavy oil-fired thermal
unit followed by 2 - 15 MW gas
turbines.
Alternative (3) - 6 - 5 MW diesel units firing heavy
oil followed by 2 - 15 MW gas
turbines.
Alternative (4)  -  1 - 30 MW coal-fired thermal unit
followed by another 1 - 30 NW coal-
fired unit.
Alternative (5) - 1 - 30 MW heavy oil-fired thermal
unit followed by another 1 - 30 MW
oil-fired unit.

Results of Comparison
4.        The equalizing discount rates between Kulekhani Hydro and other
alternatives were found to be as follows:
Equalizing Discount
Rate
(1) Alternative 1
1 - 30 MW coal-fired thermal unit followed
by 2 - 15 MW gas turbines                             12.95%
(2) Alternative 2
1 - 30 HW oil-fired thermal unit followed
by 2 - 15 MW gas turbines                             17.65%
(3) Alternative 3
6 - 5 MW diesel units followed by 2 - 15 MW
gas turbines                                          15.1 5%
(4) Alternative 4
1 - 30 MW coal-fired thermal unit followed
by another 30 MW coal-fired unit                      14.55%
(5) Alternative 5
1 - 30 MW oil-fired thermal unit followed
by another 30 MW oil-fired unit                       18.55%
5.        The Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project was found to have a lower
present worth of costs at discount rates up to 12.95% by even comparing
it with the cheapest thermal development (Alternative 1). Kulekhani is,
therefore, the least cost solution.
6.        Due to the high investment cost in civil works, the equalizing
discount rate would reduce to 9.55% in comparing it with a 1 - 30 MW coal-
fired thermal alternative, if only one unit of 30 MW would be installed at
Kulekhani ultimately. This demonstrates that the second unit should be
installed in accordance with the system demand.
Sensitivity Tests
7.        Sensitivity tests for changes in capital costs and fuel costs in
comparing Kulekhani with two most feasible Alternatives (1) and (4) have
been made. The results of the tests are summarized as follows:

ANNEX 25

NEPAL
KULEKHANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
NEPAL ELECTRICITY CORPORATION
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.        The financial statements in this report covers NEC's electricity
supply operations. They include Income Statements (Annex 22.1), Source and
Application of Funds (Annex 23.1) and condensed Balance Sheets at July 15,
1971 through 1981 (Annex 24). The FY 1972/73 results are based on the
audited accounts for that year.
Income Statements
Energy
2.        NEC's operating plant capacity will not be sufficient to meet
the winter peak demands in 1976 through 1979 despite considerable high
cost diesel generation. Substantial load shedding is forecast. System
losses (including NEC office and station use) of 28% are assumed in
FY 1974/75 gradually reducing to 20% by FY 1982/83. Forecasts of sales,
adjusted for load shedding, is also detailed in Annex 22.2.
3.        After Kulekhani HE Project is commissioned, it is assumed that
surplus energy would be exported to India.
Tariffs
5.        A tariff increase of about 74% is assumed from mid April 1976 to
enable NEC to achieve a rate of return of 0.8% on its average net assets in
operation in FY 1975/76. This would be equivalent to a 2.5% return when
calculated as though the tariffs had been in operation and royalty had been
discontinued (para. 8) from the beginning of the year. Subsequent tariff
increases of 38% from July 1977 and 28% from July 1980 are assumed to achieve
interim target returns of not less than 4% in FY 1977/78 and 6% in FY 1980/81.
Operating Expenses
6.        The FY 1974/75 expenses were based on modified budgeted estimates.
For FY 1975/76 cost of materials has been escalated by 20%, and employees
pay by 8%. In subsequent years, operations and maintenance costs have
been escalated by 20% in FY 1976/77, 15% in FY 1977/78, and 10% in each



ANNEX 25
Page 2
of the succeeding years. Additional provision has also been included to
cover the purchase of power from Sunkosi HE Plant from July 1977 and the
additional cost of operations as the following plant is taken over by NEC
for operation; Gandak HE Plant from July 1977, Devighat HE Plant from July
1978 and Kulikhani HE Plant from July 1980.
Depreciation
7.        NEC's depreciation is based on the straight line method.  Accrual
rates are calculated on the gross value of plant in service:
System Reinforcement                      3%
Rural Electrification                     3%
New Connections                           7%
Civil Construction, e.g.
S/S and Office Buildings                2%
Furniture and Office Equipment           20%
Vehicles                                 20%
Transmission (33KV and 132 KV)            3%
Generating Plant (Hydro)                  2%
Narayani Zone                             5%
Royalty
8.        HMG raised its levy for royalty on energy sold from 5 pais to
7.5 pais per Kwh from July 1974. Royalty will be discontinued from July 1975.
Income Tax
9.        HMG levies tax on NEC's net income (after interest) in excess of
NRs 40,000 at the rate of 60%.
Revenue appropriate for construction would be subject to a prior tax charge.
This means that for every NRs 1 million of revenue required for construc-
tion, tariffs should be set to earn NRs 2.5 million (before tax).
Dividends
10.       Assumes NEC would not declare dividends on equity in any year
prior to the completion of Kulekhani Project.
Other Assumptions
11.  (1)  Plant donated to HMG from external sources
is assumed to be transferred to NEC as equity and new
plant constructed by HMG for NEC transferred as debt.



ANNEX 25
Page 3
(2)  Debt created by NEC for plant financed with IDA funds
is assumed to be repayable over 25 years, with interest
at 8-1/2%, the same as if the Bank were making a loan
to finance the project. Debt in respect of plant
financed by capital provided by HMG or other lending
institutions is assumed to be repayable over 25 years,
with an interest rate of 6% per annum.
(3)  NEC would advance funds from its surplus revenue to HMG
to help finance construction of projects being constructed
for NEC by ED.
