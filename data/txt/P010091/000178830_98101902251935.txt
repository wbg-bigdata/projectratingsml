INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR KULEKHANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of $26 mil-
lion on standard IDA terms to help finance a project to meet rapidly grow-
ing demand for power in Central Nepal, which is the center of economic activity.
The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) has approved in prin-
ciple a loan of approximately US$10.0 million equivalent for a term of 30 years
including ten years grace period with interest at 2.75% per annum towards the
financing of the proposed project; the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development
(the Kuwait Fund) has approved in principle a loan of approximately US$17.5
million equivalent for a term of 32 years including 7 years grace period
with interest at 3% per annum; and UNDP has approved a grant of US$3.0
million equivalent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "A Review of Major Issues
Related to Nepal's Development Prospects" (Report No. 677a-NEP) was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on June 10, 1975. The principal findings
and conclusions of that report are summarized below. Country data are
shown in Annex I.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita income in 1974
was estimated at $90-lOO per year and the literacy rate at about 14%.
Serious efforts toward development have been underway only since the
1960s. Development expenditures have increased rapidly from NRs 232
mnillion in 1964/65 to NRs 930 million in 1974/75. About half of expend-
itures for development has been financed with external assistance, notably
from India, the United States and the People's Republic of China. About
80% has been in the form of grants.
4.        Nepal's economic growth over the last nine years has been slow.
From 1965-67 to 1972-74, the average annual rate of growth of GDP was only
2.2% in real terms. During the same period population increased at a rate
of over 2%. There was, therefore, hardly any improvement in GDP per capita.
Agriculture accounts for about two thirds of GDP and for 80% of export earn-
ings and provides employment to 94% of the population. Foodgrain proiUtction
has grown at less than 1% annually since the mid-1960's. If present trends
in the growth of population and foodgrain production continue, Nepal may have
a foodgrain deficit by the turn of the decade. Nepal is currently exporting
over 200,000 tons of rice a year, accounting for about 60% of export earnings.
Some progress was achieved in the manufacturing sector which, however, accounts
for less than 3% of GDP.



-2-
5.        This slow growth was largely due to the priority given to develop-
ment of infrastructure over the directly producing sectors. This priority
was probably an inescapable necessity. When the country began to come out
of its isolation in 1951, it had no transportation facilities and hardly
any trained people to man an administration oriented towards economic devel-
opment. At least one generation was needed to build a minimal physical
and administrative infrastructure without which a development policy is
devoid of meaning. In that respect, substantial progress has been achieved.
6.        In the past, only 20% of public sector investments was made in the
directly producing sectors which largely benefited the Kathmandu Valley, and,
to a lesser extent, the eastern Terai plains. The development of the Kath-
mandu Valley, where 4% of Nepal's population lives, has been a success story.
New cultivation methods have been widely adopted and the farming community
is enjoying an improved standard of living. With the Fifth Five-Year Plan
(1975/76-1979/80), Nepal is now attempting to shift its order of priorities
and to focus on the productive sectors and the development of its very
substantial hydro-electric power potential. Half of planned development
expenditures is tentatively allocated to these sectors. Largely because of
absorptive capacity problems, the country may experience difficulties in
redirecting its investments along this new and very pertinent course, especially
in agriculture.
7.        Nepal's development is likely to be impaired by the recent changes
in world economic conditions. The country has to import practically all
capital and manufactured consumer goods. World price increases are,
therefore, greatly affecting Nepal, at a time when export prospects are not
too encouraging. As the country is landlocked, it depends on India for most
of its imports, but India has developed shortages of its own. This has
forced Nepal to import from distant places which involves very high freight-
and transit costs through India, particularly for bulky commodities such as
cement. So far, the trade deficit has been more than offset by invisible
earnings such as tourism. For the last ten years, balance of payments sur-
pluses amounted to about $10 million a year, and foreign exchange reserves
were at the very comfortable level of S139 million in November 1974 (more
than 12 months of imports). However, and largely because of changes in
world prices in late 1974, Nepal's foreign exchange reserves declined to
$94 million by September 1975. This decline may continue at a rate of
$20-25 million a year, unless Nepal succeeds in obtaining increased foreign
assistance (see paragraph 12).
8.        If imports have to be curtailed, this would not only directly
affect economic activity but also the potential for domestic resource
mobilization, as nearly two-thirds of tax and non-tax revenue is col-
lected on external transactions. Revenue potentials from other tax
sources are limited, given the poverty of the country and the low
degree of monetization of the economy. For years to come, dynamic
export growth is likely to be one of the few potential avenues for increasing
resource mobilization. Export potentials lie mostly in the development of
agriculture, tourism and hydropower.



- 3 -
9.        On October 9, 1975 the Nepalese Rupee was devalued against the
U.S. dollar from NRs 10.56 to NRs 12.50 to the dollar. Rates for other
foreign currencies will be established daily by the Nepal Rastra (Central)
Bank on the basis of the parity rates between the U.S. dollar and such
currencies. The parity rate with the Indian Rupee remains unchanged.
This selective devaluation was addressed to the problems of increasing
earnings of convertible foreign exchange and reducing the demand for such
exchange, encouraging labor-intensive investments, reducing the diversion
of trade through unofficial channels, restoring the profitabiLity of jute
exports and increasing revenues in Hill areas by enhancing the rupee value
of pensions and remittances received mainly by retired Gurkhas who had served
abroad.  While it is difficult to fully assess the impact of the devaluation,
there can be little doubt that it was a step in the right direction.
10.       In April 1975, substantial changes were made in the pricing of
resources to consumers and investors. Consumer subsidies on basic commodi-
ties, such as rice and sugar which in the recent past were growing rapidly,
have been almost entirely rescinded. A major reform of the interest rate
structure was introduced in April 1975 with a view to increas:Lng mobilization
of private savings and rationalizing resource allocation. Th-Ls welcome and
timely reform entails an increase of the two-year fixed savings deposit rate
from 9-3/4 to 16% per annum. Lending rates of commercial banlcs have been
raised to the level of 15-18% per annum and those of financia:L institutions
to 10-16%. These rates may be compared roughly to the curreni: rate of infla-
tion in Kathmandu of about 20% a year.
11.       Development expenditures, including foreign assistance, for the
Fifth Plan (1975/76-1979/80) are estimated at about $670 milliLon, i.e. twice
as much in real terms as during the previous plan (1970/71-1974/75). The
plan is ambitious compared to the likely availability of resources and
to the country's implementation capacity. Substantial additional foreign
assistance above the present level would be required. Current: expenditures
are likely to increase sharply on account of rapidly growing expenditures
in social sectors, especially in education, increased maintenznce and man-
agement cost of previous investments, and additional administrative costs
required to decentralize Government (HMG) services. As in the past, in-
crease of HMG's recurrent expenditures is likely to outstrip growth of
revenue so that the budget surplus is likely to fall sharply, possibly
to a third of its current level in real terms. In view of this, we have
scheduled an economic mission to visit Nepal in January to review the public
sector investment program and the related resource requirement:s.
12.       In summary, on the one hand, the extreme poverty of the country
points to its limited capacity to generate resources; on the other hand,
urgent development needs and the expected gradual improvement in the coun-
try's absorptive capacity will lead to an increasing demand for foreign ex-
change. Consequently, Nepal's requirements for foreign assistance on soft
terms will rise rapidly. There is also a clear need for some local cost
financing, as most projects with high development priority have a larger
domestic cost component than can be mobilized from internal sciurces.



- 4 -
13.       So far, Nepal's external debt has been very low.   As mentioned in
paragraph 3, the bulk of foreign aid has been in the form of grants. As of
December 1974 foreign debt, which was all contracted with countries other
than India, amounted to only $106.2 million of which $71.0 million remained
undisbursed. This low utilization is largely due to the fact that three
quarters of foreign loans have been contracted after mid-1970. Consequently,
debt service was about $1.5 million in 1974 or equivalent to 4% of exports of
goods and services to countries other than India. IDA's share in the debt
service was negligible. However, future assistance may increasingly take
the form of loans, albeit soft. In view of the accelerated development
efforts, external public debt is expected to rise and, based on the trend
in recent years, may well reach $250 million by 1980, of which approximately
two thirds could be in IDA credits. The debt service ratio by 1980 is, how-
ever forecast to remain below 10%, of which the Bank Group share would be
less than 1%.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
14.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million equiva-
lent was made in FY70 for a telecommunications project. This was followed by
credits for a highways project ($2.5 million), a tourism project ($3.2 mil-
lion), an irrigation project ($6 million), a second telecommunications proj-
ect ($5.5 million), a water supply and sewerage project ($7.8 million), and
a settlement project ($6.0 million). The proposed credit would bring the
total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to $58.7 million equivalent net of
cancellations. No Bank loan has been made to Nepal. IFC made its first
investment in Nepal ($3.2 million) in a hotel project in Kathmandu in FY75.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations as of October 31,
1975 and notes on the execution of ongoing IDA projects. It shows certain de-
lays in the implementation of these projects, particularly during the initial
periods. These delays are largely due to Nepal's limited technical and man-
agerial capabilities. In order to assist Nepal in coping with this constraint,
considerable technical assistance is being given in the form of inputs of staff
time in Washington, from our Resident Mission in Kathmandu, and during frequent
missions to Nepal. As a result, tangible improvements in the rate of disburse-
ments are being realized. During FY75 $1.7 million were disbursed, compared
to $2.6 million disbursed during the previous five years. In the first four
months of the current fiscal year $1.1 million were disbursed.
15.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level
compared to the country's needs for, and total receipts of, external assis-
tance. This is due to the country's limited absorptive capacity, affect-
ing the rate of project preparation and implementation. The Bank has,
therefore, agreed with HMG to assist it in project preparation, particu-
larly by acting as Executing Agency for a number of technical assistance
projects in the UNDP Five-Year Program, now under consideration.



- 5 -
16.       Bank Group objectives in Nepal reflect the country's needs:    (a)
to place major emphasis upon directly productive sectors, particularly
agriculture and increasing food production; and (b) to continue assistance
for the development of complementary infrastructure -- including feeder
roads to support other development expenditure, facilities to expedite
communications (particularly between the Hills and the Terai), and addi-
tional hydroelectric capacity to meet the predicted increase in demand
for energy for agricultural and industrial development.
17.       Preparation work is being carried out for a number of projects,
including a rural development project, a second irrigation project, a DFC
project and a feeder roads project. In view of the institutional constraints
and shortage of trained personnel in Nepal, technical assistance and training
would be important elements in the proposed project as well as in most future
projects.
PART III - POWER IN NEPAL
18.       Nepal has a very large undeveloped hydro-electric power potential.
Estimated potential sources exceed 80,000 MW. Total installed capacity is 54.2
MW, out of which only 33.4 MW is hydro-electric power, 17.0 MW diesel, and 3.8
MW steam. Publicly owned plant account for 46.0 MW, or about 85%; the re-
maining 8.2 MW are captive plants. Electricity reaches only about 3% of the
population. Total electric power generation in 1973/74 was 120 GWh, or
10 kWh per capita, compared to 20 kWh in Bangladesh and 120 kWh in India.
Actual per capita consumption was only 7 kWh. The sector has a labor force
of about 2,370, representing about 0.05% of the country's total, and creates
about 0.2% of GDP.
19.       The Electricity Department of the Ministry of Water and Power (ED)
is responsible for the planning and construction of new generation and trans-
mission facilities - as well as licensing, enforcing safety measures, and
controlling privately owned utilities. ED provides power in the Pokhara
area and in about fifteen cities along the southern border with India.
Power generation and distribution, in the Central System (the Kathmandu
Valley and the Narayani Zone), is the responsibility of the Nepal Electricity
Corporation (NEC), established in 1962. In the Eastern Terai, power generation
and transmission is entrusted to the Eastern Electricity Corporation (EEC),
established in October 1974. The Butwal Power Company operates in the area
of the city of Butwal.
20.       The Central System operated by NEC is the largest and most developed
electricity supply system in Nepal, accounting for 73% of Nepal's installed
capacity. Power is supplied by five hydro and four diesel stations with a
total capacity of 31.6 MW and 8.3 MW respectively. The second most impor-
tant area is the Kosi Zone around the city of Biratnagar, with present total
installed capacity of 6.1 MW. Power in this area is supplied mainly by
diesel and thermal units supplemented by a micro hydro plant at Dhankuta
(2 x 120 K1W) operated by ED and supplemented by power exchange with India.



- 6 -
21.       In the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Government's basic strategy for
development of the sector is to further utilize hydroelectric resources to
meet the increasing power demand, to extend electric services gradually to
new areas in the country, and to bring about regional balance in the pro-
duction and distribution of electric power.
22.       ED's future expansion program for the Central System includes
completion in 1976/77 of the Gandak Hydro Project (15 MW) now being construc-
ted by India, and construction of the Devighat Hydro Project (14 MW), with
technical and financial assistance to be provided from India. The Kulekhani
project (60 MW), for which a development credit is proposed, would be com-
pleted in 1981/82. The associated transmission lines and substations would
be expanded. NEC is also negotiating with ADB for a loan to extend the pro-
posed Gandak-Hetauda transmission line from Bharatpur to Pokhara. This would
link Pokhara to the central system and result in a major market expansion for
NEC. This expansion would result in a higher demand level for power than has
been used in justifying the proposed project.
PART IV - TIIE PROJECT
23.       The proposed project is based on a feasibility report prepared
by Nippon Koei, HMG's Consultants, financed by the Japanese Government, and
on the findings of an appraisal mission which visited Nepal in November/
December 1974. Negotiations were held in Washington during October/November
1975. The Government of Nepal was represented by a delegation led by Mr.
A.B. Rajbhandary, Secretary, Ministry of Water and Power. A credit and
project summary is attached as Annex III.
Project Description
24.       The Project, located about 30 km southwest of Kathmandu, would
entail the construction of a 107 m high rock-fill dam. The powerhouse, would
be located underground containing two 30 MW generating units.    A 66 KV double
circuit transmission line branch 200 m in length would be required to connect
with the existing line between Kathmandu and Birganj. Two 35 MVA transformers
would also be needed at the existing substation at Kathmandu. The Project
would provide 60 MW of dependable peaking capacity and generate 165 GWh of
primary energy and 46 GWh of secondary energy annually.
Organization and Implementation
25.       Upon completion of construction and installation of the generating
units, the Electricity Department would transfer the new plant to NEC for
operation. NEC has an authorized capital of NRs 300 million in shares of
NRs 100 each. NEC's Board of Directors includes an Executive Chairman (the
General Manager) and five other members: the Chief Engineer of ED and



- 7 -
representatives of the Ministry of Water and Power, the Ministry of Industry
and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the Kathmandu Towrn Council. Under
the General Manager, there are four executive positions for Planning and
Generation, Transmission and Distribution, Administration and Commercial,
and Finance and Economic Analysis. NEC also has a branch office at lietauda
which is responsible for the operations in the Narayani Zone.
26.       The existing management of four managers and twent:y-seven engi-
neers, most of whom are graduates of Indian Universities, is competent.
Together with an additional 268 technical staff and 963 others, the total
of 1,262 employees is excessive for a utility which has a present capacity
of only 30 MW and about 56,000 consumers. HMG and NEC recognize that the
number of staff is excessive and will endeavor to make use of redundant staff
in operating the expanding facilities.
Cost and Financing Plan
27.       The total construction cost is estimated at US$68.0 million equiv-
alent of which US$56.5 million equivalent would be in foreign exchange and
US$11.5 million equivalent in local cost. UNDP has approvecd a grant of
US$3.0 million to finance technical assistance to ED in engineering, detailed
design, procurement, and supervision of construction. OECF has approved in
principle a loan of 3 billion Yen (approximately US$10.0 million equivalent)
to finance the foreign exchange cost of electro-mechanical equipment, associated
transmission line and switchyard facilities. The Kuwait Fund has approved in
principle a loan of KD 5 million (approximately US$17.5 million equivalent) 1/
towards the foreign exchange cost of preliminary works, hydro-mechanical
equipment and civil works. The draft loan agreement was negotiated between
HMG and Kuwait Fund in October 1975. The proposed credit of US$26.0 million
would finance the bulk of the remaining foreign exchange costs of civil works.
Civil works financing would be on parallel basis, with IDA financing the
foreign exchange costs of the main dam and spillway (estimat:ed at US$27.9
million, including contingencies) and the Kuwait Fund financing the foreign
exchange cost of civil works other than the main dam and spillway. The
balance of foreign exchange cost and local cost would be covered by HMG
out of its own resources. Effectiveness of the loan agreement between HMG
and OECF and the loan agreement between HMG and the Kuwait Pund would be a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit agreement.
28.       The Electricity Department would transfer the plant to NEC at cost
less the amounts that NEC contributed during construction, amd NEC would
assume a corresponding rupee debt to the Government, in an amount estimated
to be equivalent to US$59.4 million. The rupee equivalent of the proposed
credit would be repayable by NEC over 25 years with interest: at 8-1/2% per
annum, and the balance of the debt over 25 years at 6% interest per annum.
1/   US$15.9 million equivalent is included in the financing plan and the
remaining US$1.6 million equivalent would be available as additional
contingencies.



Procurement and Disbursement
29.       Procurement under the proposed credit would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding following IDA guidelines, while procurement
u7nder the Kuwait Fund loan would follow Kuwqait Fund procedures. In the event
that all bidders prequalified under IDA procedures are also prequalified under
Kuwait Fund procedures, bids would be invited for the two packages together.
Procurement guidelines established by OECF will be utilized for items financed
by the OECF on the basis of LDC untied procurement (procurement from Japan
and less developed countries). Disbursements from the proposed credit would
be made against the foreign exchange cost of the main dam and spillway. Pre-
liminary and resettlement works will be carried out by HMG's own task force,
supplemented by local contractors.
Tariffs and Finances
30.       One of the objectives of the proposed credit is to improve NEC's
financial performance. Current tariffs, set by 11MG at an average of N1Rs 0.239
(USJ1.9) per kWh are low 1/ and are inadequate for producing an acceptable
rate of return on NEC's assets. For example, in 1974/75 the rate of return
was a negative 1.4%.   The inadequate return has been due mainly to the low
tariff, high system losses (approximately 33%), levy of a royalty of USJO.6
per kWh sold, and a high tax rate of 55% (now 60%) on the net income of NEC.
During negotiations HMG indicated that, as a part of the Second Power Loan
from ADB, HMG would employ a consultant for assistance in the reduction of
system losses. They also indicated that the Government would waive the
royalty. The Government plans steps to reduce its system losses to about 20%
by 1980/81, obviating need for larger tariff increases. During negotiations
it was agreed that tariffs would be increased to produce a rate of return of
2.5% in 1975/76 (calculated as if the increase were in effect since the
beginning of the fiscal year), rining to 4% in 1977/78 and to 6% by 1980/81
and subject to further review, with a view to reaching 8% as early as possible
thereafter. This would require an average tariff of approximately USJ3.3 per
kWh in 1975/76 (compared to the current US41.9) rising to USJ5.9 per kWh in
1980/81, which is comparable to tariffs in neighboring countries. The increase
required to meet the 1975/76 rate of return target would be a condition of
effectiveness of the credit agreement. No dividends would be declared until
the plant has been commissioned, by which time cash generation should have
increased sufficiently to permit payment of dividends.
Benefits and Justification
31.       Electrical energy now reaches only about 3% of the population in
Nepal. Demand for electrical energy has been growing and in the Central
I/   The tariff for domestic users in Nepal is also about USO1.9 per t,WIT. This
compares with US,8.3 per kWH in Burma, USJ4 in Bangladesh and USi6.25
in the neighboring State of Uttar Pradesh in India.



- 9 -
System the average annual rate of growth has been about 22% over the past
10 years, but the average per capita consumption is still extremely low
(paragraph 18). Existing generating capacity even with considerable high
cost diesel generation is insufficient to meet demand. Shortages are
anticipated and load curtailment will be necessary during the next few
years. Such shortages could have serious detrimental impact on industry,
tourism and agricultural development. Though the present consumption is
mainly in the domestic sector, the major component of the future growth
in demand is expected to be in the agricultural, industrial and commercial
sectors. About 12% of the project's total generating capacity would be
required for the Chitwan Valley Irrigation Project 1/ alone. In addition,
by 1983/84 energy consumption by industrial and commercial users is expected
to increase significantly accounting for almost half the total sales.    The
proposed project is a crucial element in NEC's system expansion program to
meet the forecast load requirements.
32.       The project would contribute 60 MW in dependable peaking power,
165 Gwh in primary energy and 45 Gwh in secondary energy annually. When
fully utilized it would replace use of energy in one form or another
equivalent to about 65,000 tons of oil per annum saving approximately
US$8.0 million in scarce foreign exchange.
33.       Hydropower is Nepal's only known conventional energy source of
major economic significance.   The proposed project is a major step in
exploiting this resource.   The project would help to train Nepalese engineers
and technicians in handling of a modern hydroelectric plant and facilities
and build up staff for undertaking future projects.
34.       The project is the least cost solution for discount rates up to
13% when compared with other realistic alternatives which are thermal. No'
other alternative hydro schemes have been sufficiently investigated for com-
pletion to meet growing demand in the next few years. The rate of return
on project investments would be 10.7% based on projected tariff increases.
This return does not take into consideration the benefits that could accrue
from the potential created for two additional power stations which could
be built downstream of the Rapti River, utilizing the regullated flow from
the Kulekhani reservoir. Other additional benefits would be the possibility
of irrigating about 10,000 hectares, fish production from the reservoir and
recreation benefits.
1/ An important irrigation scheme to provide perennial water to increase
production of paddy, corn, mustard, and wheat over an area of 11,100 ha
in the Terai, presently under construction with financial support of ADB
through its loan of $8.0 million equivalent.

35.       About 235 houses in the reservoir area xill be inundated.    It
was agreed during negotiations that HMG xould submit to the Association,
no later than March 31, 1977, a detailed plan for the resettlement of their
1,200 inhabitants. No adverse ecological effects are anticipated. However,
the Consultants would examine the environmental, health and ecological
consequences of the project during field investigations, which must be
comAipleted prior to final design.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Development Credit Agreement betweeen the Kingdom of
Nepal and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Execu-
tive Directors separately.
37.       The special features described in paragraphs 28, 30 and 35 of this
report are reflected in Sections 5.04, 5.02 and 3.03 of the draft credit
agreement, respectively.
38.       Additional conditions of effectiveness are as follows:
(i) Effectiveness of the loan agreements between
HMG and Kuwait Fund, and between HMG and OECF
of Japan;
(ii) Appropriate revision to tariffs to produce a
rate of return on net fixed assets in opera-
tion of 2.5% in 1975/76 (calculated as if the
revisions were in effect for the whole fiscal
year).
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
40.       1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 166      Telecommunications Project US$1.7 million Credit of
November 10, 1969; Effective Date: February 26, 1970;
Closing Date: July 31, 1974 - Revised Closing Date:
September 30, 1976
After initial delays in making the credit effective, delays in
signing an agreement with India for some of the complementary aid provi-
sions and delays in taking procurement action, this project is now pro-
ceeding satisfactorily. All contracts have been placed and completion
is expected by mid-1976.
Credit No. 223      Highway Project US$2.5 million Credit of December 21,
1970; Effective Date: February 3, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1975 - Revised Closing Date: December 31, 1976
With a delay of about eighteen months, the last of the five project
road bridges is nearing completion and all are expected to be open early 1976.
The delay was principally due to land acquisition difficulties and a national
shortage of cement and fuel. Three of the five porter suspension bridges are
open, with the remaining two to be opened in 1976. All project road mainte-
nance equipment has been received and is now part of the Road Department fleet.
Equipment workshop construction has been slow due to contractual difficulties
stemming from price escalation; however, workshop constructiion should be com-
pleted first half 1976. Bid prices, although above appraisal estimates, are
within contingencies. Total project cost is approximately 11% above appraisal
estimate. In view of the effect of general inflation on the benefits, this is
not likely to affect the rate of return. The project is expected to be com-
pleted by mid-1976.
Credit No. 291      Tourism Project US$3.2 million (net of cancellation)
Credit of March 22, 1972; Effective Date: November 9,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1975 - Revised Clos-
ing Date: December 31, 1977
Due to delays in appointing qualified architectural, engineering
and project management consultants, and repeated changes in Scope proposed
by the sponsors of the subprojects, the project is two years behind schedule.
Construction of the Yak and Yeti subproject is underway and is expected to be
completed by the end of 1976. On the other hand, it was not possible to reach
a firm agreement with the sponsors on an appropriate revision of the Annapurna
subproject, and $1.0 million of the Credit was cancelled from the original
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the projects, in execution and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken. They should
be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not pur-
port to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

allocation ($2.88 million) for that subproject.   Agreement with the Govern-
ment is being finalized for the reallocation of the remaining $1.88 million
to meet increased costs of the Yak and Yeti subproject and to finance a
feasibility study for a major hotel in Kathmandu.
Credit No. 373      Birganj Irrigation Project US$6.0 million Credit of
April 18, 1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Implementation of the project was initially delayed by Government's
delay in appointing consultants for detailed engineering and construction
supervision, slow field surveys and procurement difficulties. Approximately
30% of the contracts under the project have now been awarded. After a slow
start present progress is satisfactory. Cost overruns are being met by re-
ducing lower priority items. The project remains viable in view of increase
in agricultural commodity prices and is expected to be completed by mid-1978.
Credit No. 397       Telecommunications Project II US$5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1973
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Procurement under this Credit is more than a year behind schedule
because of delay in appointing an expert to assist with preparation of bid-
ding documents. UK Government has recently provided consultants for this pur-
pose and procurement is expected to start soon. In June 1975 HMG introduced
an important institutional change by converting the Nepal Telecommunications
Board into an independent Corporation. This is expected to facilitate deci-
sion making within the institution.
Credit No. 470      Water Supply and Sewerage Project US$7.8 million Credit
of May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The Water Supply and Sewerage Board was established and work on the
project started with minor delay. Project implementation is now proceeding
satisfactorily with approximately 20% of the contracts awarded. Because of
recent price escalations, large cost overruns are expected which will be par-
tially met by financing the technical assistance component of the project through
JUNDP grants.  In 1976 when the major tender prices are known, the Government will
decide whether to finance the remaining cost overruns or reduce the scope of the
project. The project is expected to be completed by June 1978.
Credit No. 505      Settlement Project US$6.0 million Credit of August 14,
1974; Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing
Date: July 15, 1982
Project implementation is more than a year behind schedule due
to delays in signing and making the credit effective. Subsequent delays
were also encountered in preparing bidding documents which required more
intensive supervision and assistance by Association staff; procurement
procedures are now being speeded up. Bids for various types of equipment
have been received and are now being evaluated by the Government.
