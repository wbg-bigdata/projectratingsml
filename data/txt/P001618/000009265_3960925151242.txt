FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT-1330 HAl)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fifth
Education Project in Malawi, for which Credit 1330-MAI in the amount of
SDR 30.9 million was approved on May 5, 1983. The Credit was closed on
September 30, 1990, two years behind schedule. The last disbursement
was on December 20, 1990 and the credit was fully disbursed.
The PCR was prepared by the Population and Human Resources
Operations Division of the Southern Africa Department (Preface,
Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
The PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Development Credit Agreement; supervision reports; correspondence
between the Bank and the borrower; Progress Reports by the Borrower;
internal Bank memoranda; and interviews with Bank staff and Malawi
Gcvernment officials who were closely associated with the project.

FIFTH EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1330-HA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
i)          The project's objectives were to meet Malawi's most pressing
needs for trained manpower through: (i) improvement in the quality of
primary education, (ii) expansion in the output of secondary schools,
(iii) increases in the number of trained accountants and accounting
technicians, and (iv) strengthening of the management of the education,
training, and auditing systems. In the context of the socio-economic
conditions of the early 1980's when the project was developed, these
objectives were timely and consistent with the emerging government
policy to invest in human resources development and skill training.
Imnlementation Experience
ii)         The main variances between planned and actual implementation
were: (a) the implementation period was lengthened from five to seven
years, through two extensions of the Closing Date; and (b) four more new
secondary schools were established, while only one was planned at
appraisal. The extension of the Closing Date (in 1988 and 1989) enabled
the Government to complete four additional secondary schools with a
total of 1920 additional places. These additional facilities were
financed utilizing funds accruing from the devaluation of the Malawi
Kwacha against the US Dollar (para 8). In view of the increased size of
the project and the shortages of building materials, the time overrun of
only two years, and about llZ overrun in the total project costs, was
not unreasonable (para 29).
Results
iii)        The project complemented and reinforced IDA's assistance
under four preceding education projects. Its main thrust -- expansion
of secondary schools, MCDE centers and primary school teachers -- was
the same as in the previous projects. In quantitative terms, the
project fully achieved its objectives, since all project institutions
(secondary schools, PTTCe, MCA, MCDE centers) have already attained or
exceeded enrollment targets planned during appraisal. The quality of
construction of the facilities was generally good, although some of the
weaknesses in the design of facilities that were financed under a
previous project (for instance, excessive circulation space in the
PTTCs) were repeated in this project without appropriate modification.
Provisions for technical assistance and overseas training were likewise



- iv -
fully utilized, or even exceeded (in the case of overseas training).
However, the project had more limited success in respect to it&
objective of strengthening the management of education and training.
The project also provided funds for two ongoing and two rew studies
(Table 9, Para. 33).
Sustainability
iv)           Most of the project institutions (PTTCs, secondary schools
and the MCA) are likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future as
integral parts of the Malawi educational system. Thus the question is
not whether those institutions will be sustained but At what level of
quality and efficiency. The principal constrains are partly financial
and partly administrative -- the Government's ability to provide an
adequate level of recurrent cost support for non-salary expenditures
such as for textbooks and other learning/teaching materials and
equipment, as well as implementation of an effective and viable system
for school maintenance and equipment repairs. The MCDE centers are in a
somewhat different situation. Due to persistent shortages of self-
learning materials and radio receivers, plus lack of trained teachers,
the centers inevitably resort to conventional teaching methods. But
because of lower quality teachers, overcrowding, shortage of
instructional materials, the MCDE centers are not on the whole
functioning as full-fledged distance education centers, but at best as
conventional secondary schools, albeit of lower quality than the
conventional schools. However, the quality of some of the MCDE Centers
is being upgraded under a follow-up project (Education Sector Credit I).
Findings and Lessons Learned
v)          Overall, the project was well implemented and has brought
about satisfactory results. Enrollment targets were attained in all
project institutions, and in the case of the MCDE centers exceeded by
about 100%. Of the 21 staff-years of technical assistance provided
under the project, 16.5 staff-years (or about 79%) was satisfactorily
utilized. Provision for overseas training was increased during
implementation by about 37% so that 71.5 staff-years were financed by
the project's Closing Date, while 52 staff-years were planned at
appraisal.
vi)         Lessons derived from implementation of the project include
the following. (a) A careful and detailed project preparation should be
undertaken before a project is appraised and launched. The fact that a
project contains components financed under previous projects (i.e.
repeater project) is not a sufficient reason to skip the preparation
phase of the project cycle. (b) The project confirms previous Bank
experience that assistance for education and training should contain an
appropriate balance between support for expansion of physical
facilities, qualitative improvement, and institutional development. The
project, concentrated heavily on expansion of physical facilities (about
86% of project cost) with only minimal assistance to improve
institutional quality or to strengthen institutions in the sector. (c)
When financing studies (feasibility or research-type), it is important
to identify and reach agreement with the borroiwer as early as possible



-v 
regarding the inatitutions or individuals wqho will be assigned primary
responsibility for conducting the altudy, the terms of reference of the
studies and arrangements for report.1.ng the results. A related lesson is
that studies are likely to have a better chance of being executed if
responsibility for conducting them lies with universities or research
centers which normally have a comparat.ive advantage in this regard over
Governibent ministries and other admininstrative agencies. Toward the end
of the implementation period, IDA and the borrower established a center
for education research under the univer,ity with responsibility for all
educational research, including those financed by the Bank (para 16).

Sector:                    Population and Human Resources
Subsector:                 Education
B. Project Background
1.    Sector Development Objectives.  At the time the project was
appraised in 1982 the Government of Malawi was acutely aware that the
inadequate growth of its education system was one of the principal
constraiints to economic and socia. development.  At appraisal, gross
primary school enrollment ratio was about 62%, and that of secondary
school was just 4%, one of the lowest in all of Sub-Saharan Africa.
Outputs from agricultura', industrial, commercial and accounting
institutions fell far short of manpower needs. Qualitatively too,
primary education showed glaring deficiencies. Drop out and repeater
rates remained high and only 23% of entering students completed primary
education. Shortage of textbooks and other instructional materials,
high pupil teacher ratios, lack of properly trained teachers, and old
and decaying school buildings with little or no school furniture or
equipment were among the factors that contributed to low educational
quality. Competing demands from other sectors as well as the pressing
economic difficulties of the time made it imperative for the Government
to seek financial assistance from external sources for the expansion and
improvement of the educational system in order to meet pressing manpower
needs.
2.    Policv Context:  The Government's basic development strategy and
priorities for the 1970's and subsequent years werei set forth in a
policy framework document titled 'the Statement of Dlevelopment Policies
l97l-1980. Although the Government did not prepare a policy statement
for the 1980's similar to that of the 1970's, it did nevertheless
produce rolling five-year development plans that focused on capital
investments. In addition, the Government prepared informal documents
providing revenue and recurrent cost projections. The cumulative thrust



-2-
of these various planning documents was to show projected declines in
the average annual rato of growth of real GDP, from about 6.5Z recorded
in the 1960's and 1970's to a projected growth of only 4.8% through
1985, which wzas subseque.atly revised downward to 3% p.a. In brief, the
project wao initiated at a time of growing concern in government circles
regarding declining economic growth rate and overall financial
constraints. In spite of the Government's deliberate policy of giving
higher priority to agrlculture and infrastructure, the authorities were
becoming increaoingly aware of the need to develop the educational and
training system in order to return to the relatively high rate of
economic growth Malawi had enjoyed in the 1960's.
3.    Lnaes Between Pro ect. Sector and Macro Policy Obiectives.
The Project was largely successful in linking project, sector and macro
policy objectives. It was on the whole quite successful in meeting or
even exceeding its objectives of expanding output in carefully selected
skill areas to meet critical labor market requirements, such as
accountants, managers and auditors. The project was likewise successful
in expanding and upgrading general secondary level institutions as a
means of providing essential middle level manpower.
C. Project Objectives and Descrintio_n:
4.    Prolect ObJectives.  The project addressed Malawi's most pressing
needs for trained manpower by: (a) improving the quality of pr.'.mary
education; (b) expanding the output of secondary level institutions as a
means of providing essential middle level manpower; (c) increasing the
numbers of trained accountants and accounting tec.inicians; and (d)
strengthening management of the education, training and auditing
systems. The project also financed various studies in key areas such as
the delivery anid utilization of instructional materials including
textbooks and a school mapping survey.
5.    Project Components.  The project included construction,
furnishing, and equipping of:
(a)  Three new primary school teacher training colleges at x aasi,
Kasungu and Karonga, and expansion of the existing primary school
teacher training college at Bembeke, to provide for a total of about
1,560 student places, including teaching and boarding facilities, as
well as staff houses;
(b) 25 new Malawi Correspondence and Distance Education Centers
(MCDE) to serve about 2,960 students, renovation and expansion of MCDE
headquarte3rs at Blantyre including provision of equipment, furniture,
and staff houses and construction of two staff houses at Lilongwe and
Mzuzu;
(c) One new secondary school (480 places), including teaching and
boarding facilities and staff houses, and renovation, expansion,
furnishing and equipping of an existing secondary school at Livingstonia
to increase its capacity to 480 student places; and



-3-
(d)  The Malawi Coll3ge of Accountancy (MCA) to provide facilities
for a total of about 215 new student places, including teaching and
boarding facilities as well as staff houses.
In addition, the project fina:1ced technical assisiance and local as well
as overseas training for the Malawi College of Accountancy, MCDE, the
Auditor General's office, the Project Unit and the Malawi National
Examinations Board.
D. Proiect Design andOreanization
6.    Based on the information available to the appralsal and post-
appraisal missions (6/82 and 10/82), the conceptual foundation for the
project was appropriate and clear. The project's central thrust,
particularly expansion of secondary education, distance/correspondence
education, and primary schoo' teacher training, wae in fact a
continuation of the Bank's previous investment in these areas under two
projects which were at the time under implementation (The Third and
Fourth Education Projects -- Cr. 910-MAI and 1123-MAI, respectively).
Two other projects -- the Flrst and Second Education Projects, Cr. 102-
MAI and Cr. 590-MAI, both of which were completed at the time the
project was identified, had also contained financing of project elements
in secondary education mnd primary school teacher training. Thus by
focusing on these same areas, the project further complemented and
reinforced MOE's efforts and achievements.
7.    As stated earlier the project's timing and scope were appropriate
in that it responded to clearly articulated national. needs. The project
was designed and appraised at a time of declining economic growith. The
Government's analysis of policy options had concluded that investment in
human resources development was critical to reverse the declining rate
of economic growth, and that in particular it Was necessary to expand
the pool of secondary school graduates in order to increase middle-level
manpower. Similarly, there was consensus among the authorities for
expanding output of skilled manpower in selected areas such as
accounting, management and auditing where there was clear shortage.
E.    Prolet Implementation
8.    Critical Variances in Project Implementation.  The two factors
responsible for the variance between planned and actual implementation
were: (a) a two year increase in the implementation period (from 5 to 7
years), and (b) addition of 4 secondary schools, with a total of 1920
student places. This brought the total number of student piaces
provided by the project to 2,880 compared to 960 secondary school
places, planned at appraisal. IDA first agreed in 1988 to the
Government's request for a one year extension in order to allow the
completion of the newly added facilities. As a result of foreign
exchange shortages and lack of building materials, including cement, the
construction program fell behind schedule, necessitating a second
extension of the Closing Date to 1990. The Government was able to
finance the additional facilities as a result of the devaluation of the
Malawi Kwacha against the SDR. In view of the increased size of the



-4-
project and the shortages of building materials, the time overrun of
only two yegrs is not unreasonable and does manifest considerable
improvement in the management efficiency of the project implementation
unit.
9.    Project Risks.  At the time the project was launched, education's
share of the government's total recurrent budget was only 11%, one of
the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The recurrent cost implications
arising from expansion of the educational system had thus been flagged
as a potential risk at the time the project was appraised. The
Government had agreed to increase allocations to the sector to 14-15%,
but in view of the overall economic and financial constraints facing the
country at the time the prosject was being implemented, the Government
was unable to increase budgetary allocations. under the Second IDA
Education Sector Credit, the Govsrnment has renewed its commitment to
increase allocations for the sector. In view of some improvement in the
economic performance of the country, the Government may be in a better
position to provide the required recurrent costs.
F.    Major Results of the Prolect
10.   Project Objectives.  Overall the project may be considered
successful. Almost all project institutions are likely to be sustained.
Its impact on institutional development, however, is limited. The
project's objective to address Malawi's most pressing needs for trained
manpower has been met in terms of quantitative targets. The PTTCs have
virtually attained their enrollment targets, although the institutions
were under-enrolled for about two years (1989-1990). The secondary
schools are also operating at full capacity. The MCDE's have exceeded
their enrollment targets by about 100%. Significantly, the MCA has
exceeded its enrollment target: about 340 students are enrolled in
Blantyre and about 210 in Lilongwe in various accountancy and management
courses. Technical assistance provided under the project was almost
fully utilized (87%), while the overseas fellowship and training
component was exceeded by 372. The qualitative target of the project
(that of strengthening the management of the education, training and
auditing systems) was met only partially. For instance, in spite of
five investments (including this project) in the education sector,
implemented by the same project implementation unit, the Borrower still
relies heavily on expatriate staff for project implementation,
particularly in regard to technical staff such as architects and
quantity surveyors. Educational planning has been strengthened to some
extent with the training of Malawi nationals. However, further
assistance is required in this area and is being provided under a
follow-up operation, the First Education Sector Credit.
11.   Prolect Imnact and Benefits.  The main project elements (expansion
and improvement of secondary education, primary school teacher training,
correspondence/distance education) had also been assisted under four
successive IDA-financed projects. Thus the project complemented and
reinforced the cumulative gains achieved in those areas. The impact of
the project is most likely to be greater than it would otherwise have
been had the project elements been in areas different than those
financed under the preceding projects.



-5-
12.   The project has created over 2,000 student places in secondary
schools, and another 10,000 in MCDEs, also a second-level institution.
The project's impact on secondary school enrollment may be best
appreciated when one takes into account that the total secondary school
enrollment was only 20,000 when the project was appraised in 1982.
Similarly, the project has created almost 1600 student places in PTTCs,
thereby increasing the capacity of the PTTCs by almost 80%. The
project's impact on educational quality at the primary school level is
already beginning to be felt with the deployment of an increasing number
of graduates from the project PTTC's in primary schools. The large
increase in secondary school enrollment is likely to have a positive
effect on the quality of post-secondary institutions (including teacher
training) as these institutions will have a larger pool of applicants to
choose from.
G.    Proiect Sustainability
13.   Most of the project institutions (secondary schools, primary
school teacher training colleges, and the College of Accountancy) are
likely to be sustained for the foreseeable future as integral parts of
the Malawi education system. Thus, the question is not whether those
institutions will be sustained, but at what level they will be
sustained. The principal challenges for the level of their
sustainability are partly administrative and partly financial; nameJy,
whether the government will successfully implement an effective
maintenance system for all educational institutions, and whether the
government will be able to allocate an adequate provision for recurrent
cost and maintenance. If these challenges are not met and are coupled
with shortages in the supply of textbooks and other instructional
materials, sustainability is unlikely to be at a high level.  The MCDEs
are in a somewhat different situation. These centers were originally
intended to provide a low-cost alternative to conventional secondary
schools, using self-learning materials supplemented by educational
radio. The centers were expected to provide primary school leavers who
otherwise could not get places in regular secondary schools a "second
chance" to study toward a secondary school diploma. Over the years, it
has become increasingly clear that the centers are unable to fully
attain this objective: pass rates at JC examinations are about 10-15%,
compared to over 80% at the regular boarding secondary schools. Thus
only a handful of MCDE students pass the exam in one sitting and are
able to transfer to regular secondary schools on completion of their
studies. Because tne centers lack specially trained teachers and face
persistent shortages of self-learning materials and radio sets, they
inevitably resort to conventional teaching methods, for which they have
neither the qualified teachers or appropriate instructional materials
and facilities. Further, the centers are overcrowded and staffed with
teachers whose qualifications are lower than those assigned to regular
secondary schools, thereby reinforcing the public's perception of the
centers as less desirable options to regular secondary schools. Under
the circumstances, it would be difficult to conclude that the MCDEs
would be sustained as distant education centers. Rather, they are
likely to serve as conventional secondary schools, albeit of lower
quality than the regular secondary schools. Under a follow-up project



-6-
(Education Sector Credit II), IDA is providing assistance to strengthen
the quality of instruction in the MCDE Centers.
H     Ba.rfeoprmance
14.   Ma1j0  Strengths and Weaknesses.  Bank staff contributed to the
success of the project through close and supportive working
relationships and professional advice. On the whole Bank staff were
knowledgeable about the country's educational system as a result of
close involvement in sector analysis and project development and
implementation for a period of over two decades beginning with the
sector work and identification of the first IDA-supported education
project in 1965. Bank supervision was adequate and the missions were
well-timed, with appropriate staff skill mix: 16 supervision missions
were fielded consisting usually of two (and sometimes three) staff with
different skills such as educators, economists and architects.
Virtually all the supervision missions were combined with other tasks,
such as supervision of other ongoing education projects (The Third and
Fourth Education Projects), or later identification, appraisal and
supervision of follow-up projects, Education Sector Credits I and II).
The missions have been helpful :ln helping resolve critical
implementation constraints. although, as noted by the Borrower
(Para.21), there should have been better continuity in their
composition. For instance, during the early phase of project
implementation when the Government was facing an acute shortage of
foreign exchange which brought about major shortages of imported
building materials, thereby threatening to delay project implementation,
IDA facilitated the situation by amending the Development Credit
Agreement in 1986 to set up a Special Account, denominated in US
dollars, in a local commercial bank with an Authorized Allocation of SDR
1.5 million. This was increased to US$ 3.5 million in 1988, at the
request of the Government. Following the devaluation of the Malawi
Kwacha, IDA similarly responded positively to Government's request in
1986 and 1987 to increase the number of school places financed under the
project from 960 to 2,880, an increase equivalent to four new schools,
each with an enrollment of 480 students. The Development Credit
Agreement was s9-ended to incorporate this increase. While these are
some of the positive features of IDA's performance, on the negative side
IDA has not put in place a strong local project implementation
capability in spite of having already financed five major investments
(including this project) and ie in the process of implementing two large
sector adjustment credits. Much of the technical work (such as
architectural and procurement) was left to expatriates that were
provided by bilateral agencies, notably DANIDA, and only modest
assistance for the PIU was included in the project for the first time in
the form of fellowships and technical assistance.
15.   Lessons Learned.  For future projects the following lessons
learned from implementation of this project may be of value:
(a)   A careful and detailed project preparation should be undertaken
before a project is appraised and launched. In this case the
project was appraised only four months after it was identified,



-7-
and a preparation mission was not fielded. The identification
mission itself was very brief: a one-person IDA mission spent a
week in the field. As moat of the components of the project were
"repeaters", in the sense that they were included in previous
Bank-assisted projects, IDA and the Government may have at the
time considered it unnecessary to undertake detailed project
preparation. The outcome was that the components were simply
replicated without examining adequately other options such as a
more cost-effective mode of training primary school teachers (this
is being done now under the Second Education Credit, almost a
decade later).
(b)   The project confirms that the Bank's assistance for education and
training should contain an appropriate balance between support for
expansion of physical facilities, qualitative improvement as well
as for strengthening the system as a whole. The project focused
almost entirely on expansion of physical facilities, for which 86%
of project costs was allocated. Support for improving educational
quality or for strengthening the system's overall capability was
very limited (instructional materials accour.ted for about only 3%
of project costs; support for strengthening management and
plannirg of the system was even less, less than 1.5% of project
costs). While the project's strong emphasis on civil works was
rather typical of education projects of the period (1970s and
early 1980e), a more balanced support for quality upgrading and
institutional strengthening was appropriate as the weaknessea in
these areas had been highlighted during project identification,
and all four IDA-assisted projects that preceded it had also
focused almost exclusively on expansion of physical facilities.
For instance, in spite of long association with implementing IDA-
assisted projects, the Project Implementation Unit still relies
quite heavily on expatriate staff, particularly in regard to
architects, quantity surveyors and other technical staff. Support
for developing local capability in project implementation was
almost negligible in the preceding four projects, and the limited
assistance (overseas training) under this project was inadequate.
(c)   When feasibility or other studies on specific aspects of the
sector are financed under a project, it is vitally important to
identify the principal researchers/investigators and to agree with
the borrower on the terms of reference for the studies and on
arrangements for conducting the studies and for reporting the
results. In this case two new studies were included for financing
under the project, in addition to two other studies carried over
from the Third and Fourth Education Projects (Cr. 910 and 1123,
'espectively). After persistent delays the studies were launched,
but the reports have not been released, although they are
reportedly available in draft. A major factor for the persistent
delays in conducting the studies was that MOE did not have its own
research staff to conduct the kind of survey research envisaged
under the project. The lesson to be drawn from this experience is
that 6n the whole line ministries and similar government agencies
are not properly set up to undertake research as their primary
function is administration rather than research, and that IDA and



-8-
the borrower should instead make arrangements with institutions
that are appropriately oriented to undertake studies such as
universities or university-based research centers. Toward the end
of the implementation period IDA and the borrower realized the
problem and using the additional funds that accrued from the
devaluation of the Malawi Kwacha, decided to establish a new
Center for Educational Research under the University, to be
responsible for all educational research.
I.    Borrower Performance
16.   All major credit covenants were compiled with (Table 10), although
some were met only in part (e.g. appointment of administrative staff to
one of t t project institutions). In spite of the changes in senior
managemert, overall the PIU performed well. The procurement section was
affected most by these management changes and up to the time of the
mission the records of deliveries and outstanding equipment supplies
were difficult to ascertain. As in the preceding IDA-assisted education
projects, the project encountered difficulties in obtaining counterpart
funds on a timely basis. This was the perhaps tL.d most notable
exception to an otherwise very satisfactory borrower performance.
J.    Project Relationship
17.   Bank staff and officials of the Borrower involved in the
implementation of the project enjoyed an amiable and highly
professional working relationship. These factors contributed to the
success of the project.
K.    Consulting Services
18.   Architectural and engineering services required for the project
were limited as standardized designs prepared by the PIU were used for
both the secondary schools and the MCDE centers. The designs for the
PTTCs were prepared by local consultants based on the design of an
existing PTTC, financed under a previous IDA-assisted project. This
decision was unfortunate as the attempt to save on design fees allowed
the replication of excessive circulation spaces in the three PTTCs
financed under the project. The consultants performed their supervisory
services adequately, but have allowed some minor defects to remain
outstanding for too long; but the defects have since been corrected.
Technical assistance and overseas training provision was implemented by
the British Council under a contract with MOE. The British Council
provided a reliable and efficient service in respect to recruitment of
technical assistance staff and in placing Malawian staff in overseas
educational institutions and following up their progress.

PART II. PROCT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
19.   As stated in Part I, the objectives of the Project, on the whole,
have been achieved, although the three teachers' colleges are slightly
underutilized and the MCDE centers are over-enrolled.
20.   The Bank'e performance during evolution and implementation of the
Project is one factor that can explain the successful completion of the
Project. Among many areas in which the Bank has been useful and helpful
are:
a.   During the design phase, the Bank accommodated many elements of
the package proposed by the Government.
b.    Throughout the implementation phase the Bank was prompt with
approvals of designs, contract awards and other matters.
c.    The most appreciable area of cooperation was in the introduction
of Special Account. Before then, Credit funds were used to
reimburse expenditure made by the Government. The implementation
of civil works was being delayed due to the unavailability of
foreign exchange for the importation of building materials. To
resolve these difficulties IDA agreed to open a Special Account
under which they advanced US$ 2 million to the Government to
provide foreign exchange. With quick importation of materials,
civil works were speeded up and cost escalations were reduced.
However, in retrospect, there was room for improvement in the
following areas there could have been continuity in the members on the
supervision missions, so as to develop a more effective technical
dialogue with members of PIU. A related area of concern was that the
missions in some cases also came to appraise new projects,thus dividing
the short, scheduled time between two equally demanding tasks.
Consequently during discussions some details and explanations were
sacrificed.
21.   Another factor that enabled the successful completion of the
Project was that the Ministry of Education and Culture, through PIU
implemented the project with due diligence and efficiency. The decision
by the Ministry to appoint the heads of new institutions, for example,
before the completion of a building contract has indeed proved
commendable and useful. The head takes part in the site meetings of the
finished stages and works closely with the PIU staff, consultants and
supervisors.
22.   However, many lessons have been learnt for even better performance
in the future. More important ones include:
a.    There were small annual allocations of development funds to
educational development projects, resulting in delayed
commencement of the Project because the allocated funds were spent
on the completion of on-going projects. It is felt desirable,
therefore, that when there are restrictions on total development



-10-
budget, not more than one IDA project should be implemented at the
same time.
b.    Staff turnover, especially at senior levels, was high, and new
members started performing their duties without even rudimentary
training; their efficient performance being achieved through their
enthusiasm which enabled them to "pick-up" skills sooner than
otherwise would have been the case. It is strongly recommended
that staff turnover should be minimized and there is need for
specialized training for staff, especially at senior levels.
c.    There should have been more effective cbnsultations and dialogue
between the suppliers and the project institutions for example, in
revising and updating lists of textbooks and equipment and in
orienting the users (through workshops supplemented by manuals) on
the use and maintenance of the new facilities. This area needs
redressing.
d.    To facilitate quality control and guidance for the users, there
should have been standard specificationb and drawings for office
and staff house furniture in line with the existing documentation
of school furniture. This concern requires immediate attention.
e.    There were many problems associated with civil works; among them
were:
i)    two or three unsuitable sites for secondary schools were
eelected, for example, Euthini proved to have serious
shortage of water;
ii)   it is now evident that extensions to Bembeke and
Livingstonia were more costly than to provide an equal
number of student places in the form of a new college or
school. However, considering Malawi's national, cultural
heritage it was probably right to upgrade and expand the two
institutions. But such special project components should
have been brought forward to an earlier stage of the
implementation and PIU should have been In a better position
to undertake such projects in house;
iii)  The civil works components of the Project were largely
handled by local works professional teams, most consisting
of a firm of architects as a lead consultant with PIU
approved sub-consultants to cover the disciplines of
quantity surveying, land surveying, the various branches of
engineering and site supervision. The firms used have all
been long established and experienced practices. Towards
the end of the Project, it has, however, been felt that



-1 1-
newer consultancy firms ought to be appointed,l/ initially
for smaller and less complicated projects;
iv)   on the majority of civil works contracts the implementation
has been hampered by shortcomings in the performance of
statutory bodies responsible for water and electricity
supply. They were rather slow in providing the services;
v)    the present staff of the PIU is of the opinion that the
electrical power and lighting design of the secondary
schools and in particular the teacher training colleges have
been too extravagant resulting in unnecessary capital costs,
operational expenses and maintenance.  Where possible action
was taken on this issue.
23.   As regards to the relationship between the Bank and the Malawi
Government, it was warm and effective as exemplified in the cooperation
to establish the special account.
24.   There were no co-financiers in this project.
I/    The consultants were selected following IDA's Guidelines for
Selection of Consultants.

25.   Comments on Timetable.  At the request of the Government, the
Credit Agreement was amended in 1988 to increase the number of secondary
school places financed under the project from 960 to 2,880 student
places. Provision of additional school places was made possible as a
result of savings accruing from the devaluation of the Malawi Kwacha
against the SDR. In view of the anticipated delay in completion of the
project as amended, the Closing Date was extended by one year from
September 30, 1988 to September 30, 1989. Because of shortages of
building materials especially cement and imported materials, the
construction program (particularly of the newly added schools) was
encountering serious delays, and this necessitated a second extension of
the Closing Date to September 30, 1990.

27.  Cgmments on Proiect Implementation.  As a result of foreign
exchange constraints, imported building materials were in short supply
throughout the country, and this resulted in some delay in the
construction of project facilities, particularly during the early phase
of the project. However, the situation improved considerably when a
Special Account, denominated in US dollars, was established in 1986 in a
local commercial bank. Four more secondary schools were added to the
project, utilizing additional funds accruing from the devaluation of the
Malawi Kwacha. Completion of these additional facilities necessitated
extension of the closing date by two years, from September 30, 1988 to
September 30, 1990. The MCDE centers were completed 15 months ahead of
schedule5 rehabilitation of the MCDE headquarters, however, experienced
delays as some of the buildings that were to be rehabilitated were still
in use by MOEC and were not vacated in time. Notwithstanding these
delays, all project facilities were completed by the revised closing
date, and at the time of the Completion Mission, most of the
institutions had already been in operation by as much as three years.
Furniture and equipment have been supplied to all secondary schools and
PTTCs, except for some science equipment which was delivered late by
overseas suppliers and was being forwarded to the project institutions
at the time of the Completion Mission.

28.   Comments on Proiect Costs.  Total project costs were about 11%
above appraisal estimates. The cost overrun must be viewed against the
additional project facilities, particularly the four secondary schools
that were added during the implementation period following the

31.   Direct Benefits of Project.  Enrollment and outputs goals in the
various project institutions have already been met, and in the case of
the HCDEs, enrollment in the NCDC centers was close to 10,000 students,
or almost double that of the appraised capacity of 5,600 places. In
terms of output, the four PTTCs graduated 958 teachers in 1990-91,
compared to the appraisal target of 780. Five of the six secondary
schools were new and did not produce graduates until 1990-91. The
combined otttput from the six secondary schools in 1990-91 was 1254. The
SAR had output targets of 120 graduates for each of two of the two
schools: Livingstonia, an existing school which was being expanded, and
rural Lilongwe/Namitete. Actual number of graduates in 1990-91 for both
schools was double the appraisal estimates (240 for Livingstonia and 245
for rural Lilongwe/Namitete). Similarly, output from the NCDCs is
significant. HOE reported that the pass rate on the JCC (repeated
sittings) has been rising steadily from about 16% of the candidates in
1986 to 73% in 1990. In 1990-91 the total number of NCDC output who sat
for the JCC Examinations was 2,765. 73% of that would be about 2,000.
The appraisal target was to double the 1981 output of 600. The
institutions have thus exceeded that by over 300%, according to MOE's
estimates. Details of student enrollment in the various programs of
atudy offered by the Malawi College of Accountancy are summarized in
Annex 4. With respect to graduate output, the College graduated a total
of 150 graduates (1988-89) and 115 graduates in 1989-90. The breakdown
by courses of study is shown in Annex 5. Both the enrollment and output
figures exceed the SAR estimates. Planning and management improvement
goals, as measured by specialist assistance and special training abroad,
were achieved or even exceeded in the case of overseas training. 71.5
staff-years of overseas training were utilized in comparison to 53



-20-
staff-years provided at appraisal9 or about 35Z over the target.
Savings accruing as a result of the devaluation of the Malawi Kwacha
against the SDR allowed the Government to finance the additional
training indicated above.

32. Comments on Studies Com2onents. The project included the
financing of two studies that were carried over from the Third and
Fourth Education projects (Cr. 910-MAI and Cr. 1123-MAI, respectively).
These on-going studies included an assessment of the use and effects of
primary school textbooks and a tracer study of graduates of secondary
and higher education institutions assisted by IDA under previous
projects. In addition, the project included two additional studies.
The first was an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the self-help
school construction program assisted under the Third Education project.
The second was intended to determine to what extent boarding facilities
could be eliminated or at least reduced through new admission policies
as well as through school location mapping. Partly because detailed
terms of reference had not been agreed during project preparation and
appraisal, and also because researchers had not been identified
sufficiently in advance, the studies encountered delays. At the time of
the Completion Mission, as indicated in Table 9, drafts of the studies



-21-
had '.sen submitted to MOEC officials, but not officially released for
public dissemination. Towards the end of the implementation period, IDA
concluded that completion of such studies would require full-time
researchers, and utilizing funds accruing from the depreciation of the
Kwacha, financed the construction of a facility to house a new Center
for Educational Research (CER). The Center will be part of the
University's Faculty of Education, and will be responsible for all
educational research including those financed under IDA-assisted
Education projects, including the two follow-up projects (Education
Sector Credit I and II.)

33.   Staff Inputs.   Staff-input for early stages of the project up to
appraisal was rather light (about 14 s/w only).  As reflected in Table
12 on Mission Data, a project preparation mission was not fielded. Only
4 months elapsed between project identification mission in January, 1982
and appraisal in May, 1982. As the project was essentially a "repeater"
project IDA, and the borrower may have considered it adequate to
appraise the project, skipping the preparation phase. On the other
hand, the project was closely monitored and supervision missions were
fielded regularly (at least twice a year); close to 86 staff-weeks were
utilized for supervision in the course of a seven year implementation
period.
