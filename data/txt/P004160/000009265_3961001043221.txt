MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A HEALTH TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Korea for an amount of US$60.0 million is submitted for
approval.  The proposed loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate with a 15 year maturity including a grace period of five years. The
Government would on-lend the proceeds of the loan to private hospitals at the
same interest rate, maturity and grace periods as the IBRD loan agreement.
The proceeds would help finance a health technology project.
2.        Background.  Korea's rapid economic growth in the last two decades
has brought about an impressive increase in real living standards and equally
impressive improvements in traditional health indicators, reaching a life
expectancy of 71 years, a natural population increase of 12 p.a., an infant
mortality rate of 12.5 per 1,000 live births, and a 922 immunization rate.
Economic success and the control of comunmicable diseases have, however,
brought about a changed disease burden. The major causes of death and
disability are now noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, cancer,
stroke, and violence and injury. The demand for medical care is rising
rapidly as a result of higher income, the introduction of mandatory national
health insurance in 1989, chronic and degenerative diseases, and changing
technology. At the same time, there is growing concern in Korea over equity
issues, including a nerceived increase in income inequality and in equitable
access to quality me- ^al care.
3.        The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA) is responsible for
broad health policy coordination. Health care services in Korea are mostly
delivered by the private sector. Four out of five hospital beds--most of them
not for profit--are privately managed and private sector spending accounted
for 73S of total health sector expenditures in 1989. Direct patient payments
have declined from 80 of health care expenditures in 1980 to an estimated 51t
in 1990 as a result of broader insurance coverage. About 102 of the
population is classified as medically needy and the Government pays for most
of their medical care. Private not-for-profit hospitals owned by foundations
with large endowments have been able to respond to the rapid transition in the
country's disease profile and keep their technology up-to-c'-.te through self-
financing and leasing of equipment. Hospitals with a more limited financial
base have not been able to mobilize investment funding for needed
technological adjustments, even in geographic areas that are important to the
Government's social development policy. Commercial bankers are not familiar
with hospital operations and therefore give low priority to hospital loans.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's first project in the
health sector was a population project (Ln. 1774-5 KO), which was approved in
1979 and closed in 1987. Part of the project monies were on-lent to private
hospitals requiring quality-improving investments and the PCR of October 1989
(Report No. 8114) rated project performance satisfactory. While the project
was designed to expand and strengthen family planning and maternal and child
health programs at a time when population was a major issue, it underwent



- 2 -
major changes during implementation as the economy grew rapidly, altering
Korea's health profile. The PPAR (No. 8895, June 29, 1990) praised the
project's redesign to meet the changing needs of the sector and its support
for loans to private hospitals.
S.        The Government has requested the Bank's continued assistance in
addressing the epidemiological transition and the recent changes in financing
health care services. In June 1989 the Bank issued a health sector report
(Report No. 7412-iO), which studied the effects and implications of health
insurance on the sector and raised options for the organization and design of
the insurance system. Through the proposed project the Bank would further
assist the Government in addressing critical sector issues, focussing on
equity and efficiency in the diffusion of medical technology and private
sector development. In addition, Bank involvement would strengthen MOSA*'s
institutional capacity for planning and managing hospital sector development
and financing, and would enable continued dialogue on other important health
sector issues. Furthermore, by participation in this project, the Bank would
gain experience in helping a middle-income country adapt to an epidemiological
transition which could be utilized in similar countries.
6.        ProJect Obiectives.  The project would assist the Government's
policy of responding to the increased medical care demand resulting from
national health insurance, rising incomes, tecbnological innovations, changing
population structure, and the shift in the epidemiological profile from
comunicable to noncmaunicable diseases (NCD). It would change the criteria
currently in use for introducing biomedical equipment from a hospital-size
based approach to a population and geographic distribution basis. This change
in allocation criteria would move policy decision making towards a more
efficient and rational distribution of biomedical equipment and would make
quality medical care accessible to more people. The project would also
strengthen the capability of KOHSA to manage the process of allocation and
diffusion of medical technologies, and the financial performance of the
hospitals selected under the project would be monitored and strengthened,
setting an example for improved financial management of hospitals in the
private sector.
7.        ProJect Description.  The project wulds  (i) expand the diagnostic
and treatment capabilities of NCD specialty units in large referral hospitals;
(Ui) replace and add biomedical equipment in secondary care hospitals located
in large and medium-size cities and distribute it more equitably: and
(iii) provide equipment to medium-size city hospitals designated as emergency
centers in the national Emergency Medical Services network. Sets of criteria
would be strictly applied to the selection of participating hospitals and of
equipment. The selection criteria for hospitals would consider the hospital's
financial status, its location, its size, and the need for and potential
efficient utilization of the requested equipment. The selection of the
biomedical equipment would take into conslideration the regional distribution
among the eight medical regions, the relevance of equipment to medical needs,
the trauinig of equipment users, the availability of a recurrent cost budget
for operating the equipment, and the sharing of equipment by several
facilities. The financing of high cost equipment would be excluded from the
project, partly because there is an active leasing market for this type of



- 3 -
equipment, and partly because some procedures are not reimbursable by the
national insurance and would therefore not be accessible to the poor. Project
implementation would be the responsibility of the Bureau of Medical Affairs in
MOHSA. Independent review panels would be set up to apply agreed criteria for
selecting hospitals and equipment. MOHSA staff would receive training to
manage the on-lending process and the subloans with the selected hospitals.
8.        The Project would be implemented over a three and a half year
period. The estimated total cost of the project is US$81.2 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$68.2 million (84X). The Bank loan of
USS60 million would finance about 851 of the foreign exchange component.  The
beneficiary hospitals would finance complementary inputs for civil works to
house the equipment, transportation and installation costs, maintenance and
consumables, and contingencies. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Korea are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 9280-KO, dated April 24, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
9.        Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, the Goverwaent agreed thatt
(i) hospitals would be selected and loan proceeds allocated according to
criteria and guidelines acceptable to the Banks (ii) equipment would be
selected according to the criteria and guidelines acceptable to the Bankg
(iii) the subloan agreement between MOESA and the beneficiary hospitals
acceptable to the Bank, would be applied to all subloans; and (iv) the
financial management specialist recruited by MOHSA for the Project
Implementation Unit would be retained for the duration of the project.
10.       Proiect Benefits.  As a result of the project, the geographical
distribution of biomedical equipment would be improved making it accessible to
more people in all eight medical regions of the country. The equipment
diffusion criteria would be changed from a hospital size criterion to criteria
based on population to be served and their medical needs. MOHSA would be
strengthened in its ability to monitor hospital performance and to develop
cost containment strategies. Finally, as transparent accounting practices
would be required from the participating hospitals, the project would set the
stage for the use of uniform accounting procedures and stronger financial
management of private hospitals.
11.       Project Risks.  The principal risk would be defaulting by project
listitutions and inappropriate selection of beneficiary hospitals. To
minimize this risk, procedures have been established to investigate the
creditworthiness of recipients of loan proceeds, and one full-time staff
member with financial skills and a working knowledge of hospital financing has
been recruited by MhOSA to monitor their financial performance during the life
of the loan. The Hospital Selection Committee and the Rquipment Selection
C^omdttee satisfactory to the Bank have already been established and their
respective members already appointed. Criteria for selecting beneficiary
hospitals have been agreed and their strict application would be monitored



- 4 -
during project supervision. The experience with on-lending under the previous
health project was positive and there were no arrears.
12.       Environmental Aspects.  The proposed project is not expected to
result in significant environmental impact.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
