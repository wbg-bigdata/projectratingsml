MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, SNC
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A STEEL SECTOR RESTRUCTURING PROJECT-_
1.       I submit for approval the following report on a proposed loan of
US$400 million to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), with the guarantee
of the United Mexican States, and a maturity of 15 years, including 3 years
grace, at the standard variable interest rate. NAFIN will onlend the
proceeds of the loan as follows: (a) US$100 million to the Government of
Mexico (GOM) in support of a steel sector policy reform program;
(b) US$170 million to Altos Hornos de Mexico, S.A. (AHMSA), US$50 million
to Carbon y Minerales Coahuila, S.A. (CMC) and US$5 million to SIDERMEX,
S.A. in support of a Restructuring Program; and (c) US$75 million to HYLSA
in support of a rehabilitation and modernization program of its flat
products facility at Monterrey.
Background
2.       The steel industry is an important part of Mexico's manufacturing
sector, contributing 4.2% of industrial output and 1.3% of GDP, in 1986; it
has a crucial impact on the availability, quality and cost of material
inputs for downstream manufacturing activities, particularly the
engineering and capital goods industries. With an installed capacity of
9 million tons of crude steel equivalent, the sector comprises two public
(58% of capacity) and two private sector (24% of capacity) integrated
producers, and several independent, non-integrated mini-mills (18% of
capacity) and rerollers. Mexico has relatively favorable conditions for
its steel industry, including competitive supplies of iron ore, coking coal
and natural gas, a well-trained and motivated labor force, well-qualified
technical and managerial cadre and a growing domestic market especially for
higher quality steel products.
3.       Following years of rapid growth from the mid-1940s, steel demand
and output fell sharply with Mexico's economic crisis in 1982, and, despite
a recovery since 1983, remain below the pre-crisis peak levels; medium-term
growth is projected at about 3-4% a year. Mexican production and
consumption of steel products are about in balance. Non-flat producers,
dominated by the private sector, but including the modern SICARTSA I public
sector plant, are substantially competitive by international standards.
The two flat producers, AHMSA in the public sector and HYLSA in the
private, are not currently competitive internationally, particularly as
regards quality. Highly protectionist trade policies prior to 1985 and
controlled domestic prices below the full cost of efficient domestic
producers and landed cost of imports had resulted in an inward-oriented
industry, without much incentive to improve product quality and service to
customers. This was particularly detrimental in flat products vital to
developing competitive engineering and capital goods industries. By early
1986, the public and private sector entities were reeling under the
combined effects of low demand, falling domestic prices in real terms,
heavy debt service burdens contracted during the years of high growth, and
internal cash generation inadequate to maintain existing plant and
equipment and reinvest in new technology to meet changing market needs for
quality and product range.



- 2 -
4.       In early 1986, the Government, recognizing the industry's
financial and technological plight, began a long-term effort to restructure
the steel sector within its overall economic reform agenda. AS a critical
element of that process, the Government developed a restructuring plan for
SIDERMEX, the public sector steel holding corporation, and carried out the
first steps, including financial restructuring of the viable entities,
closure of the uneconomic integrated plant of the publicly owned Fundidora
de Monterrey, S.A. (FMSA), organizational changes to ensure effective
management, retrenchment and layoffs of operating personnel, and
divestiture of virtually all non-steel related businesses. The
organizational restructuring of SIDERMEX and the rehabilitation of physical
plant is now under way. The Government is also assisting HYLSA, the major
private sector producer, to restructure its massive US$l billion-plus
external debt.
5.       On the policy front, the Government (i) has eliminated Official
Reference Prices and reduced tariffs on all steel products to a range of 0%
to 15%; (ii) has brought controlled domestic product prices up to
international levels; (iii) has committed itself to a program which
includes month'ly adjustments to maintain domestic steel prices in real
terms until complete elimination of price controls not later than
December 31, 1988; and (iv) has substantially eliminated input subsidies.
On balance, these actions will provide the incentives and signals for
market-driven performance and strategic planning in the Mexican steel
sector. The remaining other major elements in the short-term restructuring
agenda are urgently needed improvements in facilities and technology by the
two flat producers, together with minor balancing, debottlenecking and
modernization investments by the other sector producers. No expansion of
steelmaking capacity is foreseen or plan-ed. The Government has also
presented the Bank with a Steel Sector Policy Letter which confirms the
scope and direction of the steel sector policy reforms that have been
undertaken and that will be carried out in the future. The outline
presented in the Policy Letter will be further elaborated into a Global
Steel Sector Policy Statement, to be completed before end-July 1988, based
on the recently completed Market Study and the SIDERMEX Long-term Strategic
Plan, wh,ch will be prepared by end-March 1988. The Annex shows a matrix
of actual and planned GOM policy actions in support of the restructuring
process.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
6.       The proposed Bank involvement in the steel subsector is part of
and consistent with ongoing and planned assistance programs to GOM in a
wide range of restructuring and adjustment actions such as trade
liberalization, price decontrol and private sector promotion in the
agricultural, industrial and parastatal (steel and fertilizer) sectors.
These actions aim at improving competitiveness and efficiency of the
Mexican economy. Previous Bank support to steel (Ln. 934-ME of 1973)
contributed to making SICARTSA I the premier non-flat producer in Mexico
and presently a highly internationally competitive entity in the SIDERMEX
complex. By its recent actions and declared policies, GOM has demonstrated
its determination to address major sector issues, expose the Mexican steel
industry to international competition, fundamentally restructure the
subsector and promote more efficient and rational resource allocation and
utilization. It is in this context that the Mexican authorities are



-3-
desirous of continued Bank investment in this subsector to help maintain
the momentum of policy reform and to enable the private and public sector
steel producers to arrest further deterioration and improve their
competitive efficiency.
Project Objectives
7.       The ov*rall objective of the project is to assist GOM in
implementing comprehensive and far-reaching policy reforms for both the
public and private steel sectors and in carrying out the needed
restructuring actions. The project would finance input materials and steel
product imports during the adjus-.ment period; and would assist (i) CMC in
the supply of raw materials; (ii) AHMSA and HYLSA to improve their
competitive position in flat products; and (iii) GOM in designing and
implementing a sound steel sector policy and sectoral public investment
program within the framework of a liberalized market environment and in
financially restructuring the industry. Overall the restructuring process
would result in a reduction of steel-making capacity of approximately 20%
(including closure of uneconomic plants), almost exclusively, all in the
public sector, while allowing the industry to raise utilization of existing
capacity and concentrate its product lines in competitive market segments.
Proiect Description
8.       The proposed project, with an estimated total cost of
US$1,050 million (including taxes and duties of US$104 million equivalent)
and a for .gn exchange component of US$595 million, supports a steel
restructuring program and consists of three parts: (a) Part A
fUS.100 million), an input materials and steel products import component
tied to (i) implementation of agreed policy reforms involving elimination
of domestic price controls and completion of trade liberalization measures,
viz., reduction and rationalization of tariffs on steel products and
elimination of Official Reference Prices (ORPs); and (ii) presentation of a
Global Steel Sector Policy Statement; (b) Part B (total cost.
u$ .72 million), involves physical investments in plant and equipment for
rehabilitation, debottlenecking and modernization and technical assistance
in support of the SIDERMEX restructuring effort to: (i) improve quality
and competitiveness and increase capacity utilization for the AHMSA flat
product facility (US$480 million), (ii) raise productivity in CMC iron ore
and coal mining operations (US$184 million); and (iii) enhance SIDERMEX
strategic planning capacity and imprc-ve corporate-wide management
information and control systems (US$8 million); and (c) Part C (total cost.
US$278 pillion), involves physical investments and technical assistance to
support rehabilitation and modernization of the HYLSA flat products
facilitv. The project would be implemented over a four-year period. The
main project beneficiaries would each be responsible for the implementation
of ;:heir respective components, with the assistance of qualified
engineering and project management 'consultants. AHMSA, CMC and HYLSA have
also set up internal Project Management teams whose staffing, functions and
duties will ensure smooth project implementation. A breakdown of costs and
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of ke,
project process events and the status of Bank Group operations in Mexico
are given in Schedules C and D. Two maps showing the location of steel
plants and iron ore and coal mines are attached. The Staff Appraisal



-4-
Report (Report No. 6892-ME) dated January 29, 1988, is being circulated
separately.
Agreed Actions
9.       The actions already taken (para 5), including a January 1988
adjustment of steel prices in real terms, and the presentation of the
Policy Letter satisfy all conditions of Oisbursement of the first tranche
of Part A, at loan effectiveness. Complete price decontrol on all steel
products will take place no later than December 31, 1988, and is a
conditton of disbursement of the second tranche of Part A. A further
c.ndition of second tranche release is the elaboration by GOH, not later
than July 31, 1988, of the Global Steel Sector Policy Statement,
satisfactory to the Bank and based substantially on the Policy Letter
provided at negotiations, in order for the private sector to react and
complete its strategic planning. This statement will specify among others
the respective roles of the public and private sectors and the Government's
parastatal steel sector investment and operating policies, and elaborate on
the Government's intended sector-wide policies and actions in line with the
guidelines for the SIDERMEX Long-term Strategic Plan as provided in the
Policy Letter. In addition, assurances were obtained that the overall
Steel Sector Reform Program including the agreed elements of trade and
price liberalization and global policy will be implemented and maintained
in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, and that during the remainder of 1988
and until complete elimination of price controls, the Government will
adjust domestic prices monthly based on the changes in the Consumer Price
Index in order to maintain them in real terms. Finally it was also agreed
that SIDERMEX would present its Long-term Strategic Plan for March 1988
Bank review, and thereatter implement the plan's agreed elements in
accordance with investment criteria, financing plans and implementation
schedules satisfactory to the Bank; it would also carry out annual reviews
with the Bank on the progress of implementation as well as agree on the
investment plan for the coming year.
Benefits
10.      The proposed project would permit local steel users to improve
their efficiency due to a&'ailability of high-quality steel products at
internationally competitive prices and, thereby, enhance their strategic
role in the development of an export-oriented competitive economy. AHNSA
and HYISA will attain international competitiveness since their
restructuring will involve closure of uneconomic capacity and eliminate
production bottlenecks resulting in (i) some increase in production despite
a lower production capacity and (ii) a shift in the respective product
mixes to higher- quality, higher-value products. The incremental financial
rates of return on a discounted cash flow basis are 33% for the AHNSA and
17% for the HYLSA investment programs, differing due to the current
performance of the two companies.
Project Risks
11.      A delay in decontrolling steel prices could aggravate the
financial position of the major steel producers and induce calls for higher
protection. This potential major risk is minimized by actions to date to
adjust steel prices and the agreed calendar for monthly adjustments in real



- 5 -
terms until complete decontrol by end-1988. Additional risks include a
reversal in the agreed policy actions and a sharp real appre^iation of the
exchange rate which could affect project viability. The potential adverse
impact of the above risks is mitigated by Government commitment to the
policy actions as demonstrated to date and as incorporated in the
agreements.
Recommendations
12.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
