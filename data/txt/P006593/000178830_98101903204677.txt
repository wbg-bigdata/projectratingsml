CHILE
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the expansion and improve-
ment of vocational training for agriculture, fishery and industry in
Chile, for which a Bank loan of US$ 1.5 million equivalent is recommended.
ii.       The project is intended to provide an increased supply of
trained manpower to meet Chile's needs. It would alleviate significantly
the shortage of industrial and agricultural personnel at lower and middle-
levels.
iii.      The proportion of semi-skilled, skilled and middle-level techni-
cal personnel in the labor force is lower than the requirements. Both
quantitatively and qualitatively, a shortage of vocational training con-
stitutes a major limitation for the development of the country's economic
resources.                                                                i
iv.       The formal education system under the Ministrr of Education of-
fers technical secondary school courses but the school are inadequate.
The main responsibility for vocational training falls bn the Instituto
Nacional de Capacitacion Profesional (INACAP), a subs diary of the pub-
lic Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion (CORFO). Its training
programs are almost exclusively guided by labor market needs. However,
INACAP is not large enough to meet the estimated training demands by em-
ployers. The growth in the number of training places and the improvement
in quality as a result of the proposed project would enable INACAP to bet-
ter meet labor market demands.
v.        This project was preceded by a first Bank financed project which
was successfully implemented between 1966 and the end of 1969, and which
doubled the training capacity of INACAP. The Bank has completed negotia-
tions for a third education project, this time to assist the Ministry of
Education in financing the implementation of the 1966 educational reform
act, primarily through expanding primary teacher training.
vi.       The proposed project would consist of:
(a) the construction and equipment of workshops, class-
rooms, laboratories, and related facilities to ex-
pand four existing training centers and to create
one new center;
(b) the provision of mobile units and their equipment
for training programs in agriculture and fishery;
and
(c) equipment for existing training programs.



- ii -
The project would assist INACAP's training programs in the fields of agri-
culture, fishery, metallurgy, auto-mechanics, garment trades, refrigera-
tion and air-conditioning; it would also include programs for apprentice
training.
vii.      INACAP needs to increase the rate of utilization of its facili-
ties, including instructor time, through improved supervision, close co-
operation with enterprises, and efforts to limit activities in social
fields unrelated to manpower demands.
viii.     The proposed project would cost US$ 3.0 million equivalent.
Contracts would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding.  The project is not likely to attract foreign bidders for con-
struction work. Assuming that local contractors would carry out con-
struction, but that all equipment would be imported, the foreign exchange
component of total project costs would be about 50%.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$ 1.5 million
equivalent, for a term of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years.
This would cover about 50% of the total project costs. The remainder
would be met by CORFO, which has adequate funds for this purpose. The
borrower would be CORFO, which would make the proceeds of the loan avail-
able to INACAP on a grant basis. The Republic of Chile would guarantee
the proposed loan.



APPRAISAL OF A SECOND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT IN CHILE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1965 the Bank made a loan of $2.75 million to the Corporacion
de Fomento de la Produccion (CORPO), a government-owned development organi-
zation, to finance an expansion program of its training subsidiary, the
Servicio de Cooperacion Tecnica (Servicio). During the second half of 1966,
CORFO and Servicio organized the Instituto Nacional de Capacitacion Profe-
sional (INACAP) as a subsidiary of both, entrusted with discharging the func-
tions of Servicio's Professional Training Department, originally responsible
for the execution of the Bank project. The substitution of INACAP for Ser-
viclo was reflected in an amendment to the loan documents dated July 20,
1967, which became effective on March 1, 1968. Implementation of this first
project was completed by the end of 1969, after extensions of the closing
date, originally foreseen for June 1968. 20% of the total project cost of
$3.8 million were used for construction of training facilities. 80% went
into the purchase of equipment for all fields of training offered by INACAP.
The project has fully attained its objectives by successfully contributing
to increasing the number of trainees from about 16,000 in 1965 to about
30,000 in 1969, and to improving the quality of training as well as the di-
versification of courses in accordance with changing manpower demands. The
use of mobile training units rather than centers for training in mining and
agriculture has proven particularly encouraging in terms of both training
results and costs. The Bank has completed negotiations for a third educa-
tion project, designed to help finance implementation of the 1966 education-
al reform.  It would finance educational institutions for which the Ministry
of Education carries direct responsibility, mainly primary teacher training
colleges.
1.02      In May 1969, CORFO requested Bank financial assistance for a    5//-
further expansion of INACAP. The project was appraised in June 1969, by a
Bank mission composed of Messrs. K. Bahr (economist), F.J. Pidgeon (techni-
cal education), A. Stam (architect), and W. van der Wal (agricultural edu-
cation). During appraisal, the project was modified in order to adapt it
more closely to the needs of industry and agriculture as well as to the or-
ganizational capacity of INACAP. In particular, (a) equipment lists and
building items were reduced, (b) an administrative building was deleted as
not being directly related to training, and (c) a boat for the fishery train-
ing program and (d) four buildings were added to render existing training
programs more effective.
1.03      The amended project, as approved by INACAP and CORFO, consists
of:
(a) 7 new buildings (comprising 20 workshops, 8 class-
rooms, 3 laboratories and related facilities, one
dormitory and one combined dining-assembly hall) for
training in agricultural mechanics, auto-mechanics,
sheetmetal work, refrigeration and air-conditioning
and garment manufacturing;



- 2 -
(b)  22 mobile units for agricultural training; 7 mobile
units and 1 vessel for fishery training; and
(c) equipment for all training programs.
Social and Economic Background
1.04      Chile extends over a narrow and long area between 180 and 550
southern latitude, with a coastline of about 4,500 km. It comprises a
wide range of climatic and geological zones, from sub-tropical desert in
the North to cold and humid steppe in the South. Economic activity and
population are concentrated between the Aconcagua valley and Puerto Mont.
Economic activities in the northern part of the country are dominated by
mining. In the South, agriculture, forestry and fishing are major eco-
nomic activities.
1.05      Estimated total population in 1969 is 9.3 million.  About 50%
is below 20 years of age; close to 70% is living in urban areas. The
labor force is approximately 3.1 million (see para. 4.01). Unemployment
is estimated to be about 6%. Underemployment exists in parts of the serv-
ices sector and in agriculture. In terms of employment, services and agri-
culture are the largest sectors (about 26%) followed by manufacturing (19%).
(Annex 1).
1.06      In terms of GDP, manufacturing (27%), services (22Z) and commerce
(21%) hold the largest shares in 1968 while agriculture contributes only
8%. The mining sector's share is 10%; however it earns about 87% of the
country's export income (1968), copper alone accounting for 73%. Chile is
a net importer of foodstuffs, imports of which almost doubled between 1960
and 1967 (from $60 million to $115 million).
1.07      The industrialization and modernization of the economy are pro-
ceeding but there is an urgent need to improve productivity and increase
production in agriculture. Both of these features are dependent on im-
proved and expanded training and hence related to the proposed project.
II. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
A. The Formal Education System
2.01      The Minister of Education is responsible for policy, finance,
administration, curricula and supervision of public primary and secon-
dary education. He controls curricula and examinations of private
schools. State and private universities are autonomous. In 1966 the
National Education Reform Act was passed, committing the Government to
improve the structure and content of primary and secondary education.
Major reform measures are: (a) extension of primary education from six
to eight years and a corresponding reduction of secondary education from



six to four years; (b) increased admission requirements for primary teach-
er training colleges and upgrading of these colleges to post-secondary
level; (c) curriculum reform in secondary education; (d) rationalization
of secondary technical and agricultural schlools, involving a reduction in
numbers of schools, creation of large economic units, and changes of cur-
ricula towards more practically oriented pre-vocational education. A de-
tailed description of the educational system is given in Annexes 2, 3 and
4.
B. Technical Education and Vocational Training
2.02      Responsibility for technical education and vocational training
rests primarily with the Ministry of Education and with INACAP. The uni-
versities and other public and private bodies also play a role in this
field but on a small scale.
2.03      The Ministry of Education provides technical education at the
secondary level in its agricultural, industrial, commercial and home sci-
ence schools. As explained in Annex 2, these schools have serious defi-
ciencies. They are inadequate in regard to staff, equipment and teaching
materials. Curricula are largely outdated. Students enter technical and
agricultural education without a sufficient basis of general education.
As a result, standards of technical and agricultural education have dete-
riorated and an increasing number of successful school leavers apply for
INACAP vocational training courses in order to obtain marketable skills.
The Government plans to improve secondary agricultural education but there
is little indication that the deficiencies of industrial education will be
overcome soon.
2.04      The universities, in particular the two technical universities,
offer technician training. The Technical University of Santa Maria,
Valparaiso, has organized, in conjunction with certain enterprises, an
apprentice-type training.
2.05      A few private enterprises are engaged in technical training.
Hlowever, these activities are limited in scope and directly related to
the immediate and short-term needs of the individual firms.
2.06      A small number of agricultural training courses are offered
by the Instituto de Educacion Rural (I.E.R.), the Instituto de Desarollo
Agropecuario (I.N.D.A.P.), the Corporacion de la Reforma Agraria
(C.O.R.A.), and the Instituto de Capacitacion e Investigacion de la Re-
forma Agraria (I.C.I.R.A.).
C. Instituto Nacional de Capacitacion Profesional (INACAP)
2.07      The Instituto Nacional de Capacitacion Profesional (INACAP),
carries the main responsibility for the entire field of vocational, tech-
nical and agricultural training. It was founded in 1966 as a subsidiary
of CORFO, to carry on the training functions previously assigned to a de-
partment of CORFO. The Corporacion de Fomento de la Produccion (CORFO),



- 4 -
founded in 1939, is a public corporation promoting economic development
through a variety of programmes, ranging from participation in mixed com-
panies in all sectors of the economy, financing and operating public de-
velopment programmes, financing and controlling legally autonomous subsi-
diaries engaged in production and distribution of goods and services, to
research and training. The Minister of National Economy is, ex-officio
the President of CORFO. CORFO's annual budget needs approval by Parlia-
ment to become effective. In 1969, for example, 83% of the budget of
Escudos 1,356 million and $171.5 million was funded by the National Treas-
ury or - in the case of the foreign exchange budget - consisted of foreign
funds made available to the Government but allocated and administered by
CORFO. 65% of the domestic income from non-government sources, (i.e. of
17% of Escudos 1,356 million) is spent to cover CORFO's operating expenses.
Thus virtually all development activities of CORFO, including the financing
of INACAP. are in fact financed out of public funds.
2.08      INACAP operates on a non-profit basis, obtaining its finances
mainly through CORFO. It is governed by a council which represents gov-
ernment departments, including the Ministries of Education and Labor,
the universities, representatives of private employers and the trade
unions. The institute caters primarily for persons above the age of 18
years, i.e., for adult workers, the unemployed and school "drop-outs."
In 1968 an apprentice training program was started.
2.09      INACAP is well organized (Annex 5).  The subject, level, con-
tent, duration, and location of the courses offered are closely linked
to labor market needs. The training program is highly flexible and
adaptable to changing needs. Curricula and syllabi are continuously
updated. Equipment and training facilities are appropriate for the
present programme. Instructors are well qualified, work on a full-time
basis and earn competitive salaries. INACAP provides its own instruc-
tor training and retraining courses. The instructor-trainee ratio is
between 1:10 and 1:15, depending on the type of course. Planning of
INACAP training programs is based on the expressed demands of employers,
sector studies of manpower developments and follow-up studies of former
trainees.
2.10      Courses are given in 22 INACAP training centers, and through
mobile units. Whenever appropriate, INACAP uses the facilities of
private firms, farms and farm-cooperatives, and industrial schools be-
longing to the Ministry of Education, other public and private institu-
tions and the universities. INACAP employs 420 instructors and super-
visors out of a total of 700 employees. More than 500 courses were plan-
ned for 1969.
2.11      INACAP has experienced a rapid growth, from 16,000 trainees in
1965 to close to 30,000 trainees in 1969 (see also Annex 6). An increase
of annual training capacity to more than 40,000 is foreseen by 1975. For
INACAP's success it is essential that training programs be highly flexi-
ble in responding to short-term labor market changes. INACAP, therefore,
does not draw up detailed long-term development plans but plots its future



- 5 -
expansion along a cautious course which is well within the limits of its
organizational and financial capacity and of economic needs. The expan-
sion of 30% foreseen by 1975 which is below estimated manpower needs
(chapter IV) has been determined by INACAP's policy to maintain high train-
ing standards, which can be achieved only if the annual increase in activi-
ties does not outgrow the organizational ability to handle the activities.
2.12      The duration of courses varies from 10 days to 3 months; ap-
prentice training extends over 3 years.   The types and levels of courses
offered are:
(a)  basic training courses ("Formacion") for unskilled
persons;
(b) upgrading training courses ("Capacitacion") leading
to qualification as a fully skilled worker;
(c)  specialized courses ("Especializacion Profesional")
providing specialist skills;
(d) courses for secondary school graduates at intermediate
technician level;
(e) apprentice training courses;
(f) Labor Promotion Courses ("Promocion Superior de
Trabajo, P.S.T.) providing general education,
with a technical bias, for persons in industry
who did not complete a formal education, upgrad-
ing them to the level of qualified foreman or
shop-floor techniciani;
(g) instructor training courses;
(h) in-plant training courses at various levels;
(i) mobile training courses, also at various levels;
(for further details see Annex 7).
These courses are being offered in the fields of mechanics and metallurgy,
construction, agriculture, fishery, garment manufacturing, mining, elec-
tricity, refrigeration and air-conditioning. Annex 8 shows how these
training activities correspond with occupational levels, and how INACAP
complements, and to some extent supplements, formal education.
2.13      INACAP employs well qualified instructors, who are graduates
from secondary technical and agricultural schools or from universities,
and who have received specialized instructor training by INACAP. Many
have had industrial experience and some have had teaching experience.



- 6 -
Salaries and fringe benefits are competitive with those in public serv-
ices and compare well with those in industry. It will not be difficult
to recruit 50 additional instructors to implement the proposed project.
2.14      In connection with the past and foreseen development of INAGAP
two problems have arisen:
(a)  the effectiveness of supervision may decline as
a result of the increased workload (i.e., the
growing amount of supervision information to be
evaluated for incorporation into operational de-
cisions); and
(b)  the utilization of instructor time, equipment and
workshops may become too low as a result of the
large number of short ad hoc courses.
2.15      These difficulties could be overcome (a) by setting up and carry-
ing out, with the help of data processing equipment to be acquired under
the project, continuous course evaluation procedures, and the utilization
of the evaluation information in the day-to-day operational decisions, and
(b) by increasing the direct involvement of department heads and other
senior staff of INACAP in course supervision. During negotiations assur-
ances were obtained to this effect.
2.16      Chile has no laws requiring minimum training for occupations
and, unlike similar training organizations in other Latin American coun-
tries, the budget of INACAP is not financed directly by industry. There-
fore, industry does not yet take as close an interest in INACAP's acti-
vities as is desirable and as might be the case with direct financial
contributions by industry. Pending such an arrangement, which seems to
be excluded for some time, INACAP should make a systematic effort to en-
list industry's interest and participation in increasing the utilization
of INACAP's training facilities. Industry should assist by releasing
workers during part of the day to attend day-time training courses. In
this way industry could assume indirectly part of the training cost for
its own employees. During negotiations assurances were obtained that
INACAP will develop a program, in close consultation with the appropriate
industrial organizations, to increase the attendance of workers at day-
time training courses.
III. FINANCING AND EXPENDITURES OF INACAP
3.01      Chile's total public and private education expenditure has in-
creased substantially over the last five years, from approximately 4.6%0
of GDP in 1964 to approximately 5.4% of GDP in 1968 (Annexes 9 and 10).
Ministry of Education expenditures on vocational and technical education
show a downward tendency, thus indicating the increasing role of INACAP
in this field.



- 7 -
3.02      Over 90% of INACAP's budget is financed through contributions
from CORFO (Annex 11) which in turn obtains its funds mainly from the
government budget and from foreign borrowings (see para. 2.07). The
proceeds of foreign loans to CORFO, contracted to help finance INACAP's
expansion programs, amounted to 31% of INACAP's budget in 1968 and an
estimated 6% in 1969. The remainder of INACAP's budget is financed main-
ly from fees for training services sold to the Ministry of Education.
3.03      Details regarding the development of INACAPts expenditure are
as follows (see also Annexes 9 and 10):
£xpenditure        1965         1966         1967         1968         1969
(in millions of 1969 Escudos)
Recurrent          14.2         18.9         22.2         28.1         44.6
Capital             7.1          5.6         23.7         20.7         10.3
Total          21.3         24.5         45.9         48.8         54.9
3.04      INACAP's recurrent expenditure is estimated to increase from
EO 44.6 million in 1969 to EO 102 million in 1973 (1969 prices) when
the project will be completed. As from 1973, about EO 10 million (1969
prices) of the recurrent expenditure would be additional expenditure
due to the project. During the implementation period of the project,
capital expenditure would also be about EO 10 million per year (1969
prices).
3.05      The cost per pupil of INACAP programs is difficult to assess
because of the great variety of courses of different and changing dura-
tion. An estimate (Annex 12) shows that the cost per person who had com-
pleted training (not per trainee) increased, in constant 1969 prices,
from $129 in 1965 to about $180 in 1969, or by 8.8% annually, with major
increases in the last two years. This increase in costs is due to a
shift in the mix of training courses from shorter and relatively low cost
courses towards longer and more expensive ones.

ance) from the Governments of Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland and
the United Kingdom. ILO is executing a UNDP/SF financed project which
includes the supply of equipment as well as technical assistance.

IV. MANPOWER AND TRAINING NEEDS
4.01      The manpower situation in Chile is characterized by a relatively
high and rising rate of unemployment (about 6% in 1969) and underemploy-
ment (an estimated 9% of the total employment), and a low level of formal
vocational education and training of the labor force. The 1965 census
shows that about 50% of the labor force has had four years of primary edu-
cation or less (including about 15% illiterates), 25% has had up to six
years primary education; less than 5% have completed secondary education,
and less than 0.5% have completed secondary technical or agricultural edu-
cation.
4.02      The economy is growing at a rate which promises good employment
opportunities for qualified labor. GDP increased at an average rate of
4.5% annually during the past five years, but there are great differences
among sectors. Agricultural production increased during 1965-67 by only
1-1/2-2% per year and for several years Chile has been a net importer of
foodstuffs. Since 1960, employment in agriculture decreased slightly from
about 28% of total employment in 1960 to about 26% in 1969. The slow rate
of growth in agriculture has been a major constraint on the country's de-
velopment through its impact both on the balance of payments and on the
size of the domestic market for manufactured goods. Low productivity in
agriculture is in part due to the lack of adequately trained farmers and
farm labor. Less than 3% of those employed in agriculture are trained.
4.03      Manufacturing production has grown by 6-6-1/2% annually during
1965-67; continued growth is expected, but it requires technically qual-
ified manpower. The economy is still heavily protected by import re-
strictions, the anticipated gradual removal of which increases the need
for competitive industries, and thus for high quality products.
4.04      Against this economic background, it is estimated that voca-
tional training would have to be extended to about 800,000 persons be-
tween 1965 and 1975 (Annexes 13, 14 and 15):

1/   Since 1965 is the most recent year for which labor force statistics
are available and no reliable information exists to calcubl te cor-
responding figures for later years, 1965 has been used as 1 ase year
for the purpose of estimating manpower requirements.
2/   Forecasts are based on 1969 employment which was estimated on the
basis of 1965 statistical data.
These figures refer to the employment directly related to produc tion,
i.e., including all occupations involving manual work of the sersi-skilled,
skilled and middle-level technician level. It is desirable that about
80% of the 474,000 persons who will be employed for the first time in
directly production related jobs during the 1965-1975 period shculd under-
go some vocational training of the kind provided by IIJACAP, in Xddition
to any formal education.  Of the 835,000 employed in 3965 in dihectly
production-related occupations, an estimated 423,000 (or 70% of those
who are likely to be in employment by 1975) will need refresher and re-
training courses. These estimates indicate the maximum needs fcr system-
atic vocational training activities during the 1965-1975 period. Sub-
tracting the numbers already trained between 1965 and 1969, the maximum
average annual training needs for the years between 1970 and 19;5 would
be for 61,000 new entrants to the labor market and 56,000 persors already
employed and to be retrained (Annexes 6 and 15) as shown in the following

4.05      With the present training capacity of about 30,000 training
places pei year INACAP's contribution to meeting the overall vocational
training needs of the economy is relatively modest (i.e., about 25% of the
average atnual needs). On the other hand, INACAP provides 90% of the coun-
try's voc&tional training, measured in terms of persons trained each year.
While mort efficient utilization of existing facilities would allow INACAP
to increase its training capacity even further (para. 2.16), for finan-
cial and (.rganizational reasons it would not be advisable to extend INACAP
at a fastEr rate (para. 2.11).
4.06      The proposed project is designed to increase INACAP's annual
training capacity from about 30,000 to close to 38,000 and concentrates
on two highest priority training sectors (agriculture and manufacturing)
where training needs are greatest. An additional annual capacity of 2,500
trainees vill be provided by a training center for metallurgy and elec-
trical tr&des at present under construction, and jointly financed by
INACAP anc bilateral assistance from the Governments of France and
Germany. INACAP's total training capacity would then amount to about
140,000 truinees per year as of 1972 (see Annex 6). The detailed train-
ing requirements in individual fields to be covered by the project are
given in innex 14.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Technical Features
5.01      The proposed project is intended to increase the training ca-
pacity of INACAP by at least 30% In the course of three years, in order
to alleviate Chile's shortage of trained industrial, agricultural and
fishery personnel at lower and middle levels.
5.02      The project consists of:
(a) the construction of:
(i) premises for the Chilean-Swiss Center for
Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning in
Santiago;
(ii) new premises for the Garment Trade Center in
Santiago;
(iii) extensions to the Chilean-Danish Metallurgy
Training Center in Santiago;
(iv) extensions to the INACAP Center in Renca for
the Apprentice Training Program, the Labor
Promotion Program and the Central Technical
Department;
(v) extensions to the Center for Agricultural
Mechanics Training at San Fernando;
(b) mobile training units for:
(i) the Agricultural Training Program (22 units);
(ii) the Fishery Program (8 units including one
vessel);
(c) equipment for:
(i) the items mentioned under (a, iv), (a, v) and
(b); and certain other INACAP rrograms, including
in-plant training and Instructor and Foreman
Training; programs in technical drawing, machine
tools, auto-body repair and painting, woodwork,
welding;
(ii) print shop at Renca Center; and
(iii) data processing at Renca Center.



- 12 -
5.03      The total number of new places to be provided in the project
would make it possible to accommodate an additional 8,000 trainees per
year. The distribution over the various training programs will be as
follows:

5.04      The project items, a detailed description of which is given in
Annex 16, are the following:
(a)  (i)  The Chilean-Swiss Center for training in installa-
tion, maintenance and repair of refrigeration and
air-conditioning equipment, to be located in Santiago
(Renca), would provide 72 places per year. Switzerland
is to supply all equipment and three experts who will
train Chilean counterparts.
(ii)  The expansion of the Garment Trades Center, involving
its relocation in an area close to garment industries
in Santiago, would increase the annual capacity by
450 places to 800 places, leading to a broadening of
fields of training from woven garment manufacturing
to knitted garment production.
(iii)  The Chilean-Danish Metallurgy Training Center,
Santiago, would be completed, increasing the annual



- 13 -
capacity by 600 places to 1,180 places, thus enabling
the Center to offer a complete range of metallurgy
training courses at various levels. Denmark is pro-
viding all equipment as well as a teal of instructors.
(iv) The extension of training facilities at the Center
in Renca, Santiago includes the UNDP/ILO supported
Labor Promotion Program under which upgrading
courses in general and technical education are of-
fered; the Apprentice Training Program; the Tech-
nical Department of INACAP which is responsible
for syllabus development and production of didac-
tical material for all INACAP activities. Also
included in the Center is a central combined assemb-
ly-dining hall.
(v) The construction of 100 boarding places will increase
the capacity of the Agricultural Mechanics Center at
San Fernando to full utilization of 480 places per
year.
(b)  (i)  22 mobile units for INACAP's agricultural training
programs would increase both the annual number of
trainees by 4,000 to about 10,000, and the effi-
ciency of training by providing maximum flexibility
with respect to short-term changes in training needs
in varying locations.
(ii) 7 mobile land-based units and one boat would increase
the fishery training capacity by 360 places to 930
places annually, at the same time broadening consider-
ably the range and level of courses.
(c)  (i)  The project includes equipment for the Labor Promo-
tion Program and complementary equipment for almost
all other INACAP programs, permitting an overall ad-
dition of about 1,000 annual training places, together
with modernization and broadening of the scope of
courses.
(ii) Additional printing equipment will alleviate the
existing serious bottleneck in the production of
written instruction material. It would provide also
the needed capacity for the foreseen expansion of
INACAP activities.
(iii)  The data processing equipment included in the project
would lead to a substantial reduction in costs and to
the needed increase in the efficiency of information
processing and evaluation for a variety of management



- 14 -
functions, including accounting, inventory control,
budgeting, planning and evaluation of training activ-
ities.
B. Cost of the Project

5.07       These cost estimates are based on recent experience in similar
projects in Chile by INACAP and the Sociedad Construction de Establieci-
mientos Educacionales (S.C.E.E.), the school construction company re-
sponsible for design and supervision of government school building ac-
tivities.  Increases in building costs for the types of buildings includ-
ed in the present project have been around 5% annually (itn real terms)
over the past five years. This trend is assumed to continue. Space
standards for workshops, classrooms, laboratories and offices are appro-
priate. Estimates of equipment costs are realistic and assure adequate
provision of the various items, including spare parts. In view of the
varying lengths and content of the courses, and the fact that much of the
loan is to be used for the improvement of existing facilities, it is not
possible to make a useful estimate of the cost-per-student.
C. Execution of the Project
5.08       INACAP would be responsible for the execution of the project
and would therefore establish a Project Unit to coordinate, administer
and supervise implementation. The Unit would be headed by a senior of-
ficer of INACAP. A Project Architect, acceptable to the Bank, would be



- 16 -
appointed to the Project Unit. He would be responsible for coordinating,
supervising and approving the architectural work and contract awards for
construction work. He would be engaged expressly for this purpose and ad-
ditional to the staff of the existing architectural section of INACAP.
Agreement on this point was reached during negotiations.
5.09      Designs for INACAP buildings would be provided either by private
architects or made by INACAP's own architectural office. Both procedures
are acceptable for purposes of the project.
5.10      Tendering for construction work, furniture and equipment would
be in accordance with Bank procedures for international competitive bid-
ding. In view of the size of the works and the competitiveness of local
industry, the project is not likely to attract foreign bidders for con-
struction work. However, it is highly likely that all equipment will be
procured from foreign suppliers. A preference of up to 15% would be
granted to domestic suppliers.
5.11      The country's building industry is highly developed and con-
struction capacity is sufficient to cope with the expansion program of
INACAP. Construction methods used for existing INACAP buildings as well
as those proposed for the buildings included in the proposed project are
economical. Maintenance costs would be low. All building materials to
be employed in connection with the proposed project are produced in Chile.
Some equipment and machinery would be imported.
5.12      Maintenance of INACAP buildings and especially of equipment is
of good standard. Maintenance funds are adequate. All sites for new
construction under the project are already owned by INACAP and are suit-
ably located.
5.13      The implementation of the project would be spread over a pe-
riod of three years, including design and preparation work as well as de-
fects and liability periods.
5.14      The amount of the loan would be $1.5 million or 50% of the es-
timated total cost of the project of $3.0 million. To meet the remaining
share of the project costs INACAP will have to provide the finance for
the equivalent of $1.5 million. This would require an increase of INACAP's
capital budget from domestic sources of up to 25% annually (at 1969 prices)
during the period of project implementation (1970-73). This heavy finan-
cial burden must be regarded as the limit of what INACAP could bear. The
operating expenditures (in 1969 prices), the increase of which would only
partly be due to the project implementation, are expected to be about
EO 100,000 when the project will be completed (1973). INACAP is not
likely to encounter difficulties in financing these expenditures through
CORFO's contributions to INACAP's budget (which amount to over 90% of
INACAP's budget and to less than 4% of CORFO's budget).
5.15      The disbursement of the proposed loan would be on the basis of
100% of the identifiable direct c.i.f. costs of imported equipment and



- 17 -
13% of the remaining cost of the project to cover the indirect foreign
exchange cost arising from the use of machinery and equipment for site
development, construction and the production of furniture. Should ex-
penditures exceed the estimated cost of $3.0 million, the excess would
be met by CORFO.
5.16      The borrower would be CORFO (see para. 2.07), which would trans-
fer the loan proceeds to INACAP on a grant basis. The Government of Chile
would guarantee the loan.
VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations assurances were obtained that:
(a) a Project Unit would be set up within INACAP under the
charge of a senior executive of INACAP (para. 5.08);
(b) a Project Architect, acceptable to the Bank, would be
appointed as member of the Project Unit (this appoint-
ment would be in addition to the staff of the existing
architectural Section of INACAP), (para. 5.08);
(c) INACAP would take appropriate steps to increase the
utilization of facilities and instructor time through:
(i) making full use of performance information on
courses by setting up a continuous courseieval-
uation procedure and by using information thus
obtained in the day-to-day decision-making
process as well as for the improvement of course
supervision (para. 2.15);
(ii) co-operating closely with enterprises with a
view to assuring greater participation of workers
in day-time training courses (para. 2.16).
The points mentioned under (a) and (b) above are conditions of effective-
ness of the proposed loan.
6.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$ 1.5 million, for a term of 25 years including a 5-year grace
period.

THF EDUCATION SYSTEM
Formal education
1.        The Minister of Education is responsible for policy, finance,
administration, curricula and supervision of public primary and secon-
dary education.  He controls curricula and examinatioas of privete
schools. However, state and private universities are autononmous. 2At'
tonomy status enables universities to establish and maintain educat'oenal
institutions below university level.
2.        in 1966 t.he National Education Reform Act was passed o-~tdiLLIng
the Government to imiplement reforms which will improve structure Lad con-
tent of primary and even more of secondary education. Major rerorm.
measures are:  (a) extension of primary education from six to elght yeara
and a corresponding reduction of secondary education from si4  to .
years,, (b) increased admission requirements for primaryt racher tcainlug
colleges and tipgrading of these colleges to post-secondary level.; tic) in-
troduction, on a pilot basis, of comprehensive secondary schools; (d) cur-
riculum reform in the remaining part of secondary education; (e) rat_ ova:L-
ization of secondary technical and agricultural schools, involving a re-
duction in numbers of schools, creation of large economic units, atid
changes of curricula towards more practical oriented pre-vocational educa-
tion. The structure of the new formal education system is shown in Annex
3.
3.        The enrollment ratio at the primary level age group is about 70%.
Enrollments from 1963-1967 and projections to 1975 are shown in Annex 4.
4.        Enrollments in secondary education amounted to about 25% o' the
age group 15-18 in 1967. The enrollment ratio is estimated to increase
to 30% by 1970 and to reach 45% by 1975. Technical education accounted
for about 30% of total secondary enrollments in 1968. An increase to 44%
by 1975 is foreseen, implying that in that year 50% of first year euroll-
ments in secondary education are expected to be in technical schools.
5.        Until now the development of secondary technical education,
comprising agricultural, industrial, commercial and home science girls
schools, has been related neither to further education nor to the labor
market in the regions of school location. Compared to general academic
secondary schools, technical schools are inadequately endowed with staff,
materials and equipment. 'rhis applies in particular to agricultural and
to industrial education and training.

ANNEX 2
Page 2
7.        Technician training is given at the universities; two of the
country's eight universities are technical universities.
8.        Higher education is mainly provided by two public and six pri-
vate universities. Each university, although almost entirely financed
by Government, is autonomous and reluctant to accept outside direction.
Central planning and coordinated action among universities does not yet
take place. The universities are engaged in organizing courses, at sec-
ondary and post-secondary level and in adult education, in industrial,
agricultural and commercial subjects and in primary teacher training,
thus duplicating the functions of other institutions.
9.        Vocational education and training in agriculture, fishery,
garment trades and technical fields is the responsibility of the Insti-
tuto Nacional de Capacitacion Profesional (INACAP). It is described in
detail in paragraphs 2.08 - 2.16 of the main report.
10.       There is no evidence of serious quantitative shortages of middle
level manpower, except in agriculture and in certain technical occupations.
A gradual increase in secondary enrollments should suffice to meet quanti-
tative labor market demands in the coming years. There is, however, much
evidence that the average school leaver is poorly prepared for entering
the labor force and that a change in the quality and orientation of sec-
ondary education is needed.
11.       Weaknesses of the general secondary schools are:
-    the course content is too academic and theoretical,
and not always relevant to the needs of the country;
-    the rigid methods of teaching fail to allow for in-
dividual differences and interests among students
and emphasize too much the importance of rote learn-
ing and memorization;
-    the system of part-time teachers makes meaningful
contact between pupil and teacher virtually impos-
sible;
-    there is a serious lack of equipment and books and
poor school facilities.
12.       As a result, many pupils become discouraged, with a consequential
high drop-out rate. Those who succeed in finishing general school have dif-
ficulties in finding suitable employment due to their lack of orientation
towards practical work. An increasing number of them applies to vocational
training centers of INACAP to obtain a marketable skill.
13.       The technical-vocational schools suffer from the same deficiencies
as the general secondary schools, with the following additional weaknesses:



ANNEX 2
Page 3
-    students are required to make career choices at an
immature age of 12 or 13 years; they enter techni-
cal training without a sufficient basis of general
education and are, in fact, denied access to higher
education;
-    a lack of financial and administrative support from
the Ministry of Education with an ensuing more
serious shortage of equipment and supplies than in
the general secondary schools.
14.       As a result, standards of technical education have deteriorated,
and an increasing number of successful school leavers attend INACAP voca-
tional training courses in order to obtain employment.
1S.       Government plans for rationalization and improvement of indus-
trial secondary schools show little evidence that the unsatisfactory si-
tuation described above will change soon. On the other hand enrollments
in technical education are expected to almost triple between 1966 and
1975. Enrollments have been planned without reference to prospective
manpower requirements which would suggest substantially lower enrollments.
Also, since the overall future long-term manpower requirements have not
been specified with respect to type and level of function to be performed
in employment, very little is known about the specific vocational train-
ing to be provided by the secondary technical schools. As a result, the
main burden of vocational preparation of post-primary and post-secondary
young people for employment in agricultural, technical and related occupa-
tions continues to fall on INACAP, and is likely to increase.

ANNEX 7
TYPES AND LEVELS OF INACAP COURSES
INACAP offers the following types of training courses:
Basic Training Courses ("Formacion") provide basic
skills to enable a person to practice a trade.
Upgrading Training Courses ("Capacitacion"), usually
offered in the evenings, raise the skill standards
of employed workers, who may have been trained by a
"Formacion" course, to that of a fully skilled work-
er.
-    Specialized Courses ("Especializacion Profesional")
provide a qualified worker with specialist skills
in some narticular aspect of his occupation.
-    Courses for secondary school graduates are a recent
development intended for those who cannot enter uni-
versity. A 15-month course trains them as middle
level technicians for specialized industrial occupa-
tion.
-    Apprentice training is being developed on modern
lines in conjunction with the Ministry of Educa-
tion, for persons between the ages of 14 and 18
during 3 years.
-    Labor Promotion Courses ("Promocion Superior de lra-
bajo") are a new program developed, with UNDP/SF
assistance, to provide general education, with a
technical bias, for persons in industry who did not
complete a formal school education. This program
will provide qualified foremen and shop floor level
technicians.
-    Instructor training courses for instructors for INACAP's
own centers, for the Mtinistry of Education and other or-
ganizations.
-    In-plant Training courses are given within enterprises,
often with the use of mobile training units for special
mobile demonstration kits, at various levels.
-    Mobile Training Courses at various levels are particu-
larly intended for training in agriculture and fishery.

ANNEX 16

DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECT ITEMS
Chilean-Swiss Center for Refrigeration and Air-ConditLoning,L Santiago
1.        To make Chile self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs and to increase
exports the Government is trying, amongst other things, to reduce food los-
ses due to inappropriate conservation (estimated at 30% to 40% of produc-
tion), to deflect meat demands from imported to local varieties (fish, mut-
ton, poultry) and to increase production of exportable fruit. A serious
obstacle is the lack of refrigeration facilities. Consequently Government
and private firns are expanding the country's system of cold-storage plants,
smaller storage units, freezer trucks, etc., for industrial, commercial and
domestic purposes. Manufacturing industries, such as textiles, are increas-
ingly using air-conditioning systems.
2.        The Ceniter will train (i) craftsmen and supervisors for the in-
stallation, maintenance and repair of refrigeration plants and equipment
and (ii) plant operators at supervisory level in the techniques of refrig-
eration as applied to food preservation.
3.        The proposed project item consists of the construction of a work-
shop building situated in Santiago (Renca), providing for up to 72 places
per year (Annex 14). An agreement has been signed between the Government
of Switzerland and INACAP under which Switzerland will supply all the equip-
ment for the training center together with the services of three experts who
will train their Chilean counterparts. The implementation of this agreement
is dependent on the provision of workshop facilities.
Garment Trades Center
4.        Chile's textile industry is preparing to build up a competitive
position, through rationalization and quality improvement. To do this la-
bor productivity has to be increased considerably. The proposed Center
will be an important step towards reaching this goal, even though the
training capacity proposed for the expanded Center is rather conservative.
While the manpower estimate indicates an annual requirement of at least
1,100 trained workers (Annex 14), the estimated total capacity of the cen-
ter, after expansion by 450 places, is 800 places per annum. This figure
includes apprentice training and basic training for workers without pre-
vious experience ("Fornmacion") as well as upgrading ("Capacitacion") and
advanced training for workers with some experience. The precise numbers
proposed for each type of course will vary from year to year.
5.        The Garment Trades Training Center is at present situated at the
INACAP center at Renca, Santiago, in inadequate premises, originally built
as storage rooms. New accommodation for an enlarged Center will be built
at the site of the Anglo-Chilean Vocational Training Center, situated in
the area of greatest concentration of garment manufacturing enterprises Jn
Santiago.  The enlargome  l wi 11 enable the center to broaden the training



ANNEX 16
Page 2
field from woven garment manufacturing to knitted garment production.  The
equipment for the extension of the Center is already available. Most of it
was purchased under the first Bank loan to INACAP.
Chilean-Danish Metallurgy Training Center, Santiago
6.        The proposed project would enlarge the Center by providing four
workshops for apprentice training in metallurgy and for training and re-
training (upgrading) courses in auto-mechanics and sheet metal and fabri-
cation work. The new buildings, together with an extension of welding
facilities and construction of offices, which are presently occupying
classrooms, will complete the center, part of which is already in opera--
tion.
7.        The center has a present annual capacity of 580 places.  After
completion the capacity will be about 1,180 trainees at various levels.
The demand for training in metallurgy in the Santiago area is estimated
to amount to 1,500 newly trained persons each year until 1975 and is
likely to increase thereafter. This figure includes the demand for
skilled and semi-skilled manpower in auto-mechanics in the Santiago area,
estimated to be at least 650 annually compared with INACAP 's present train-
ing capacity of 140 in this field. After completion of two additional cen-
ters in Santiago, including the one proposed as part of this project, the
annual capacity for auto-mechanics training will be about 500 trainees.
8.        An agreement has been signed between the Government of Denmark
and INACAP under which all equipment for the proposed center and also a
team of instructors is being provided by Denmark. Delivery of part of
the equipment is dependent on the provision of buildings.
Extension of Training Center at Renca-Santiago
9.        Two new training programs, the Labor Promotion Program and Ap-
prentice Training, will be added to those already in operation at Renca
(Santiago). Accommodation is to be provided for both programs.
10.       Under the Labor Promotion Program (see paragraphs 23-25 of this
Annex) classrooms and laboratories for 110 places, offices for the corre-
spondence course program, general office and services rooms will be loca-
ted at Renca. Altogether, places for about 840 trainees in different cen-
ters in the country will be provided annually under this program.
11.       While the apprentice training itself will take place in workshops
and classrooms of other training programs, separate facilities will have to
be provided for the administration of the entire program including prepara-
tion of courses, supervision and evaluation. These facilities are included
in the proposed project.
12.       In addition to accommodating these two new programs, INACAP's
Technical Department needs relocation. This Department is responsible



ANNEX 16
Page 3
for developing the syllabi for each course offered by INACAP. it pre-
pares and produces most of the didactical material. Furthermore, it
conducts job analyses and studies and evaluates the development of demand
for INACAP training.  It is also responsible for the training and retrain-
ing of INACAP's instructors. The activities of this department will grow
considerably as a consequence of the efforts to increase both quantity
and quality of training and to adapt the courses to labor market de-
velopments, in terms of field and level of training and in terms of
geographical location of courses. Inadequate space is adversely
affecting the efficiency of the Technical Department and additional
facilities are needed.
13.      'The Renca center is a combination of various centers which, after
completion of the project, will accommodate at least eight different pro-
grams at four to five levels each in more than 150 courses involving be-
tween 1,000 and 1,300 persons during the day (including 250 employees of
INACAP central offices, located at Renca) and 500 to 750 persons in the
evening. The utilization rate of training facilities at the Renca Center
could be increased considerably by continuous use throughout the day and
evening. Because of the distance of the Center from town, at present 20%
of the available day-time and 25% of the evening time is lost through idle
periods due to a serious lack of adequate cafeteria facilities. Also, the
Center does not have any assembly facilities needed for instruction pur-
poses, e.g., film showings. The proposed project therefore includes a
combined assembly-dining hall for 250 places. For cafeteria purposes, this
hall would be used in three shifts.
AL.ricultural Mechanics Center
14.       The Center is located in San Fernando, an agricultural area
where a wide range of agricultural machinery is used. The Center, with
22 ha. of farmland provides 3 months training courses in the operation
and maintenance of agricultural machinery for persons working on farms
or employed by agricultural enterprises. Machinery instructors for
INACAP and CORA are also trained at the Center.
15.       The Center caters for trainees from every part of Chile; there-
fore boarding facilities are necessary. At present trainees are boarded
temporarily in workshops intended for training. This restricts the capa-
city of the Center to 40 day students and 20 (non-boarding) students in
evening classes. Construction of boarding facilities will increase the
capacity of the Center to full utilization of 100 day students and 20 in
evening classes. This amounts to an annual training capacity of 400 day-
course trainees and up to 80 evening-course trainees depending on the
length of evening courses. This increase is below the estimated needs
(see Annex 14).
Mobile Units for Agricultural Training
16.        INACAP plans to expand agricultural training through the use of
mobile units. Immovable training centers would not attract sufficient



ANNEX 16
Page 4
farmers because the latter would not leave their farms unattended. Such
centers, moreover, would be expensive because lodging facilities would be
necessary. Mobile training units are more flexible and enable farmers to
carry on working. In the areas where the rural population is concentrated
INACAP wants to operate multi-purpose mobile unlits, consisting of three
motor vehicles, including one unit carrying a classroom, another with
workshop and equipment, and a third to lodge four or five instructors.
In this way, it is possible to teach several courses at one time in the
same location, and also to use the trucks to transport trainees. It is
possible to split a multi-purpose mobile training unit into several sin-
gle purpose units, thus further increasing the flexibility of the training
programs. Single purpose mobile units consisting of one truck plus caravan
will carry one instructor with equipment to operate in remote areas. All
instructors working on these units will be trained by INACAP and qualified
to teach one of the following subjects: horticulture, crop production,
agricultural machinery or animal production. Each mobile unit will be
furnished with suitable equipment.
17.       At present 35 INACAP instructors are operating in the field with
17 more being trained. Seven are already supplied with a vehiicle, but no
equipment is available. They use the equipment used on the farms which is
very often in a poor state or out of date.  Instructors should, therefore,
be supplied with good and modern equipment.
18.       The training courses provided are of 1-3 weeks duration and are
essentially practical.  They do not lead to any specific qualification.
To supplement the instruction, participants are given a set of technical
training documents.  The number of trainees varies from 8-12.  Training
follows the normal seasonal work cycles, and is being given on the farms,
in closest relation to actual needs and environment. The proposed pro-
ject would increase the total number of trainees from about 6,000 per year
in 1969 to about 10,000 in 1972. This would still be below the estimated
annual training needs of about 12,000.
19.       The proposed project would provide 15 complete new single-purpose
units, 6 complete new multi-purpose units, equipment for the 7 existing mo-
bile units, and 1 unit for supervision.
Fishery Training
20.       INACAP's 2 - 4 week fishery training courses aim at training
fishermen in the operation and routine servicing of equipment, engines,
the catch, and in carrying out overhauls. The 4,500 km. long coast line
of Chile has nearly 200 fishing ports and coves. Training will be of-
fered at fishing ports and at locations of fishing industries.  The pre-
sent fishery training program which involves 570 trainees is far too
small to have any noticeable impact in an acceptable time span. The
quality of courses is low because of severe equipment shortages, and
the timing of courses is very often unsuitable due to lack of mobile
facilities. To carry out the program properly, well-equipped mobile
units which can be sent to those locations where fishermen work (in



ANNEX 16
Page 5
fishing industries; on the vessels) are essential. Instructors are
university graduates. The proposed project would increase the train-
ing capacity by about 60% and would enhance its efficiency considerably.
21.       At present Chile's fishing fleet uses 3,000 diesel engines
amounting to a total investment of about $15 million. INDAP (Instituto
de Desarrollo Agropecuario) is providing funds for increased mechaniza-
tion and the number of engines is expected to grow. The proposed pro-
ject would increase INACAP's fishery training capacity by 360 places
per year from 570 places in 1969 to 930 in 1972. This would still be
below the estimated need of about 1,200 places annually.
22.       To train fishe rmen in the operation and maintenance of engines,
in fish processirng, diving, artisanal fishing, the project would include
(1) 6 mobile land units for training in diesel mechanics, in fish proces-
sing and preservation, in use of better diving equipment and inshore fish-
ing techniques, (ii) 1 boat for training fishermen in navigation and laying
nets,, and (Mii) 1 car for evaluation and improvement of courses and super-
vision. Each land unit would consist of 1 pick-up with equipment and one
caravan. The boat would be a 70-ton vessel with equipment and facilities
to accommodate I instructor and 2 crew members.
Labor Promotion Program
23.       With the assistance of UNDP/Special Fund and ILO as executing
agency, INACAP is developing a program which will provide further educa-
tion, with a technical bias, for workers in industry, the large majority
of whom have received no more than four years of primary schooling. Courses
will be provided in three stages, the highest of which will equip a per-
son for the work of a foreman or shop-floor technician in industry.
24.       The program consists of two parts.  The first covers a joint
INACAP-industry program in three levels: The first level course is in-
tended to advance the educational level of the participants in 1-1/2
years to the equivalent of graduation from primary school. The second
level will cover the equivalent of the first two years of secondary
school and will last for one year on a part-time basis. The first and
the second level of this part of the Program may be more an expression
of the Government's social policy than a response to labor market needs.
However, these two levels provide an essential basis for the third level.
The third level will take the participants up to an educational level
suitable for a technician. The content of this third level course will
be largely technical and will include laboratory work. These courses
would not normally lead to university entrance.
25.       The second part is an Experimental Program designed to assist
with the development of Labor Promotion Courses at the INACAP Centers in
Renca-Santiago, Concepcion, and Valparaiso. UNDP/SF with ILO as execu-
ting agency supports the implementation of this experimental program
through providing part of the equipment and a team of experts.



ANNEX 16
Page 6
26.       The equipment to be provided under the proposed project is lab-
oratory equipment for the third, technical, level of the education course,
and industrial equipment to demonstrate industrial application of labora-
tory experiments. Classrooms and laboratories for the experimental center
at Renca would also be part of the project (see paragraph 10 of this Annex).
Equipment
27.       The proposed project contains a certain amount of audio-visual
aid equipment for use in INACAP training centers, in in-plant traininig
programs, and by mobile units.  This equipment should increase consider-
ably the efficiency of training in terms both of better utilization of
instructor time and of continuous up-dating of the content of courses.
28.       The project would also include complementary equipment for the
Instructor and Foreman Training Center, which has been established with
UNDP/ILO assistance. The equipment would permit training in modern weld-
ing techniques.
29.       Additional equipment for training in carpentry and woodwork,
technical drawing, machine tools, auto-mechanics, and auto-body repair
and painting would enable an increase in already existing programs as
well as in the quality and diversification of course content. It will
in part be needed to furnish new training centers which are nearing
completion of construction.
30.       In addition to increasing the quality of training, this equip-
ment should enable an increase of training places equivalent to about
980 trainees per year.
Printing Equipment
31.       Existing printing facilities are inadequate to meet the current
needs for instructional material which cannot be readily bought, but has
to be designed, prepared and produced by INACAP for each type of course.
Present output averages 30,000 sheets of printed material each day. With-
in one or two years an output of approximately twice this amount will be
required.
32.       It is proposed to meet existing demand and the increase over the
next few years by providing, under this project, one additional press with
ancillary equipment.
Data Processing Equipment
33.       The diversity and relatively frequent change of content of INACAP
courses, the great number of inventory movements and the volume of training
materials which become quickly obsolescent put a heavy burden of data intake
and processing on INACAP. With growing trainee numbers and in order to
maintain flexibility in training programs this burden will increase. The
system of manual data accounting at present in use is too slow and too
costly to enable the necessary evaluation of data.



ANNEX 16
Page 7
34.       The data processing equipment included in the proposed project
would be used for accounting, analysis and performance evaluation of train-
ing activities, in inventory control, trainee control and follow-up, salary
and other expenditure control, demand for training assessments, planning of
operations and budgeting. Given the present volume of data movements, the
change from manual to machine operations would amount to economies of about
30% in man-hours and 40% in related recurrent expenditure. The utilization
of the equipment would be about 80% on an annual average and with one shift.
Future increases in operations could easily be absorbed. The mix of the
equipment proposed is well balanced and should serve the purpose adequately.
Trained staff is already available.
