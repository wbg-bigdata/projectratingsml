INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPIVIENT
REPORT AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO CORPORACION DE FONENTO DE LA PRODUCCION
WITH THE GUARA0TEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHILE
FOR A SECOND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $1.5 million to the
Corporaci6n de Fomento de la Producci6n (CORFO) with the guarantee of
the Republic of Chile, to assist in the financing of a Second Vocational
Training Project.
PART I. - HISTORICAL
2.        The proposed loan would be the second one for vocational
training in Chile. In 1965, the Bank made a loan of $2.75 million to
CORFO to finance the activities of its vocational training affiliate,
the Instituto Nacional de Capacitaci6n Profesional (INACAP). It was
the Bank's first education loan in Latin America and the first Bank
loan for vocational training anywhere in the world.  The project was
carried out efficiently and has now been completed, contributing to
increasing the quantity and quality of the labor force.
3.        Following a request from CORFO for additional Bank financial
assistance for expansion of INACAP's training activities, the Second
Vocational Training Project was appraised in June/July 1969 and loan
negotiations took place in W4ashington from January 26 to January 29, 1970.
The Chilean delegation was headed by Mr. Luis Velasco, Director, CORFO,
representing the Republic of Chile and CORFO, and included Mr. Agustin
Alberti, Executive Director of INACAP, and Mr. Guillermo del Campo, Tech-
nical Director of INACAP.

5.       Disbursements on the existing loans are, on the whole, proceeding
on schedule. However, difficulties were encountered in the execution of
the loans made to CORFO in 1963 for livestock development (Loan 366-CH)
and for the construction of meat and milk plants in Southern Chile
(Loan 367-CH). Initially, disbursement of the livestock loan was not
proceeding according to schedule because of organizational bottlenecks,
lack of proper credit policies and disbursement procedures. In 1966,
after a reappraisal, a Project Director was appointed, credit operations
were improved by the greater use of technical personnel in the preparation
of individual farm development plans, the disbursement procedure was
changed and a livestock fund created for making loans to farmers. With
the implementation of these measures the disbursement rate improved and
a supervision mission which inspected the project in December 1969 found
it to be progressing. The problems encountered in the implementation of
the meat and milk plants project, which led to cancellation of $1.3 mil-
lion of the original amount in 1967, have also been overcome. Construction
has now been substantially completed and the undisbursed balance reflects
the fact that final payment for equipment is not to be made under existi- -
contracts until the suppliers have placed it in fully satisfactory opera' _

6.        A supervision mission inspected the ENDESA Power Project (h79-OH1)
in December 1969 and found the construction of the major civil works and
the placement of orders to be on schedule. The disbursement rate will in-
crease sharply when civil works are completed and the generators have been
delivered and installed. In the Highway Maintenance Project (Loan 558-CH)
there has been some delay in the placement of orders for equipment, arising
out of problems encountered in the evaluation of bids. Recently procuremant
contracts have been approved for about $7 million.
7.        IFC has made nine investments in five enterprises in Chile
totalling $21.2 million.
8.        A Third Education project, covering agricultural secondary edu-
cation and primary teachers' training with a proposed Bank loan of $7 mil-
lion, has been negotiated. The loan is being presented to the Board con-
currently with this project.  A second road construction project, calling
for a Bank loan of $10.8 million has been appraised and it is expected
that the loan will be presented to the Board before the end of FY-1970.

PART III. - THE PROJECT
10.       A detailed description of the project is given in the attached
appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Second Vocational Training Pro-
ject in Chile" (PE-12a).
11.       INACAP, which has the main responsibility for providing voca-
tional training in industry and agriculture, was founded in 1966 as a
subsidiary of CORFO and operates on a non-profit basis. It obtains its
funds mainly from CORFO and is governed by a council which represents
the Ministries of Education and Labor, the Universities, representatives
of private employers and the trade unions.
12.       The proposed project will continue to improve and expand INACAP's
vocational training facilities, thus helping to increase the supply of
trained agricultural and industrial workers at lower and middle levels, of
which there is still a shortage.
13.       The proposed project includes the (a) acquisition of twenty-two
mobile units for agricultural training and seven mobile units and a boat
for fishery training; (b) the construction of seven new buildings (com-
prising workshops, classrooms, laboratories, and related facilities) for
training of agricultural mechanics, automobile mechanics, sheetmetal
workers, refrigeration and air-conditioning technicians and garment
workers; and (c) acquisition of equipment for existing training programs.
14.       It is estimated that between 1970 and 1975 61,000 new entrants
to the labor market and 56,000 persons already in employment might benefit
from vocational training or retraining annually. The present training
capacity of INACAP is 30,COO trainees a year, only about 25 percent of
annual requirement. The proposed project is designed to increase INACAP's
annual training capacity from 30,000 to about 38,000 trainees, an expansion
compatible with the entity's technical and financial capabilities. In
addition to this, places for another 2,500 trainees annually will be pro-
vided by a training center for metallurgy and electrical trades which is
jointly financed by INACAP and the governments of France and Germany.
15.       The implementation of the project will take three years.  INACAP
will establish a Project Unit headed by a Project Director to coordinate,
administer and supervise execution. A Project Architect, acceptable to
the Bank will be appointed to the Project Unit to coordinate, supervise,
and approve the architectural work and contract awards for construction.
Contracts for civil works and for furniture and equipment will be let on
the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bankts procedures; local suppliers of furniture and equipment will be
accorded a 15 percent preference.



- 5 -
16.       The total estimated cost of the project is $3.0 million, in-
cluding contingencies, of which 56 percent will be for construction and
about 44 percent for equipment and furniture. The construction cost
estimates are based on recent experience in similar projects of INACAP
and the Sociedad Constructora de Establecimientos Educacionales (SCEE) -
the Government entity responsible for design and supervision of Gov-
ernment school buildings. Estimates of equipment costs are realistic and
assume adequate provision for the various items, including spare parts.
The proposed $1.5 million loan will cover 50 percent of the estimated
total cost of the project. This is equivalent to the foreign exchange
cost, including not only the cost of imported equipment but the estimated
foreign exchange component of domestically produced furniture and of site
development and construction.
PART IV. - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
17.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Corporaci6n de
Fomento de la Produccion (CORFO), the draft Guarantee Agreement between
the Republic of Chile and the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between
the Barnk and the Instituto Nacional de Capacitaci6n Profesional (INACAP),
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement and the draft Resolution approving the proposed
Loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
18.       The draft Loan documents conform substantially to the documents
used for Loan No. 431-CH and for education projects in general.
PART V. - THE ECONOMY
19.       An Economic Report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects
of Chile" (WH-186) was distributed to the Executive Directors in September
1968.  An Economic memorandum based on the preliminary findings of the
recent Economic Mission to Chile is attached to this report together
with basic data on the economy.
PART VI. - CO.MPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEIENT
20.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII. - RECOD4MEDATION
21.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN CHILE
1.        A report on the "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of
Chile" was presented to the Executive Directors on August 28, 1968. It
concluded that, certain short-term problems--such as the drought which
began in 1967--notwithstanding, longer term prospects for economic growth
were good, largely because of the copper production expansion program anid
other investments then under way. The report identified the following
policy issues as being particularly relevant to continued Chilean credit-
worthiness: continued implementation of a flexible exchange rate policy;
control of short and medium-term external borrowing; restraint of public
and private sector wage adjustments; generation of an adequate level of
public savings; and, provision of adequate price incentives to entre-
preneurs, particularly in agriculture.
2.        A Bank Economic Mission which visited Chile in November-December
1969 and is now preparing its report found that while these conclusions
continue to be broadly valid, certain developments have improved the
balance of payments outlook considerably. At the same time the short-
term fiscal and stabilization prospects were adversely affected by other
domestic developments.
3.        The negotiation of an agreement with Anaconda whereby that
company's principal mining enterprises in Chile can be expected to be
completely owned by the Government as early as 1973, the imposition in
1967 of new taxes on copper company profits accruing from world prices in
excess of US$0.40/lb, the acceleration of the copper production expansion
program and the relatively favorable medium-term outlook for copper prices
have transformed Chile's balance of payments situation. Whereas the
country formerly tended to register large deficits on current account, the
higher copper earnings now in prospect together with reduced profit remit-
tances by the copper companies imply that current account surpluses may be
expected over the next several years. In these circumstances, controls
over imports are being liberalized to facilitate containment of infla-
tionary pressures. More importantly, import liberalization can be regarded
as necessary in the longer run to utilize the expanded exchange earnings
for developmental purposes. One important facet of such a policy will be
the promotion of greater efficiency on the part of excessively protected
local industry. In fact, the Government has already expanded its list of
permitted imports substantially and has announced its intention to review
tariff levels and take other liberalizing measures consonant with abandon-
ment of the past single-minded concentration on an import substitution
strategy.
4.        Inflation--as measured by the wholesale price index--has
accelerated from its recent low point of about 17 percent in 1966 to
33 percent in 1968 and to 37 percent in 1969. It is principally the result
of wage increases which--in real terms--have averaged about 16 percent
annually since 1965.  The Frei Government, which took office in late 196/,



- 2 -
had as one of its major policy goals the redistribution of income in favor
of labor and the increased participation of the workers in economic
decision making through more complete unionization of the labor force.
While real wage increases effected during the early years of the Frei
Government may be said to have been deliberate, those of the past two or
three years rather reflect the difficulties of reconciling stabilization
objectives with free collective bargaining and reasonably full employment.
For 1970 the wage situation is complicated by the fact that the Govern-
ment was forced to concede a massive increase of some 145 percent in
military salaries. Nevertheless, the Government for the first time
succeeded in negotiating an agreement with the Labor Union Confederation
whereby civil service wages and wages of private sector workers not
covered by collective bargaining arrangements are increased by only 28
percent. Assuming that wage increases negotiated through collective
bargaining can be held near that level and taking account of the import
liberalization mentioned above, the Government anticipates inflation of
35-40 percent in 1970, not substantially different from that of 1969.

5.        While public sector investment increased at an annual average
rate of 9.6 percent annually in real terms over the 1964-69 period, the
current account surplus of the sector increased even more rapidly. Public
sector savings financed 81 percent of public sector investment in 1969 as
compared to 63 percent in 1964. Dependency on net external borrowing to
finance public sector investment has declined sharply, accounting for
10 percent of total financing in 1969 as compared to 25 percent in 1964.
The balance of required finance has come from loan repayments and other
capital income of the public sector, and until the last two years from
the banking system. In 1968 and 1969 the monetary impact of public sector
operations has been contractionary. The improvement in public sector
savings has been primarily a function of increases in Central Government
tax revenues from 14.6 percent of GDP in 1964 to 20.3 percent in 1969.
Of the total increase in tax collections, taxes on the copper sector,



which in 1964 yielded 14 percent of all tax receipts, accounted for 20
percent.

6.        Chilean GDP (at market prices) is estimated to have grown by
3.5 percent in real terms in 1969 despite a 4.0 percent decline in agri-
cultural output resulting from the drought. This followedtwo relatively
poor years in which GDP increased at an average rate of 2.5 percent
annually. In 1970, GDP can be expected to increase by 6 or 7 percent as
agricultural output recovers from the drought and massive investments in
copper, steel and petrochemicals production begin to have their effect.
Through 1975 the investment programs already under way together with new
investments now in prospect can be expected to yield annual growth rates
of 6 percent or better. Growth of this magnitude should allow for quite
tangible improvements in living standards; population growth is currently
estimated at about 1.9 percent annually, having been around 2.1 percent
in the sixties. This decline in the demographic growth rate, while
reflecting widespread changes in attitude towards family planning, may
also be in part a result of the impact of Chile's "abortion control"
program on fertility rates; under this program at present some 200,000
women regularly avail themselves of birth control facilities provided
by the national health service.

7.        With regard to agriculture, the Frei Government's main
objectives have been: (a) to help the landless population and the sub-
marginal farmers through a land reform which would include the redist-
ribution of land and the provision of services to enable the recipients
to use the land productively, and (b) to stimulate agricultural output
by improving the terms of trade of agriculture generally. After over-
coming the strong Congressional resistance to land reform in the first
two years, a sizable program got under way in 1967 and by the end of the
current year some 26,000 families are expected to have received land
under the program which will then affect about 30 percent of Chile's
irrigated land. The program is still too new to be judged in detail
regarding its impact on output and efficiency; it is important to note,
however, that poorly exploited properties were the first ones to be
affected by the reform.
8.        The Government was successful is raising agricultural prices
more than the general wholesale price index. However, owing to the
massive wage increases of 1965 and 1966, agricultural costs rose even
more, so that production incentives may well have deteriorated until
1968. Some of the losses seem to have been recovered in 1969 and the
Government hopes to make further progress in this respect in 1970.

9.        Manufacturing output in the sixties has risen at an annual
rate of about 6.2 percent while employment in the sector has increased
by about 4 percent annually. Over the next few years the growth of
manufacturing output may be expected to accelerate somewhat owing to
heavy recent investments in certain sub-sectors such as petrochemicals
and steel, and to increasing internal and external demand. The relative
lag of industrial employment growth reflects not only the industrial
composition of recent investments but seems also, in part, to be a
consequence of the increasingly burdensome social security charges and
of the labor legislation which makes the dismissal of redundant labor
cumbersome and expensive. Both factors often seem to induce employers
to adopt the most labor-saving techniques possible.
10.       Past industrial development took place behind high protective
barriers which in many cases operated in a rather haphazard manner,
leading to some quite inefficient productive units. The present more
favorable balance of payments outlook will permit the Government not
only to liberalize imports generally but also to move toward a more
rational protective system. It has already taken some steps in this
direction; during 1969 the number of import commodities subject to the
prohibitive (10,000 percent) advance deposit was reduced by two-thirds
and the list of permitted imports was expanded substantially in
January 1970. Moreover, an interdepartmental task force is reviewing
the tariff structure with a view to reducing extreme disparities in
rates.
11.       In 1969 Chile substantially improved its net foreign reserve
position. With copper prices averaging approximately US$0.65/lb. FOB
as against US$0.53 in 1968 and US$0.30 during 1960-64, exports in 1969



- 6 -
exceeded those for 1968 by 23 percent and the average level of the first
half of the decade by 122 percent. Despite an 11 percent increase in
imports, largely due to the importation of capital goods in connection
with the copper expansion program, Chile registered a current account
deficit of only US$35.6 million in 1969 compared to a deficit of US$146
million in 1968. As in 1968, the net inflow of long and medium-term
loans amounted to about US$200 million. The resulting 1969 balance of
payments surplus of about US$211 million increased Chilets net foreign
reserves to a level of US$284 million or the equivalent of more than
three months' imports. For 1969 the ratio of service on public and publicly
guaranteed debt to goods and non-factor services earnings net of copper
company remittances is provisionally estimated at 19 percent. Reflecting
the operation of new machinery created to control the contracting of
external debt by decentralized public sector entities, Chile was able to
stay within the limits on new short and medium-term external debt
contained in the IMF Standby Agreement of April 1969.
12.       Chile has continued to implement its flexible exchange rate
policy in a satisfactory manner. The exchange rate was moved in bi-
weekly adjustments throughout 1969 by about 29 percent; almost exactly
in proportion to the movement registered by the cost of living index
but about 8 percentage points less than the movement registered by the
wholesale price index. During the 1967-68 period real currency
depreciation had amounted to about 10 percent as measured by the whole-
sale price index. Minor or non-minerals exports increased by 6.3 per-
cent in 1969 and by 15.6 percent in 1968. Minor exports benefited
greatly from a system of drawbacks adopted in 1967 which subsidizes
local exporters up to a maximum 30 percent of their costs provided
they can show such subsidization is necessary to meet foreign competi-
tion. In 1968, such subsidies averaged 22 percent of the value of the
principal products benefited.
13.       Over the next few years--as noted above--Chile's balance of
payments situation may be expected to change radically. Despite some
decline in copper prices--to an estimated US$0.55/lb.--the 33 percent
increase in Chilean copper output anticipated during 1970-71 as the
result of completion of the copper expansion program, together with a
sharp decline in payments to foreign copper companies attributable to
the copper "Chileanization" arrangements, are likely to produce sur-
pluses on current account even with rapid import liberalization. The
increase in the absolute magnitude of amortization payments which can
be anticipated as the result of external financing of recent invest-
ment programs and of the new copper arrangements will not be sufficient
to offset this marked improvement on current account. For 1970, for
example--when amortization payments to both Kennecott and Anaconda
on account of the purchase of 51 percent of their principal properties
in Chile in 1967 and 1969, respectively, will commence--the debt
service ratio is estimated at 19 percent, about the same as in 1969.
14.       The prospective role of external borrowing in Chile in the
future is thus likely to be somewhat different from the past when



the net transfer of resources to supplement domestic savings was a key
element. For some time to come it will still be important for the
authorities to continue to build up reserves to levels which will exceed
minimum safety margins. Given the past record of extreme volatiiity of
copper prices, safe reserve levels in Chile would be substantially higher
than in many other developing countries. Moreover, given the importance
of import liberalization to improve the efficiency of the economy, there
is merit in the Government's view that reserves should be high enough to
allay any reasonable fears of balance of payments difficulties associated
with meaningful liberalization. Another facet of external borrowing in
the next few years will be to 4mprove the structure of the existing debt,
i.e. to continue the improvements in debt management policy that were
initiated in 1969. This is a logical complement of the policy to build
up reserves and acquires special importance to Chile for the same
reason, namely the large fluctuations of world copper prices.
15.       The management of the Chilean economy in 1970 will undoubtedly
be affected by the presidential elections scheduled for 1970. Although
the process of transferring power in one of the most democratic environ-
ments of the hemisphere imparts considerable uncertainty to the outlook
for the economy, the basic elements underlying this outlook are favor-
able.  Success in realizing the medium-term potential for rapid growth
within a framework of gradually improving price stability which does
exist is, however, dependent on:
(a) Reconciliation of wage policy with other economic
and social goals;
(b) Rationalization of pricing policies;
(c) Effective import liberalization;
(d) Appropriate credit policy; and
(e) Continued attention to the adequacy of the
exchange rate so as to ensure that it does not
become a barrier to the expansion of non-copper
exports.
16.       Assuming that performance in regard to these policy elements
is reasonable and that the contracting of external indebtedness
continues to be controlled, Chile should continue to be creditworthy
for borrowing on conventional terms.
