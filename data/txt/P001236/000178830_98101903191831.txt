REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPIBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A FOURTH HIGWeiAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Kenya for the equivalent of US$22.0 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance a Fourth Highway Project.
PART I - THE ECONON7
2.        Since gaining Independence at the end of 1963, Kenya has made
a good start in bringing a better standard of life to its population
and has gone a long way towards establishing the administrative and
infrastructural base for future economic development. This good growth
performance has been made possible by sound and pragmatic economic manage-
ment, which successfully built on to the economy inherited from the
colonial period, and by policies and attitudes that have encouraged a high
level of private investment and external assistance. Kenya has continued
as a strong supporter of the East African Community, particularly during
its recent period of stress.
3.        A Bank economic mission visited Kenya recently to review progress
made under the current development plan which c wers the financial years
1970 through 1974. The report of the mission is expected to be distributed
in February 1972 (country data are given in Annex II). In current terms
GDP has been increasing at an average rate of 7.8 percent a year since 1964,
which, since price increases have been fairly modest, is equivalent to a
growth rate of 6.7 percent in real terms. This rapid growth in production
has increased the average per capita income from $107 in 1964 to about $140
in 1970, which is near the median for Africa as a whole. Thus real income
has probably grown about twice as fast as population since Independence,
even though the rate of population growth (3.3 percent) in Kenya is one of
the highest in the world.
4.        There have been no fundamental changes in Kenya's development
philosophy since Independence; in fact the evolution of economic policy since
1964, as set out in the national development plans which have been published,
should rather be seen as a development of the basic philosophies laid down
in the original Government policy statement, "African Socialism and its
Application to Planning in Kenya".  The current 1970-74 Plan, which was pub-
lished towards the end of 1969, restates the Government's basic objectives



- 2 -
of maintaining rapid but broadly-based economic growth and providing al.
the country's citizens with rising incomes and reasonable facilities.
In addition, the Plan focused particularly on the scope for accelerated
development of the rural areas, on the urgency of expanding employment
opportunities, and on the need to achieve a more equal dis-tribution of
income. Since the Plan was published, the Government has started to move
cautiously towards greater direct participation in certain key sectors ot
the economy. by purchasing a shareholding in several private comrpanies,
notably in the power, oil refining and banking sectors.
5.        In terms of overall growth, the target growth rates set by trhe
Plan have so far largely been realized although the effects of a prolonged
drought have set back development in 1971. GDP increased by about 6&
percent in real terms in 1969 and 1970, compared with a target growth
rate of 6.8 percent in the Plan. Investment, after only a modest increase
in 1969, increased by nearly a quarter in 1970 to a record level of nearly
MOO million. Development in the first phase of the Plan has so far been
fairly broadly-based, although construction and manufacturing have been
particularly important as growth points in the economy.
6.        Government expenditure during the first three years of the Plan
is also growing at a faster rate than planned, especially the development
budget which has been boosted by an average of 30 percent a year during
the Plan period.  Some of this increase has been due to the purchase of
shares in private companies referred to above (paragraph 4). This deci-
sion to take a substantial, though not necessarily major, shareholding
in a few major undertakings of strategic economic importance was not
provided for in the Plan. 1joreover, the decision to acquire these shares
by purchases on the open market or by direct negotiation with the private
companies, while reinforcing investor confidence in Kenya, has had effects
on both the budget and the balance of payments in 1970 and 1971. But even
if these transfer payments are eliminated from public sector expenditure,
it is evident that the Government is pushing ahead with development faster
than expected. This acceleration in expenditure is reflected in a budget
which has now to rely more heavily on raising loan capital in the domestic
market since neither the recurrent surplus nor external aid has kept up
with the rate of growth in expenditure.
7.        The rapid rate of development of the economy as a whole has
also brought about a much tighter balance of payments position in 1971.
W1hile the emergence of a balance of payments constraint by 1974 was fore-
seen in the Plan, the very rapid increase in imports needed to sustain
the pace of development has brought it on sooner than expected. After
a number of years of balance of payment surpluses and growing reserves,
this new and rather sudden development will require some changes in the
orientation of economic management, particularly in regard to the fostering
of export industries and the need to attract additional amounts of external



- 3-
financial assistance to cover the deficit on current account. The emer-
gence of the first real constraints on the balance of payments, as wiell
as on the Government budget, is a significant development, but not, as
stated ear'ier, an unexpected one. In fact these constraints are in
large measure the natural consequence of the country's success in pushing
development nearer to the limits of its resource base than it has in
the past. They also indicate very clearly that Kenya will have to attract
a substantially higher level of external assistance if the present fast
pace of development is not to be curtailed.
8.        While the overall rate of growth of the Kenya economy has been
very good, certain aspects of Kenya's economic development in recent
years - especially in regard to the allocation of resources and the
distribution of benefits among its people - have not been entirely
satisfactory. The general allocation of resources in Kenya's development
planning is very largely in conformity with the economic priorities of
the country, but, as past Bank reports have suggested, there is the risk
of some imbalances emerging. The agricultural sector, for example, has
tended to receive a diminishing allocation of public expenditure and
investment funds since the end of the major land transfer and settlement
programs after Independence, even though the continued groiwth of incomes,
em,ployment and exports will depend critically on the pace of agricultural
development, as will the success of any program of rural development0  To
a large extent this apparent imbalance reflects the necessary emphasis
there has been on providing the infrastructural facilities - roaos,
harbors, power and wqater supplies - which were required before any devel-
opment could take place.  It also reflects the strongly-felt social and
political need to improve social services, particularly education, to a
people Who had few of these services before.  However, some re-ordering
of priorities may be called for in subsequent reviews of the Plon, if
the productive sectors are to be given sufficient resources to stimulate
a high rate of future growth.
9.        Perhaps the least satisfactory aspect of Kenyals past economic
growth has been the manner in which the incremental benefits have been
distributed amongst the population. Many people in Kenya have gained
very considerably since Independence, particularly those who have beezi
able to beneiit from education and training under the Kenyanization
program, the urban wage earners, and many thousands of African farmers
Who have had their way of life transformed through the successful intro-
duction of profitable cash crops. Many other people, however, particuiar2y
in the lower strata of income, have benefitted much less.  The difficulty
in distributing economic gain in some equitable way is seen in its most
serious form in the increasing unemployment problem. Wage employment
has not increased at all since 1964 in the large-scale private sector,
and the rapidly increasing labor force has had to seek work in the relatIvely
small public sector or in the increasingly important small-farm and small-
business sector, or find self-employment on the land or in the towns.
The hardcore of the unemployment problem is among the school leavers,



- 4 -
particularly the primary school graduates, who are being thrown onto the
labor market at the rate of about 100,000 a year and are generally ill-
equipped to secure the few jobs that are available and unsuitable either
by age or orientation to return to work on the land.
10.       The Government is well aware of these problems and is continuing
to seek solutions. The present plan contains an enterprising experiment
in rural development which the Covernment now hopes to extend gradually
to all rural areas, and there is now a growing concern for accelerating
agricultural development and the first signs that the agricultural sector
is getting an increased allocation of resources. Government's greatestu
concern, however, is probably now being centered on the problem of un-
employment, and particu'larly the need to find productive work for a labor
force which is growing at 3.4 percent a year.
11.       Kenya's immediate economic dilemma will be to decide how to
allocate more resources to certain key sectors of the economy, while
not disrupting the continuation of existing programs, in the context of
emerging financial and foreign exchange constraints. There is clearly
no easy solution to this problem. There will, however, be a higher
priority for projects to be prepared in agriculture and other export-
oriented industries in a form that will be suitable for external financing.
It is estimated that if the past rate of develcpment continues, Kenya's
resacrce gap will continue to grow rather quickly during the remainder
of the Plan period, and that an increased flow of external capital will
therefore be required to cover the balance of paymernts.
12.       Kenya's external public debt is not unduly large ($284 million
or $342 million if a notional one-third share of the East African Community
debt is included), and her debt service ratio (6% in 1970, including
her share of EAC debt) does not represent a large burden on her foreign
exchange earnings. However, a substantial proportion of the past external
aid flowing to Kenya has been on relatively hard terms, especially if
account is taken of the increasing flow of pirivate investment in recent
years. There is therefore a need for a softer blend of aid if the burden
of servicing debt is not to grow too quickly, particularly as Kenya's
external assistance requirements continue to grow.
13.       In view of the serious constraint on the amount of IDA funds
that could be made available to Kenya, the blend of Bank Group lending
to Kenya through FY71 has been relatively hard, writh over half of total
commitments being in the form of Banlk loans. If Kenya's notional share
of Bank lending to the EAC corporations is taken into account the blend
of total Bank Group lending to Kenya becomes even harder; 67 percent Bank
and 33 percent IDA. It is hoped to soften this blend in the future.
14.       The Consultative Group for East Africa met to discuss Kenya's
economic prospects in February 1970 and is scheduled to meet again in
April 1972. The Bank economic report which is now under preparation and
a detailed project list bein; prepared by the Government will provide the
basis for discussions.



PART II - BANK GROUP LENDING TO KENYX
15.       Beginning with a Bank loan for agriculture and roads in 1960,
Kenya has to date received a total of six Bank loans and eleven IDA
credits amounting to $127.3 million.  In addition, Kenya has been a
beneficiaray of six loans totalling $162.8 million which have been extended
for the development of common services (railways, harbors and telecom-
munications) operated on a regional basis for the three partner states
of the East African Community (EAC). Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Summary
statements of Bank loans/IDA credits to Kenya and the EAC common services
organizations are in Annex I.
16.       About 50 percent of direct lending to Kenya has so far been
for the improvement of the road network, particularly feeder and rural
access roads. The proposed credit, which woild form part of a Joint
financing arrangement with Sweden, would be the eighth Bank Group opera-
tion wholly or in part concerned wsith road construction. The previous
seven loans and credits in this sector, of which five have been fully
disbursed, total $65.2 million, and have brought benefits to the agri-
cultural sector, tourism and the general economy.  Other sectors which
have received Bank Group support have been agriculture and forestry,
education, water supply, power and telecommunications.
17.       In close cooperation with the Bank, the Government of Kenya
is identifying and preparing projects for the productive sectors, parti-
cularly agriculture, for our future assistance. A project for the
development of Nairobi Airport has recently been appraised. A second
phase smallholder agricultural credit project, prepared with Bank Group
help, is under active consideration. Projects for tourism and a devel-
opment finance company are being prepared with our assistance. In
addition, assistance to the East African Development Bank, an EAC
institution serving Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda is under active considera-
tion and the EAC common services organizations for railways, harbor and
telecommunications are preparing further programs for the development of
their respective facilities for which Bank assistance is expected to
be sought.
18.       Although there have been delays in the execution of some Bank
and IDA financed projects in Kenya, particularly in the agricultural
sector, performance continues to be generally satisfactory.  In my Report
and Recommendation on the loan to Tana River Development Company Limited
(No. P-946 of May 19, 1971) I had reported that the Smallholder Agri-
cultural Credit Project (Credit No. 105 KE), which had experienced serious
delays due to problems in recruiting and retaining satisfactory management
and staff, had recorded marked improvement and that the bulk of the
funds provided under the credit had in fact been committed and the
corresponding disbursements were expected to be completed about eighteen
months later than the appraisal estimates. A subsequent supervision



-6-
mission confirmed that the momentum is being maintained.   To malke fI,'1
use of the credit the Government requested a postponement of the Closing
Date, to which we agreed. Indeed, we are now actively considering
proposals for a Phase II project which would continue and expand on the
developments initiated under the ongoing project.
19.       Under the Livestock Development Project (Credit No. 129 ICE)
the development of the livestock movement and marketing facilities and
the survey and development of range water facilities is proceeding
satisfactorily. The loaning of funds for the development of ranching
enterprises has shown improvement; in fact commitment of funds for
development of individual ranching enterprises has now reached targets
established at the time of appraisal.  However, overall progress on this
component of the project is still slow, partly due to the lower than
expected demand for credit for development of company and commercial
ranches. It is our present expectation that all funds provided under
the project iwill be committed by early 1973 and that the corresponding
disbursements will then be completed about 24 months later than initially
estimated. The project continues to be closely supervised. In respect
of the Second Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA) Project (Credit
No. 119 KE) no disbursements have yet been made.   KTDA's operations continrue
to gnnerate surpluses which enable it to finance an accelerated planting
program without resorting to the funds provided under the credit. VIhile
the financial forecasts indicate a need to draw on the credit next year,
there are likely to be considerable savings under this credit.
20.       The IFC's largest investment ($12.9 million) in Kenya is in
the Panafrican Paper l-ills Ltd., a 45,000 ton/year integrated paper
mill which currently is under construction. The Corporation also has
a $3.2 million investment in Kenya Hotel Property Co. Ltd. and has
recently approved a loan of $2.4 million to Tourist Promotion Services
(Kenya) Ltd. which will construct and operate lodges and hotels in Kenya.
PART III - THE PROJECT
The Transport Sector
General
21.       The transport sector (including Kenya's share of common services)
accounts for about 8.5 percent of GDP and is expected to absorb about
20 percent of the projected investments under the current Development
Plan (1970-1974). In addition, the Government's road construction is
expected to contribute about 6 percent of the total fixed capital formation



- 7 -
during the Plan period or about 16 percent of the public sector invest-
ment. The heaviest concentration of inland transport facilities and
traffic is on the 1,000-km route from the port of Mombasa to Kenya's
western border with Uganda, passing through Nairobi and the populous
southwestern area of the country. The route is served by the road,
rail and air services.
22.       For imports and exports through Yombasa, and indeed for other
long-distance bulk movements, the railway is the most important carrier,
providina the principal outlet to the sea for both Kenya and Uganda.
The main railway line from Uganda to oiombasa, together with subsidiary
lines feeding into it, accounts for some 1,600 km of the total 6,ooo km
system of the East African Railways Corporation (EARC) which is jointly
owned by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Kenya accounts for 60 percent of
the total annual traffic (of about 12 million tons) handled by the EARC.
The Bank has made three loans for railway improvements in East Africa.
23.       Kenya's road network is made ur of approximately 22,500 km of
trunk, primary and secondary roads, 19,C00 km of minor roads and 2,700 km
of special purpose roads such as those serving tourist, tea collection,
and sugar areas. Although the length of paved roads has tripled in the
last c'ecade, totalling about 3,000 km ir 1971, almost half of the network
consists of unimproved roads or tracks, and many of the gravel and earth
roads serving key agricultural and tourist areas do not provide all
weather service.
24.       Kenya's principal harbor is at 1ombasa.   It has 15 deep-water
quays plus lighterage facilities. A new wharf which has recently been
completed and two new berths together with bulk handling facilities are
presently being constructed by the East African Harbours Corporation
as part of a Bank financed Project (Loan No. 638 EA).   These additional
facilities are expected to ease the congestion presently prevailing in
the port.
25.       Kenya is served by a large number of international airlinas
and the East African Airways Corporation (EAAC) which is owned equally
by Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. in addition to EAAC, a number of smaller
private carriers operate charter services in Kenya, as elsewihere in East
Africa. The two principal airports are the Embakasi Airport at Nairovi
and the Airport at Mombasa.  The Ihbakasi runway can handle all modern
aircraft that are in commercial use.  However, inadequate taxi-way,
terminal and cargo handling facilities are the cause of increasing con-
gestion and delays. A project to improve and partly reconstruct these
facilities has recently been appraised by the Bank.
26.       The difficulties of transport coordination have been mostu
evident in the area of road-rail compe-tition.  The development of the
economy has been heavily dependent on the railway and, from an early
stage, a policy of encouraging agricultural production for export by



- 8 -
means of a differential rail tariff based on the value rather than the
transport cost of shipments was followed. In order to protect this
tariff structure against the effects of road competition, strict quan-
titative and operational restrictions were imposed on road transport.
A study to assist the three partner states in formulating sound regula-
tory, investment and pricing policies for all surface modes of transport
in the three countries was completed in 1969.   The study contained a
number of recommendations designed to ensure future viability of EARC
and the economic use of resources in the transport sector in East Africa.
During negotiations for the Third Railway Project (Loan No. 674 EA) the
transport questions facing East Africa were discussed in the light of
the study's findings, and agreement was reached on measures to improve
transport policy and operating practices in the region. The most im-
portant of these measures are aimed at evolving a commercially viable
cost-based tariff and rate structure for EARC which would secure the
competitive position of the railways and ensure that no unecono,mic
transfer of traffic from rail to road transport takes place. The tariff
structure is now under review and when the revision is completed the
Governments will cease to protect the railways from road competition.
Iig hways
27.       The current Development Plan (1970-74) allocates KSh 860 inillion
($120 million) for capital investment in roads; actual expenditures are
expected to exceed this figure. Around 65 percent of the investment in
this sector is expected to be financed externally; about two thirds by
the Bank Group.  The Plan itself marks an important policy shift in
respect of highway development in Kenya and enunciates a strategy calling
for (a) shift of emphasis towards rural roads which are to be an integral
part of comprehensive rural development programs; (b) restricted and
highly selective future investments in new trunk roads; (c) adoption of
minimum acceptable road design standards and stage construction; and
(d) provision of increased resources for the maintenance of the existing
highway network.
28.       In line with this strategy, Kenya, like many other developing
countries, fol'lows the policy of stage construction under wThich the
geometric standards are such that the road is built as economical'ly as
possible on its permanent alignment and the pavement is designed to meet
the traffic needs for the years immediately ahead. As traffic increases,
local improvements in difficult areas may be made and the pavement
structure strengthened by successive increases in thickness. Thus under
stage construction, a road is improved as traffic grows without the
necessity of substantial reconstruction and loss of earlier investments.
29.       The M1nistry of Works (i4OW) is principally responsible for
the administration, construction and maintenance of Kenya's roads althoug
a large number of local authorities exercise certain functions. The
Ministry of Power and Communications is responsible for regulating the



- 9 -
road transport industry.  In 1970 the Ministry of W-3orks was considerably
reorganized in consultation with the Association; some previously ovper-
lapping executive functions were eliminated and its maintenance organi-
zation was strengthened. Most road engineering is presently carried out
by consultants.  However, more Kenyan graduate engineers are becoming
available and this, together with the strengthening of MOW staff by 27
engineers and field superintendents provided under the Highwayr Maiyitenance
Project (Credit No. 224 KE) is expected to result in the MSW being able
to carry out an increasing amount of such work without recourse to con-
sulting services.
30.       Highway construction is carried out, for the most part, by
contract. The contracting industry in Kenya has grown in recent years,
and major works have been awarded both to large local firms and to foreign
firms with branches in Kenya. Smaller works have been awarded to local
contractors. For non-contract work, the HOW utilizes its own construction
units, some of which are staffed by labor from the National Youth Service
(NYS) created to provide training and employment for youths who lhave
left school. These units which have carried out a considerable amount
of work in the past, have suffered from many of the defects frequently
met in departmental work, such as a lack of realistic costing and a
lower standard of worknanship than that normally required of contractors.
However, recent measures taken by the iMiOW have improved the operation
of these units.
31.       The progressive increase in the size of vehicles in recent
years and lax enforcement of weight regulations have resulted in axle
loadings in excess of those for which the roads were designed and con-
sequent fai'lure of important sections of certain trunk roads.  The MOW
and the Kenya Police have drawn up a long-term plan for establishing
an effective highway traffic law enforcement agency. This plan, which
is now under revision, calls for the construction of permanent weighing
stations at strategic points in the road netwcrk and the establishment
of special highway patrols to facilitate the enforcement of the regulations,
The Prolect
32.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Fourth Highway- Project in
Kenya" (No. PTR-92a. dated December 6, 1971) is .vailable separately.   A
Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
33.       The project was appraised in the field in March 1971.   Nego-
-tiations for the proposed IDA Credit and the Swedish Credit were held in
Washington in October 1971. The Kenya Government was represented by:
Mr. P. Shiyukah, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works; Mr. S. Mougua,
Ehgineer-in-Chief, Ministry of Works; Mr. N.P. Radier, Chief Engineer
(Roads), Ministry of Works; Mr. G.P. Manners, Chief Engineer (Roads)
(Supernumerary), Ministry of Vbrks; and Mr. A.L. arap Ngeny, Under
Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning.  Ihe Swedish International



- 10 -
Development Authority (SIDA) was represeiated by:  M.r S Ohlund, Depaty
Director, Department of Financial Assistance; 3'.r. U. Rundin, Africa
Division; it. B. Nvothander, Legal Adviser; and Pr. B. Oden, Economist,
34.       The project comprises:
(a)  construction, reconstruction or improvement of
(i)    five fee(der roads totalling 158 In.;
(ii)   995 km of tea collection roads;
(iii)  429 km of access roads in settleinent areas; and
(iv)   three trumk roads sections totalling 71 km;
(b)  construction and equipping of two vehicle weighing
stations; and
(c)  retention of consultants for conpletion of engineering
and supervision of construction as required.
35.       The project which is in line with the policies enunciated for
this sector in the cuxrrent development plan, described in paragraph 27
above, reflects both the increased emphasis on building roads required
to promote or support specific developments in the agricultural sector
and the intention that investments in major trnLnk roads should be highly
selective and restricted to specific growth points. Many of the feeder
and trunk roads included in the proposed project are either exteinsions
of roads constructed under past projects, or a further step in the program
of stage construction (paragraph 28 above'.  The feeder roads Till link
rich agricultural areas with the trunk road network; the tea roads form
part of a long-term tea developraent prograTn started in the late 1950's
and partly financed under the Tea Roads Project (Credit No. 77 KE),
approved in 1965; the settlement roads will ensure all weather accsss to
factories and markets for smallholders in the selected areas which is
essential if schemes to encourage such farmers to produce perishables,
particularly milk, are to succeed.
36.       The main economic benefits of the project wrould be the increased
rate of agricultural development induced by the improved infrastlructure
and benefits accruing to the economy as a result of lower vehicle operating
costs. The estimated economic rate of return on the project as a whole
is 19 percent.
37.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$h2 million
equivalent, The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$28 million
(67 percent), Sweden will provide a credit of SKr 31 million (which is
a little in excess of US$6 million at current exchange rates) on standard
IDA terms. The proposed credit of US$22.0 million would cover the balance
of the foreign exchange costs. The local currency component of the project
cost amounting to US$14h0 million would be financed by the Government.



- 11 -
38.       As in past highway projects the MOW would be responsible for
the execution of the proposed project. Although the iLnistry's technical
capacity has increased (paragraph 29 above), as evidenced by the fact
that it has done some of the design work for the roads included in the
Project and will be able to carry out some of the construction super-
vision, it will continue to require assistance from consultants and
provision has been made under the credit for their retention.
39.       Contractors would be employed to carry out the construction
work included in the proposed project with the exception of about 414 km
of settlement roads (accounting for 2 percent of total project costs)
which mill be built by the NOW's own construction units utilizing labor
from the National Youth Service (NYS).   Construction of such loW standard
roads, which are widely dispersed, is unlikely to attract reasonable bids
from contractors.  Such departmental units employing 1TYS labor were also
utilized for the construction of settlement roads financed under Loan
No. 639 KE (Third Highwayy Project). While there were some initial
administrative and organizational difficulties,the introduction of doable
work shifts and a program of incentives has improved performance and
the standard of the work completed by such units is satisfactory.
40.       Construction contracts will be awarded on the basis of inter-
natioral competitive bidding. The only proposed exception to this is
the contract for paving a 23 km feeder road estimated to cost about
US$400OO,0. This contract would be negotiated as an extension to the
ongoing contract for the gravelling of the same road, which was awarded
after international competitive bidding under the Third Highway Project
(Loan No. 639 KE). It is expected that because the contractor has already
mobilized for work on this stretch of road, this procedure will permit
Kenya to obtain unit prices lower than can be expected from any new
contractor; the terms of such a negotiated contract would be subject
to our approval. The project provides for a small amount of construction
equipment and spare parts (US$383,000) for the MOW construction units.
It is proposed that this equipment be procured under ongoing contracts
recently awarded after internationa' competitive bidding under the Highway
Maintenance Project (Credit No. 224 KE).
41.       Disbursements from the IDA and Swedish credits will be made
on a pro rata basis against foreign exchange costs. Approximately
US$170,000 of the credits would be provided for retroactive financing
for one of the settlement roads which is presently under construction
by MDW construction units. This is considered justified since the units
were in the area building a road financed under the Third Highway Project
(Loan No. 639 KE) and it was most economical to permit these units to
remain there and continue work on the road included in the proposed
project before moving on to another area.
42.       In order to safeguard past and future highway investments it
was agreed during negotiations that Kenya would, within four months of
the signing of the proposed credit, complete a revision of its existing
plan for enforcing weight regulations and restricting axle loads (para-
graph 31 above) and that it would then proceed to implement such revised
plan in accordance with a timetable to be agreed with the Association.

PART IV - LEGAL INSTRITNUN-TS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Kenya and the Association, the draft Joint Financing Agreement between the
Republic of Kenya, the Kingdom of Sweden and the Association, the Recom-
mendations of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of
the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed Development Credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. An Administrative Letter from the Bank and IDA
to the Kingdom of Sweden which is the Basic Agreement governing all
joint financing operations undertaken by the Bank and IDA with the Kingdom
of Sweden was distributed to the Executive Directors in connection with
Loan Mo. 605 ET (R69-82-L).
44.       The above mentioned draft agreements contain the covenants
usually found in the Association's agreements for highway projects and
projects jointly financed by the Association and Sweden. The draft
Joint Financing Agreement provides for disbursement of the IDA and Swedish
credits and the methods and procedures for procurement of goods and services.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articlec of Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOI&IVENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
