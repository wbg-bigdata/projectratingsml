                         The Transport and Territorial Development Project (TTDP) aims at rehabilitating two transport corridors in the North and South-East departments, and at fostering territorial
                         development along said corridors, based on a decentralized planning and implementation approach. This project so far has had a satisfactory progress to DO but implementation
                         progress have suffered of the large increase in the number of projects and funds handled by the PIU . Over the last 6 months, road rehabilitation works on National Road No 3 (RN3)
                         8km, Barriere Battant / Carrefour la Mort have been completed as well as works on the Thiotte/Anse a Pitre Departmental Road No 41 (RD41), 34 km. Out of the 22 originally planned
