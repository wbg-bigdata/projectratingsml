                         The Transport and Territorial Development Project (TTDP) aims at rehabilitating two transport corridors in the North and South-East departments, and at fostering territorial
                         development along said corridors, based on a decentralized planning and implementation approach. This project so far has had a satisfactory implementation. Over the last 6 months,
                         road rehabilitation works on National Road No 3 (RN3), Barriere Battant / Carrefour la Mort have been completed and works on the Thiotte/Anse a Pitre Departmental Road No 41
                         (RD41) section are nearing completion. Out of the 22 originally planned spot road repairs, following the additional financing, 15 are already completed and works are on-going for the

                         remainder. The project has since added 5 additional spot interventions following Hurricane Tomas (November 2011).
