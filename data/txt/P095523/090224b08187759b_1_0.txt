                         The Transport and Territorial Development Project (TTDP) aims at rehabilitating two transport corridors in the North and South-East departments, and at fostering territorial
                         development along said corridors, based on a decentralized planning and implementation approach. This project so far has had a satisfactory progress to DO but implementation
                         progress have suffered of the large increase in the number of projects and funds handled by the PIU . Over the last 6 months, road rehabilitation works have continued as well as
                         works on the Thiotte/Anse a Pitre Departmental Road No 41 (RD41), 34 km which are now completed and road is open for traffic , time travel on this itinerary has been reduced from

                         integrating damages in designs . Activities related to the territorial development window in the 2 micro regions have been successfully completed and model developed is being
