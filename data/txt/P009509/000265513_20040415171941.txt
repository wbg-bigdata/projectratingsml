      56.      Notwithstanding the concerns noted
      in paragraph 53 above, the Panel is aware of
      the unique and complex challenges posed by
      this project, and acknowledges the efforts of
      staff and Management to ensure its success.
      The Panel believes the EFP issued after the
      Request was filed could constitute an
      adequate and enforceable framework that
      would allow -- and show the intentions of --
      Management to comply with the policies
      and procedures relevant to the Requesters'
      concerns. This framework, however, would
      have to be revised and expanded to meet
      policy requirements and a full and informed
      participation of affected people would be
      needed to ensure its success.         Also a
      balanced      supervision    and     constant
      monitoring should help overcome existing
      institutional weaknesses and assure timely
(-,   remedies for emerging problems.

      In this context, the Panel feels that an
      investigation of the matters alleged in the
      Request is not warranted at this time.
