Credit and Proiect Summary
Borrower:                 Republic of Djibouti
Beneficiaries:            Ministry of National Education (MEN)
Ministry of Labor and Welfare (MTPS)
Prime Ministry
Amounts                   SDR 4.6 million (US$5.82 million equivalent)
Terms:                    Standard with 40 years maturity
Proiect Description:
Objectives:               The objectives of the project are to: (a) improve
the coordination of vocational training in
relation to labour market patterns; (b) increase
access to primary education; (c) upgrade the
relevance and quality of education at the primary
and lower secondary levels; and (d) improve the
mAnagement capazity of the Ministry of National
Education while reducing costs and better
allocating resources
Components:               (a)  Coordination of Vocational Training.
Improve the technical capacities of the
National Service for Employment and
establish a National Council for Training
and Employment.
(b) Access to Primary Education. Establish
three primary schools in Djibouti-City and
one in Ali Sabieh, with a double-shift
enrollment capacity of 4,500 students.
(c) Quality of Education. Establish a National
Center for Educational Research, Information
and Production and two regional
inspectorates.
(d) Educational Management. Strengthen
educational planning and management through
specialist services and training.
Benefits:                 The proposed project would establish a framework
for expanding the education sector by: (a)
increasing its cost-efficiency while tying
sectoral investments to the Government's capacity
to meet the incremental recurrent costs; (b)



improving the relevance and quality of education;
and (c) assisting in institution-building
throughout the education and training sector.
The project would provide spaces for 4,500
primary school-age children, an increase of 17
percent over the enrollment in 1988/1989, but the
more important long-range benefit to the sector
would be reduction of the costs of primary
teachers without sacrificing their
qualifications, more relevant curricula at the
primary and lower secondary levels and changes in
vocational education, to be introduced by the
National Council for training in that sub-sector.
Risks:                    The risks include the iL 1equate staffing and
technical capacities of the institutions
Involved. Arrangements on additional staffing
and a s4zable tra'.ning program, supplemented by
specialist services in the key areas addressed by
the proposed project, would help overcome these
weaknesses.

MANPOWER AND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01 The Government of Djibouti has requested IDA's assistance in
financing a project with the objectives of: (a) improving the coordination
of the vocational training subsector in relation to labor market patterns;
(b) increasing access to primary education; (c) upgrading the relevance and
quality of primary and lower secondary education; and (d) improving the
managerial capacity of the Ministry of National Education (Ministere de
l'Education Nationale - MEN) while reducing costs and better allocating
resources. The estimated project cost is US$7.5 million equivalent (net of
taxes and duties, except for operating costs), with a foreign exchange
component of US$4.7 million (about 62 percent). The European Development
Fund (Fonds Europ4en de D4veloppement - FED) and the United Nations
Development Program (Programme des Nations Unies nour le Developpement -
PNUD) would contribute US$0.40 million and US$0.42 million, and the
Government would contribute about US$0.9 million equivalent to the project,
respectively. The remainder of US$5.8 million equivalent would be financed
by IDA.
1.02 The proposed project would be IDA's second contribution to the
development of Djibouti's education and training sector. Its objectives
would be to assist in the financing of the Education Five-Year Investment
Program within a strategy aimed at increasing the cost-efficiency of the
sector and improving the relevance and quality of education. IDA is in a
favorable position to help in this effort, as over the last two years it has
been engaged in an intensive policy dialogue on the sector with the
Government. The basic data sheet is in ANNEX 1.1.
II. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
A. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
2.01 Labor Market. Djibouti's labor market is very small. Of a labor
force of 160,000 in 1987, only 48,000 held permanent jobs, with 24,000 in
the formal sector (6,700 in the public, 4,000 in the para-public and the
revt in the private sector). This disequilibrium results from the high rate
of population increase (about 3.0 percent per annum) and difficult
conditions for the growth of the p.imary and secondary sectors, ?'hile
development of the tertiary sector faces severe constraints (shortages of
skilled labor, weak administration and high costs of qualified labor).
Detailed socioeconomic background information is provided in Annex 2.1.



- 2 -
2.02 Education and Training. Djibouti's formal education and training
system is very closely modeled after the French system. It consists of six
years of primary education starting at age six, followed by four years of
lower and three years of upper secondary education (general and technical).
Higher education is undertaken abroad with Government and bilateral
financing (about 350 students). In addition, the country has developed a
limited non-formal education and training system with about 2,000 trainees.
The non-formal vocational training is funded largely out of public revenues.
Public education accounts for about 90 percent and 85 percent of primary and
secondary enrollments, respectively.   Annex 2.2 provides an overview of the
education and training sector, including a chart showing the structure of
the education and training system.
2.03 Organization and Administration. The administrative responsibilities
for education, training and labor are shared by three ministries: (a) the
MEN for primary, secondary and higher schooling (both genera'. and
technical); (b) the Ministry of Labor and Welfare (Ministere du Travail et
de la Pr4voyance Sociale - MTPS) for vocational training and labor
management; and (c) the Prime Ministry (Primature) for policy and
coordination of manpower development and training. The Ministry of Finance
and National Economy (Ministere des Finances et de l'Economie Nationale -
tFN) and the Ministries of Health and Justice have their own training
centers. In addition, there are several institutions (e.g., the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, the Postal Service and the Electricity Corporation)
and associations (e.g. the National Youth Association, Mother and Child
Center and National Union of Djiboutian Women) that also manage training
centers. These programs currently involve only a few trainees but an
expansion of capacity is envisaged. Without adequate planning and control
however, this scattering of technical and vocational training and the
envisaged expansions will result in overlapping and excess capacities.
Organization charts for the MEN and MTPS are given in Annex 2.3.
B. SECTORAL ISSUES
1. Coordination of Vocational Training with the Labor Market
2.04 Along with a high level of unemployment (para. 2.01), Djibouti faces
a serious shortage of trained manpower, particularly at the middle and
higher professional and management levels, while having excess training
capacity for some lower level skills (e.g., masonry, plumbing and
mechanics). Expatriates account for about 5 percent of total employment in
the formal sector but hold about 40 percent of the professional, supervisory
and higher level technical positions, including in the education sector.
Between 1983 and 1985, 95 percent of higher, secondary and technical
education graduates found employment, but the employment rate for graduates
at 'he level of skilled worker was low, varying with the subsector (E.g., 35
percent for construction workers, 47 percent for mechanics and 49 percent
for clerical staff), indicative of a disequilibrium between labor demand and
supply at this skill level.
2.05 The main Government law guiding Djibouti's economic and social
orientation (no. 251/AN/82) stresses the strategic role of human resources
in economic development, particularly in relation to the goal of making
Djibouti an international center for commerce and banking. This emphasis is
not, however, reflected in the current levels of institutional development
and performance of the education and training sector. The National Training
and Employment Program (Programme National Formation et Emploi) under the
Prime Minister, -4iich is intended to coordinate and develop manpower



-3-
training in line with labor market requirements, is constrained by its
limited ateffing, lack of resources, scant statistical and information base,
and inadequate involvement of employers. Until recently, the MEN largely
neglected the labor market environment becausa of a lack of technical
expertise regarding policy analysis and planning for human resources (para.
2.15). The other relevant Government ministry, MTPS, is weak. While it has
a total staff of about 90, its capacity for data collection and processing,
analysis of the labor market, and policy development through its main
agency, the National Service for Employment (Service National de l'EmIloi -
SNE) is negligible. As a result, the training system is not geared to the
current and future needs of the labor market. Annex 2.4 provide, additional
information on the status of the management of the labor market.
2. Access to Education
2.06 There are no reliable data on population for Djibouti because of the
prevalence of nomadic and semi-nomadic herdsmen, who wander across the
frontiers, and the uncertain number of immigrants and refugees from
neighboring countries. Estimates of the population and primary school age
group published by the Djibouti National Directorate of Statistics in 1986
suggest a gross primary school enrollment rate of about 36 percent. This
relatively low level is explained by the high unit costs and, to some
extent, lack of school buildings and, in a more general way, by the nomadic
nature of part of the country's population. Admi_sion to primary education
is conditioned by the provision of a Djiboutian birth certificate. This
policy inherited from the previous governing power seems also to be applied
in order to avoid enrollment of children from neighboring countries at the
expense of nationals. Because of the low level of primary enrollment, and
the share of Djibouti-City in the overall population; the sector
authorities'indications, that the demand of students with birth certificates
is still higher than available capacity, seem plausible. A decentralization
law has recently been promulgated which would allow the regional authorities
to establish nationality and to issue birth certificates: this should
provide a partial solution to the problem of equity of access. However, the
problem of providing access to Oresidents children from neighboring
countries needs still to be addressed. Girls account for 42 percent of total
primary enrollment but only about 33 percent in rural areas.
2.07 Transition rates from primary to lower secondary and then to upper
secondary education decreased between 1980/1981 and 1988/1989 from about 51
percent to 24 percent and from 39 percent to 26 percent, respectively
because of insufficient capacity. Secondary school enrollment in Djibowti-
City, which accounts for almost 85 percent of total secondary enrollment,
exceeds the physical capacity by about 20 percent. The share of girls in
total secondary enrollment is about 35 percent, but only about 23 percent in
rural areas.
3. Quality of Education
2.08 The teaching conditions within the education system are good by
African standards. However, the output levels do not correspond to these
conditions. Success rates on the final examinations at the primary
(Certificat d'Etudes Primaires - CEP), lower (Brevet d'Etudes du Premier
Cycle - BEPC) and upper secondary (Baccalaureat) levels are low, averaging
about 25 percent, 48 percent and 56 percent for the 1984-1989 period. For
vocational training within the MEN, the situation is similar with
examination pass rates of 46 percent for the Commercial Vocational Training
Certificate (Certificat d'Aptitude Professionelle - CAP) and 53 percent for



the Vocational Training Diploma (Brevet d'Enseignement Professionel - BEP)
for the same period.
2.09 Several factors are adversely affecting the capacity of the average
Djiboutian student to succeed in the education system. They relate to the
curricula, languages of instruction, primary teacher training, pedagogical
support and supervision.
2.10 Curricula. The Primary education programs are still very similar to
those in place before the country's independence. The curricula have not
been sufficiently modified to take account of the conditions in the country
and of the students and their sociocultural background. In secondary
education, the curricula and organization are still those applied in the
former metropolis.
2.11 Languages of Instruction. French is the main language of
instruction. It is taught at the primary level through a method developed
in a West African country and which needs serious review and adaptation in
order to be relevant for Djibouti. Arabic is taught as a second language in
the last two years of primary school; iti instruction shares the same
weaknesses as does French. In secondary education, French is taught with
the same objectives and content as in France to students who are unfamiliar
with the implicit cultural context and whose proficiency in French falls
short of the requisite level. Annex 2.5 providei additional information on
the status of languages of instruction.
Z.12 Primary Teacher Training. In addition to the limited relevance of
the primary school curricula, and methods of language instruction, the
quality of primary education is depressed by the fact that one-third of the
teachers have not received any professional training. Furthermore, the
students at the teacher training college of Djibouti, the education level of
which has increased in recent years (from 10 to about 11-12 years), have
been following curricula that do not pay sufficient attention neither to the
students improved educational level nor to the content of primary education
and to teaching practices including for the languages of instruction.
2.13 Pedagogical Support. The Pedagogical Office for Primary Education,
created in 1986 under MEN to develop curricula and instructional materials,
strengthen in-service training and evaluate educational outcomes, has not
been able to achieve its objectives except for some in-service training and
instructional materials. Its main weaknesses -- an inadequate mix of
skills, absence of nationals staff and poor operating conditions -- are
shared by the parallel institution at the next higher level, the Pedagogical
Office for Secondary Education also under the MEN. The existing education
printshop operates adequately but suffers from lack of space to operate
fully.
2.14  Supervision.  The country's three primary education inspectors are
mainly involved in administering the primary education system, and only 2 of
the 11 pedagogical counselors are stationned outside the capital to support
rural teachers. With 1 counselor for about 100 teachers and the extreme
isolation of many rural schools, pedagogical support is inadequate. In
addition, the support the counselors provide is no more than a transmission
of pedagogical formula rather than the development of an independent and
flexible approach to teaching.

4. Educational Management
2.15 The MEN capacity for policy analysis and planuing, budgeting and
resource management is weak. The Schools Organizatiln Office, which could
be considered as an embryonic planning office, is understaffed. The Office
of Administration Services, in charge of budgeting tad cost control, lacks
the necessary expertise, as does the Office of Personnel, which in addition
perceives its functions to be limited to staff records and promotion.
5. Financial Constraints
2.16 Between 1981 and 1987, Government expenditures on education grew in
nominal terms at an average rate of 4.7 percent p.a., the same rate as the
overall budget. In that period, education accounted for about 12 percent of
the Government's recurrent budget, compared with about 18 percent for Sub-
Saharan Africa. Since 1987, the growth of the Government's budget has
slowed to an average of 3.3 percent and is expected to be about 1 percent
p.a. over the next five years.
2.17 In 1988, about Franc Djibouti (PD) 3.7 billion, or 13.9 percent of
the Government's recurrent budget, were allocated to education, a figure
below the average for french-speaking Sub-Saharan countries. 1/ However,
these figures greatly understate the total amount of financing available to
education, as they exclude most French assistance, which is roughly eaual to
the Government's own education budget.  The national development budget for
the sector consists mainly of counterpart funding for externally financed
projects.
2.18 Compared with other African countries, the unit costs for education
are high, amounting in 198511986 to US$372, US$576 and US$983 equivalent for
primary, secondary and vocational education, respectively, and to US$4,103
for teacher training.
2.19 Teachers' salaries make up a large percentage of the primary and
seccadary education budgets (in 1985, about 88 percent and 93 percent,
respectively). These salaries are high compared with those prevailing in
Sub-Saharan Africa (for a primary teacher, about US$6,975 in Djibouti vs.
US$2,255 for the region). These high salaries are explained by the
relatively high starting point and rapid progression for primary school
(instituteurs) and other teachers. Teachers housing benefits. While civil
servants benefits comprise housing, the Ministry of Education has started
replacing provision of housing (monthly renting costs averaging FD 100-
120,000) by a monthly indemnity of PD 30,000 for single and 40,000 for
married teachers. Monthly pre-salaries for trainee teachers came to PD
80,000, about six times the official minimum wage.  As to support grants for
secondary students, in 1987/1988 its total budget amounted to PD 80 million
and for fellowships in secondary and higher education abroad to FD 184
million. No differentiating criteria such as economic need, academic
performance or field of study are used in awarding the support grants and
fellowships. These policies were perhaps appropriate at the time of
independence, when the country urgently needed to develop its human resource
1, The 1983 average for French-speaking Sub-Saharan countries was about 26
percent. (World Bank, 'Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: Policies for
Adjustment Revitalization and Expansion' pp. 144).



-6-
base, but they are no longer relevant in view of the effective demand for
education and the financial constraints.
2.20 In view of the limited prospects for medium-term financing for the
sector and the high unit costs, Djibouti started to reexamine certain
fundamental parameters of the education sector, beginning with the level of
recruitment of teachers and their salaries (as part of a general review of
civil service status) and fellowship policies, in order to be able to expand
and improve education services.
C. THE GOVERNMENT'S SECTORAL STRATEGY AND INVESTMENT PROGRAM
2.21 The Government, fully aware of the sector's importance for the
economic development of Djibouti has designed a medium-term education
strategy addressing the issues discussed above and whose wain elements and
sub-elements are as follows:
(a) Coordination of vocational training with the labor market --
(i) improvement of decision-making in vocational training through more and
better information; (ii) Creation of a vocational training coordinating
body;
(b) Access to education -- (i) Increase in primary education
enrollments by 4,500 and lower secondary by 800; (ii) maintenance of the
current level of general upper secondarl enrollments; (iii) creation of an
upper secondary industrial and commercial Lyc4e (750 students); (iv) phasing
out of the vocational lower secondary school (Lycee d'Enseignement
Professionnel -LEP-) of MEN, and preparation of commensurate expansion of
u-noer secondary schooling through the rehabilitation and conversion of
facilities; and (v) increases in hiaher education enrollments abroad beyond
the present level through private and bilateral financing.
Cc) Quality of education -- (i) Curriculum adaptations with a view to
acL.ieving more relevant primary and lower secondary education and better
franch language teaching; (ii) strengthening of supervisory capacity in
rural areas; (iii) improving of pre- and in-service training for primary and
lower secondary teachers, primary inspectors and pedagogical counselors; and
(iii) development of an education research, information and production
center with an evaluation capacity, and.
(d) Costs and financina -- (i) replacement of current teacher
trainees pre-salary by an indemnity at least one third less than the pre-
salary; (ii) introduction of the new civil service statute devised for the
entire civil service, including teachers, and of the new category of lesser
paid but qualified primary teachers (instituteurs adjoints); (iii)
cancellation for upper general secondary, of new fellowships abroad; (iv)
reduction of the number of support grants for secondary education and
development of awarding criteria; (iv) development of criteria for awarding
higher education fellowships and freezing of related budget; and (v)
strengthening of education management.
2.22 To pursue this strategy, the Government has developed a Five-Year
Education Investment Program for the period 1990-1994, the result of
intensive analysis and discussions aimed at reconciliating needs and means.
Approval of the investment program by the Minister's Council on March 9,
1989 has been the latest step in this process and the Government and IDA
have agreed upon the five-year program. Its main features are the strategy
described above, the investment program and the estimation of its

2.23 The financing of the program components, except for the
rehabilitation/transformation of the existing vocational secondary schools
{Lycde d'Enseignement Profeesionel - LEP) which is still at an early stage,
is divided among the following donors: IDA, through the ongoing First
Education Project. US$1.8 million equivalent and through the proposed
project, US$5.8 million equivalent, vith co-financing by the European
Development Fund (FED), US$0.4 million equivalent, and the United Nations
Development Program. US$0.4 million equivalent (para. 4.09): the Government
of Kuwait, about US$5.0 million equivalent; the African Development Fund
(A£DP), US$12.8 million equivalent; and the French Government, US$1.2
million equivalent. The Government would provide counterpart funding,
mainly for local expenses.
2/    Three additional schools financed by the proceeds of the First
Education Project (Cr. 1543-DJI).
3/    Lower secondary school (Balbala) of about 1,200 places to be fizanced
by Kuwait. During the Program period, the level of enrollment at the
school will reach about 800 students, or 651 of capacity.
4/    Upper Secondary Technical and Commercial Lycee of about 750 places,
to be financed by the AFDB. No incremental recurrent costs are
expected because of the transfer to the new school of the existing
vocational upper secondary school (Lycee d'Enseignement Professionnel
- LEP), budget and staff.
5/    Teacher and supervisory staff training center, to be financed by
France. The incremental recurrent costs are estimated at 100
secondary school students equivalent.
6/    Rehabilitation/transformation of existing LEP into a general upper
secondary school. Enrollment in the first year ix, estimated at 360,
or 40 percent of capacity.

2.24  Assuming one percent annual growth in the Government's budget in
nominal terms, the maintenance of the present level of french bilateral aid
to the sector, and the application of the cost reduction measure (para.
3.16), timely implementation of the investment program would increase, as
agreed with the Ministry of Finance, the share of education in the recurrent
bucget from 13.9 percent in 1989 to about 16 percent at the end of the five-
year sector program.
2.25 To sum up, the Government's strategy addresses the major education
issues and deserves support. Its main aims are to improve cost- efficiency
and quality and expand access. It calls for severe cost reduction measures,
which have already been introduced in part (Annex 2.6), although the most
difficult ones are still to be implemented (para. 3.16). In addition,
better access to and relevance of education and improved management of the
sector remain the major challenges. The main purpose of the present project
is to assist the Government in implementing its education sector strategy
and completing the financing of its investment program.
D. THE BANK GROUP'S ROLE
2.26 Djibouti joined the Bank Group on October 1, 1980. Six IDA credits
have since been approved for a total of US$34.6 millions Technical
Assistance (1982), Highway Maintenance (1983), Geothermal Exploration
(1984), Urban Development (1984), First Education (1984) and a second
geothermal development project (1969). The Bank Group's assistance is
focused on broadening the country's development base through the
investments proposed in IDA's current five-year lending program. That
program includes, in addition to the proposed manpower and education
development project, a second urban development (FY91) and two reserve
projects (health and third geothermal) in the out-lying years.
III. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
3.01 The proposed project is designed to complement the contributions of
other donors for the implementation of the Government's medium-term sector
program, as outlined in Chapter II. Within this framework, its objectives
are to: (a) improve the coordination of vocational training with labor
market pattern; (b) to increase access to primary education; (c) to upgrade
the relevance and quality of education at primary and lower secondary
levels, and (d) to improve the management capacity of the Ministry of
National Education while reducing costs and better allocating resources. To
this end the proposed project would finance a part of the proposed
investments program (paras. 3.02-3.15).
1. Coordination of Vocational Training
3.02 To strengthen the coordination of vocational training with labor
market patterns, the project would improve the technical capacities of the
National Service for Employment located in the MTPS and establish a
coordinating body for planning and policy-making in this subsector located
in the Prime Ministry.



- 9 -
3.03 National Service for Employment. This project component would aim at
developing a solid data base on employment, and implementing studies mainly
geared to the re-definition the HTPS' Vocational Training Center missions in
relation with the rehabilitation/transformation of the LEP of the HEN (para.
2.21); and restructuring of the Directorate of Training-Employment within
the MTPS. These informations and studies would support the planned National
Council for Training and Employment (CNFE), which is to redirect vocational
training streams and expansion. The proposed project would finance 46 man-
months of technical assistance, 26 man-months of training, equipment,
furniture and related operating costs. During negotiations, the Government
gave assurances that the National Service for Employment would be
strengthened by two additional staff holding at least the equivalent of a
junior college diploma. Thie strengthening would be a condition of
disbursement for the component.
3.04 National Council for Trainina and Employment (Conseil National de la
Formation et de l'Emploi (CNFE). This council, to be established under the
Prime Minister, is to be responsible for assuring proper linkages between
vocational training and the labor market, propose necessary adjustments in
the composition, content, duration and volume of training, and review
proposed investments. The council would be comprised of representatives of
interested parties, including employers. It would be assisted in its work
by a secretariat staffed by a high-level public servant with at least three
years of higher education and a technician. The proposed project would help
establish this council through the financing of 9 man-months of training,
equipment, materials, and related oeerating costs.  During neaotiations, the
Government provided assurances that it wills (a) issue the decree creating
the CNFE. The decree is to be a condition of disbursement for the
component; and (b) staff its secretariat with two staff persons having the
required qualifications at the latest by September 30, 1990.
2. Access to Primary Education
3.05 The project would support a primary school construction program, lay
the foundations for educational research and development of relevant
programs/supply of primary education textbooks, and strengthen supervisory
capacity in rural areas.
3.06 Primary School Construction Program. To improve access to primary
school education, the proposed project would finance the construction,
equipping and furnishing of three schools in the suburbs of Djibouti-City
(36 classrooms) and one school in the southern region in Ali Sabieh (9
classrooms). The design to be used was developed under the First Education
Project (Cr. 1543-DJI). It is expected that these schools would be used for
double shifts, providing an enrollment capacity of 4,500, or 17 percent of
the 1988-89 enrollments. During negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that at least 90 percent of all the primary teachers who will be
recruited during the project implementation period would be at the
instituteur-adioint level.
3. Qualitv of Education
3.07 National Center for Education Research. Information and Production
Center (CRIPEN). To provide the pedagogic support and leadership required
to improve the relevance and quality of education (para. 2.13), the proposed
project would assist in establishing a National Center for Education



- 10 -
Research, Information and Production (Centre de Recherche. d'Information et
de Production de 1'Education Nationale - CRIPEN) by merging and
restructuring the two existing pedagogical offices (para. 2.13). The Center
would adjust the educational programs to the realities of the country,
develop appropriate teaching guides and other documentation, evaluate the
outcomes of primary and lower secondary school programs and assist in the
training of education staff.
3.08 The proposed project component related to the Center would help
implement an agreed-upon work program, to consist of: Reviews of the
curricula for primary and lower secondary education and for primary teacher
training; development of teaching guides for primary education; evaluation
of student achievement in primary and lower secondary schools; and together
with the teacher and supervisory staff Training Center financed by France
(para. 2.23), upgrade the skills of primary education supervisors.
3.09 The proposed project would finances Construction of the Center, and
space extension at the education existing printshop (about US$ 25,000),
equipment and furniture; textbooks for mathematics and sciences and
dictionaries for French and Arabic for the last two years of primary
education; 65 man-months of specialist services; 40 man-months of foreign
training; and related operating costs. During negotiations, the Government
gave assurances that it will, prior to proiect effectiveness, legally
establish (a) the CRIPEN, appoint its national director and authorize its
operating budget for the first year; and (b) the commissions for the review
of the primary and lower secondary curricula. In addition, it gave
assurances that it will: (a) assign, by December 31, 1990, two national
educators to the Center and three more by December 31, 1991; (b) provide IDA
with the revised primary education curricula, by June 30, 1991 at the
latest, with the revised primary teacher training curricula by December 31,
1991 and with the revised lower secondary curricula by June 30, 1992 and (c)
review with IDA the annual work programs of the Center before Hay 31 of each
year.
3.10 Insvectorates. To increase the frequency and quality of pedagogical
support for teachers in rural areas through on-site observation and advice
and local training as well as support to studies initiated by CRIPEN, the
proposed project would finance civil works for two regional primary
education inspectorates, one in Tadjourah (North) and the other in Dikhil
(South); equipment, furniture and vehicles; 20 man-months of training; and
incremental operating costs. Durins negotiations, the Government gave
assurances that it will, Prior to project effectiveness, legally establish a
new statute for primary education inspectors.
4. Educational Management
3.11 To strengthen the Ministry's capacity for planning and management,
the existing School Organization Office (para. 2.15) has been transformed
into a Service of Educational Planning (Service de la Planification de
l'Education - SPE) within the General Directorate of National Education
(Direction Generale de lVEducation Nationale - DGEN) by Law No. 89/AN/2 of
July 27, 1989. The new service would be organized and staffed to assume the
additional responsibilities that derive from the sector policy measures
discussed in para. 3.16 and the needs for further policy analysis and
planning. To this end, the service woulds (&) intensify the collection of
education data and conduct of analyses, particularly on non-satisfied
primary education demands (para 2.06) and for higher education; (b) conduct
two studies on the costs and financing of education; (c) complete school



- 11 -
mapping for primary and secondary education; (d) carry out, in collaboration
with the CRIPEN, a tracer study of the Ministry's vocational training
graduates; (e) conduct an organization and management study of the MENt and
(f) prepare annual reviews of the sector investment program and, in
particular, of the next annual program tranche and its budgetary
implications (para. 3.16). During project implementation, one additional
staff would be assigned to the SEP, with qualifications equivalent to at
least two years of higher education (para. 5.03).
3.12 The proposed project would financet furniture, equipment and
vehicles; 24 man-months of technical assistance; 38 man-months of training;
and incremental operating costs.
3.13 Durina negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it will:
(a) assign to the SPE, by December 31. 1991, one additional staff with
required qualifications (para. 5.03); and (b) complete (i) the Ministry of
Education Organization Study by June 30, 1991, the cost and financing
studies by December 31, 1991 and 1993 respectively and discuss their outcome
and follow up with IDA; (ii) the school mapping for primary education by
June 30, 1992 at the latest; and (iii) the vocational education graduates
tracer study by June 30, 1993 (para. 3.11).
3.14 Proiect Management. To strengthen the operational capabilities of
the DGEN which would be responsible for project management (para. 3.27), the
proposed IDA credit would finance: furniture, equipment and vehicles; and
funds for auditing the project accounts, for operational travel and for
incremental operating costs, including the costs of local training of about
60 primary education supervisors.
3.15 Studies and Preparation of Future Investments. The proposed project
would provide funds for further sector studies to be agreed with IDA and for
the possible preparation of future investments.
5. Costs and Financing
3.16 The proposed project would support the Government's Education Five-
Year Investment Program through the implementation of the following
additional cost reduction measures (para. 3.06).
(i) replacement, by March 31, 1991, of current teachers trainees
pre-salary by an indemnity at least one third less than the pre-
salary (para. 2.21);
(ii) cancellation, by December 31, 1990, effective the following
school year, of new fellowships abroad for upper secondary
general education (para. 2.21);
(iii) reduction by 60 percent in the number of support grants for
secondary education, by January 31, 1991, while retaining
criteria for eligibility designed to increase female enrollment
in secondary education (para. 2.21);
(iv) introduction, by January 31, 1991, of new criteria for awarding
fellowships for higher education, while providing incentives for
the higher education of females and freezing the related budget
(para. 2.21);



- 12 -
tv) assurance to undertake, by November 15 of each year at the
latest, an annual Government/IDA review of the draft invertment
and recurrent education budgets for the upcoming fiscal year to
ensure financing of the education program.
3.17 The MEN would implement the above measures in close consultation with
the MFE. Prior to negotiations, the Government provided IDA with a policy
statement encompassing the Government's medium-term strategy, to include the
above measures, the related investment program and its financing
arrangements.  Durint negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it
will implement the measures, assurances and reviews specified in para. 3.16
according to the schedule agreed to with IDA.

3.19 Basis of the Cost Estimates. IDA has reviewed the cost estimates for
the civil works with the staff of the Ministry of Public Works (Ministbre
des Travaux Publics, de l'Urbanisme et du Logement - MTPUL). The
construction costs are based on the results of recent bidding for similar
facilities; without/with site development they average US$3651495 per gross
square meter for urban primary schools, US$4351590 for rural primary
schools, US$590/740 for rural inspectorates, and US$535/750 for the CRIPEN.
IDA has reviewed the costs of the furniture and equipment with the HEN
staff; they are based on contracts awarded under the ongoing first IDA
education project and on quotations obtained during the appraisal mission
for comparable items. The technical assistance costs -- US$121,200 per year
for long-term specialists, US$10,200 per month for short term consultants,
US$2,870 per month for foreign fellowship training -- are based on UNDP
rates. The costs for the long-term specialists include housing, relocation,
salaries, subsistence, office services, fees,.overhead and recruitment. The
costs for the fellowships include travel, tuition and subsistence. The base
cost estimates reflect prices at the time of appraisal (May 1989).
3.20 Customs Duties and Taxes. In accordance with the normal practice of
the Govervaent, the project will be exempted from duties and taxes, except
for small purchases related to operating costs and which amount to US$0.13
million.
3.21 Area and Cost Rer Student. The area allocated per student place is
economical, about 1.15 net sq.m. for primary classrooms. Utilization rates
would be high, since the primary classrooms are expected to be used in
double shifts. The cost per student place, assuming a double shift, average
US$285 for the civil works in urban areas and US$339 in rural areas, and
US$107 for furniture/equipment and US$59 for textbooks and educational
material at the primary level.
3.22  Oleratina Costs.  These costs are related to the maintenance and
operation of the furn'.ture/equipment financed by the project, the salaries
for incremental staff of the implementing unit (junior accountant and two
drivers), and the costs of local training of primary school supervisors.
3.23 Contingency Allowances. The project costs include an allowance for
physical contingencies equal to 7 percent of the estimated base cost (US$6.7
million) for civil works, furniture, equipment, vehicles and textbooks.
Annual rates for price increases have been applied for both local and
foreign costs and for all categories at a rate of 4.1 percent for the
period. The price contingencies are estimated at 5 percent of the base cost
and the total contingencies at 12 percent.
3.24 Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component was
estimated as follows: (a) civil works, 40 percent; (b) furniture, 80
percent; (c) equipment, vehicles and textbooks, 100 percent; (d)
professional fees and technical assistance, 100 percent; (e) training
abroad, 100 percent; and (f) operating costs, 30 percent. These percentages
were determined by estimating the percentage of imported construction
materials and by assuming that all equipment, furniture, vehicles and
textbooks would be imported and that all project-financed specialists would
be foreign. Including the contingencies, the resulting foreign exchange
component is estimated at US$4.7 million, or about 63 percent of total
costs.

2. Proiect FinancinA
3.25 The plan for project financing specifies an IDA contribution of
US$5.82 million equivalent (77 percent of total project costns). Assistance
from the European Development Fund (mainly for the National Service for
Employment component) would amount to US$0.40 million equivalent (or 5
percent) and from the United Nations Development Program (for the education
planning component) to US$0.42 million equivalent. The Government would
finance the balance of the project costs equivalent to US$0.9 million (or
about 12 percent) as indicated in Table 3.2. A condition for the credit
effectiveness would be that conditions for effectiveness of the co-financing
by UNDP and FED have been fulfilled.

C. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
3.26 Status of Preparation. The project is at an advanced stage of
preparation. Six of the seven construction sites have been identified;
surveys and soil tests as well as sketch designs for the civil works are
underway. The seventh site (for the CRIPEN) is being studied, and the
result will be reviewed with IDA. The Service of Educational Planning has
been created and an additional staff person was assigned to it (para 3.11).
The MEN has also provisionally created the CRIPEN (Decision No. 1470 of
September 27, 1988) and two staff were sent abroad for training in
educational research and supervision.
3.27 Project Implementation Unit. The proposed project would be
Implemented by the DGEN under the MEN according to arrangements that became
effective with the First Education Project (Cr. 1543-DJI). A Project Task
Force (Groupe de Coordination du Projet - PTF) is to be in charge of
implementation, to be comprised of the Director General of National
Education as project director (part-time), assisted by his expatriate
technical advisor; the Chief of MEN Financial Services as deputy director
and procurement officer, supported by the MEN accountancy section; the Chief



- 16 -
of the Educational Pianning Service (MEN), the Director of Urban Planning
and Housing (MTPUL) vith responsibility for the design, procurement and
supervision of civil works; the Director of the National Service for
Employment of the MTPS responsible for the SNE component; the head of the
National Commission for Vocational Training Coordination responsible for the
CNFE component; and the Director of Finance (MFEN). The PTF would be
responsible for overall planning, general coordination and monitoring of
project progress and for procurement. Liaison with the Aasociation and
project accounting would be the responsibility of the DGEN through its
Director. The expatriate advisor to the Director General and the expatriate
accountant in the MEN Financial Service would continue to assist the DGEN
staff; consequently, no additional technical assistance would be needed for
project management. Funds have been added for equipment and vehicles,
operational travel and incremental operating costs. Annex 3.2 shows the
project implementation schedule.
3.28 Civil works and related professional services. Ic necessary, the
MTPUL would hire consultants, in accordance with Bank gStdelines, for any
professional services related to the civil works for the CRIPEN. In
addition, the MTPUL would, in liaisnn with the DGEN, be responsible for
site identification and survey, civil works design and procurement,
construction, supervision and maintenance. More specifically, this work
would be undertaken by MTPUL's Directorate of Urban Planning and Housing,
coordinating the Division of Urban Planning and Housing and the Division of
Public Construction (which consists of about 10 architects/urban planners,
civil engineers and draftsmen); MTPUL's Procurement Section would review
bid documents and contracts for all civil works.
3.29 Technical Assistance and Training Abroad . All specialists' services
would be procured under contracts on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA
in accordance with IDA's guidelines for the use of consultants. List of
specialist services and training is given in Annex 3.3. During
negotiations, the Government confirmed its intention to apply IDA's
guidelines for the use of consultants.
3.30 Maintenance. In the past, the MTPUL, the mobile unit of the MEN and
the local governments in rural areas have maintained well the ongoing
project's institutions as well as the other education buildings. This
practice is expected to continue.
3.31 Ernvironmental ImPact. This project is not expected to have any
adver,e effect on the environment, because of the small size of the
constructions involved.
3.32 Women's Edacation. As provided in para. 2.06, the proportion of
females in primary school enrollment is reasonably high considering the
recent growth of country's education system and its nomadic population. The
proportion of females is lower in secondary (35 percent) and higher
education (8 percent) because of the time needed for enrolled population
including girls to move through primary education and to transfer into the
upper levels. Further expansion of primary education will boost female
access to this level. Durina necotiations, the Government agreed to
maintain financial incentives to increase females access to secondary and
higher education (para. 3.16).

3.34    Given the experience under the First Education Project with
international competitive bidding (ICB) for civil works, it is expected that
projected contracts, due to their small size (averaging US$0.7 million),
would fail to attract overseas bidders and would therefore be awarded after
local competitive bidding (LCB), according to procedures acceptable to IDA
(Under the ongoing project, ICt for contracts of this size have not resulted
in any bid from abroad). Equipment, furniture, vehicles and textbooks would



- 18 -
be grouped to the extent practical into packages suitable for biddings which
would account for about 80 percent of the total value of goods. The
remaining 20 percent would be grouped into minor packages suitable for other
procurement methods acceptable to IDA, as per the footnotes of the above
table. Procurement packages (announcements, bid documents at±d proposed
awards) exceeding US$500,000 for civil works and US$50,000 for goods would
be subject to IDA's prior review, and wou..ld cover about 90 percent of the
estimated value of the contracts. For goods contracts valued at between
US$25,000 and US$50,000 equivalent, two confirmed copies of each contract
would be subject to post-review by IDA before withdrawal of the funds from
the credit account. Contracts valued at less than US$25,000 equivalent
would be held by the borrower for review by IDA supervision missions and for
audit. During negotiations, the Government confirmed its intention to apply
the procurement procedures and arrangements outlisned above.
2. Special Account
3.35   To facilitate disbursement, an amount in FD equal to US$0.3 million
equivalent, would be advanced from the IDA credit and deposited in an
institution acceptable to IDA. That amount is estimated to cover about
three months of expenses for all project expenditures finaaced by the
proposed credit.
3. Accounting. Auditing-and RePorting
3.36   The Project 'Director would maintain separate accounts for the IDA
credit. These accouits would be subdivided into expenditures for each
component. Durina negotiations, the Government gave assurances that: (a)
IDA project accounts, including disbursements against statements of
expenditures (SOEs), would be audited annually by an independent auditor
acceptable to IDA, within the six months following the end of the borrower
fiscal year beginning in 1991; (b) the Project Director would submit to IDA
semi-annual reports on project implementation and expenditures by June 30
and December 31 of each year beginning in 1990, and a completion report
within six months of the closing date of the proposed credit.
4. Disbursements
3.37   Disbursements under the proposed IDA credit would be made on the
basis of categories and percentages shown in Table 3.4. Applications to IDA
would be aggregated into packages of at least US$20,000 equivalent.
Expenditures for operating costs and expenses related to contracts and/or
expenditures valued at less than US$25,000 equivalent would be reimbursed
against certified statements of expenditures (SOEs), for which the
documentation would be retained at the DGEN, for review by IDA supervision
nissions and for annual audits. Applications for reimbursement would also
include a bank statement of the account transactions since the last
application, with the balance certified by the bank holding the account.
The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 3.4.

IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
4.01        Benefits.  The project would establish a framework for expanding
the education sector by: increasing its cost-efficiency; tying sectoral
investments to the Government's capacity to meet the incremental recurrent
costs; and for improving the relevance and quality of aducation while
assisting in institution-building throughout the sector.
4.02        The most immediate direct impact of this IDA-financed project on
primary education would be a 17 percent increase in enrollment. More
important long-range contributions would be: a restructuring and reduction
of the costs of primary teachers without sacrificing their quality;
important revisions of the curricula at the primary and lower secondary
.Levels and for primary teachers' training, leading to quality upgrading; and
the progressive structuring, through the National Commission for Vocational
Training and Employment, of the Vocational Training sub-sector.
4.03       Risks.  The risks include inadequate staffing and technical
capacities throughout the educational and training system. Agreements
reached on additional staffing and a sizable training program supplemented
by specialist services in key areas are included in the proposed project to
help overcome these weaknesses.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01  Prior to negotiations.  The Government has provided IDA with a policy
statement encompassing the Government's medium-term strategy and related
measures investment program and financing arrangements (para. 3.17);

SOCIO-ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
A. THE COUNTRY
1.         The Republic of Djibouti is a small country of 23,000 sq. km.
with several social and economic difficulties that hinder its development.
Located at the mouth of the Red Sea, Djibouti is bordered on the north, west
and southwest by Ethiopia and on the southeast by Somalia. Djibouti became
independent in 1977 and joined the World Bank in 1980. It is classified by
the United Nations in the least developed countries group.
2.         The country is characterized by a rugged topography, with
elevations ranging from 150 meters (m.) below sea level to 2,000 m. above.
Its climate is very hot, and in the absence of any perennial rivers, the
lack of fresh water is a major physical constraint. An estimated 1 million
head of livestock are herded by the nomads who comprise roughly 20 percent
of the total population. Only about 600 hectares of land are cultivated,
although some 6,000 hectares are potentially cultivatible. The country's
fishing potential is just beginning to be exploited. Apart from reservoirs
of the geothermal steam, there are few proven natural resources except
salt, limestone, gypsum and other raw materials used in construction. The
manufacturing sector is limited to a number of small-scale establishments
producing for the domestic market.
B. THE POPULATION
3.         The population was estimated at between 400,000 and 450,000 in
mid-1986, including about 40,000 refugees from neighboring countries. About
two-thirds of the population live in Djibouti-City. The rate of population
growth is estimated at about 3 percent. Nearly 40 percent of the population
is below 14 years of age. The age structure of the population, its rapid
increase and the influx of refugees have resulted in acute employment
problems.
C. THE ECONOMY
4.         In spite of its unfavorable climate and limited resources,
Djibouti has been able to benefit from its strategic location and its
bistorical and regional ties to build upon the service-oriented economy
inherited at independence. While both the primary and secondary sectors are
underdeveloped, accounting for less than 20 percent of GDP, there is a
relatively important tertiary sector based mostly on official and unofficial
trade with neighboring countries and the presence of a large number of
French military and civilian personnel. Other services center around the
port of Djibouti, shipyards a-id the railway to Ethiopia. The activities are



_ 25 _                              ANNEX 2.1
Page 2 of 2
vulnerable as they depend highly on the fluctuating external demand for
services.
5.         The economy is highly open, notable for a complete absence of
trade barriers and exchange restrictions, and there is a free trade zone at
the port. Merchandise exports of local origin are insignificant, and the
country depends heavily on imports of food and other consumer goods.
D. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.         Real GDP declined on average by about 2 percent p.a. during the
period 1984-88, as compared with an average rate of growth of 3 percent
between 1978 and 1982. The main reason was the sharp drop in service and
construction activities. In 1989, the economy suffered a further setback
because of torrential rains that caused heavy floods and affected about 50
percent of the population of Djibouti-City.
7.         The external current account deficit improved substantially from
17 percent of GDP in 1984 to an estimated 4 percent in 1987 owing to a
reduction in imports and a sizable increase in unrequited transfers. On the
fiscal front, however, the budgetary deficit is worrisome. As a result of
some remedial measures taken recently with support from France, the overall
deficit, including grants, declined from 6.4 percent of GDP in 1984 to
around 5 percent in 1988. Capital expenditures have been reduced in
conjunction with a more cautious approach to borrowing and external debt
management.
8.         Djibouti is highly dependent on foreign assistance.  External
aid finances more than 40 percent of Government expenditures and represents
nearly 25 percent of GDP. About two-thirds of the total foreign assistance
are in the form of grants and one-third in the form of external borrowing,
mostly on concessionary terms. External debt outstanding at the end of 1987
amounted to US$152 million, or 40 percent of GDP. Because of heavy
borrowing in the early 1980w to finance infrastructure projects, debz
service payments increased rapidly from US$3 million in 1982 to US$13
million in 1987. They reached 7 percent of total exports, including re-
exports.

DJIBOUTI
MANPOWER AND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
OVERVIEW OF THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTEM
A. THE SYSTEM
1.         Djibouti's formal education system is closely modeled on the
French system. It consists of siX years of primary education, followed by
four years of lower and three years of upper secondary education, both
divided into general and technical streams. In addition, the country has a
limited non-formal education and training system of about 2,000 trainees;
this system is scattered through different ministries, national corporations
and associations, as a result of which there is overlapping and inefficient
use of resources. Since Djibouti's small size does not justify the
development of a higher education system, students (about 300 in 1989) are
sent abroad, mainly with government scholarships. Despite liberal
government policies regarding private education, the public education and
training sector still accounts for over 85 percent of primary and general
secondary enrollment. Vocational training is also largely funded out of
public revenues.
B. ENROLLMENTS
2.         The recent development of the Djiboutian public education system
has been impressive. Between 1980/1981 and 1988/1989, enrollment at the
primary level increased at 8.3 percent p.a. and at the secondary level at
4.9 percent p.a. as compared with a population growth rate of 3 percent
p.a.. moving at the primary level from about 15,300 students to 26,80  mnd
at the secondary from about 3,500 to 5,500. These improvements in access
have been achieved in part through a policy of double shifts which in
198711989 were applied to 80 percent of the urban and G0 percent of the
rural classrooms. Private education, which was very limited and stagnant
until 1984/1985, developed at a rapid pace between 1985 and 1989, moving at
the primary level from 1,234 students to 3,225, at the secondary from 148
to 986, and at the vocational from 457 to 1,082. In 1988/1989, female
students accounted for 41.8 percent of total primary and 34.4 percent of
secondary school enrollments.
C. TEACHING CONDITTONS AND EFFICIENCY
3.         The teaching conditions within the education system are good as
compared with other African countries. In orimary education, almost all the
teachers are academically qualified, and 67 percent have received some
pedagogical training. The teacher/student ratio is 1 to 43; however, the
classroom/student ratio is 1 to 64 because of the double shifts. The
schools are well-provided with basic collective teaching materials. The
only textbooks available are for French language (one for two). Because of
the policy of automatic promotion, the repetition and drop-out rates are
low, and it takes only 7.6 instead of 6.0 student-years to produce a sixth
grade leaver. However, achievement is low as evidenced by the low level of
success on the final examinations which average 25.4 percent for the period
1984-89. This shortfall, as at the lower secondary level, is mainly the



_ 27._                              ANNEX 2.2
Page 2 of 2
result of poor teaching French (along with Arabic in the last two years) and
the inappropriate cultural and environmenta. content of the curricula and
resulting inappropriate examination standards.  In general secondary
education, the level of qualification of teachers (of which 65 percent are
foreigners) is adequate, and since 1981 the teacherlstudent ratio has been
stable at 1 to 23. The classistudent ratio, although higher than in 1981,
is still 1 to 33. Although this ratio seems acceptable,it masks
overcrowding in the general secondary schools in Djibouti-City. In the
technical streams, the teacherlstudent ratio is 1 to 15. The secondary
schools are well-provided with teaching materials; textbooks are accessible
to students through a rental scheme; and the laboratories and workshops are
fully used. Internal efficiency is reasonablet it takes about 5.1 instead
of 4.0 years, and 4.1 years instead of 3.0, to produce a lower and upper
secondary last grade leaver, respectively. However, the rate of success on
the graduation examination is low, averaging, between 1984-89, 47 percent
for lower and 56 percent for upper general secondary (baccalaureat) and 46
percent at the lower and 53 percent at the upper technical education levels.

DJIBOUTI
MANPOWER AND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
MANAGEM4ENT OF THE LABOR MARKET
A.    Flexible Planning
1.    The development efforts since independence have yielded tangible
results as regards investment and accumulation of capital. 'While the
results are real and important, all the available economic analyses (see
World Bank reports of 1983 and 1986) have stressed the relative fragility
and imbalances of the Djibouti economy, as reflected by the simultaneously
ambitious and constraining nature of planning procedures.
2.    Law 251/AN/82 governing the "economic and social direction ef the
Republic of DjiboutiO defines the general development framework for the
period running from 1983 to 1989. The Law, which is the basic point of
reference for the decisions by the authorities for promoting the country's
development, sets both the objectives and the means.
3.    The economic and social objectives were set as follows (see Title I,
Article 2):
-    the development of Djibouti as a major international maritime center;
-    efforts to lessen urban and rural poverty;
-    reduction in Djibouti's food expenditures;
-    industrialization;
-    reduction in the country's energy dependence.
4.    In order to obtain those objectives, the Law stresses training as a
critical factor and proposes three general thrusts:
-    reform of teaching and education to help future generations reach
their potential through programs adapted to national realities and
teaching cycles compatible with the technical and cultural needs of
the country;
-    establishment of quasi-academic (,eri-scolaires) institutions to help
the country's youth enter the national economy through the
establishment of small units and businesses that provide on-the-job
training (entreprises-6coles) geared toward the introduction of the
new technology needed by the country;
-    establishment ef continuous and accelerated training cycles for
Djibouti's managers through a transfer adapted to the real and direct
needs of the country of the know-how of existing managers,
cooperation personnel and international assistance missions.



- 31 -
ANNEX 2.4
Page 2 of 4
S.    Training as a vehicle for the country's development is critical,
given the scarcity of Djibouti's resources beyond tha skills and quality of
its manpower.
6.    Two other aspects of that Law should be brcaght out:
-    the relatively precise and operational nature of the proposals for
the development of human resourcas. There is a heavy stress on
strengthening the direct abilities of local managers and manpower;
-    the inadequacy, if not total lack, of features aiming at lowering
under-employment and the need, if the above-mentioned objectives are
to be achieved, to implement an active policy in that area.
B.    Structural Weaknesses
6.    These ambitious objectives are hampered by insufficient diagnostic
studies on the establishment and running of the structures. In this
connection, there seems tG ve a definite insufficiency in funding and poor
oversight by the government entities directly involved in the management of
the labor market.
7.    The Planninm  Department is a lightweight structure that has been
attached to various ministries. It first reported direct to the Office of
the President, then to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance, and is
now under the Prime Ministry. It has an important task in taking stock of
the last 10 years and, on the basis of a systematic survey of the pertinent
ministerial departments, subsequently preparing a report on the achievements
in each area. This exercise should yield extremely useful information for
decision-making on the economic and social directions that more clearly
reflects the progress made as well as the constraints of the current
economic situation.
8.    The Ministry of Labor and Welfare has overall responsibility for the
management of the employment system, as well as the means associated with
the welfare payments policy. Its funding seems limited, if not inadequate,
given the development of problems related *;o employment. In point of fact,
as direct resources the Ministry has only some 90 staff, i.e. 1.4Z of all
total government workers, and the operating funds at its disposal are less
than 1Z of the national budget.
9.    The planned organization for this ministry calls for the
establishment of a Department of Employment and Vocational Training, but
thus far no such department has been set up. This is an impediment to the
development of a more active employment and vocational training policy.



- 32 -
ANNEX 2.4
Page 3 of 4
10.   The diagnostic study of the Ministry's structures suggests that it
is, primarily for reasons related to its means, limited to legal (labor
inspections) and management functions. This is unquestionably a priority
area requiring attention and proposals.
11.   The National Emplovment Office (SHE) is located within the Hinistry
of Labor. it essentially performs a recording function for the mandatory
filing with the SNE of all offers of and requests for employment. In
practice, it appears that there is not always compliance with this
requirement and SNE's real impact on actual placement procedures is somewhat
limited, for both the public and private sectors.
12.   The current sources (for data) on employment are essentially related
to the processing of administrativs data. There is no independent data
ccllection and compilation system. Two sources provide valuable information
on employment and can be used to trace developments in the sectors
-    registrations of firms with the Welfare Payments Fund (Caisse de
Prestations Sociales -- CPS) can be used to estimate the total number
of firms, their distribution by economic activity and wage-earning
personnel;
-    the filing of offers of the requests for employment with SNE can be
used to estimate hiring flows and the permanent level of under-
employment.
13.   The inventory on the organization of the management of the labor
market can be supplemented by a determination of the pertinent human and
financial resources of the Ministry of Civil Service and Industry. The
staffs of those two departments are respectively some 30 and some 15 strong,
whereas the total operating means at their disposal does not exceed 0.4? of
the country's operating budget.
14.   In sum, the weaknesses of the resources allocated to the management
of the labor market are both quantitative and organizational in nature.
This undoubtedly is responsible for two adverse consequences relating to the
problems analyzed aboves
-    poor assessment of the scope and rhythm of phenomena linked to
employment and imbalances in the labor market;
-    poor diversification of possible policy responses, which logically
means that the solutions for finding a better fit to the needs of the
economy are left in the hands of the training structures alone.

ANNEX 2.4
Page 4 of 4
C.    An Attempt at Coordination:  The National Training-Employment Program
15.   In order to help overcome the weaknesses discussed above, an
interministerial coordination program was established two years ago and is
overseen by the Prime Minister. The program has a comprehensive two-pronged
plan:
-    quantitative approach, for implementing the means, techniques,
projects and procedures that generate jobs;
-    qualitative approach, for reconciling training and the immediate and
long-term needs of the labor market.
16.   Without attempting to assess the success of the program, several
points can be raised:
-    the advantage of having a complete frame of reference for the
problems associated with training and employment;
-    the laudable ambition of the program aimed at simultaneously
developing study and analysis processes and organizational measures;
-    the introduction of a real process for centralizing and formatting
emplcyment data;
-    identification of major quantitative imbalances in the current
employment situation in Djibouti;
-    implementation of permanent labor procedures for the ministerial
departments involved and the establishment of a network for
exchanging the basic information that would result.
17.   However, it should also be noted that this program is aimed at
coordination and not implementation and as such actual progress depends and
will depend largely on the primary work carried out by the pertinent
departments and institutions and in particular the availability of detailed
information on employment and what becomes of students after they leave the
various training centers.

MANPOWER AND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LANGUAGES OF INSTRUCTION
I.    Teaching of French
1.    The teaching of French is now based on a method used in all schools
(CLAD method) and a text entitled 'Livre Unique de Frangais, Pour Parler
Francais' published by EDICEF. Developed by the Applied Linguistics Center
of Dakar for Senegalese students, the CLAD method does not, at first sight,
seem totally relevant to the Djibouti context. It however does have the
merit of being used, with a sufficient number of texts, in all classes. It
also responds to certain linguistic dictates in learning a foreign language
and is thus, from a pedagogical standpoint, relatively suitable for
Djibouti.
A.    The CLAD Method
2.    This method is based on six principles defined by CLAD as follows:
(a) priority of spoken French over written French;
(b) gradual and systematic introduction of phonetic and grammatical
difficulties detected by comparative studies between French and the
major languages in Senegal;
(c) language elements in "basic French,* whose base lexicon of 1,200
words was established scientifically;
(d) lessons constructed around realistic dialogues, associated with
familiar situations and using audio-visual aids;
(e) the teacher's tasks are detailed and teaching plans provided for each
lesson;
(f) simple and economical teaching aids.
3.    The adaption of the first book for teaching French by the Ministry of
Education and which has just been published satisfies a number of these
principles (a,c,f, and in part d). However, the gradual introduction of
phonetic and grammatical difficulties (b) is largely based on Senegal's



- 35 -
ANNEX 2.5
Page 2 of 2
linguistic situation and hence not suitable for Djibouti. Because it was
urgent to make certain readers more relevant for students in Djibouti, they
were transcribed rather than adapted. As a result, several themes such as
hunting and water are still occasionally removed from Djibouti context. It
would therefore not be advisable to proceed in the same way for the other
French texts or those for other subject matters, as adaption cannot consist
merely of several cursory refinements of vocabulary and illustrations.
4.    Beyond the phonetic aspects of teaching French that must be :eviewed,
the texts and lesson plans for the teachers were modified very little and
should therefore be revised. As regards, methodology, several refinements
could be made. The CLAD method, developed for Senegal, was designed more
for lower-level instructors (moniteurs) then primary school teachers
(instituteurs) and as such is extremely directive and constraining, taking
above all an overall approach to reading and grammar. Djiboutian teachers,
especially those at the primary level with tenure, would wish to have, in
addition to that method, texts that would enable them to introduce elements
of more analytical and normative pedagogy that would also be more responsive
to the types of question in the sample CEP tests and those for promotion to
the sixth year. With a general level that tends to rise with admission to
the teacher training schools, upgrading the quality of teaching requires a
diversification in teaching methods and approaches.
II.   Teaching of Arabic
5.    Like French, the teaching of Arabic should also be based on existing
linguistic and phonetic studies on the national languages. The teachers of
Arabic from the national Youth Association (ANJ) have begun an important
study of methodology for earning Arabic that incorporates certain steps and
themes used in the teaching of French. As such, they can use the same
teaching aids, e.g. feltboard with the same figures and learning situations.
Research and experimentation in the learning of French and Arabic would
certainly benefit from close coordination from both the linguistic and
pedagogical standpoints. Such coordination would be enriching for the
education advisors specializing in the teaching of the two languages.

MANPOWER AND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
LIST AND STATUS OF COST REDUCTION MEASURES
1. Cost reduction measures taken
(a) Teacher's career time span. In April 1989, the civil service
career time span was lengthened by about six years (from 19 to 25) while
maintaining the salary scale. The expected result is the slowing down
overtime of the promotion pace and related salary growth. In addition, the
new statute created a one year probation level (stagiaire) at a lower
salary than previous entry level;
(b) New primary teacher category. The new statute increased the
academic requirement (baccalaureat) for recruitment at the existing
linstituteur' level and created a new "instituteur-adjoint' category with
the academic requirements previously requested for *instituteur level"
while scaling down its salary scale.
(c) Teachers'housinR benefits. While the Government is considering
the revision of existing civil servant housing benefits, the Ministry of
Education has, in the last two years, started replacing these benefits
(monthly house renting cost averaging FD 100-120,000) by a monthly
indemnity of PD 30,000 for single and PD 40,000 for married teachers.
2.   Cost reduction and efficiency measures agreed upon.
(a) Pre-salary of trainee teachers. Replacement of the current
trainee teachers pre-salary of FD 80,000 by a fellowship amounting to about
FD 55,000.
(b) Support grant to secondary students. Cancellation of about 60 X
of the support grant to secondary students. Remaining support would be
awarded according to criteria taking into account students socio-economic
background, academic performance and gender.
(c) Fellowship for education abroad. Cancellation of fellowships for
attendance of general secondary education abroad. Higher education
fellowship budget is expected to be frozen for the period and new
fellowships (under bilateral financing) would be awarded according to
criteria taking into account socio-economic background, academic
performance, field of study and gender.
