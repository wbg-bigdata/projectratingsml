MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF DJIBOUTI
FOR A
MANPOWER AND EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Djibouti for SDR 4.6 million (US $ 5.82 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terris with 40 years maturity and help support the development
of human resources in Djibouti. The project would be co-financed by a
United Nations Development Program grant of US $ 0.42 million equivalent and
an European Development Fund grant of US $ 0.40 million equivalent.
2.    Background.  The shortage of qualified national personnel hinders the
development of Djibouti. Technical and administrative skills are seriously
lacking, which has created a need for and dependence on expatriates.
Djibouti natural resources are limited. While its long-term development goal
of becoming an international export manufacturing and service center relies
on its capacity to develop its human resources, only 9 percent of the
population is literate. In the education sector, despite considerable
progress at all levels since independence in 1977, primary enrollment
remains low anI access rates to secondary education are decreasing.
Technnical and vocational education is largely geared to skills which are
not in demand and the institutions in charge of manpower, education and
training development are weak.
3.    The formal education and training sector is closely modelled on the
French system. In 1988, education expenditures accounted for 13.9 percent of
government recurrent expenditures while total education expenditures
represented, in 1986, 5 percent of GNP. These figures understate the
financing available to the sector since they exclude the French contribution
which more than doubles total expenditures. Unit costs are high at all
education levels but the corresponding outputs are modest because of the
system's insufficient relevance to local conditions, particularly at primary
and lower secondary level.
4.    IDA involvement in Djibouti's education sector started in 1984
through the first education project expected to be closed by June 30, 1990.
The main objectives of this project, which is progressing satisfactorily,
are to expand primary education in Djibouti City and rural areas and to
strengthen educational planning.



- 2 -
5.    Rationale for IDA involvment.  IDA's assistance strategy aims at
helping the government reinforce the development of the country and
designing a viable long term development strategy within which IDA and other
donors can provide assistance to help diversify the economy. Given the
scarcity of Djibouti's natural resources and the significance of human
resources in the development process, manpower and education is therefore a
suitable sector in which to pursue such a strategy. IDA's involvement is
justified by the agreement reached with the government on: (a) a policy
framework and investment program to improve the sector's cost-efficiency,
access and quality; and (b) a financing plan of the education investment
program by different donors (African Development Fund - AfDF; French
Government, Kuwait and IDA with co-financing of the United Nations
Development Program - UNDP - and the European Development Fund - EDF).
6.    Policy framework.   The project would support government policies and
complement other donors'contributions to the investment program. This
program aims at improving the coordination of vocational training with labor
market patterns, increasirng access to education and upgrading its relevance
and quality while improving the sector's cost-efficiency. These policies
address:
(a) coordination of vocational training: (i) improvement of employment
data collection and analysis; and (ii) creation of a coordinating body.
(b) access to educations expansion of capacity while tying it to recurrent
cost financing capability.
(c) quality of education: (i) improvement of the relevance of curricula at
primary and lower secondary levels; (ii) strengthening of supervisory
capacity in rural areas; and (iii) development of an education research and
evaluation capacity.
(d) improvement of the sector's cost-efficiency: (i) introduction of a new
category of lower paid but qualified teachers; (ii) cancellation of new
fellowships for secondary education abroad; (iii) reduction of support
grants for secondary education; and (iv) review of the criteria for awarding
secondary support grants and higher education fellowships (with emphasis on
female enrollment).
7.    Prolect objectives.   The project objectives are to: (a) improve the
coordination of vocational training with labor market demands; (b) increase
access to primary education; (c) upgrade the quality of education at primary
and lower secondary levels; and (d) improve the management of the education
sector while reducing costs and improving resource allocation.
8.    Project description.  The project will have four main components:
(a) coordination of vocational training. (i) development of the
technical capacities of the National Service for Employment under the
Ministry of Labor; development of data on employment and undertaking of
studies geared to decision making and (ii) establishment of a National
Council for Training and Employment (NCTE) under the Prime Minister to
ensure proper liaison between vocational training and labor market. The
project would finance technical assistance, training, equipment and
furniture and related incremental operating costs.



- 3 -
(b) access to primary education. Construction and equipment of
three primary schools in the suburbs of Djibouti City and one school in the
Southern Region (Ali Sabieh) providing an enrollment capacity, in double-
shifts, of 4,500 or 17 % of 1988-89 enrollments.
(c) quality of education. (a) establish a National Center for
Education Research, Information and Production (CRIPEN) to (i) improve the
educational programs; (ii) develop appropriate teaching guides and
pedagogical documentation and (iii) evaluate the outcome of education and
assist in training of education staff; (b) establish two primary school
inspectorates in the rural North and South of the country to increase the
freqaency and quality of pedagogical support to rural teachers. The project
would finance civil works, furniture and equipment, textbooks, technical
assistance and training, and incremental operating costs.
(d) educational management. Strengthening of the Ministry of
Education capacity for planning and management through the establishment of
a Service for Studies and Programming (SSP) and related training and
studies. The project would finance technical assistance, furniture and
equipment, training and incremental operating costs. In addition, the
project includes funds for the preparation of future investments.
9.    The total costs of the project are estimated at US $ 7.52 million
equivalent of which US $ 4.72 million would be in foreign exchange. The
project cost summary and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and Methods of Procurement and Disbursement, as well as a
Disbursement Schedule are in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations (IDA only) in
Djibouti are given in schedule C and D respectively. A map showing the
projects components locations in the country is also attached. The staff
appraisal report, No. 8065-DJI dated November 17, 1989, is being distributed
separately.
10.   Agreed Actions.  The government has agreed on the following:
(a) conditions of effectiveness would be (a) the issuance of the
legal texts related to: (i) the establishment of CRIPEN, nomination of its
director, authorization of its budget and setting up of the commi.sions to
review the primary and lower secondary education; (ii) the statute of
primary education inspectors; and (b) that conditions for effectiveness of
the co-financing by UNDP and EDF have been fulfilled.
(b) conditions of disbursement on (i) the Nationral Service for
Employment component would be the hiring of two additional staff with at
least two years of higher education and (ii) the National Council for
Employment and Training, the issuance of its creating decree.
11.   In addition, the Government has agreed to:
(a) ensure that at least 90% of primary school teachers be recruited
at the level of assistant teacher (instituteur adjoint),



- 4 -
(b) furnish to the association revised curricula for primary
education, primary teacher training and lower secondary education,
(c) replace pro-salaries for teacher trainees with reduced
indemnities,
(d) reduce by 602 tho number of grants in support of secondary
education,
(e) complete and make effective new criteria for awarding fellowships
for higher education while freezing related budget, and
(f) exchange views annually with the Aisociation on the Borrower's
investment and recurrent expenditure budgets for the education sector for
the coming fiscal year.
Benefits. The benefits would bet (a) establishing a framework for expanding
the education sector by increasing its cost-efficiency; tying sectoral
investments to the government's capacity to meet the incremental recurrent
costs and (b) improving the relevance and quality of education while
assisting in institution-building throughout the sector. The most immediate
impact on primary education would be an enrollment increase of 4,500
students, equivalent to about 17 percent of 1988/89 enrollments. More
important long range contributions would be the restructuring and reduction
of the cost of primary teachers without sacrificing qualityl important
revision of the curricula at the primary and lower secondary levels and for
primary teachers training leading to quality upgrading and to the
progressive structuring through the National Commission for Vocational
Training and Employment of the vocational training sub-sector.
Risks The main risks associated with the project are the inadequate
staffing and technical capacities throughout the educational and training
system. Agreements reached on additional staffing and a sizable training
program supplemented by special services in key areas are included in the
project to help overcome these weaknesses.
Recommendations. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
