IRRIGATION PROJECT XV
1. PROJECT AND SECTOR BACKGROUND
Project Ba,ckground
1.01      The Govern-ment of Indonesia (GOI) has requested Bank Group assist-
ance for construction of the 11,600 ha Dumoga irrigation subproject in North
Sulawesi (comprising 5,000 ha of tertiary development and minor works in the
partly constructed K(osinggolan irrigation area, and construction of the
adjacent Toraut irrigation system to serve 6,600 ha); for institutional
support comprising the strengthening of irrigation planning and programming,
topographic survey and mapping; and for studies and investigations for irriga-
tion systems on existing transmigration sites in the Other Islands and for
further irrigation rehabilitation and upgrading in Java.
1.02      IDA staff also appraised the 8,100 ha Panti-Rao irrigation project
proposed for construction in West Sumatra. Kreditanstalt fur lWiederaufbau
(KfW) has informed GOI that subject to the Association's appraLsal findings,
it would provide financial assistance of about US$26 million for the Panti-Rao
project. A summary of appraisal findings on Panti-Rao is contained in
Annex 10, and separate financing, disbursement and procurement arrangements
would be concluded between GOI and KfW.
1.03      This staff appraisal report is based on the findings of a mission
composed cif Messrs. R. Hewson, P. Momal, I. Naor (IDA) and H. ten Have,
P. G. Herklots (consultants), which visited Indonesia in June 1979 to appraise
the DumogaL and Panti-Rao projects, and in October 1979 to appraise the insti-
tutional support and study components.
Sector Objectives
1.04      The Government's major objectives for the agricultural and rural
sector are to: (a) create productive employment to raise the incomes of the
rural poor; (b) increase domestic food supply to keep pace with rising
demand; (c) expand agricultural exports, particularly of smallholder
tree crops; and (d) ensure productive, sustainable use of Indonesia's land,
water and other natural resources.
Role and Performance
1.05      Despite a 4% average annual growth of production, agriculture's
share of 'GDP has declined from 40% to 30% since 1968, while its share of
exports dropped from 45% to 33% due mainly to the markedly increased
value of oil exports. Nevertheless, the agricultural and ruraLl sector
remains of overwheLming importance to the great majority of Indonesians;
nearly 80% of the population lives in rural areas, and agriculture is the
major source of income for about two-thirds of rural households and one-tenth
of urban households. Some 15.6 million smallholder families produce
subsistence and cash crops on 15.8 million ha, while 1,800 estates occupying
2.2 million ha produce mainly rubber, sugar, tea, palm oil, atnd tobacco.



- I -
1.06       Employment.  Agriculture's share of total employment decreased
from 69% in 1961 to 64% in September 1971, while in 1976 it ranged between
66% in March and 60% in October./I Nevertheless, agriculture remained by
far the largest single source (with 46%) of new employment during 1971-76.
Outside Java, employment prospects in agriculture appear quite promising,
given the sustained increases in the smallholder area, due to land and
irrigation development, including that under publicly sponsored and
spontaneous transmigration. In Java, rehabilitation of irrigation systems,
which generated significant employment in the last decade, should continue
to provide additional construction and farm work.
Food Crops
1.07       Production Growth.  Given its limited manpower and financial
resources, GOI has concentrated on increasing the production of rice, the
preferred staple food of the great majority of Indonesians. Rice production
increased rapidly (4.5% p.a.) between 1968 and 1974, chiefly due to irri-
gation rehabilitation and the provision to irrigated rice growers of fer-
tilizer and high-yielding variety seed, financed largely through the BIMAS
credit program. The growth rate slowed markedly to 1.7% p.a. over 1974-77,
in the wake of severe declines in fertilizer usage (due to restrictions on
private sector fertilizer trade), successive seasons of untimely rainfall,
and unprecedented attacks by pests and diseases, principally the brown plant
hopper and associated viruses. In 1978, a record rice harvest was achieved,
with better weather, improved and liberalized fertilizer distribution, and
nationwide Government distribution of recently-introduced pest resistant
varieties. Over the past decade, output of secondary food crops (maize,
cassava, soybeans, peanuts, and sweet potatoes) grew more slowly, at an
average of only 1.6% p.a., composed of a 1.1% p.a. average decline in area
(much of this land shifting to irrigated rice) and a 2.7% p.a. increase in
yield.
1.08      Demand-Supply Balance.  These gains in food output did not keep
pace with the 3.5-4.0% p.a. increase in demand due to rising population and
incomes.  Indonesia became the world's largest rice importer, with a record
import of 2.3 million tons in 1977, and about 1.3 million tons in 1978.
Simultaneously, wheat imports rose to 1.4 million tons in 1978, cassava
exports nearly disappeared, and soybean, maize, and coconut oil imports
began to grow. The "Indonesia Supply Prospects for Major Food Crops"
(Report No. 2374-IND of March 3, 1979) concluded that even with expanded
irrigation, and improved technology, extension, credit and marketing, food
production growth would not exceed 3.5% p.a., leaving a basic food deficit
up to at least 1990, with a rice deficit alone of 2-3 million tons.
lI In 1976, shares were 63% in March and 57% in October in Java, and 72%
and 66%, respectively, elsewhere.  The total drop in agricultural
employment from March to October was 6.7 million. Precise estimation is
difficult due to the surveys' shifting definitions and seasonal timing.

1.09       Future Strategy.  To keep rice imports at some reasonable fraction
of the wor:ld rice trade, and to prevent a widening food production-consumption
gap, productivity and area of both rice and secondary food crops must be
increased. In Java, rice-cropping intensity could be raised through water
storage projects anDd by explii-ing groundwater Rice yields ak,u cropping
intensity can also be increased by constructing tertiary irrigation and
drainage systems, and improving support services. In the Other Islands
there is potential ior new irrigation systems, including tidal and swamp
land development. Despite the scarcity of high-yielding tropical varieties
of secondary food crops, yields of existing varieties could be increased
substantially by improved husbandry, including use of fertilizer and
insecticides. GOI is just beginning to give serious attention to marketing,
credit, seeds and research aimed at varietal improvement for secondary
crops.
Tree Crops
1.10      Tree crops occupy about a third of total cropped land (coconuts
and rubber account for 80% of this), and generate almost half of total
non-oil export revenue. Smallholders cultivate 80% of the rubber area and
virtually all coconuts, coffee, cloves and pepper, whereas tea and oil palm
are grown primarily on estates.  Despite recent higher world prices for
Indonesia's major tree crop projects, only oil palm has shown sustained
large increases in production, due to investment programs by Government and
private estates. With the long immaturity of tree crops, static production
levels are a symptom of past low prices and neglect, especially inadequate
research and extension, and failure to replant with higher-yielding
varieties.
1.11      Smallholcler Development.  Efforts to revitalize the smallholder
tree crop sector are commencing on several fronts. One new approach, which
is being supported by three Bank-financed Nucleus Estates and Smallholders
(NES) projects, is for Government estates to plant and maintain rubber and
oil palm oan previously undeveloped land for three years, using farmers
selected to be settlers (including local landless families and trans-
migrants) as employees, and thereafter to supply the settlers with inputs,
extension, and processing facilities. Other new plantings of tree crops are
being included in transmigration projects. While the NES approach has been
mainly for new settlers, GOI has also initiated national programs to assist
geographically concentrated groups of existing smallholders to plant rubber
or coconuts themseLves, with fairly intensive support from Project Management
Units (PMUs). Effoarts to design a low-cost system of tree crop planting
with minimal demandLs on management are also starting. Given the vast area
of overaged and loiwyielding smallholder rubber and coconuts (smallholder
rubber yields are half those in Malaysia), the good market prospects for
these crops, and t'he Other Islands' land availability and natural comparative
advantage in them, rapid expansion of smallholder tree crops, using all
suitable approaches, is a high priority. As these programs will place a heavy
demand on technical and managerial personnel, major staff recruitment and
training efforts will be required.

Area Development and Transmigration
1.12      Java.  In 1978, about 85 million people lived in Java, at a density
approaching 650/sq km. The island, with 7% of Indonesia's land area, has
45% of the cropped area and 63% of the population. Java generally has
higher fertility and better infrastructure than the Other Islands; however,
its cultivable land is almost fully utilized, and in some higher watersheds
cultivation already exceeds ecologically safe limits, contributing to
increasing erosion, downstream flooding, and siltation of ports, dams, and
irrigation canals. GOI is preparing watershed development and integrated
development projects to address this problem.
1.13      Other Islands.  The primary program for new area development in
the Other Islands, as well as for creating employment and settlement nuclei
for Javanese migrants, is transmigration. An organized transmigration program
is important for regional and natural resource development in the Other
Islands, production of food and export crops, and creation of employment and
decent living conditions for landless Javanese. Unfortunately, this program
has long been hampered by unrealistic expectations of its potential for
resolving Java's population problems and for stimulating large-scale
regional development, by overly ambitious targets, and by weak, uncoor-
dinated implementation. Confronted by management problems, GOI reorganized
the program in preparation for Repelita III, by transferring implementation
responsibility from the Directorate General of Transmigration to the line
agencies normally responsible for each sector. This measure needs to be
complemented by continued attention to technical and policy issues including
(a) the suitability of the land for food crops, (b) the role of tree crops
and livestock, (c) appropriate target incomes and farm sizes, (d) the extent
of Government financial, marketing and other services to settlers, and
(e) the role of spontaneous migration. The Second Transmigration Project
(Loan 1707-IND and Credit 919-IND) is expected to address these issues.
Role of Government
1.14      While the private sector should be encouraged to expand its role
in agricultural input supply, marketing, and processing, Government
bears the major responsibility for infrastructure, resource conservation,
and other services. Despite marked improvements over the past decade, overly
centralized procedures, weak regional planning, and technical and managerial
manpower constraints have impeded agricultural and rural development
planning and implementation. GOI's concern for area development has also
increased the need to strengthen provincial and local planning capabilities.
Future programs responsive to GOI's stated objectives will necessarily be
complex, requiring closely coordinated programs of agricultural research,
extension, input supply, credit, land development, transport, pricing policies
and marketing. GOI must therefore continue to strengthen its key rural
development institutions, particularly through the education, recruitment,
training and retention of technical manpower.



-5-
Bank Lending Strategy
1.15      t:OI and the Bank generally agree on overall objectives and strate-
gies for the rurai sector.  While views sometimes differ on the relative
emphasis to _e given to different investments, and on the technical design of
some projects, such differences are not impeding Bank Group operations
generally and are usually resolved by further analysis and dialogue.
1.16      Projects.  Since the first of 13 irrigation projects was approved
in 1968, the Bank Group's agricultural lending has rapidly expanded to
include esitate anc Esmallholder tree crops, fertilizer production and
distribution, sugar, livestock, fisheries, research, extension, training,
seeds, tran8migration, and resource survey and mapping. The Operations
Evaluation Departmenit's Sector Operations Review of Bank Group agricultural
lending in Indone La (Report No. 2166, dated August 9, 1978) concluded that
despite deficiencies in some projects, the Bank's portfolio in Indonesian
agriculture was "of overall good quality and likely to contribute
substantially to increased production." Within the context of GOI's
agricultural strategy, future Bank lending is expected to focus on:
(a)  a diversiEied irrigation, flood protection, drainage and swamp
reclamation program to intensify rice cropping on Java and to
extend water management to the Other Islands;
(b) production of secondary crops, including second phase projects
for agricultural research, extension and seeds;
(c) smallholder tree crop planting programs; and
(d) area development projects aimed at (i) watershed management to
conserve soil and ensure long-term productivity in the densely
populated areas of Java, (ii) integrated rural development of poor
areas on Java, and (iii) transmigration.
1.17      Sector Work.  These projects have been and will continue to be
complemented by extensive sector work. Analyses of employment and income
distributiLon, irrigation, agricultural support services, and food crop
production have improved the Bank's understanding of the sector's needs and
of GOI's policies. Reviews of the rubber subsector, the transmigration
program, secondary food crops, land tenure systems, and the supply and
requirements of technical and managerial manpower for agriculture are now
underway.
The Irrigation Subsector
1.18      Although annual rainfall is normally in the range of 1,500 mm to
3,000 mm, its distribution from year to year is unpredictable and even
during the main welt season there are frequently periods when rain is
inadequate for iniltial stages of plant growth such as post germination,
tillering or flowering. Excessive rainfall causing flooding is equally



common and crop losses in early growth and at harvesting are significant.
Irrigation and drainage are essential for rice production therefore, and are
also important in controlling weeds and facilitating land preparation - both
major drawbacks with rainfed farming.
1.19      Rice is the dominant irrigated crop in Indonesia, accounting for
about 60% of the area of all major food crops harvested. In 1978 there were
some 8.9 million ha of rice harvested, of which about 7.7 million ha were
irrigated or grown in rainfed paddy fields which provide almost 95% of total
rice production. Irrigation systems serve an estimated 5.0 million hectares
of land, of which only 2.1 million hectares have technical irrigation./l
1.20      Irrigation development is the responsibility of the Directorate
General of Water Resources Development (DGWRD), which is within the Ministry
of Public Works. The DGWRD uses the facilities of Provincial Public Works
Offices and in addition frequently retains contractors and consultants to
carry out its work. It is organized along functional lines in six Direct-
orates (e.g., the Directorates of Irrigation, Rivers and Swamps) and has
about 1,200 professional engineering staff.
1.21      In addition to the six Directorates which carry out the regular
DGWRD development program, five special executive bodies /2 have been
established to execute specific development tasks which are funded from
GOI's development budget, frequently with foreign assistance.
1.22      The Bank Group has now made 13 loans or credits for irrigation,
drainage and flood control in Indonesia (totalling US$574.5 million),/3
concentrating first on the most urgent rehabilitation of existing works and
upgrading of operation and maintenance services and later on improving and
expanding irrigation systems and constructing tertiary systems to increase
irrigation efficiency. The first three projects have been completed, and
a project performance audit has been prepared for the first (PPAR dated
/1  The four classifications used are "technical", "semi-technical", "simple"
and "village". Technical systems have a water supply system separate
from the drainage system and the volume of incoming water can be measured
at several delivery points. Semi technical systems have fewer permanent
structures, have only one water measuring device (usually at the major
intake) and the supply and drainage systems are not always separate.
Simple systems have no measurement devices and have common irrigation/
drainage facilities. All those are controlled by the Ministry of Public
Works. The remaining "village" systems are constructed, operated and
managed directly by village authorities, usually without professional
engineering advice.

- 7
February i3, 1978 on Credit 127-IND). Performance audits are under
preparationi for the Second and Third Irrigation Projects. Conclusions of
the PPAR for the First Irrigation Project were that food crop production
increases and economaic returns exceeded expectations, and that the
project was an outstandinr  example of institution building.
1.23      The rehabilitation of about half of the major irrigation systems
(which cover 2.1 mi:Llion ha in Java) has been completed or is under way, but
poor drainage, inadequate flood protection and insufficient rural roads in
many of Java's irrigation systems continue to depress cropping intensities
and yields and hamper the flow of extension services, agricultural products
and inputs. Recent cultivation and deforestation of the catchments of
rivers serving irrigation systems is accelerating soil erosion, resulting in
serious downstream sedimentation and siltation problems. Additional work on
the major irrigation systems is warranted, and the ratler limited potential
for reservoirs and groundwater to expand dry season cropping should be
developed as far as practical. New gravity irrigation systems and swamp and
tidal land. development mostly outside Java offer prospects for increasing
rice production, although short-term economic returns on such iinvestments
are likely to be lower than for rehabilitation of irrigation systems or for
tertiary irrigation construction in Java.
1.24      When the Bank Group became involved in Indonesia's irrigation
subsector in 1968, the existing institutional capacity could not, unaided,
have supported the very significant accomplishments in irrigation
rehabilitation and construction over the past few years. In the course of
project work, the Bank Group has played an important supporting role in not
only improving the engineering and management capacity of DGWR) by providing
foreign and local consulting services and training, but also in strength-
ening the capacity of operation and maintenance (O&M) services in the
provinces and in ensuring that increased and timely budgetary support is
directed ito O&M. T'here have been important advances in the local contract-
ing industry and imiprovements in local consulting capability also. The Bank
Group has worked with the Government in introducing multiyear contracts,
with price escalation provisions, where previously work could 'be contracted
only on an annual budget basis with no guarantee of continuity of work for
contractors. More attractive mobilization and prompter payment provisions
have been introduced also, and an increasing proportion of work is now
awarded to local contractors and consultants.
1.25'     A recent Bank review of Indonesia's irrigation program /  concluded
that, to expand rice production at the same rate as demand (about 4% per
year), the level otE annual investment in irrigation should be further
increased by a'bout 20% by the end of the third Five-Year Development Plan in
1983. Implementation of such an irrigation investment programtwould demand
strengthening of DGWRD, especially in planning and project formulation,
training, and staff development. DGWRD lacks sufficient trained engineers,
a Irrigation Program Review Report No. 2027-IND, October 1978.



-8-
economists and other staff, and relies heavily on consultant services in
project planning and construction supervision. For the next few years,
DGWRD is expected to continue using such consultants in order to expand
investments in irrigation, drainage and flood protection. Training and
staff development needs are being studied with Bank assistance under
Irrigation Project XII, while strengthening the planning capacity of DGWRD
will be supported under the proposed project. Further expansion of
agricultural support services provided by other GOI agencies will be
necessary for successful implementation of the irrigation program, and the
Bank is planning to assist projects for extension, research, seeds and
fertilizer distribution.
1.26      Bank Group lending for Indonesian irrigation for the next few
years is expected to place roughly equal emphasis on Java and the Other
Islands, while paying increasing attention to institutional strengthening.
The basic problem to expanding irrigation investments is the lack of
sufficient numbers of high caliber DGWRD engineers who are free from
administrative functions to undertake engineering design and construction
supervision; a similar situation exists in project planning and economic
evaluation. A balanced program of investments in irrigation, drainage and
flood protection and swamp reclamation will be persued while seeking to
strengthen DGWRD in project planning, evaluation, implementation and
monitoring to gradually lessen the Bank's current heavy involvement in these
aspects. As progress is achieved in these areas, the Bank will also explore
the possibility of eventually moving towards a sector lending approach in
the belief that a broader involvement will permit more effective
consideraton of the critical problems in this subsector.
Project Formulation and Status of Existing Infrastructure at Dumoga
1.27      Project formulation is consistent with GOI and the Bank's objectives
and emphasizes development outside Java and the institutional strengthening
of DGWRD especially in planning and programming.
1.28      The Dumoga Project.  The Dumoga River is formed by the confluence
of the Kosinggolan and Toraut Rivers. Survey and hydrological measurements in
the Dumoga Valley were carried out in the late 1930s but work ceased with the
start of the Second World War. In the late 1960s, DGWRD started to prepare
designs for an irrigation system using the Kosinggolan River flows. After
negotiations with the British Government, a study was carried out by
Binnie & Partners in 1971 which recommended UK assistance for engineering
design, provision of equipment and construction supervision. Before this
materialized, construction was started on the basis of original designs and by
end-1975, the Kosinggolan weir, 10 km of main canal and 6 km of secondary
canal had been partly constructed. An agreement was signed in 1975 between
GOI and the British Government to provide consultancy services for: (a)
completion of survey and design for Kosinggolan main works; (b) construction
supervision, workshop management and O&M; (c) survey and design of a 500 ha



-9-
sample tertiary block; and (d) survey and design of the main works for a
system to irrigate the Toraut area on the left bank of the Dumoga river
using flows from the Toraut River. Bquipment was also provided for civil
works and workshop mtaintenance and repairs.  Air photography was undertaken
under Irriga on Project X, and further project preparation of the Toraut
system was completed by Binnie & Partners in 1978/79.
1.29      At preseitt the Kosinggolan main system is almost completed with
only minor repairs and improvements to be performed. The systeak comprises a
diversion weir, 34 km of main canals, 10 secondary canals covering a total
length of 22 km, and about 21 cross drainage structures and stop log
equipped checks. The net irrigable area which will be under couLmand is esti-
mated at 5,600 ha of which only 5,000 ha would be initially included in the
project due to limited assured water supplies. Few benefits are yet derived
because of the lac of tertiary and quaternary canals, except oln about 400
ha of the sample tertiary area.
1.30      The Toraut area is presently mostly rainfed but almost 1,050 ha are
supplied by simple irrigation systems constructed by farmers, one of which is
being improved under the Government's small scale irrigation program
(SEDERMANA). Construction of the access road for the headworks for the
proposed Toraut irrigation system was started in early 1980, and a contract to
initate works on the diversion structure had been signed. As presently
formulated, the Dumoga subproject covers less net irrigable area than
originally proposed (11,600 ha compared to 13,200 ha) based on the calculated
dependable flows from the two main rivers only (para. 3.07). Future expansion
of the systems by an additional 1,600 ha should be undertaken iE additional
reliable water from minor streams in the project area proves to be available.
1.31      Without protection of the Dumoga catchment, it is likely that river
flows woulcd change in character and that less water would be available for
irrigation, especially in the dry season. Shifting cultivation has already
started to encroach on the forests in the catchment, and would accelerate
without control. Accordingly, the government will create a Nature Reserve
(Cagar Alarn) covering the catchment area and establish suitable services for
policing the reserve and educating settlers. There are a number of unique
species of flora and fauna in the catchment area which warrant protection: the
Nature Reserve would. accomplish both objectives of catchnent and nature
protection. The World Wildlife Fund and FAO have been instrumental in
assisting the Directorate of Nature Conservation (DPPA) which is responsible
for the Reserve.
1.32      ]DGWRD Institutional Support Package.  Recognizing the need to
increase irrigation investments during the Third Five-Year Development Plan
ending in 1983 (para. 1.25), the Government intends to rehabilitate and
improve one million ha of existing irrigation systems, to construct about 0.7
million ha of new irrigation systems, construct about 2 million, ha of tertiary
systems in existing irrigation schemes, to reclaim about 0.5 million ha of
swamps, and to improve flood protection by improving rivers presently
adversely affecting about 0.7 million ha. The program makes great demands



- 10 -
on the planning, programming and surveying capacity of DGWRD which is
already understaffed and lacking facilities and training. Except for
projects receiving foreign assistance, economic analysis and the translation
of investment priorities into the annual budget is not applied to the
irrigation program. As the program expands more cases are likely to arise
of marginal justification and the setting of priorities and monitoring and
evaluation of ongoing investments assumes greater importance.
1.33      In discussing the planning and programming demands on DGWRD as a
follow up to the Bank's review of the Indonesian Irrigation Program (para.
1.25) the Government decided to seek IDA assistance to expand and
strengthen the DGWRD Directorate of Planning and Programming; to assist
topographic surveying and mapping contractors and provide better DGWRD
quality control; and to employ consultants for carrying out studies,
investigations and engineering design. The proposed institutional support
package was prepared by DGWRD and by consultants provided under UK
assistance in consultation with IDA staff.
2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The Dumoga project is located in the central part of North
Sulawesi, about 200 km southwest of the provincial capital, Menado. It is
readily accessible since the completion in 1978/79 of a main highway
connecting the area with Menado (financed under Cr. 388-IND).
Climate
2.02      The climate in the project area is tropical - hot and humid year
round, with average monthly temperatures varying only slightly from 260C.
Rainfall at Dumoga averages about 2,000 mm and is nearly uniformly
distributed throughout the year. September and October are relatively dry
months, and mean monthly relative humidity is around 72% (Table 2.1 and
Figure 5.1). The climate at Dumoga is favorable for growing a wide range of
crops, such as upland rice, corn and soybeans throughout the year, but wet
rice requires supplementary irrigation water.
Soils, Topography and Drainage
2.03      The Dumoga Valley is approximately 25 km long and 5-7 km wide.
Soils are fairly fertile sandy clays to clays, mostly alluvials of basaltic
origin. The valley is flat, surrounded by slightly undulating grounds where
lighter textured soils are found. Soil capability and drainage are suitable
for a wide range of crops.

Population, Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.04      Clearing and developing the Dumoga Valley for permanent farming
started in the 1970's. The present population is estimated at 32,000 (some
6,000 families) compared to 14,000 in 1970 and 4,000 in 1961. Up to the
1970s the Toraut area was virtually undeveloped with only scant shifting
cultivation. The major impetus for development was provided by the settle-
ment of transmigrants from Java and Bali, starting in 1973. Presently some
5,250 families are owner/operators or sharecroppers; the vast majority of
farms are between 1.0 ha and 3.0 ha. Land settlement is still taking place,
and it is estimated that by 1990 there will be some 10,000 families (Table
2.2), with average farm sizes of about 1.5 ha. About 70% of farm families
are expected to be owner operators with individual title to their lands and
15% share croppers; the remaining 15% of the population is likely to consist
of landless laborers or non-farmers.

Agricultural Support Services
2.05      Agricultural support services in the Dumoga area are as yet
insufficient because the area has only recently been opened up for farming.
Five agricultural extension officers (PPL) are based in Dumoga, but only two
have trainiLng in irrigated agriculture. Two small cooperatives (KUD) have
been established in Dumoga, and there are two fledgling village cooperatives
in the recently established transmigrant villages. The cooperatives lack
experienced staff and infrastructure, and are engaged mainly in drying and
milling rice and in trading soybeans. Credit services are provided by the
Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) which maintains three village offices in the
subproject area but only about 100 farmers availed themselves of credit in
1978/79.  [nputs are channelled through the KUDs and through private
traders. A 50 ha seed production farm is under construction by the provin-
cial agricultural service.
3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project would consist of the Dumoga irrigation project, a pro-
gram of institutional strengthening, and studies and investigations. The
Dumoga prolect would comprise (a) tertiary development to serve about 5,000 ha
of the existing Kosinggolan irrigation system and some repairs and improve-
ments on the main and secondary canal networks; (b) construction of headworks,
main, secondary and tertiary networks of the Toraut irrigation system to serve
about 6,600 ha of the left bank of the Dumoga River; (c) provision of
buildings, vehicles and equipment, surveys and mapping, consultant services,
training, and establishment of the Dumoga Nature Reserve; and (d) provision of
buildings and equipment for agricultural support services and establishment of
monitoring services.  The DGWRD institutional support program would consist
of: (a) strengthening the Directorate of Planning and Programming by providing
additional staff, office space and facilities, staff housing, training and
consultant: services; (b) establishing a pool of surveying equipment which
would be 'Leased by topographic surveying and mapping contractors, and
providing consultants for training DGWRD and contractor staff, for improving
quality control, and for planning improvements in topographic surveying and
mapping procedures of Ministry of Public Works Agencies. Four study,
investigation and/or engineering design projects would be carried out under
the project.
Proiect Works
3.02      Dumoga project.  Project works for completing the partly construc-
ted Kosinggolan irrigation system may be summarized as follows:
(a) completion of the main and secondary networks which include about
7.5 km of main canal and about 6.7 km of secondary canals, including
the repair of embankments, additional rock excavation in constricted



- 14 -
sections, reshaping of canal sections, furnishing check gates and
provision of additional drainage structures and bridges;
(b)  construction of a tertiary network to serve a net area of about
5,000 ha, of which 400 ha have been partially developed, to include
tertiary and quaternary canals at a density of about 50 m/ha,
tertiary and quaternary drains at a density of about 35 m/ha and
structures at a density of about 1 diversion box per 10 ha;
(c)  improvement of approximately 100 km of cross drains; and
(d)  design and construction of about 58 km of inspection roads along
main and secondary canals and about 200 km of 1.50 m wide roadways

supporting services for conducting four studies to assist the transmigration
program, further irrigation rehabilitation in Java, expansion of the
Jatiluhur irrigation system and irrigation and flood control on the Cibeet
River in West Java (detailed terms of reference appear in Annex 3).
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
3.07      The major water sources for irrigation are the rivers traversing
the Dumoga project area: the Toraut and the Kosinggolan Rivers. Several
minor streams enter the project areas downstream of the proposed diversion
sites but they have not been taken into account in determining dependable
water supplies due to lack of data. Dependable water supplies (main rivers
only) limit the irrigated area to about 5,000 ha out of 5,600 ha at
Kosinggolan, and to about 6,600 ha out of 7,600 ha at Toraut.
3.08      Water supplies at the proposed diversion site were calculated
from long-term rainfall and rainfall-runoff relationships. At Dumoga no
rainfall data were available for the watershed area, and data were
transposed from long-term recording stations. Rainfall-runoff relations
were derived from physically and climatically similar watersheds where
long-term data were available. Dependable supplies at the proposed
diversion site are half-monthly discharges equal to, or exceeded 80% of the
time.
3.09      Water demands were estimated from potential evapotranspiration
calculated by the modified Penman method, crop factors related to the
proposed cropping plans, effective rainfall, and percolation losses ranging
between 4-2 mm/day for medium to heavy textured soils. Effective rainfall
was based on half-monthly rainfall equal to or exceeded during 80% of the
time. The dominant crop planted is rice, which is also the largest water
consumer, with smaller areas allocated to secondary crops. Prior to
See Annex 1, Table 5 for detailed list.

transplanting, a net amount of 120-150 mm /1 of water has been considered for
land preparation and puddling of paddy soils requiring a peak flow in
tertiaries of 1.8 l/sec/ha. In order to reduce peak irrigation require-
ments, a staggered cropping pattern is planned in which tertiary blocks are
divided into 3 or 4 subblocks (golongans), as commonly done in Indonesia,
each commencing the cropping cycle in successive two week intervals. If
additionaL dependable water supplies can be derived from the small streams
(para. 3.07), the irrigated areas can be expanded without enlarging the
canals built under the project. At Kosinggolan, about 600 ha of additional
tertiary blocks could be added at tail ends of the system and at Toraut the
development of the right bank would add about 1,000 ha of irrigated land.
Table 3.1 shows monthly irrigation demands and dependable supplies.  Minor
water deficiencies of little impact on crop yields would occur' occasionally
at Toraut and Kosinggolan. The probability of occurrence of shortages
during successive mnonths is extremely remote.
3.10      Water quality for irrigation is good and chemical te!sts indicate
low salinity and low alkali hazards. No major sedimentation problems are
foreseen as most sediments are suspended colloidal particles.
Status of Design
31.11     Construction of the Kosinggolan system has been substantially
completed (para. 1.29). Orthophotomapping and contour maps of the service
area for the construction of tertiaries has been completed and the design of
tertiaries covering an area of about 1,000 ha is expected to be completed by
June 1980. Construction of tertiaries on or about 400 ha began in 1979.
The design for the improvement of about 100 km of cross drains in the
project aLrea is scheduled for completion in early 1980. No designs have been
prepared yet for inspection and access roads. Construction of tertiary
systems for the Kosinggolan system is scheduled to start in September 1980
and designs can be completed with the support of experienced local
consultants, supervised by foreign consultants.
3.12      Detailed designs, model tests and site investigations of the head-
works for the Toraut system were completed in 1978. Main and secondary
canals and related structures have been designed, and contract documents for
these and for the headworks can be completed in early 1980. Orthophotomaps
for tertiLary development are available and the preparation of contour maps
is scheduled to start when the project becomes effective. The design of
tertiary systems would commence in September 1980 and continue through
December 1982.
/I The smaller amount is applied following months of high ralinfall.

Kosinggolan tertiaries would be completed by mid 1983 and the Toraut system by
mid 1984. The implementation schedule shown in Figure 3.1 has been based on
the performance of contractors engaged in similar works in Indonesia's Outer
Islands, with a v:Lew to maximizing benefits by starting irrigation as soon as
possible after the headworks are complete. Institutional strengthening, and
studies and investigations under the project would start in 1.980 and be
completed within five years.

Cost Estimates
3.14       Total project cost is estimated at US$71.1 million, of which
US$31.9 million (45%) is the foreign exchange component (Table 3.3). The
above costs include provision for taxes on civil works contracts averaging 5%.
Quantity estimates for civil works for main and secondary systems were based
on the detailed designs. Unit rates, based on local costs prevailing in
April-May 1979 have been escalated to early 1980 prices, considering a 25%
increase in local costs during 1979. Cost estimates for tertiory development
at Dumoga are based on sample design of typical areas at Kosinggolan. Costs
of consulting services are based on recent contracts for similar services in
Indonesia. The direct costs of foreign consultants (salaries, overseas
allowance, home office overhead and fee), amount to about US$7,100/man-month.
Reimbursible expenses (travel, housing, field office overhead, reproduction
and printing, and other expenses) average about US$3,400/man-month, for a
total cost of about US$10,500/man-month. Total costs of local consultant
engineers amount to US$1,500/man-month (Annex 1, Table 9) while local
consultant draftsmen and other technicians have been costed at US$500
man-month. Physical contingenies of 20% have been added to the cost of civil
works, and of 10% to the estimated cost of equipment and services. Cost
estimates also include an allowance for expected price increases during
project implementation (25% of base cost plus physical contingencies based on
the following annual inflation rates:
(a) on local cost components: 15% in 1980 and 1981 and 10% thereafter;
and
(b) on foreign cost components: 9% in 1980; 8% in 1981, and 7% in
1982 and 1983.

Procurement
3.16      Procurement of civil works for the Toraut irrigation system
(US$12.8 million) would be divided into two main contracts each covering
main and secondary works on about half the area./l The sizable packages
should attract international contractors, and would be tendered on
/1 The costs quoted in this section are base costs without physical
contingencies or expected price increases (Annex 1, Table 11).

the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. Contracts for the
Toraut heacdworks (US$2.2 million), several minor works for supporting services
and the Nature Reserve at Dumoga (totalling about US$1.5 million), and for
office and housing construction for DPP (US$2.5 million) are small and are
unlikely to attract international contractors. They would be procured on the
basis of local competitive bidding. Tertiary system would be constructed
progressively as soon as reasonable number of tertiary offtakes on the
secondary canals havre been completed to make up sizeable contract packages.
Assurances have been obtained that tertiary works (US$4.2 million) would be
divided into about L.0 contract packages (i.e., about 1,000 ha each) awarded by
local competitive bidding. GOI is expected to complete the Kosinggolan main
system using the state-owned contractor which has constructed all works so
far, provided that tmit rates, suitably adjusted for inflation, do not exceed
the unit rates previLously applied under contracts awarded follcwing local
competitive bidding., and provided that the contract value does not exceed
$0.4 million.
3.17      Excepting 22 vehicles required for rapid start up of consultant
services, which wouLd be procured locally by consultants under the terms of
their contracts, vehicles (US$0.3 million) and motorcycles (US$35,000) would
be procured locally and financed entirely by Government because of a ban on
importation. Dump trucks for O&M (US$0.3 million), surveying equipment
(US$3.3 million), and soil mechanics and hydrological equipment: (US$0.2 mil-
lion) would be procured by ICB in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
Office equipment and furniture (US$0.8 million) would be procured in several
small contract packages by different project implementing offic:es. No
contract is expected to exceed US$50,000. Accordingly, office equipment and
furniture would be procured following normal GOI procedures involving local
competitive bidding. A preference equal to 15% of the cif cost: or the cus-
toms duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to qualified local manufac-
turers in the evaluation of bids.
3.18      During negotiations, an understanding was reached with the Govern-
ment on th,e use and content of standard contract documents for civil works and
equipment to be procured by international competitive bidding. The under-
standing on the use and content of standard contract documents for works to
be awarded under locally advertised competitive bidding is expected to be
reached by September 1, 1980.  Technical specifications for irrigation con-
struction have been prepared and are satisfactory, while for tertiary works
construction standards and criteria have been agreed. Other civil works (e.g.
housing) follow routine GOI specifications, while equipment to be procured is
simple in nature. Accordingly, prior IDA review of bidding documents for
individual contracts may be reduced, and limits for contracts requiring prior
cost review before tendering and award would be higher than in earlier
projects and would be US$1.5 million for civil works and US$0.2 million for
equipment.,

Disbursements
3.19      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 70% of total contract
costs for main and secondary irrigation works at Toraut and Kosinggolan.
Disbursements for tertiary construction would be at the rate of 100% of the
cost of tertiary structures, and against buildings at Dumoga for construction
supervision and O&M and the Nature Reserve at the rate of 100% of total
expenditure, all on the basis of certified quarterly statements of expenditure
(Annex 8). Documents would be held by PIBD for IDA inspection during project
supervision. Disbursements for imported equipment, dump trucks and furniture
would be made at 100% of foreign expenditures; for locally manufactured items
at 95% of local expenditures; and at 65% of the cost of imported goods
procured locally. Disbursements for studies and investigations would be at
the rate of 100% of foreign and local consultant services including the costs
of 22 start up vehicles. All other vehicles would be financed only by the
Government. To encourage environmental protection, disbursements would be
made at 100% against the cost of operating the Nature Reserve for the first
three years, on the basis of certified quarterly Statements of expenditure.
The estimated schedule of expenditure of the project, disbursement schedule
and allocation of credit proceeds are presented in Annex 1.
Accounts and Audits
3.20      Assurances have been obtained from the Government that PIBD, DPP,
DPPA, PROSIDA and PROSIJAT would: (a) maintain separate accounts for
subprojects under their respective responsibilities, (b) engage auditors
acceptable to the Association, and (c) submit to the Association audited
financial statements including statements of expenditure submitted in support
of credit withdrawal applications, and the auditors comments and opinions.
within six months of the close of each fiscal year.
Environmental Effects
3.21      In the Dumoga area the conversion of presently rainfed farms into
irrigated rice fields would help to limit the extent of shifting cultivation.
The catchment area of the Toraut and Kosinggolan Rivers would be protected by
the establishment of the Nature Reserve, thus helping preserve the forest, its
rich flora and several rare animal species found only in North Sulawesi
(especially the black ape Macaca migra, the Babirusa, the Burung Maleo and the
giant civet Macrogalidia musschenbrookii). There is no present occurence of
schistosomiasis in the project area.
4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Management
4.01      The Dumoga project would be implemented by PIBD, an executive body
of DGWRD. PIBD was created as an executive body to implement projects



- 25 -
benefiting from Bank Group financial support - starting with Irrigation
Project X - in the face of increasing work loads in DGWRD subdirectorates and
in PROSIDA, the first executive body responsible for earlier Bank Group-
assisted projects and the proposed Irrigation Project XIV. At present PIBD is
responsible for the implementation of the Kali Progo project in the special
district of Yogyakarta; the Way Seputih, Way Sekampung and Sungai Dareh-
Sitiung projects in Lampung; and for a number of studies, investigations and
designs of- future irrigation projects mainly in Lampung. In effect PIBD
concentrates on irrigation development in the Other Islands; PROSIDA on
projects in Java. Because of a rapidly increasing work load, PIBD faces a
shortage of trained engineers and administrators; to accelerate the develop-
ment of its technical capability it was placed under the control of the
General Manager of PROSIDA in mid-1979.
4.02      PIBD wou]d appoint by July 31, 1980 a project manager whose
qualifications and experience would be acceptable to the IDA to be stationed
on site alt Dumoga and responsible for construction management. PIBD would
also appoLnt assistant managers and operating staff as detailed in Figure 4.3.
Development activities in the Dumoga project are recently started, and the
activities of the various line agencies (agriculture, cooperatives, BRI,
transmigration, for example) are weakly coordinated.  Accordingly, committees
to coordinate the activities of line agencies have been formed both at the
Kabupaten and Kecamatan level, headed by the Bupati and the Camat
respectively, in wlhich the PIBD Project Manager would regularly participate.
To support these committees and promote continued close collaboration between
the various agencies, supporting services and administrative bodies, the
project would provide the services of a consultant Advisor for Development
Coordination (Annex 4).
4.03      The field organization (Figure 4.3) follows patterns used in other
Bank Group-assisted projects in Indonesia except that the project manager
would be a PIBD appointee stationed on-site. The deputy proj,ect manager would
be from the provincial irrigation office in Mienado.
4.04      The institutional support package would be the responsibility of the
DGWRD Directorate of Planning and Programming (DPP) which would procure and
administer consulting services, vehicles, equipment and support services. DPP
would progressively assume responsibility for project formulation and
appraisal and for supervising feasibility studies; and would establish
priorities for studies, investigations and engineering design, draw up terms
of reference acceptable to IDA and in consultation with the Director General
of Water Resources may assign responsibility for executing specific studies to
DGWRD executive bodies. DPP would review all progress reports and in
particular would assess the findings and recommendations of the studies as
they progress. PIBD would execute the study for existing transmigration
sites; PROSIDA the rehabilitation study on Java; PROSIJAT the Jatiluhur study;
and DPP the Cibeet study.  Once sufficient trained staff are available, DPP
may itself conducl: feasibility studies (Annex 3).



26 
4. 05     Equipment procured by DPP for topographic surveying and mapping
would be administered by two state-owned corporations (Virama Karya in Jakarta
and Inda Karya in Bandung). The equipment would be leased to surveying
contractors at a price agreed between the companies and the Director General
of Water Resources Development, sufficient to cover depreciation, repairs and
administrative costs.
Consulting Services
4.06      About 846 mm of local and about 128 mm of expatriate consultants
would assist PIBD in completing design, preparation of contract documents for
the Dumoga project, supervision of construction and in setting up O&M
organizations and procedures. In view of the limited number of PIBD qualified
technical staff, most design and construction supervision would be carried out
by local consultants. Expatriate consultants would guide design and
construction supervision, and review all designs prior to approval by PIBD's
project manager for construction. Consulting services would prepare the
design of tertiary systems and necessary minor modifications of designs for
main and secondary systems; and would supervise construction and setting up
the O&M organizations. Designs would be prepared in close proximity to the
project area in view of the need for frequent field inspections to fully
consider micro relief and farm boundaries. Summary terms of reference are
shown in Annex 4.
4.07      About 432 mm of foreign consultants would be engaged to assist DPP;
to improve the quality of topographic survey and mapping and to study the
survey needs of the Ministry of Public Works; and about 1,287 mm of local
consultants and about 401 mm of foreign consultants would conduct studies,
investigations and engineering design. Table 4.1 summarizes quantities and
costs of consulting services under the project. Assurances have been obtained
from Government that consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms
and conditions of employment would be satisfactory to the Association would be
engaged to assist with construction supervision, provide technical assistance
to DPP and to conduct studies and investigations; consultants to assist with
construction supervision and development coordination of the Dumoga project
would be appointed by July 31, 1980.

Operat ion and Maintenance
4.08      PIBD would be responsible for operation and maintenance of the
Dumoga project during the construction period.  Except for tertiary works,
PIBD would continue to operate and maintain the works of individual sections
spacing for one year following completion to ensure that all defects are
corrected and needed repairs are made before they are formally turned over to
the Provincial Public Works Department of North Sulawesi, which would
thereafter operate and maintain diversion structures and conveyance and
distribution networks.



- 28 -
4.09      The systems will call for newly established O&M arrangements by the
Provincial Irrigation authorities. Consultants have prepared plans for O&M
systems which are likely to be modified by the provincial authorities.
Accordingly detailed O&M plans have not yet been finalized. Assurances have
been obtained that the Provincial Government of N. Sulawesi would establish
an O&M plan for the Dumoga irrigation project in consultation with PIBD
acceptable to the Association by July 31, 1981; by October 31, 1980 an O&M
manager from the provincial irrigation staff would be appointed as an
assistant project manager; adequate O&M funds, adjusted to keep pace with
inflation and annual needs, would be allocated to all Bank Group-assisted
irrigation systems in future years; GOI would take the necessary steps to
ensure that at least half of the budgeted O&M funds would be released to
subprojects by August 15 of each year and the balance, in equal quarterly
installments thereafter, until the total amounts are fully released; to
upgrade the standard of O&M services and to effectively utilize the available
funds, GOI would progressively increase the number of qualified O&M personnel
in the Bank Group-assisted projects until the additional numbers to be
established by GOI in consultation with the Bank Group are employed; and GOI
would inform the Bank Group by December 31 of each year of the proposed number
of O&M personnel and per hectare O&M budget for each subproject; and by June 1
of each following year, it would submit the approved O&M budget and by October
1, the staffing provisions.
4.10      Shortly after construction of the tertiary works, responsibility
for O&M of the tertiary systems would shift to water-user associations which
would be established within the systems. Water user associations have been
established throughout Java, and their establishment has been a requirement
for the Bank's support for tertiary irrigation construction under previous
projects. Their establishment in Dumoga would follow the patterns and
functions of those in Java. PIBD would closely supervise the operation of
the tertiary systems for one year to ensure that all defects are corrected
and needed repairs are made before they are formally turned over to the
water-user associations. To properly operate and maintain the systems, each
water-user association would appoint a full-time water master (ulu-ulu) with
one or two assistant water masters, who would allocate the water to the
various users on a day-to-day basis and carry out needed maintenance and
repairs. The water-user associations would establish and collect contribu-
tions from all beneficiaries to defray the salaries of water masters, as
well as the cost of materials needed for maintenance and repairs. These
practices are presently in effect for completed tertiaries and are generally
satisfactory. Since the standard of O&M in these systems would be dependent
upon the existence of properly functioning water-user associations, assur-
ances have been obtained at negotiations that the Government would take the
necessary steps to ensure that: (a) before the start of construction of any
tertiary network a water-user association would be established to operate
and maintain it after completion; and (b) promptly when a tertiary network
is completed each association would determine an appropriate level of
charges and collect from its members such charges to cover the costs of
sound operation and maintenance of the system.



- 29 -
4.11      Training of O&M Staff.  On-the-job training would be provided at
the completed components of the Kosinggolan system for Dumoga O&M staff.
Agricultural Sulpjorting Services
4.12      The various line agencies providing agricultural and other support
services at Dumoga would strengthen their services by providiLng extra
facilities, equ-,.pment and training and by increasing staffing.
(a)  Extension Services would be strengthened by the Ministry of Agri-
culture under the second Agricultural Extension Project, for which
negotiations were concluded in February 1980. Strengthening would
include stationing at least an additional 10 PPL's in the Dumoga
subproject by April 1, 1981 and another 4 by April 1982; stationing
an ae itional PPS in the area to specialize in plant protection;
upgrading the existing facilities at Madomang and constructing a new
REC in the vicinity of Mopuya; and training PPL's iLn water
management.
(b) Cooperatives. The Department of Trade and Cooperatives (DTC) would
provide adequate facilities and office equipment for four KUD's and
would upgrade one existing KUD in the Dumoga area; construct a
150-ton fertilizer store and fertilizer kiosks in 9 villages now
served by KUD's; and provide motorcycles and training for DTC staff
and KUD personnel.
(c)  Farm Credit. Farm credit operations would be expanded under the
BIMAS program and funds provided for cooperatives under a national
program. The Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) would construct four new
offices and extend the existing office; provide ofi-ice equipment
and motorcycles; would expand the staff to nationaL BIMAS levels
and would provide suitable training; and would station a credit
specialist in the area.
(d) Land Development. The Department of Agriculture would establish
a land development unit with facilities, transportation and
equipment in Dumoga to identify land clearing needs and
priorities; help create and advise farmer groups on land clearing
and levelling; and provide adequate funds and contract services
for land clearing and rice field formation. The land development
unit would clear and level about 300 ha of land in Kossinggolan
and about 1,200 ha in Toraut under the project using machinery
and equipment procured under a bilateral donor country loan, or
using local contractors.
(e) Land Titles and Registration. The Department of Home Affairs
Directorate of Lands (DG Agraria) would survey, title and register
farmers lands in order to accelerate acquisition of right of ways;
provision of credit to farmers; and land clearing and levelling.
Agraria would provide an office; survey, drafting and office



- 30 -
equipment; motorcycles; and would strengthen staff numbers by
posting four experienced staff to Kotamabagu and stationing a
field unit of at least four surveyors in Dumoga.
4.13      Assurances have been obtained from Government that the Department of
Agriculture, Department of Trade and Cooperatives (DG Cooperatives),
Department of Home Affairs (DG Agraria), and the Bank Rakyat Indonesia would
provide adequate funds, staff, facilities, vehicles and equipment for
supporting the irrigation development at Dumoga.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.14      A program to monitor project benefits in the Dumoga project area
would be undertaken by the Economic and Agricultural Faculties of Sam
Ratulangi University (UNSRAT) in Menado, supported by the Agro-Economic Survey
in Bogor and by the consultant Advisor for Development Coordination
(para. 4.02). A Consultative Committee including representatives of the
local administration and university staff would be established to guide the
monitoring program, and a site Monitoring Office would be set up under the
Kecamatan's Economic Section to compile, check and improve the data collected
by various other offices (agricultural production, population and employment,
cooperatives and marketing, credit and taxes, etc.). The Kecamatan office
would be run by qualified staff (at least SMA with 3 months training in
Kotamobagu). Monitoring reports from the project would include (a) construc-
tion reports from the PIBD project manager; (b) summary compilations of
relevant project area data by the monitoring office; (c) UNSRAT survey and
study reports including the development of water-user associations among
different farmer groups, and (d) reports from DPPA on Nature Reserve
operations. The consultant Advisor for Development would be responsible for
grouping these reports or summaries of on-going activities into 6 monthly
reports to be circulated to the local administration, and to the Monitoring
and Evaluation Section, Directorate of Planning and Programming in Jakarta.
Catchment Protection
4.15      The Directorate of Nature Conservation (DPPA) of the Directorate
General of Forestry would be responsible for establishing a Nature Reserve
covering at least 100,000 ha including the Dumoga watershed through a decree
promulgated by the Ministry of Agriculture. DPPA would provide staff,
equipment and services for permanently marking the boundaries of the reserve;
for policing it and permanently stopping all illegal logging and hunting; and
for carrying out an education program for settlers and visitors. The World
Wildlife Fund would assist DPPA in this work and would provide 36 m/m of
expert services, vehicles and motorcycles, training and specialized equipment.
Assurances have been obtained from Government that the Minister of Agriculture
would promulgate a decree establishing a Nature Reserve, covering at least
100,000 ha of the Dumoga catchment by July 31, 1980; take steps to continously
police and prevent logging activities in the Nature Reserve; and by July 31,
1980 enter into an agreement satisfactory to the IDA with the World Wildlife
Fund for assisting DPPA in establishing and operating the Nature Reserve.

5.  AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
5.01       The project would substantially increase rice production by pro-
viding irrigation and drainage, with irrigated rice cultivation replacing
rainfed rice and secondary crops; some land presently under secondary
forest and scrub would also be brought under rice production. Details of
expected changes in agricultural production and cropping calendars within the
area to be irrigated at Dumoga are summarized in Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1.
Present Situation
5.02       Within the gross area, there are presently about 2,850 ha of wet
rice fields (sawah), 1,800 ha in Kosinggolan and 1,050 ha in Toraut. Most of
these sawahs benefit from simple irrigation. Rice cropping intensity is
estimated at 140%, an additional 40% growing a palawija crop, mainly soybeans,
and 20% remaining fallow in the dry season. Some 1,500 farmers, mainly
transmigrants, are estimated to use BIMAS inputs. Overall fertilizer
consumption is low because soils are fairly fertile. All stages of crop
growth can be observed in the fields because seasons are not well marked and
there is no perceived need for coordinated cropping calenders to be followed.
In addition poor dLrainage is responsible for a fallow vegetation of weeds and
volunteer rice after harvest. The situation is favorable to a variety of
pests, diseases arnd rats (major rat damage was reported in 1970, 1974 and
1978). lTo allow c:omparisons with the future situation the distinction between
wet and dry seasons has been maintained, the wet season extending from June to
November, the dry season from December to May. Average yields are low. Wet
season yLelds are estimated around 2.0 tons/ha and dry season yields at 2.2
tons/ha.  The prodLuction of sawahs is about 8,000 tons paddy and 1,000 tons
soybeans.
5.03       Upland fields presently cover some 4,000 ha. Cropping intensity
on uplanid fields :Ls around 250% over three cropping seasons in November-
February, March-Jlne and July-October, the second season being unfavorably
influenced by heavy rain. The main crops are soybeans for about 75% of the
harvested area and maize on the remaining 25%; groundnuts, vegetables and
roots and tubers are also grown but to a minor extent. For purposes of
analysis soybean has been retained as representative of all secondary crops
with present yieldls around 0.8-0.9 tons/ha. Upland production of secondary
crops is thus estimated at 8,500 tons.
Future Without Project
5.04       It is assumed that without the project, tertiary development would
take place in Kosinggolan at a slower rate and less extensively. Investment
would be kept low and much of the work would be left to the i-armers.  As a
result sawah areas would likely increase from 1,800 ha to 3,400 ha, over a
ten-year period and cultivation practices would change little. On the Toraut
side no construction would take place but clearing and land dlevelopment mostly
for rainfed farming would continue; sawah areas would increase from 1,050 ha
to 2,000 ha (but not irrigated) and total cultivated area from 3,700 ha to

- 33 -
6,200 ha also over ten years. Overall, sawahs would cover 5,400 ha and upland
fields would be reduced to 3,050 ha. Rice cropping intensity would increase
to 165% with yields of 2.2 tons/ha in the wet season and 2.4 tons/ha in the
dry season. Paddy production would thus increase to some 20,000 tons, 10
years frolm now. W:Lth unchanged yields for secondary crops, the combined
production of sawahs and upland fields would reach some 8,000 tons of
soybeans.
Future With Project
5.05      Under the project, a total of 11,600 ha of sawahs would be supplied
with dependable irrigation. Given available water supplies, 67% of this area
could grow two rice crops each year while 33% would adopt a riLce-soybean
rotation. Areas supplied with irrigation for only one rice crop would be
rotated from year to year so that every farmer would plant soybeans once in
three years. The proposed cropping calendar (Figure 5.1) is mainly determined
by water availability, especially the canal closure period during the three
first weeks of November. Yields are projected to reach 3.1 tons/ha in the wet
season and 3.6 tons/ha during the dry season. The higher dry season yields
are due to better weather conditions and to the relatively long dry fallow
period preceeding it which reduces the damage of pests and diseases and allows
better field preparation. A slow build up of the yield levels over five years
has been assumed because most local farmers are not familiar with intensive
irrigated agriculture and because of the time needed to complete land clearing
and develop sawah lands from upland fields. Total paddy production at full
development is projected at some 64,000 tons (or some 46,000 tons incremental
attributable to the project), and soybean production at 4,500 tons.
Drying, Storage and Processing
5.06      Virtually all paddy is sun-dried on mats in house yards or along the
roads and afterwards stored in the farm houses. Especially whien weather
conditions are rainy and erratic during the harvesting periods, drying of the
threshed grain requires much care and labor to prevent deterioration of
quality due to excess moisture; however, families have grown adept at drying
and will be able to prevent serious losses due to high moisture content.
Milling capacity is presently adequate and it is expected that, when the need
occurs, local enterprise will expand capacities in line with production.
Milling standards are presently rather low as the output contains impurities
and up to 35% brokens.

6. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Indonesian rice production has been unable to satisfy demand for
many decades. From 1969 to 1976 imports ranged between 0.5 and 1.3 million
tons. In 1977/78 imports rose to about 2.3 million tons; because of an
excellent 1977/78 harvest, imports during 1978/79 were at 1.3 million
tons; 79/80 imports, however, are expected to be substantially higher.
Rice-oriented policies have been a major element of the Government's
development strategy in Repelita I and II (1969/70 to 1973/74 and 1978/79)
and continue to receive very high priority. As a result of the heavy
investments aimed at increasing the domestic supply of rice, production is
expected to grow at between 3% and 3.5% p.a. to 1985; this, however, would
still imply an average annual rice deficit of 2 to 3 million tons in 1985
(10% to 15% of the total producton)./1 Continuation of high investment
rates over the next ten years could reduce the average expected annual
deficit to 2 million tons in 1990. Marketing prospects for paddy should
therefore remain eminently favorable in the future.
6.02      Dumoga is a rice surplus area, selling rice surplus to consumption
needs mostly to Menado; the projected increase of 46,000 tons paddy per year
attributable to the project would also be marketed in Menado.]2 Maize
production (2,000 tons) would virtually disappear and soybean production
would fall from 7,200 ton per year presently to 3,500 tons at full project
development. Maize would have been consumed locally or in Kotamobagu while
soybeans would have been exported to Menado and Java.
6.03      In the Dumoga area there is virtually no trade in paddy as farmers
have their paddy milled and sell rice. The vast majority of trade is carried
out by the farmers or private traders. Milling, transportation and
marketing appear fairly competitive with some millers extending free credit
to attract customers. Working back from a minimum rice price of Rp 165/kg
and taking into account a 6% milling charge, farmers get a price of about
Rp 95/kg paddy. The Government procurement agency (BULOG/DOLOG) and its
agents in the villages (BUUD/KUD) are not very active at present. It is
expected that the private sector will be able to handle the substantial
increase in rice trade.
Prices
6.04      For both the farm budgets and economic analyses, farm inputs and
outputs have been valued at early 1980 prices. Economic prices are expressed

/2 Projected future with project compared to future without project.

in border prices. For rice, soybeans and fertilizers, economic prices were
derived from the Bank's Commodity Division's forecasts for world market
prices, and adjusted for transportation and other costs; the calculations are
shown in Annex 2, Cable 3.  The remaining inputs not traded on the inter-
national market have been expressed in terms of actual (farmgate) prices. All
prices used in the analyses are summarized in Table 6.1. Rice produced under
the project would substitute for Indonesian rice imports of 25% broken quality
rice. It has been shown that the world market price for this quality of rice
is about 90% of the standard 5% broken Thai white rice price and this figure
has been used to project the future cost savings in Indonesian rice imports.
The economic price of soybeans has been calculated under the assumption that
Indonesia would remain a net importer of soybeans. Indonesia has been a tra-
ditional exporter of limited amounts of soybeans until the last three years;
it has since turned to be a net importer under the continued influences of
increasin,g domestic demand and of slackening production. It is not expected
that production will keep up with demand in the coming years. Sensitivity
analyses include, however, the case of 10% lower rice price, (which in addi-
tion to world market prices sensitivity, illustrates the case where successful
BULOG purchasing strategies on the international marketcan reduce the cost of
imports to the Indonesian economy) and the case where Indonesia turns to be an
exporter of soybeans by 1985 (para. 7.12).
6.05       Historically, the Government has followed a policy of keeping con-
sumer food prices low by selling imported rice below its cost and keeping
domestic floor prices low. To mitigate the effect of this policy on farm
income, the Goverrtment has simultaneously subsidized fertilizer and pesti-
cide. In 1974 and 1975, however, the Government substantially raised domestic
paddy prLces to encourage rice production. This change in policy, combined
with the fall of world prices from the record levels of 1973-.74, brought
farm-gate prices fairly close to world market levels, taking into account the
quality differences. The floor price of paddy is expected to increase from
Rp 95/kg in October 1979 to Rp 120/kg in 1990 (in 1980 prices). Prices of
fertilizers would rise from a present low of Rp 70/kg to Rp 100/kg, an
increase warranted by raising oil prices and by the effects of the November
15, 1978 devaluation of the Rupiah.
Farm Incomes
6.06       Illustrative farm models have been prepared for farm income
analyses.  Farm sizes of 2.0 ha and 1.0 ha have been chosen and examined under
owner-operator an,d sharecropped conditions. While there are larger farms, it
is estimated that holdings will seldom be much larger than 2. 0 ha especially
as intensification develops with the supply of irrigation water. Detailed
farm budget calculations appear in Annex 2, Table 5 and are summarized in
Table 6.2. There is a great variety of farms in the project area; the models
chosen reflect the situation of farms presently cultivated (i.e. fields
entirely cleared) but benefitting from no irrigation supply; while the
cropping; pattern retained is assumed to be representative, wide variations are
to be expected in an area undergoing rapid changes; year to year changes would
also occur (para. 5.05). In the models hired labor is only necessary on the

Project Charges
6.07      The Government has effective mechanisms to recover a portion of
project costs through the collection of the IPEDA tax and of a water charge.
6.08      IPEDA.  IPEDA is a land tax collected nationwide by the village
heads and turned over to local and provincial administrations for use in
public services. Allocations of GOI funds under the local in,frastructure
development program (INPRES) are tied to IPEDA collection performance and
provide a constant incentive for high IPEDA collection rates. The IPEDA
land classification is based on soil fertility, quality of irrigation and
other yield determining factors and IPEDA levels are based on average pro-
duction levels on these classes of land; amounts collected would therefore
increase as crop yields rise and IPEDA land classification is modified in
the project area in response to the project. There is no mechanism relating
incremental IPEDA collection due to irrigation projects to incremental
allocations of O&M funds.
6.09     Water Charges.  Water charges are collected by water users associa-
tions and are earmarked for O&M of tertiary and quaternary canals and drains.
The levels of water charges vary according to the level of development of
tertiary, units but would average some 20 kg of paddy per ha per season in
the project areas. This is sufficient to pay for the service of the
water-master (ulu-ulu) and, where applicable, of his assistants; sometimes
the water charge is in the form of an area of village rice land reserved for
the water master.
6.10      Cost Recovery.  Present and estimated future levels of IPEDA and
water charges are as follows:

/a Present and future "without project" charges would remain the same.
/b At full agricultural development.
/c In constant early 1980 prices.
6.11      At full development water charges would cover O&M costs at the
tertiary level and incremental IPEDA collection would cover about half of
the recommended O&M level (Annex 6). Cost recovery indices comparing the
present value of direct Government recovery (incremental IPEDA) discounted
at 10% opportunity cost of capital to present value of Government costs
(capital and O&M of main systems) are 13% in Kosinggolan and 3% in Toraut.
These indices are low because of the high cost of irrigating previously
rainfed areas. However, the level of charges expected at full development
would be more than seven times that without the project and would therefore
represent a substantial effort from the administration. Further analysis of
the cost recovery issue should take into account lower Government expenses
for international rice procurement due to increased domestic production
(indirect recovery) and the advantages of IDA borrowing (indirect cost).

6.12      Rent Recovery.  From the point of view of the farmer, the project is
a windfall opportunity for realizing increased incomes (Table 6.2). The
project rent calculation shown in Table 6.4, attempts to separate earned
income increases (through increased labor, management, etc.) from "non-earned"
increases and the rent recovery index indicates how much of the "non-earned"
portion is returned to Government entities over the project life. Direct rent
recovery indices are mostly between 40% and 70%. About half the project
farmers have and would continue to have annual per capita incomes below the
critical consumption level of about US$110 in the without project situation.
6.13      Assurances have been obtained at negotiations that following com-
pletion of project works, the government would collect from farmers benefitted
an adjusted IPEDA based on the increased productivity of irrigated land,
sufficient to ensure sound O&M practices and to recover a reasonable portion
of the capital costs of constructing the system, taking into account farmers'
incentives and ability to pay; and would submit to the Bank Group every two
years the IPEDA rates collected for different land classes.
7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
General
7.01      By providing irrigation and drainage for some 11,600 ha of land
in the Dumoga valley the project would directly benefit some 8,500 farm
families. Incremental farm labor requirements would be about one million
man-days including 100,000 to 200,000 man days of hired labor. Unskilled
construction labor is estimated at about 25,000 man years over a construction
period of 5 years. At full development incremental production attributable
to project actions would reach 46,000 tons paddy, which would substantially
reduce rice deficits in North Sulawesi, a traditional rice importing region.
7.02      At present the target poverty population (i.e. farmers with per
capita incomes below the estimated absolute poverty level of about US$120
in 1980) and transmigrants constitute about 80% of the population in Dumoga;
about 50% of direct project benefits would accrue to this group. At full
project development only about 15% of the population would earn less than the
absolute poverty level. The project would also help make transmigration
efforts in Dumogs a success, and in common with similar developments elsewhere
in Indonesia there would be a flow of spontaneous migrants into the area,
beginning with friends and relatives of the present migrants to provide
additional labor. The development of the Dumoga Valley would accelerate the
development of surrounding poorly developed agricultural areas. In
particular, agricultural inputs and agricultural services including seed
supply would be available to nearby farmers.
7.03      The establishment of the Dumoga Nature Reserve and the stable
irrigated farming developed in the valley will do much to halt the trend
towards widespread destruction of the environment caused mostly by shifting
cultivation and indiscriminate logging and hunting which would take place



- 41 -
without the project. DPPA and WWF authorities have expressed their intention
to establish in the future a larger National Park based on the Nature Reserve
established under this project.
7.04      Benefits from the strengthening of DGWRD's training and programming
activities would permit greater analysis by the Government of irrigation
priorities, progressively help reduce the current high level of consultant
services etmployed for feasibility studies and engineering design, and by
improving the quality of topographic surveying and mapping reduce a current
wastage of time and costs caused by inaccurate work. The strenagthening of
DGWRD's project appraisal capacity should also assist in reducing delays in
project implementation; and at an appropriate time should enable the Bank to
consider al sector lending approach. Benefits from the studies and investiga-
tions to be carried out would be derived from accelerated irrigation construc-
tion or upgrading which would also assist the transmigration program. None of
these benefits can be quantified at present, and economic analysis is confined
to implementation of the Dumoga project.
AssumptiorLs for Economic Analysis
7.05      Benefits.  Expected future crop yields with and without the project
are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the farm-gate prices for
inputs and outputs based on the Bank's commodity price forecasts for rice,
soybeans and fertilizers and domestic prices for other commodities. For the
analyses, soybean has been retained as representative of secondary crops;
other secondary crops like chillies or tobacco are as profitable while less
profitable secondary crops, like maize, are disappearing. Crop production
costs, labor requirements and crop budgets appear in Annex 2; Table 7.1 shows
expected gross values and gross margins per ha and total agricultural benefits
at full development.
7.06      Foreign Exchange.  Together with the November 1978 devaluation of
the rupiah, a package of measures was enacted to reduce import duties, quan-
titative restrictions and export subsidies. As a result, the present official
exchange rate of US$1.00 = Rp 625 is estimated to reflect the value to the
economy oiE the foreign exchange used in carrying out the project and saved
through increased grain production. A standard conversion factor of 1.0
has, therefore, been used in replacement of the previous factor of 0.85.
However, this value has also been considered in the sensitivity analyses.
7.07      Labor Pricing.  The Dumoga project area is undergoing profound
economic transformation and the labor situation is not stabilized at present.
A particuLar feature of the labor market is the clove harvest season in
Minahassa from February to April when very high wages are paid to the
harvesters. The area has also recently experienced a sizeable source of
construction labor employment with the construction of the Ilenado-Dumoga
highway. Together with the relative scarcity of labor in the area, these
factors all contribute to high wages for unskilled labor, averaging Rp 1,250
per day. However a large proportion of construction labor would be drawn from

productivity of labor i1 thAt area construction shadow wage rates have been
estimAted around Rp. 1,000 per man-day.

There Is v~ery iit1.e dem.!Td for labor in the first place, and most transfers
of labor are in terms of exchange labor (gotong roSyong) or sometimes shared
harvest tusually oie sixth of the harvest).  Present wage rates are estimated
around Rp 1,250 per man-day in peak periods and Rp 1,000 per man-day during
slack periods. During most of the project life however there would be
exceas labor in slack perlowi.s wh&ien foregone productivity of labor would be
relatively low. The average economic wage rate has been estirmated at Rp 900
per man-day based on peak period wages of Rp 1,250 per man-day and foregone
proluctivity of labor around Rp 600 per man-day in the slack periods.
7.09       Investment Costs . The construction unit rates are expressed in con-
stant early 1980 prices net of taxes and duties. Economic costs reflect
shadow priciing assumptions and a standard foreign exchange conversion factor
of i.0O. The cost of investments benefitting both Toraut and Kosinggolan has
been allocated to both subproject on the basis of areas served. Operation and
maintenarnce costs are detailed in Annex 6; land development costs cover all
clearing and leveling operations and are based on economic rates of Rp
200,000/ha for leveling, and Rp 450,000/ha on average for land clearing.
7.10      Development Period.  Given the various types of land brought under
irrigation in Dumoga a detailed calculation has been performed to estimate
the build up of paddy yields in the two schemes.  Full development yields
are attained over a 5 year period starting at 2.5 t/ha for existing sawah
fields and 2.0 t/ha for others. The rate of production development is based
on the construction schedule.
Economic Rates of Return
7.11      With the foregoing assumptions and discounting costs and benefits
over a 40-year period economic rates of return (ERR) on investments with
quantifiable benefits are 48% for Kosinggolan and 11% for Toraut (altogether
17% for the Dumoga project). The high rate of return on completion of the
Kosinggolan system is partly due to the fact that sunk costs have not been
included in the calculations. The rate of return for Toraut reflects
conservative judgements on assured water supply and irrigated area.  Should
the flows of minor streams into the project area prove dependable during the
project's construction period, the irrigated area may be extended by an
additional 1,600 ha (para. 1.29) which is likely to raise the rate of return
to between 12-13%.

7.12      Sensitivity Analysis.  Possible events referred to earlier in the
text have been examined as to their implications on the economic rates of
return (Table 7.4). To determine which variables are most crucial for the
success of the project, switching values have been calculated for the Toraut
scheme for an economic opportunity cost of capital of 10%: switching values in
Table 7.4 show the values which the tested variables would have to assume for
the project to reach an ERR of 10%. The most sensitive variable for rate of
return calculations is the with project yield of paddy; yields assumed in the
text (para. 5.04 and 5.05) are conservative but reflect possible slow pace of
adopting intensive cropping in the project area. Higher yields or earlier
attainment of projected yields would substantially increase project returns
and assurances have been obtained that good quality support services will be
introduced rapidly into the area by GOI. The price of rice is also a sensi-
tive variable which indicates that project returns would be higher if rice
prices were increased to reflect the Government's objective of enhancing food
security.  Returns are not overly sensitive to labor wage rates and there is
no positive switching value for farm labor wage rates: if the costs of farm
labor are assumed to be zero the ERR is 13% in Toraut.

7.13      Risks.  No major technical problem is expected in the implementa-
tion of the project, especially since conservative assumptions have been
retained for the level of water supplies. Rapid inflation over the last
several years led to sizeable cost overruns on projects initiated in the early
1970s; inflation is a continuing problem after last year's devaluation of the
Rupiah; however, the provisions for price increases are greater than in
earlier projects financed by the Bank Group. The slow progress experienced
previously by the provincial irrigation office in bringing land under
irrigation in the Kosinggolan system should be greatly accelerated under PIBD
management.  The main risk would be a slower rate of adopting intensified
irrigated agricultural production, but conservative judgments h1ave been made,
while support services would be significantly strengthened, and close
monitoring would be exercised throughout project implementation. Projects
such as Dumoga locaLted in remote areas in the Outer Islands and involving
substantiaLl modifications of agricultural practices may present more problems
than projects in Java, but have an acceptable level of risk in view of their
regional developmerLt importance. The strengthening of DGWRD pLanning and
programminig and stLdies and investigations have low risks.

8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on
the following points:
(a) contracts for civil works estimated to cost US$1.5 million and
above, and for equipment, dump trucks, and furniture estimated to
cost US$200,000 and above, would be submitted to the Association for
review before tendering and award (paras. 3.15 and 3.16);
(b)  PIBD, DPP, DPPA, PROSIDA and PROSIJAT would maintain separate
accountsl for subprojects under their respective responsibilities;
engage auditors acceptable to the Association to audit these
accounts; and submit to the Association, audited financial
statements including statements of expenditure subumitted in support
of credit withdrawal applications, together with the auditor's
comments within six months of the close of each fiscal year
(para. :3.19);
(c) consultants whose qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment would be satisfactory to t:he Association
would be engaged to assist with construction supervision, provide
technical assistance to DPP and to conduct studies and investiga-
tions; consultants to assist with construction supervision and
development coordination of the Dumoga project, and consultants to
provide technical assistance to DPP would be appointed by July 31,
1980 (para. 4.07);
(d) the provincial government of N. Sulawesi would establish an O&M
plan for the Dumoga irrigation project in consultaition with PIBD
acceptable to the Association by July 31, 1981; by October 31,
1980 an O&M manager from the provincial irrigation staff would be
appointed as an assistant project manager; adequate O&M funds,
adjusted to keep pace with inflation and annual needs would be
allocated to all Bank-assisted irrigation systems in future years;
GOI would take the necessary steps to ensure that at least half of
the budgeted O&M funds would be released to subprojects by August
15 of each year and the balance, in equal quarterly installments
thereafter, until the total amounts are fully released; to upgrade
the standard of O&M services and to effectively utilize the
available funds, GOI would progressively increase the number of
qualified O&M personnel in the Bank-assisted projects until the
additional numbers to be established by GOI in consultation with
the Bank Group are employed; and GOI would inform the Bank Group
by December 31 of each year of the proposed number of O&M
personnel and per hectare O&M budget for each subproject; and by
June 1 of each following year, it would submit the approved O&M
budget and by October 1, the staffing provisions (para. 4.09).



- 48 -
(e) before the start of construction of any tertiary network a water
user association would be established to operate and maintain it
after completion; and promptly when a tertiary network is com-
pleted, each association would determine an appropriate level of
charges and collect from its members such charges to cover the
costs of sound operation and maintenance of the system (para.
4.10);
(f) the Department of Agriculture, Department of Trade and Coopera-
tives (DG Cooperatives), Department of Home Affairs (DG
Agraria), and the Bank Rakyat Indonesia would provide adequate
funds, staff, facilities, vehicles and equipment for supporting
the irrigation development at Dumoga (para. 4.13);
(g) the Minister of Agriculture would promulgate a decree establishing
a Nature Reserve, covering at least 100,000 ha of the Dumoga
catchment, by July 1, 1980; take steps to continuously police and
to halt all logging activities in the Nature Reserve; and by
July 31, 1980, enter into an agreement satisfactory to IDA with the
World Wildlife Fund for assisting the Department of Nature
Conservation in establishing and operating the Nature Reserve
(para. 4.15); and
(h) following the completion of the Dumoga project, the Government
would collect an adjusted IPEDA based on the increased pro-
ductivity of irrigated land for which an irrigation system is
rehabilitated or constructed following completion of the project;
the amounts to be collected would be sufficient to ensure sound
O&M practices and to recover a reasonable portion of the capital
costs during the project's useful life, taking into account
farmers' incentives and ability to pay; and it would submit to
the Bank Group for review every two years the IPEDA rates
collected for different land classes (para. 6.13).
8.02      With the above assurances, the project is suitable for an IDA Credit
of US$45 million, on standard IDA terms. The Borrower would be the Republic
of Indonesia.

IRRIGATION PROJECT XV
Studies and Investigations
Identification of Irrigation Potential for Upland Transmigration Sites
Settled under Pelita I and II
Terms of Reference
1.        PIBD would provide all support services for the consultants
conducting the study, and the Directorate of Planning and Programming of
DGWRD would review all consultant reports, follow progress of the studies,
and evaluate the findings before departure of the consultants. Consultants
would collaborate closely with the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration,
the Directorate of City and Regional Planning, Department of Public Works;
and with Provincial Departments of Public Works.
2.        Consultants would collect, collate and analyze all existing data
including airphotos, maps, land capability and current agricultural output
and land use for all upland transmigration sites settled under Repelita I
and II.
3.        On the basis of available data and the consultants' photo inter-
pretation, sites with potential water resources, suitable topography and
layout would be selected for more detailed field study after about 6 months
preliminary work.
4.        Consultants would then assess outline costs and returns from
irrigation on the selected transmigration sites. On the basis of these
preliminary investigations, consultants would define a program of project
preparation, ranking the selected sites by priority for irrigation
investment. Consultants would prepare terms of reference for project
preparation studies detailing manpower needs and the needs for additional
hydrologic data, aerial photography, mapping, etc., for each feasibility
study. The work is expected to be completed within 12 months of the
arrival of the consultant's staff.

2.        Consultarnts would review existing data on the irrigation potential
of the Upper Jatiluhur area, including hydrology preliminary investigation
of possib'le storage sites, (SOGREAH, 1972), studies of irrigation service
areas, construction costs and project benefits prepared by Jatiluhur
Authority Staff. Consultants would review preliminary proposals for six
dams (at Telaga Herang, Maya, Bodas, Sadawarna, Kandung and Lalauang/
Citayeum) and would conduct pre-feasibility studies on these sites. The
pre-feasibility studies would consider possible improvement of existing
diversion works, timing of possible future dam construction, and would weigh
investment costs, Lncremental benefits and the resettlement of the population
living in potentia1L reservoir areas.
3.        Based on review and investigations during the first six months of
the work, the consultants should propose a priority ranking for development
of the Upper Jatiluhur area. After reviewing the consultants' proposal, the
Jatiluhur Authority would direct consultants to undertake a full feasibility
study of the selected first phase of the project in the following 12 months.
Consultants would also propose a detailed program of investigations for
other possible investments in the Upper Jatiluhur area and would prepare
terms of reference for such work.
4.        The consultants' initial work phase should include sufficient
geologic investigations to permit proceeding directly to deta:Lled design if
the resuLts of the project feasibility study are favorable.

Jatiluhur Service Area
5.        Consultants would investigate the feasibility of upgrading and
possibly hard surfacing inspection roads in the existing service area in
order to lower maintenance cost and provide additional access. Consultants
should also discuss with provincial Department of Public Works and Jatiluhur
Authority Staff responsibility for upgrading and operation and maintenance
in the future.
6.        The Consultants would examine alternative options for upgrading
implementation and future O&M of the roads, and recommend the most suitable
organizational framework therefor. The consultants would discuss their
recommendations with the provincial public works department and prior to
finalizing, with the Jatiluhur Authority.
Coastal Area
7.        In the coastal strip of the Jatiluhur service area, consultants
would investigate the technical and economic viability of drainage and
water control for improving and expanding fish farms. About 15,000 ha have
been developed already for fishpond and an additional 30,000 ha appear to be
potentially suitable for fishpond development. Consultants would analyze
alternative schemes of waterway improvements, flood and water quality
controls, and prepare a feasibility study within 18 months, duly evaluating
costs and benefits.

Preparation of the Cibeet Irrigation/Flood Control Water Supply Project
1.        Consultants would report to the Directorate of Planning
and Programming of DGWRD . Close collaboration would be maintained with the
Jatiluhur Authority, the Jakarta City Authorities and the Department of
Public Works (for the urban water supply), and with West Java provincial
government staff.
2.        The consultants would review all available data, especially studies
carried out by DPP and SOGREAH (consultants) on the Cisedane-Jakarta-Cibeet
Water Resources Development Study/l. Based on this review, consultants would
submit to DGWRD within six months of their arrival a statement of the
possible alternatives and issues related to development of Cibeet's water
resources. This statement would include an estimate of possible
resettlement needs and/or land expropriation needed for various alternative
schemes, and preliminary cost/benefit analysis of the alternative schemes.
3.        On the basis of the above definition of alternatives and issues,
DGWRD would decide which of the developments warrant implementation.
Consultants would then conduct necessary feasibility studies and would
propose an implementation schedule for the most feasible first-phase
investment to permit GOI to proceed to detailed design and preparation of
tender documents. Consultants would submit the feasibility study for a
first-phase project within 18 months of the team leader's arrival in Jakarta.
/1 The Cisedane-Jakarta-Cibeet study proposes the doubling of capacity of
the Jatiluhur system's West Tarum canal to provide flood control, urban
water supplies, flushing open drains in Jakarta in the absence of a
sewage system, and the irrigation of about 14,000 ha of additional land
at Bekasi.

Consultant Services for the Directorate of Planning and Programming
Background
1.        The Directorate of Planning and Programming was formed in July
1968 to carry out the planning and programming functions within the
Directorate General of Water Resources Development. The composition of the
Directorate was revised in 1968 and again in 1975 when it assumed its present
form which comprises:
(a) Directorate Secretariat;
(b). Subdirectorate of Water Resources Program Planning (P4);
(c) Subdirectorate of River Basin Development Planning (P2WS); and
(d) Subdirectorate of Ground Water Development Planning (P2AT).
2.        In order to implement a number of planning tasks of a specific but
temporary nature two Special Projects have been set up under the Director
of Planning and Programming.
(a) The Water Resources Development Planning Project (Proy.P3SA)
managed by the Head of Subdirectorate P2WS implementing planning
of specific river basin and large surface water schemes and carrying
out other special tasks;



ANNEX 3
- 73                                 Page 10
(b) The Groundwater Development Pilot Project (Proy.P2AT) managed by the
Head of Subdirectorate P2AT implementing planning of specific
groundwater investigation and development schemes.
3.        These special projects control the activities of a number of
subprojects (some 26 in the case of Proy.P3SA, 5 in the case of Proy.P2AT)
each of which is responsible for carrying out the planning studies for one
specific development scheme or similar special assignments. At the present
time Proy. P3SA and Proy. P2AT are an effective integral, if temporary, part
of the Directorate.
4.        The Directorate has grown steadily in size and capability but due to
shortage of experienced staff has been unable to keep pace with the very large
water resources development program now being undertaken by the Directorate
General of Water Resources Development. As a result much of the detailed
project planning and programming within Directorate General is at present
undertaken by other Directorates and Executing agencies, because the
Directorate of Planning and Programming still lacks the strength to
effectively undertake on behalf of the Directorate General the supervisory
control necessary for such a large investment program. It is desirable to
strengthen the capability and organization of the Directorate with a view to
improving in the short-term its supervisory role in relation to the planning
and programming activities of the Directorate General and to increasing its
capability to undertake or direct a larger proportion of detailed project
planning in the longer term.
5.        The Government of Indonesia would employ the services of
consultanlts within the Directorate of Planning and Programming of the
Directorate General of Water Resources to assist that Directorate, over a
period of 3 years, to strengthen its capability and organization, including,
amongst other things, project preparation, project feasiblity, studies and
the supervision and evaluation of other feasibility studies; improving the
system for controlling and monitoring the planning and programming activities
within t'he Directorate General including technical, economic and financial
aspects; and specialized technical guidance as required.
Scope of Services
6.        The consulting services would be provided through a team of 9
experts having suitable experience project identification preparation and
appraisal, in water resources planning, management techniques, hydrology and
land capability studies, economics, in particular agro-economics, hydrogeology
and water well drilling. This team would work in conjunction with suitably
qualified full time counterpart staff, but the experts and their full time
counterparts will be required to work in close collaboration with the staff of
any division, section or unit of the Directorate as the need arises.



- 74 -                               ANNEX 3
Page 11
7.        It is anticipated that the consulting team would in conjunction with
Directorate staff, study the present functions and organization of the
Directorate with particular reference to the planning and programming of the
current water resources development programme of the Directorate General,
identify areas where improvement or strengthening are desirable, propose
and discuss with the Directorate General means of bringing about any desirable
changes or strengthening and upon agreement of such proposals assist the
Directorate in carrying them out.
8.        The following activities would receive the attention of the
consultancy team.
(a) Long-term planning and translation of investment priorities into
the DGWRD budget allocation.
(b) Establishing terms of reference for studies and investigations,
monitoring progress of studies and evaluating the findings and
recommendations of such studies.
(c) Project formulation, identification of issues, discussions with
the interested GOI agencies affected by project proposals, and
project appraisal.
(d) Assistance with the establishment, operation and training of
specialist groups or units required to provide technical back-up
to the Directorate in the fields of hydrology, land capability
and soils, engineering, surveying and economics.
(e) Advise and assistance with the planning evaluation and execution
of groundwater development projects and provide technical assistance
to field drilling activities.
(f) Training of DGWRD staff in project preparation and appraisal, and
in technical and economic aspects of irrigation development.
9.        In addition to the above the consultancy team would be required to
advise and assist the Directorate on any matter relating to its functions or
to specific development projects. Throughout the consultancy, the team
would be required to adopt a flexible approach to its activities and
programme in order to meet the needs of and assist the Directorate in
strengthening its capabilities and improving its performance as the planning
and programming organization of the Directorate General.
Staffing
10.       The consultant team (360 m/m in total) would consist of nine
resident staff for 3 years supported when required by visiting short-term
specialists (12 m/m each year for 3 years) as necessary for the proper
execution of the services described above.

IRRIGATION XV PROJECT
Dumoga:  Terms of Reference for the Advisor for
Development Coordination
The Advisor for Development Coordination (ADC) would be stationed
on the project site together with other PIBD consultants. He would have
frequent and close contacts with the construction, design and O&M teams.
However, his counterparts would mainly be members of the local administra-
tion, particularly extension. To facilitate his role as coordinator, the
ADC would therefore advise the local administration, i.e., to the Bupati.
Copies of his reports would go to the Bupati, to PIBD, Jakarta and the Bank.
The ADC would be required to have particular ability for communi-
cations and for helping coordinate various agencies - he should have good
command of the Indonesian language. The ADC needs to have at least five
years' experience in actual, on-site rural development in irrigated areas.
The ADC should have good general technical knowledge in the fields of
extension, land development, establishment of farmer groups and
organizations, and in monitoring of rural development.
The ADC would be responsible for:
(a) advising and supervising monitoring in the project area
(exclusive of construction monitoring) and keeping well informed
of the status of development and of possible problems and bottle-
necks encountered;
(b) coordinating the efforts of various agencies and individuals
by making the above knowledge available and by helping cross
agency communications. Coordination would be provided by the
regular meetings of the Kecamatan and Kabupaten committees,
the meetings of the Monitoring Advisory Committee and the daily
contacts of the AMDC with the various agencies; and
(c) advising the various agricultural support agencies in the project
area, especially extension, land development and cooperatives.
The ADC would be available to help the various agencies and the
Bupati upon request. He would write short quarterly progress reports covering
all above mentioned aspects and a more thorough six-monthly reports.

IRRIGATION PROJECT XV
The Panti-Rao Project
GENERAL
1.         The Government of Indonesia requested assistance for the construc-
tion of 8,100 ha Panti-Rao irrigation system in West Sumatra and the project
was appraised by the Association in June 1979. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau
(KfW) has informed GOI that subject to the Association's findings, it would
provide financial assistance of about US$26 million for the project. Separate
financing, disbursement and procurement arrangements would be concluded
between GOI and KfW and are not discussed in this Annex.
2.         The Panti-Rao Project was started in the early 1970s by the Public
Works Department of West Sumatra Province. Some alignments and designs of
the right bank main canals were completed by the Provincial Office but
difficulties were encountered in the design of the headvorks. Responsibility
was then trasferred to DGWRD's design office in Bandung. The Bank's assis-
tance for Panti-Rao was sought by DGWRD in 1976 as part of a package of 10
medium-scale irrigation systems.  At that time some 3 km of the right bank
main canal had been constructed, and there has been no construction since. It
was agreed that DGWRD would hire consultants to review the designs of these
systems and prepare feasibility studies; financial assistance was made
available by the Bank Group in 1977 under Irrigation Project IX. A contract
was signed with consultants (SINOTECH) in November 1977 for review of design
and feasibility studies allowing appraisal to take place in June 1979. The
right bank system proposed at Panti-Rao has now been excluded because
appraisal shows that its economic viability is unsatisfactory even when the
cost of the headworks is entirely charged to the left bank development.
PROJECT AREA
Location
3.         The Panti-Rao project is located in West Sumatra, some 200 km
north of Padang, and is also readily accessible via the Trans-Sumatra highway
connecting it with Padang and Medan.
Climate
4.         The climate in the subproject area is tropical - hot and humid year
round, with average monthly temperatures varying only slightly from 260C.
Rainfall at Panti-Rao averages about 1,650 mm per year, and about 70% (or
1,130 mm) falls during October through April. Irregular dry spells occur



- 85 -                           ANNEX 10
Page 2
frequently during January and February. Mean monthly humidity is around 82%
(Table 1). Supplementary water supplies are needed to overcome the effects
of dry spells during the early growth period of rice, and are essential for
dry season cropping.

Soils, Topography and Drainage
5.        The project would serve a narrow valley traversed by the Batang
Sumpur River and surrounded by mountainous country. The area is generally
flat with medium to poor drainage and soils are mostly heavy clays of low
permeability, exhibiting gley features. Soil fertility is fairly good, but
supplementary nitrogen and possibly phosphorus are needed for raising
present rice yields. With improved drainage, the soils are well suited for
rice, but they are too heavy for extensive growing of secondary crops.
Population. Farm Size and Land Tenure
6.        About 60,000 people (11,000 families) presently live in the Panti-
Rao area (Table 2). Past population growth appears to have been around 2.9%
p.a. Some migration has taken place from North Sumatra (South Tapanuli area)
possibly triggered by the expectation of a forthcoming irrigation system.
Seasonal migrations follow the pattern of agricultural operations with immi-
gration at harvest time and less markedly at the time of land preparation.
Average farm size is about 1.0 ha of which 0.8 ha is paddy fields. Some 20%
of all farms are estimated to have more than 2.0 ha of paddy while 50% have
less than 0.5 ha. Land tenure is based on the principle of common ownership
of the land by the village (adat land) with land use rights decided by the
village authorities. Individuals do not have titles to their land; collateral
for credit is based on the village headman certifying use right.

7.        Agricultural support services have been established.  Eight PPLs
are stationed in the area, supported by a rural extension office. In
1978/79 the extension service supervised 46 fertilizer/variety demonstration
plots in the area, and introduced the training and visit system. Two
cooperatives (KUD) are active in rice milling, trading and supplying inputs,



- 87 -                           ANNEX 10
Page 4
in addition to inputs supplied by several small private traders. The BRI
maintains two village offices in the subproject area, primarily for the
BIMAS/INMAS credit program, but only 360 farmers used credit in 1978/79 to
obtain inputs for growing rice on some 270 ha. At present there may be
overcapacity in rice milling facilities in the subproject area with some 120
mills with a capacity of 4-10 tons/day.
THE PROJECT
Project Works
8.        The Panti-Rao Subproject would consist of (a) construction of an
irrigation and drainage system to serve some 8,100 ha on the left: bank of
the Batang Sumpur River and (b) provision of vehicles and equipment, consul-
ting services and training.
9.        Project works would include:
(a) completion of design and construction of headworks, consisting of
a 50 mr-long diversion weir 5.5 m above the riverbed; 285 m of
earth embanknents, sluices and a gated canal intake structure;
(b)  completion of design and construction of 41 km of main canal, 22
cross drainage and 5 road crossing structures;
(c)  completion of design and construction of 11 secondary canals 53 km
long in total;
(d) tertiary development, to cover a net area of 8,100 ha, including
survey, mapping, design and construction of tertiary and
quaternary irrigation canals at an approximate density of 50 m/ha
and tertiary and quaternary drains at an approximate clensity of
of 35 m/ha and structures at an approximate density of one diversion
box per 10 ha;
(e)  design and construction of inspection roads along maini,
secondaries and selected tertiaries;
(f) construction of project headquarters;

(g) procurement of vehicles, motorcycles, bicycles and O&M equipment;
and
(h) training of O&M staff.
Water Supply. Demand and Quality
10.       The major water source for irrigation is the Batang Sumpur.  Several
minor streams enter the project area downstream of the proposed diversion
site but they have not been taken into account in determining dependable
water supplies due to lack of data and because their small catchments are
unlikely to contribute significant amounts of water during critical dry
periods. At Panti-Rao there is adequate water to irrigate the 8,100 ha
potentially under command on the left bank (Table 3). Although water supply
is sufficient to irrigate an additional 1,400 ha on the right bank it is not
economically justified because it requires a long and costly conveyance
system.

11.       Water supplies at the proposed diversion site were calculated from
long-term rainfall and rainfall-runoff relationships. Dependable supplies at
the proposed diversion site are half-monthly discharges equal to, or exceeded
80% of the time. Water demands were estimated from potential evapotranspira-
tion calcula,ted by the modified Penman method, crop factors related to the
proposed cropping plans, effective rainfall, and percolation losses ranging
between 4-2 mm/day for medium to heavy textured soils. Effective rainfall was
based on half-monthly rainfall equal to or exceeded during 80% of the time.
The dominant: crop planted is rice, which is also the largest water consumer,
with smaller areas allocated to secondary crops. Prior to translplanting a net
amount of 120-150 mm /1 of water has been considered for land preparation and
puddling of paddy soils requiring a peak flow in tertiaries of 1.8 1/sec/ha.
In order to reduce peak irrigation requirements, a staggered cropping pattern
is planned iLn which tertiary blocks are divided into 3 or 4 subblocks
(golongans)Y, as commonly done in Indonesia, each commencing the cropping cycle
in successive two week intervals. Water quality for irrigation is good and
chemical tests indicate low salinity and low alkali hazards. No major
sedimentation problems are foreseen as most sediments are suspended colloidal
particles.
Status of Design
12.       Semi-detailed designs of the headworks and foundation investigations
have been prepared by local consultants and reviewed by foreign consultants
(SINOTECH). Final designs for the headworks would be prepared in early 1980,
following investigation of an alternative site, some 300 m downstream of the
proposed site. Use of the alternative site may permit a small reduction of
construction costs of the main canal which would cut through a steep hillside
in the initial portion of the presently proposed alignment. Detailed designs
have been prepared for the main and secondary systems, but recent revisions of
a number of crossing structures will require additional design iinputs.
Tertiary development would require aerial photography, field surveys, mapping
and design, none of which has been undertaken yet.
Implementation Schedule
13.       The project would be implemented by April 1986.  The implementation
schedule has been based on the performance of contractors engaged in similar
works in Indonesia's Outer Islands, with a view to maximizing benefits by
starting irrigation as soon as headworks are complete. The schedule implies
parallel construction of headworks, main, secondary and tertiary systems.
/1 The smaller amount is applied following months of high rainfall.

Cost Estimates
14.       The cost estimates are summarized in Attachments 1-6.  Total project
cost is estimated at US$39.3 million, of which US$14.9 million (46%) is the
foreign exchange component. The above costs include provisions for local,
provincial or national taxes, which average about 5% on civil works contracts
Quantity estimates for civil works for main and secondary systems were based
on the detailed designs. Unit rates, based on local costs prevailing in
April-May 1979 have been escalated to early 1980 prices, considering a 25%
increase in local costs during 1979. Cost estimates for tertiary development
at Panti-Rao are based on local unit rates and on quantities derived from
detailed designs prepared for a sample area. Costs of consulting services are
based on recent contracts for similar services in Indonesia. The direct costs
of foreign consultants (salaries, overseas allowance, home office overhead and
fee), amount to about US$7,100/man-month. Reimbursible expenses (travel,
housing, field office overhead, reproduction and printing, and other expenses)
average about US$3,400/man-month, for a total cost of about
US$10,500/man-month. Total costs of local consultants amount to
US$1,500/man-month (Table 10). Physical contingencies of 20% have been added
to the cost of civil works, and 10% to the estimated cost of equipment and
services. Cost estimates also include an allowance for expected price
increases during project implementation (42% of base cost plus physical
contingencies) which are based on the following annual inflation rates:
(a) on local cost components: 15% in 1980 and 1981 and 10% thereafter;
and
(b) on foreign cost components: 9% in 1980; 8% in 1981, and 7% in
1982 and 1983.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Situation
15.       The left bank command area envisaged under the project is presently
comprised of about 6,600 ha of rainfed sawah, 800 ha of irrigated sawahs
served by simple irrigation systems, and about 700 ha under scrub, grassland
or secondary forest. About 70% of sawahs grow one rice crop from December to
May and 30% grow two crops from September to January and from February to
June. Secondary crops only cover some 450 ha. Yields are low: 2.0 tons/ha
for the first rice crop, 1.8 tons/ha for the second and 0.6 tons/ha for
soybeans. About 25% of the farmers use BIMAS inputs and 35% HYVs. The main
yield limiting factor is lack of water but other factors include shallow soil
preparation, inadequate fertility, weeds, diseases, pests and rats. Present
production is about 20,000 tons paddy and 300 tons soybeans.
Future Without Project
16.       Without the project only minor modifications are expected to take
place. Over a 10 year period an additional 300 ha would likely be brought
under cultivation and yields would increase to 2.0 tons/ha for the first rice



-t _                         ANNEX 10
Page 8
crop, 2.4 tons/ha for the second rice crop and 0.7 tons/ha for soybeans.
Production would reach 23,000 tons of paddy and 350 tons soybeans.
Future With Project
17.       With assured supplies of irrigation for double cropping of rice it
is expected that farmers will have sufficient incentives to clear all lands
under command. In addition, about 400 ha of swampland would be drained during
the dry season and would be suitable for irrigated rice cultivation using
return flows. Accordingly, farmers would switch to irrigated rice cultivation
on 8,100 ha of sawahs, and on an additional 400 ha during the dry season.
Yields would increase to 2.9 tons/ha by 1990 for both crops. Production would
more than double, reaching 48,000 tons paddy.
Drying. Storage and ProcessinR
18.       Virtually all paddy is sun-dried on mats in house yards or along the
roads and afterwards stored in the farm houses. Especially whien weather
conditions are rainy and erratic during the harvesting periods, drying of the
threshed grain requires much care and labor to prevent deterioration of
quality due to excess moisture, however, families have grown adept at drying
and will be able to prevent serious losses due to high moisture content.
Milling capacity is presently adequate and it is expected thait, when the need
occurs, local enterprise will expand capacities in line with production.
Milling standards are presently rather low as the output contains impurities
and up to 35% brokens.

Market Prospects
19.       Trnionesian rice production has been unable to satisfy demand for
many decades. From 1969 to 1976 imports ranged .etween 0.5 and 1.3 million
tons. In 1977/78 imports rose to about 2.3 million tons; because of an
excellent 1977/78 harvest, imports during 1978/79 were at 1.3 million tons;
79/80 imports, however, are expected to be substantially higher. Rice-
oriented policies have been a major element of the Government's development
strategy in Repelita I and II (1969/70 to 1973/74 and 1978/79) and continue to
receive very high priority. As a result of the heavy investments aimed at
increasing the domestic supply of rice, production is expected to grow at
between 3% and 3.5% p.a. to 1985; this, however, would still imply an average
annual rice deficit of 2 to 3 million tons in 1985 (1OZ to 15% of the total
producton)./l Continuation of high investment rates over the next ten years
could reduce the average expected annual deficit to 2 million tons in 199O./1
Marketing prospects for paddy should therefore remain eminently favorable in
the future.
20.       Panti-Rao is a rice surplus area.  In Panti-Rao more than half the
production is exported (over 10,000 tons paddy) to North Sumatra. The incre-
mental j2 production of about 28,000 tons paddy per year would continue to be
exported to cover neighboring areas' rice deficits. The project area would
forego some secondary crop production under the project, and production would
decrease by 2,000 tons.
21.       In the Panti-Rao area farmers sell their surplus paddy production
mainly to private dealers and millers and to coopertives. The Government's
rice procurement authority (BULOG/DOLOG) maintains a floor price for paddy in
the project areas, and the BUUD/KUD, its agent in the villages, buys paddy
directly f'rom farmers. The price at which BULOG purchased paddy was Rp 95
(US$0.17)/kg in October 1979 for 14% moist paddy at the village. Although
prices on the open market are usually higher than the floor price during
nonharvest periods, farmers often sell their paddy below the f:Loor price
during the harvest period at about Rp 85/kg for paddy with about 18-20Z
moisture content and up to 10% impurities. In other cases, farmers sell their
paddy on the open market at a discount because BUUD/KUDs exhaust their credit
lines and are unable to obtain cash to pay the farmers, who need immediate
cash to meet tax payments or to pay off the last season's debtBs so that they
can purchase inputs for the new season. Practically all farmers have to sell
some paddy immediately after harvest to meet their debts, even if they have to
repurchase rice later for consumption at some Rp 165/kg. BULOG, through its
subsidiary DOLOG, also maintains rice and paddy storage facilities at the
provincial level.

Prices /1
22.       For both the farm budgets and economic analyses, farm inputs and
outputs have been valued at early 1980 prices. Economic prices are expressed
in border prices. For rice, soybeans and fertilizers, economic prices were
derived from the Bank's Commodity Division's forecasts for world market
prices, and adjusted for transportation and other costs. The remaining inputs
not traded on the international market have been expressed in terms of actual
(farmgate) prices. Rice produced under the project would substitute for
Indonesian rice imports of 25% broken quality rice. It has been shown that
the world market price for this quality of rice is about 90% of the standard
5% broken, Thai white rice and this figure has been used to project the future
cost savings in Indonesian rice imports. The economic price of soybeans has
been calculated under the assumption that Indonesia would remain a net
importer of soybeans. Indonesia has been a traditional exporter of limited
amounts of soybeans until the last three years; it has since turned to be a
net importer under the continued influences of increasing domestic demand and
of slackening production.  It is not expected that production will keep up
with demand in the coming years. Sensitivity analyses include, however, the
case of 10% lower rice price, (to illustrate successful BULOG purchasing
strategies on the international market) and the case where Indonesta turns to
be an exporter of soybeans by 1985.
23.       Historically, the Government has followed a policy of keeping con-
sumer food prices low by selling imported rice below its cost and keeping
domestic floor prices low. To mitigate the effect of this policy on farm
income, the Government has simultaneously subsidized fertilizer and pesticide.
In 1974 and 1975, however, the Government substantially raised domestic paddy
prices to encourage rice production. This change in policy, combined with the
fall of world prices from the record levels of 1973-74, brought farm-gate
prices fairly close to world market levels, taking into account the quality
differences. The floor price of paddy is expected to increase from Rp 95/kg
in October 1979 to Rp 120/kg in 1990 (in 1980 prices). Prices of fertilizers
would rise from a present low of Rp 70/kg to Rp 100/kg, an increase warranted
by raising oil prices and by the effects of the November 15, 1978 devaluation
of the Rupiah.

Farm Incomes A
24.       For farm income analyses, illustrative farm models have been
prepared. A small farm (0.5 ha) and a fairly large farm (1.5 ha) have been
chosen as models. The 0.5 ha farm family performs all farm tasks and works
off the farm for the equivalent of 125 man-days; the 1.5 ha farm family does
not work off the farm and hires labor in the with project situation. Given
the customary form of land ownership and the widespread use of gotong royonR,
sharecropper situatons have not been shown since there are few sharecroppers
in the usual sense.
25.       Data on landless laborers' incomes are fragmentary.  According to a
recent farm survey, the yearly average employment per landless family in the
Panti-Rao area is 220 days of male labor, 260 days of female labor and 175
days of child labor per working child. Altogether wages may average Rp 500
per day and incomes could therefore average some Rp 460,000 per year (US$736)
or a per capita income of Rp 85,000 (US$136)-per year. The 5% landless
families in the project area are not, therefore, in a situation similar to
those on Java. Some of them, however, must earn substantially less and would
benefit from the project as would the landless or near landless families
outside the project area, especially those living in the nearby hills and
relying on seasonal employment earnings.

Prolect Charges
26.       The Government has effective mechanisms to recover a portion of
project costs through the collection of the IPEDA tax and of a water charge.
/j See Annex 2, Tables 4 and 5.

Page 14
27.       IPEDA.  IPEDA is a land tax collected nationwide by the village
heads and turned over to local and provincial administrations for use in
public services. Allocation of GOI funds under the local infrastructure
developi.-at program (INPRES) are tied to IPEDA collection performance and
provide a constant incentive for high IPEDA collection rates. The IPEDA
land classification is based on soil fertility, quality of irrigation and
other yLeld determining factors and IPEDA levels are based on average pro-
duction levels on these classes of land; amounts collected would therefore
increase as crop yields rise and IPEDA land classification is modified in
the project area in response to the project. There is no me!chanism relating
incremental IPEDA collection due to irrigation projects to incremental
allocations of O&M funds.
28.      Water Charges.  Water charges are collected by water users associa-
tions and are earmarked for O&M of tertiary and quaternary canals and drains.
The levels of water charges vary according to the level of development of
tertiary units but would average some 20 kg of paddy per ha per season in the
project areas. This is sufficient to pay for the service of the water-master
(ulu-ulu) and, where applicable, of his assistants; sometimes the water charge
is in the form of an area of village rice land reserved for the water master.
29.       Cost Recovery.  Present and estimated future levels of IPEDA and
water charges are as follows:

Page 15
30.       At full development water charges would cover O&M costs at the
tertiary level and incremental IPEDA collection would cover about half of the
recommended O&M levels. The cost recovery index comparing the present value
of direct Government recovery (incremental IPEDA) discounted at 10% opportu-
nity cost of capital to present value of Government costs (capital and O&M of
main systems) is 2% in Panti-Rao. This index is low because of the high cost
of irrigating previously rainfed areas. However, the level of charges
expected at full development would be more than seven times that without the
project and would therefore represent a substantial effort from the
administration. Further analysis of the cost recovery issue should take into
account lower Government expenses for international rice procurement due to
increased domestic production (indirect recovery) and the advantages of Bank
borrowing (indirect cost).
31.       Rent Recovery.  From the point of view of the benefitting farmer,
the project is a windfall opportunity for realizing increased incomes (Table
8). The project rent calculation attempts to separate earned income increases
(through increased labor, management, etc.) from "non-earned" increases and
the rent recovery index indicates how much of the "non-earned" portion is
returned to Government entities over the project life. Direct rent recovery
indices are mostly between 30% and 70%. Most project farmers have and would
continue to have annual per capita incomes below the critical consumption
level of about US$100 in the without project situation.

BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
General
32.       By providing irrigation and drainage for some 8,100 ha of irrigable
land in the Panti-Rao area the project would directly benefit some 10,000 farm
families. Incremental farm labor requirements would be about one million
man-days in Panti-Rao including some 600,000 man-days of hired labor which
would benefit landless families in and around the project area. Unskilled
construction labor is estimated at about 30,000 man-years in Panti-Rao over a
construction period of 6 years. At full development incremental production
would reach 28,000 tons paddy in Panti-Rao; this quantity would be regionally
exported and would substantially reduce rice deficits in the northern half of
Sumatra.
33.       At present the target poverty population, i.e. farmers with per
capita incomes below the estimated absolute poverty level of about US$130
(1979) constitute about 75% in Panti-Rao. At full project development this
proportion is expected to be lowered to 25%. About 45% of direct project
benefits in Panti-Rao would accrue to the target group of poor farmers.
34.       Projected benefits would be achieved at a cost of about US$4,850/ha
for new irrigation in the Panti-Rao system.
Assumptions for the Economic Analyses
35.       Benefits.  Expected future crop yields with and without the project
are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the farm-gate prices for
inputs and outputs based on the Bank's commodity price forecasts for rice,
soybeans and fertilizers and domestic prices for other commodities.
36.       Foreign Exchange.  Together with the November 1978 devaluation of
the rupiah, a package of measures was enacted to reduce import duties, quan-
titative restrictions and export subsidies. As a result, the present official
exchange rate of US$1.00 = Rp 625 is estimated to reflect the value to the
economy of the foreign exchange used in carrying out the project and saved
through increased grain production. A standard conversion factor of 1.0 has,
therefore, been used in replacement of the previous factor of 0.85. However,
this value has also been considered in the sensitivity analyses.
37.       Labor Pricing.  The Panti-Rao area experiences some extent of labor
shortages during the harvest period and also during land preparation. At all
other times, there is virtually no market for farm labor and limited exchanges
of labor (gotong-royong) within the villages. At peak periods, the labor
market is still limited because many farmers prefer to use the services of
relatives; even when nonrelatives are hired, there is little wage hire as such
because farmers feel it would introduce unpleasant commercial relationships.
Estimated farm labor cash wage equivalents average Rp 750/man-day. Local
circumstances have not been considered to warrant shadow pricing farm labor
wage rates. Construction labor wages in the Kabupaten vary between an
equivalent Rp 700 and Rp 900/man-day and would average Rp 800/man-day.
Because of some urban unemployment and because the project would draw on a
regional labor pool (given the good access to the area) construction labor has



-101 -                             ANNEX 10
Page 18
been priced at Rp 700/man-day while a shadow rate of Rp 600/man-day has been
considered in the sensitivity analysis.
38.       Investment Costs.  The construction unit rates are expressed in con-
stant early 1980 prices net of taxes and duties. Economic costs reflect
shadow pricing assumption and a standard conversion factor of 1.00. The cost
of investments benefitting both Toraut and Kosinggolan have beten allocated to
both subproject on the basis of areas served. Operation and maintenance costs
are detailed in Table 9.
39.       Development Period.  In Panti-Rao the construction schedule allows
all the area to receive irrigation in 1987; yields are expected to increase
from 2.6 ton/ha in 1987 to 2.9 ton/ha in 1990. Prior to 1987 irrigation would
be supplied on 25% of the area in 1985 and 75% in 1986 and benefits in these
years have been calculated by applying these percentages to the 1987
production.
Economic Rate of Return
40.       With the foregoing assumptions and discounting costs and benefits
over a 40-year period the economic rate of return (ERR) is 11%. The rela-
tively low rate of return on the system is due to unfavorable area configura-
tions in long narrow valley requiring long conveyance canals with numerous
structures.

Economic Rate of Return = 11%
41.       Sensitivity Analysis.  To determine which variables are most crucial
for the success of the project, switching values have been calculated for the
Panti-Rao scheme for an economic opportunity cost of capital of 10%:
switching values show the values which the tested variables would have to
assume for the project to reach an ERR of 10%. The most sensitive variable
for rate of return calculations is the with project yield of paddy; yields
assumed in the text are fairly low but reflect inherent agricultural diffi-
culties in the project area. Higher yields or earlier attainment of projected
yields would substantially increase project returns. The price of rice is
also a sensitive variable which indicates that project returns would be higher
if rice prices were increased to reflect the Government's objective of
enhancing food security. The ERR is not overly sensitive to labor wage rates
and there is no positive switching value for farm labor wage rates: if the
costs of farm labor are neglected altogether the ERR 14% in Panti-Rao.
42.       Risks.  No major technical problem is expected in the implementation
of the project, especially since conservative assumptions have been retained
for the level of water supplies. Rapid inflation over the last several years



ANNEX 1 P
- 103 -                         Page2O
led to sizeable cost overruns on projects initiated in the early 1970s;
inflation is a continuing problem after last year's devaluation cf the Rupiah;
however, the provisions for price increases are greater for this and other
projects recently financed by the Bank Group than in earlier nrojjects.
