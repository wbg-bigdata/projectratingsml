MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ZIMBABWE
FOR AN URBAN SECTOR AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Zimbabwe for US$80.0 million equivalent for approval. The proposed
loan would be on standard IBRD terms with 20 years maturity, including 5
years of grace, and would help finance an urban sector and regional
development project. The project would be co-financed by the Federal
Republic of Germany (US$21.0 million equivalent), and by Sweden (US$3.0
million equivalent).
2.       Background.  About three fourths of the 8.7 million population of
Zimbabwe live in rural areas but the urban population, increasing at
approximately 6Z per year, is growing much faster than the rural. The high
urban population growth rates reflect greater opportunities in urban areas,
coupled with limited farming opportunities available in the Communal Areas
to support both population growth and increases in rural incomes. The
rapid growth of the cities, centered primarily in Harare, places a heavy
demand on Government financial and manpower resources to provide requisite
services and, thereafter, to protect these capital assets with adequate
maintenance. With the bulk of urban population growth comprising low-
income families, the costs and standards of infrastructure and housing
investments have a direct bearing on the accessibility and affordability of
these services to the urban poor. The principal urban development policies
of Government are therefore to strengthen its capacity to identify least
cost solutions. as well as select, on an economically sound basis, between
alternative investment demands, maintain the financial independence and
viability of local authorities, and substitute private for public sector
funding where possible. Government is also seeking to foster increased
opportunities in smaller urban centers to slow the shift in population to
Harare and to strengthen their economic linkages to the farming activities
in the surrounding Communal Areas. The local authorities are generally
well managed and financially sound, although there are staff weaknesses and
signs of financial deterioration. Governtent recognizes these problems and
its policy initiatives include placing a greater emphasis on urban
financial management and cost recovery, and the transfer of mortgage
provision responsibility to private sector-owned building societies. The
ongoing First Urban Project (Loan 2445-ZIM), which successfully laid the
groundwork for these initiatives, is essentially a pilot project
incorporating a new approach to urban development and as a result of its
success, Government is now seeking to replicate this approach in the sector
generally. Other donors actively involved in the urban sector in Zimbabwe
in such areas as infrastructure for low-income housing, housing finance,
technical assistance and training, include the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), the British Overseas Development Agency
(ODA), the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA), and the
Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC).



5.       Protect Oblectives.  The proposod project aims tot (a) support
urban areas, on a sector-wide basis, in providing the additional urban
infrastructure services and housing required to meet rapid growth in urban
population; tb) strengthen the capacity of central and local government
institutions to determine the most rational and cost-effective investments
In the urban sectort tc) enaure continued financial self-sufficiency of
urban locai authorities, including maintenance of appropriate cost recovery
and revenue generation capabilities through the Ittroduction of financial
Performnce Plans (FPPs); (4) protect eaisting and planned capital
investments oz urban local authorities through the strengthening of their
maintenance capabilitiesa (e) maximize the role of non-governmental
investors in housing, particularly building societies, as a meant of
relieving the financial burden on Government; (f) assist with
infrastructure investments and promotion of employment opportunities in
secondary urban centers as alternative locations to main citiest and Cg)
develop programs to strengthen the role of small towns and growth centers
in the Communal Areas in order to promote the economic development of their
rural hinterlands.
4.       Prolect Descri2tion. The project would consist of the following
componentst Ca) sub-sector loans to specific local authorities in the urban
areas for primary infrastructure for their next 5-year capital investment
program in water supply, sewerage, roads and drainage (including
maintenance-related plant, vehicles, equipment and spare parts); (b) sub-
sector loans to specific local authbrities in the urban areas for their
next 5-year capital investment program for residential infrastructure,
sufficient to service about 45,000 sites including the provision of related
community facilities and electricity connections; (c) mortgage financing
for housing; (d) technical assistance and training for relevant central
Government line ministries to develop their investment programming and
project appraisal capacities, and for local authorities to strengthen their
project preparation capabilities, as well as improve their overall
financial management, and operating and maintenance performance; and te) a
pilot regional development program providing (i) capital funds, to be
strategically utilized, to construct advance industrial infrastructure to
support the growth of small-scale and micro enterprises, on a proven demand
basis, and (ii) technical assistance to prepares a Development Plan and
Investment Strategy for the Harare Metropolitan Region; a Corridor Town
Development Plan and Investment Strategy for the secondary towns along the
main railway line; and District Development Plans in two provinces
(Mashonaland East and Manicaland), focused on district centers
demonstrating strong economlc growth potential. All three development
plans would pay particular attention to employment support measures, with
special reference to the informal sector.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement,  Bank involvement in the project
would fully support the Bank's country assistance strategy, and would help
ensure that GOZ policy initiatives, including strengthening of Government
capacity to select and appraise cost-effective investments, improving cost
recovery, and supporting financially self-sufficient local government,
would be implemented. Under the project, Government/Bank dialogue
successfully established through the gains made under the first project,
would be further strengthened.



6.       Actions Agreed on.  During the appraisal, the following main
agreements were reached with the Government of Zimbabwe, and were confirmed
during negotiationst (a) Government would recruit additional staff, under
technical assistance, by Dec. 31, 1989 to strengthen the appraisal capacity
in the Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development (MLGRUD)
and for the Program Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU); (b) MLGRUD
would introduce an action program aimed at maintaining the financial
viability of the local authorities, including implementing Financial
Performance Plans that would require each participating local authority to:
(i) make all past accounts current so that the accounts for FY 1989/90 can
be closed by December 31, 1990, with audits completed within nine months
thereafter; and (ii) prepare 3-5 year financial plans by June 30, 1990 that
include adoption of a program of annual financial targets designed to
ensure that, on an annual basis, total recurrent revenues, for each of the
principal service accounts would be sufficient to meet the following
expenses: for fiscal year 1991192, total cash operat4ng expenses (excluding
debt service); for fiscal year 1992/93, the sum of total cash operating
expenses and interest payments due; for fiscal year 1993194, the sum of
total cash operating expenses and debt service requirements; and for fiscal
year 1994/95, the sum of total cash operating expenses and depreciation1 or
debt service requirements, whichever is the higher; (c) establishment in
each local authority of a revolving fund, to be operated according to
procedures satisfactory to the Ministry of Public Construction and National
Housing (MPCNH) and the Bank, that would link the flow of funds through the
National Housing Fund in MPCNH to the up-front recovery of housing-related
infrastructure costs by the local authorities; (d) appraisal criteria and
procedures to be utilized by MLGRUD in approving investment proposals by
the local authorities; and (e) procedures and criteria for monitoring the
capacity of the building societies to provide the requisite mortgage
finance.
7.       Benefits.  The proposed project would reduce the need for Central
Government resource transfers to local governments by replacing public with
private sector sourced housing finance and by improving local authority
financial management, as well as by investing in social and economic
infrastructure targeted on poverty alleviation and equality. This is
evident in the nearly 702 of total project costs allocated for the
development and financing of housing and housing-related infrastructure,
which, it is estimated, will benefit approximately 500,000 people under the
project (about 652 of all new urban residents during the project period) of
whom 502 will be at or below the urban poverty threshold. In addition, 702
of the housing supplied under the sector program would be affordable to
households at or below the 30th percentile of the income distribution of
urban residents. Access to housing opportunities and related mortgage
financing for female-headed households is assured under similar procedures
to those utilized successfully under Urban I. While increasing the supply
of affordable low-income housing, the project would ensure this is done on
1 or annual contribution to the capital development fund.



a full cost recovery basis, and would secure requisite long-term mortgage
finance provided entirely by the private sector. The project would also
invest in economic infrastructure in the urban areas to support long-term
growth in the productive sectors as well as improve the maintenance of
primary urban infrastructure and services throughout Zimbabwe. In
providing for timely augmentation of urban infrastructure facilities,
ensuring suitable site selection criteria for new development, and
initiatinr a vigorous program of new housing supply, the project avoids the
environm. .. ,l degradation that may result from the growth of squatter
settlements, and assures the continuation of the existing high standards of
local practices in such areas as waste treatment and effluent control. In
addition, the project would increase the capacity of Government to make
rational and cost-eiZective choices between alternative investments. Fully
satisfactory economic rates of return of 202 are anticipated for the costs
of those housing and related infrastructure/municipal services components
of the project which are attributable under the economic analysis (about
55Z of total project costs).
8.       Risks.  Possible risks includes inability of the local authorities
to meet the requirements of the FPPs; limitations on the capacity of the
building societies to generate sufficient funds; and inability of the small
local authorities to develop and Implement suitable capital development
programs. The risks are mitigated by Government's commitment to
maintaining the financial independence and st.engthening the technical
capacity of the local authorities, and its interest in ensuring that the
shift of housing finance to the private sector will not be inhibited by
capacity limitations resulting from regulatory constraints, all of which
are reflected in Government's policies and the project objectives.
9.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
