I.Introduction

This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a second additional
grant in an amount of SDR 27.7 million (US$40 million equivalent) to the Afghanistan
Emergency Solidarity Project (P084329), Grant NumberH072-AF.

The funds are needed to scale-up activities under a successful emergency program inthe social
sector that has exceeded the original implementation (including disbursement) expectations. The
funds to be added through this additional grant were not available under IDA 13 at the time the
first additional financing was processed inJune 2005. The scaled up activities are expected to be
implemented by the original closing date and are within the original project objectives and
subject to same implementation arrangements.

The Emergency National Solidarity Project constitutes the backbone of the Government's
National Solidarity Program (NSP). The NSP i s co financed by several donors through the World
Bank managed Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (TF053939, approved on September 30,
2004 inthe amount of US$75 million) and bilateral arrangements.


11. BackgroundandRationalefor AdditionalFinancinginthe amount ofUS$40.0 million.

The Emergency National Solidarity Project was approved on December 23, 2003. The Grant
became effective on April 5, 2004. The closing date i s March 31, 2007. It i s a follow-up project
to the Emergency Community Empowerment component funded under IDA Grant H009-AF
(closed inDecember 2004).

The objectives of the Emergency National Solidarity Project are to lay the foundations for a
strengthening o f community level governance, and to support community-managed sub-projects
comprising reconstruction and development that improve the access o f rural communities to
social and productive infrastructure and services. The project finances: (i)     block grants for
communities to carry out sub-projects involving reconstruction and development activities; (ii)
community facilitation and sub-project preparation to support local communities through
facilitation exercises, assistance for preparing sub-project proposals, assistance in carrying out
sub-projects for which block grants have been made available, and capacity building for
members of local communities; (iii)    capacity building and implementation support comprising
provision of consultants' services for capacity building, implementation support to the Ministry
o f Rural Reconstruction and Development (MRRD), and incremental operating costs; and (iv)
external monitoringand evaluation.

As per last Implementation Status and Results report (December 2005), the Project is rated as
satisfactory  in achieving the Development Objective and highly satisfactory                in its
Implementation Progress.

The Emergency National Solidarity Project i s proving an effective mechanism to transfer
resources to the communities and to use them in consultative, responsible and transparent

                                                 2

manner. The Project's emphasis on community participation has shown very encouragingresults.
The secret ballot-based election process has created thousands o f Community Development
Councils (CDCs) that contribute to buildinglocal governance, while demand-driven, community
projects have benefitedabout a thirdo f the ruralpoor inrural areas.

The Project implementation progress and actual disbursements have been above appraisal
projections. The scaling up of program implementation raises the funding requirements. As of
June, 2005, Grant H072-AF (US$95 million equivalent) had been fully disbursed. An additional
financing of US$28 million equivalent was approved by the Board on June 2, 2005 (H174-AF)
whose proceeds have been fully disbursed by December 2005. The proposed additional grant o f
US$40 million equivalent would cover about 25 percent o f the estimated funding requirements
for block grants and technical assistance for Afghan SY 1385 (March 21, 2006         -  March 20,
2007), with the balance to be met with grant funds from the ARTF, JSDF, and bilateral
arrangements.

111. ProposedChanges

The proposed additional financing will require an amendment to the Development Grant
Agreement (072H-AF) to increase the amount of Block Grants category by US$24.4 million,
Consultants Services, facilitation and training by US$15.0 million, Goods by 0.5 million, and
Incremental Operating Costs by 0.1 million.

IV. Consistencywith the TransitionalSupportStrategy

The World Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS, March 2003) puts forward priorities for
the Bank's financial and non-financial assistance to Afghanistan. Under this strategy, IDA i s
focusing on supporting four strategic areas: (i)livelihoods; (ii)fiscal strategy, institutions,
management; (iii)governance and public administration reform; and (iv) private sector
development. The Project contributes directly to improving livelihoods and governance and will
facilitate economic growth through improved access to social and productive infrastructure.

V. Appraisal of Restructuredor Scaled-up ProjectActivities

Institutional:  Activities under the additional grant are a consolidation and a geographical
expansion o f the ones already being financed under the Emergency National Solidarity Project.
The institutional framework and staffing are already in place. The Ministry o f Rural
Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD) i s responsible for implementation o f the project.
Community empowerment i s at the core of the ministry's principles, policies and objectives. An
inter-ministerial NSP Steering Committee acts in an advisory capacity to MRRD on overall
programpolicy formulation and direction, and oversees program implementation. To manage the
NSP, MRRDrecruited an Oversight Consultant (OC) whose tasks include (i)       appraisal of project
proposals from communities, (ii)   transfer o f block grant funds and disbursement for approved
community projects, (iii) management of relations with Facilitating Partners, (iv) supervision and
monitoring o f implementation, and (v) capacity building for MRRD and Facilitating Partners.
MRRDalso contractedAfghan and internationalFacilitating Partner (NGOs andUN-Habitat) to
support Community Development Councils, planning and implementation of projects,
community financial management, and procurement.

Technical: The additional financing will support activities that have been undertaken under the
Emergency National Solidarity Project in the last year. Technical capacities in the country exist
and supervision capacity of the Oversight Consultant i s available. The update o f the information

                                                 3

system i s a continuing activity, with bi-annual, quarterly and weekly report being provided in a
timely manner.

Safeguards:    Sub-projects under the NSP comprise small-scale civil works which are not
expected to have any significant negative environmental or social impacts. The project observes
an updated version of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework that has been
developed for emergency rehabilitation projects in Afghanistan. Investments with negative
environmental or social impacts cannot be undertaken and are included in a negative list of
prohibited investments.

Financial Management: The financial management system for the National Solidarity Project
exists and has been reviewed by the Bank. The system will be used to incorporate the
expenditures financed by the additional grant. The project accounts under the Emergency
National Solidarity Project have been audited annually throughout implementation. Audits
reports were submitted on time and had unqualified opinions with suggestions for improvement
which were taken into account and discussed with the Bank.

Procurement: The additional financing will be usedmainly to continue the same activities o f the
ongoing program : (i)  Subproject block grant disbursements to elected Community Development
Councils (CDCs) ; (ii)  payment to Oversight Consultant who manages the program on behalf of
the recipient of the grant and 24 Facilitating Partners (international and national NGOs, and UN-
Habitat) who facilitate the communities and CDCs for implementing the village level activities
usingthe block grants disbursed to them; and (iii)  limited procurement o f goods and incremental
operating costs. The experience o f the NSP i s that 95 percent o f the NSP expenditure i s incurred
for the first two disbursement categories above. Based on the historic performance o f the NSP,
and considering the current commitments o f other donors to the Program, the proposedadditional
financing amount o f US$40 millioni s likely to be fully usedby September 2006.

As the OC and FPs have already beenhired, it is not plannedto hirenew Facilitating Partners or
OversightConsultant usingthe proceeds o fthe proposed additional grant before September 2006.
The proceeds of the grant will be used to finance the sub-project block Grants, Consultancy
(Services of the ongoing OC and FPs and new procurement o f individual consultants for various
studies), goods (vehicles and office equipment), and incremental operating costs o f the ongoing
work program as indicatedbelow.

The procurements to be financed by the additional financing will be carried out in accordance
with "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits - May 2004" and
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers      - May  2004".
The thresholds for procurement methods and prior review shall be as describedinAppendix 8.
All other provisions, includingthe threshold limits, of Schedule 3 of the original Development
Grant Agreement shall apply to the procurements under Additional Grant.Schedule 3 Section I,
Part C.
Countemart funds: The additional grant will not require counterpart funds.

Sustainabilitv: For the near term, the program's sustainability would require continued
Government commitment to channel adequateresources to support program implementation. The
program's longer term sustainability would depend on: (a) the commitment o f communities to
adequately operate and maintain the investments; (b) capacity buildingo f CDCs to enable them
to play a greater role in local level development decision making; and (c) evolution o f NSP from
a grant based program focusing on rural irrigatiodtransport access to an integrated rural
development program with access to rural finance providers. The Government recognizes the
importance o f the program in reaching out to the rural population and its huge potential as a
mechanism to support nation building, rural development and poverty reduction. The donor
community i s highly supportive o f the program`s objective. Thus, the program's sustainability i s
considered highly likely.

VI. ExpectedOutcomes
Additional financing will provide additional community-led reconstruction and development o f
rural infrastructure. Approximately 70 percent o f program funds return to local labor, and
virtually all o f the benefits from the physical works accrue to primary producers. Sub-project
choices by villagers include physical infrastructure, direct asset transfers (e.g. tools and
equipment for income generation activities) for vulnerable women and disabled people, and the
use o f block grants for income generation activities.

VII. BenefitsandRisks

It is premature to calculate economic and financial benefits inthe current Afghanistan disrupted
environment. However, under NSP data are being collected to enable estimation o f expected
returns on individual subproject investments. The proposed additional grant faces the same
implementation risks as the overall program. Specific risk and mitigationmeasures that currently
apply to NSP are listed below:

      Risk                                          Mitigation measures

Elitecapture      External facilitation o f the establishment o f CDCs through secret ballot and the
o f benefits      participatory sub-project planning process. Focus onpublic rather than private
                  goods, and transparency inbudgeting andthe use of block grants by communities.
Corruption        Same as above, as well as financial management arrangements where MRRD,
                  Facilitating Partners, and Oversight Consultant staff do not handle cash.
