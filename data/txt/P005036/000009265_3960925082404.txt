ABU QIR GAS DEVELOPENMT PROJECT
(LOAN 2103-EGT)
PRIPACI
This report reviews the results of Abu Qir Gas Development Project
partly financed by Loan 2103-EGT. The loan, made to Egypt General
Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) with the guarantee of the Arab Republic of
Egypt, for the equivalent of US$90 million was approved on March 23, 1982.
It was fully disbursed in December 1986, ibout 12 months later than the
appraisal forecast. The proceeds of the loan financed drilling services
and materials, process ani utility equipment and materials for the offshore
platform, submarine pipeline and its installation, supply and installation
of an LPG plant, consultant services, studies and training. The project
was basically completed with a 15 month delay, mainly due to procuremnhnt
and coordination delays. The physical objectives of the project !Fave been
realized.  This project copoletion report has been prepared by Energy and
Industry Division, E1ENA region, and is based on the information obtained
during completion mission and from the Appraisal, President's and
Supervision Reports, as well as other documents and files. The
implementing agency submitted final completion report containing its views
on the project execution and supplied additional data for this PCR.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), butthe project was not audited by OED staff.
OED sent ccpies of the draft report to the Borrower for comments. The
comments received have been attached to the Report as Annex 10.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EGYPT
ABU QIR GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2103-ZOT)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.       The loan under review in the amount of $90 million, was to help
finance Phase II development of the Abu Qir Gas Field off Alexandria.
Egypt General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), a state enterprise was the
borrower, and Western Desert Operating Petroleum Company (WEPCO), a joint
partnership of EGPC and a foreign company, was the implementing agencv.
2.       The project had several objectives; the main one was to raise the
level of production of gas from 100 MMCFD to 200 MMCFD, of condensates from
69,000 metric tons per year to 146,000 metric tons per year and extract
liquid petroleum gas (LPG) from all of the produced gas to reach a level of
58,000 metric tons per year. This objective has been realized. Another
objective was to assist Egypt to develop an infrastructure for the gas
subsector considering that gas was assuming importance in the energy
economy, particularly due to the possibility of oil exports declining from
the late nineties. Studies for Abu Qir gas reservoir management, for a gas
pipeline network covering all gas producing areas and important consumption
centers and for gas tariffe were accordingly provided for. These studies
have been satisfactorily carried out. The recommendations made for the
optimal development and production of the field have been adopted. EGPC
has also since laid a gas pipeline network in lower Egypt. On the gas
tariffs, initially the then prevailing gas price structure appeared to be
satisfactory in that the average sales realization would cover the long run
marginal cost of production. Currently, however, in spite of recent gas
prices increases, it is seen that the tariff level requires further upward
adjustments and 7.ecommendations to this effect are made in the PCR.
3.       The project was completed about fifteen months behind schedule at
a cost of $177.1 million, approximately 6 percent less than the appraisal
estimate of $189 million. The difference is mainly attributed to lower
outlay required on drilling, consultancy and technical services. Further,
some of the costs of the studies were covered by grant funds made available
to EGPC by other agencies subsequent to loan approval.
4.       The economic reevaluation projects that the economic rate of
return (ERR) from the project will be 36.5 percent, which is satisfactory;
but substantially short of 122 percent expected at appraisal. The lower
ERR is largely due to the sharp drop in actual and projected international
petroleum prices. On the basis of the criteria established under the project,
the project's financial objectives have been met. These criteria include use
of US$1- L.E. 0.70 for EGPC's transactions.  The return on net revalued assets
in FY88 is 18% which exceeds the minimum of 15% stipulated in the financial
covenant under this loan. However, since revision of exchange rates in 1987
if the assets were now to be revalued at the prevailing market exzhange rate
of US$ - 2.2 L.E. an increase in natural gas tariffs of 5% in real terms (or
30% in nominal terms) would be required to achieve the stipulated financial



V
rate of return in 1988-89. Subsequent increases may be necessary depending
upon exchange rate and inflation rate movements.
5.       EGPC is a mature and competent institution.  The arrangements it
had made vLth WEPCO to implement the project were satisfactory. VEPCO
imple_ented tW4s project efficiently in spite of initial procurement
delays. Th"ire are lessons to be learnt to avoid at least some of the
delays as discussed in the report.
6.       Experience in carrying out the project has highlighted the
following lesons:
(a)  The implementing agency should assure itself right at
inception that the project management consultants are
adequately equipped to coordinate all activities and to
closely monitor the progress of the project impiementation;
(b) It is necessary that bidding documents should be prepared
with a greater deg,ee of prec.sion and detail, in order to
keep procurement lead time to the minimum; and
(c)  Sector issues such as energy pricing cannot be effectively
pursued only through the vehicle of project lending.



PROJECT CUOPLETION REPORT
EGYPT
ABU QIR GAS DEVELOPHENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2103-3GT)
I.       INTtODUCTION
1.01     The Abu Qir Gas Development Project was one of four successive
projects in the Petroleum sector in which the Bank GrouF , -ticipated in
financing between 1979 and 1982. All the projects were aimed at expanding
the production and use of natural gas. The context was the remarksble
nrogress Egypt had made in developing its oil resource over twenty years
through a well conceived policy of inviting international oil companies to
explore for hydrocarbons adopting generally the production-sharing type of
contracts. By the late seventies however, apprehension was growing that
oil production could be soon peaking out and in the later nineties Egypt
could conceivably become a net importer of petroleum products. Testing of
new areas such as in the Western Desert and harnessing of natural gas for
domestic use to replace petroleum products assumed urgent relevance. The
four Bank Group financed projects were the project under review (Loan
2103-EGT approved March 23, 1982) and the following:
a) Loan 1732-EGT, approved June 19, 1979, for a project aimed at
retrieving and utilizing naturai gas previously flared in the Gulf of Suez
(Project Performance Audit Report - No. 6880 issued or June 30, 1987);
b) Credit 1024-EGT, apprcved May 20, 1980, for construction of a
netural gas distribution system in Cairo to replace higher value liquid
fuels in households, commercial establishments and power plants (Project
Performance Audit Repnrt - No. 6860 issued on June 24, 1987); and
c) Loan 1928-EGT, approved December 9, 1980 for reviving interest
in the oil and gas prospects of the Western Desert and assisting GPC, a
subsidiary of EGPC to explore, and appraise any discoveries made in its
concession block in the Western Desert (Project Performance Audit Report
No. 6862 issued on June 26, 1987).
1.02     The prnject under review had the objective of increasing natural
gas production from Abu Qir offshore field by 100 MMCFD, where in an
earlier phase (Phase I) EGPC had developed a capacity for producing the
first 100 MMCFD as from February 1979. The project also provided for
recovery of LPG from all of the natural gas. Condensates would be
recovered from the incremental gas productic as in the first phase.
1.03     All the four projects were completed successfully and have played
their part, in Egypt being able to produce presently almost 5 million toe
of natural gas, amounting to a little over 20Z of total oil and gas
consumption in the domestic market and 102 of the country's production of
oil and gas. As is known, currently oil and gas constitutes 882 of
commercial energy used, and accounts for 402 of foreign trade receipts.



-2-
1.04     The project under review had an overall cost of $177.1 million
(appraisal estimate, $189 million) and the Bank loan of $90 million thus
met about 5OZ of the cost. The project was implemented by Western Desert
Petroleur Company (WEPCO) on behalf of Egypt General Petroleum Corporation
(EGPC), the Borrower. EGPC is a state owned holding corporation
administering the oil and gas sector. WEPCO is jointly owned by EGPC and
Philips Petroleum of USA, having been established as an operating company
to develop certain oil fields and produce oil. however, WEPCO agreed to
develop the Abu Qir Gas field and produce natural gas from it, wholly to
the benefit of LGPC subject to all costs of development and production of
gas, being borne by LGPC.
1.05     This report is based on the findings of two Bank missions, one a
brief and preliminary mission in July 1987, and the other more extended in
February 1988. Documents and reports available in the project files have
been consulted.  WEPCO prepared a brief project completion report and
cooperated fully with the mission by helping it to acquire supplementary
data for this report
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01     The project was identified during the visits of the missions of
the Energy Department in mid-1980. Pha3e II development of the Abu Qir Gas
field covered by the Project was based on a study undertaken by consultants
who had prepared a development plan and the basic engineerin3 design for
the phase.
2.02     The project was appraised in February 1981.  The following were
the major components.
(a)       Fabrication and installation of two offshore platforms
one for drilling and production and the other for
living quarters and utilities;
(b)       Drilling of nine wells from the drilling and production
platform;
(c)       An 18 inch submarine pipeline of 15km length from the
drilling and production platform to Abu Qir Onshore
terminal and a 14 inch submarine pipeline between the
two platforms;
(d)       Onshore gas/condensat3 separation and stabilization
facilities;
(e)       LPG plant to process 250 MHCFD gas;
(f)       A 24 inch pipeline to Alexandria area and distribution
lines to selected bulk consumers facilities;
(g)       Technical assistance and training relating to
engineering, drilling, reservoir evaluation and planning
for pipeline network in Egypt and some studies.



-3-
2.03     The Bank loan provided foreign currency financing for drilling
(other than rig hire), engineering and related services, offs}ore
platforms, submarine pipelines, associated onshore and offshore fa-ilitieq,
LPG plant, consultancy services, most of the studies and training.
European Investment Bank finar zed the drill rig hire charges and ZGPC
financed tLe local costs and provided the foreign exchange for the
Alexandria trunk pipeline and the distribution lines,
III.  PROJECT IMPLEHENTATION
Backaround
; 01     EGPC, the borrower, nominated WEPCO for implementing the project,
except for the Alexandria trunk pipeline and distribut.on lines, which was
entrusted to Petroleum Pipeline Co (PPC), a subsidiary of EGPC in late
1983, after initial assignment to Petroleum Gas Company, another subsidiary
of EGPC (PETROGAS). WEPCO was assisted by ENPPI, a joint engineering
enterprise between EGPC and Brown & Root (USA) for engineering, design,
procurement and project -anagement.
3.02     The original project implementation schedule based on the
development plans made by the consultants provided for project completion
by June 1984.  However, owing to various delays which are discussed in para
3.03, the project was completed in October 1986, after a delay of over two
years.  Project components other thar the Alexandria trunk line were
thowever completed by September 1985 involving a delay of about 15 months,
at which time the project could be commissioned partially with gas being
supplied to power stations and fertilizer plants not dependant on the
laying of the line and LPG and condensate also being produced.
Implementation Delays
3.03     The major reasons which caused the de±ays in project
implementation were procurement and some lack of coordination among the
various agencies. The planning for procurement itself had been carefully
done. Thus for offshore items, packages for procurement were made with a
view to achieving the least cost solutior, and transfer of technology. The
need however was for good engineering, project supervision and
coordination. This part of the work, due to the philosophy of dependance
on local agencies, although they had collaboration with foreign
consultants, was not well executed to start with. All the same a turnkey
approach would not have been advisable and it is open to question if such
an approach would have avoided some of the delays which were beyond
anyone's control. For the onshore items, mainly the LPG plant, a single
responsibility contract was awarded and the execution was highly
satisfactory. In this case, subpackaging would have been of no particular
advantage and in fact could have led to difficulties in matching equipment.
In what follows, the delays are listed and commented on.
(i)       Delay in the mobilization of the offshore drilling rig
which the drilling contractors were acquiring new from
Argentina and the fabr ..ation of which was delayed by
the Falkland Island hostilities.



-4-
(ii)      Delay in fabrication of jackets and decks of the
offshore platforms due to poor performance of the
contractor and delay in installations due to bad
weather.
(iii)     Delays caused in obtaining third party inspection
certifications as the contractors contested the
inspector's findings.
(iv)      Delay in construction of the 14 inch submarine pipeline
between the two platforms due to poor quality of the
l'ne pipe supplied by the contractor, not approved by
the third party inspector and eventually replaced by the
supplier.
(v)       Delay by WEPCO in awarding contracts for offshore hook
up.
(vi)      Delay in completion of Abu Qir Reservoir Study due to
consultants having had to be changed during the study.
(vii)     Delay in the construction of the Alexandria Gas trunk
line in delayed assignment to PPC as well as due to land
acquisition problems.
(viii)    Poor coordination among various agencies, WEPCO and
EGPC. All these delays necessitated extension of the
loan closing date initially by six months to June 30,
1986. Additional extension by six months of the closing
date to December 31, 1983 was made to extend validity of
letters of credit beyond June 1986 and payment of
retention money to contractors. In the following the
major implementation problems are discussed.
Drilling
3.04     As a result of the then worldwide shortage of offshore drilling
rigs, in April 1981 WEPCO awarded a drilling contract to Reading and Bates
as so as to make it worthwhile fir them to fabricate a new cantilever type
jack up drilling rig and make it available on site in October 1982. This
rig was being fabricated in Reading & Bates yard in Argentina when the
Falkland Island hostilities broke out. The rig arrived tn Alexandria in
FeLruary 1983 about four months behind schedule.  WEPCO saved about three
weeks of mobilization time and about $0.5 million in costs by changing mode
of transpor,ation from wet towing to dry towing of the drilling rig.
Platforms
3.05     WEPCO engaged Petrojet, a local construction company for
fabrication, transportation and installation of the offshore drilling cum
production platform (P-2) and the platform for the living quarters and
utilities (Q-2). Petrojet i" turn subcontracted to Mcdermott of USA with
the deck only to be fabricated by the Alexandria Shipyard. The platform was
supplied about 13-112 months later than the contracted date. The main
reason was Petrojet's inexperience and lack of resources in keeping with



the magnitude and complexity of the job. Other contributing reasons were
procurement delays, lack of coordination with the subcontractors and poor
workmanship which third party inspectors (Germanischer Lloyds) refused to
certify but which Petrojet contested over prolonged periods. Due to these
delays, WEPCO had to go to the additional expense of storing and
maintaining living quarter modules which had been supplied by ether
contractors on time.
Submarine Pipeline
3.06     The 18 inch pipeline was satisfactorily completed with minor
delays mainly caused by the breakdown of the pipelaying barge and bad
weather conditions. The 14 inch bypass line between P-2 and P-1 existing
platform was delayed as the line pipe supplied was not up to the standard
and was rejected by the third party inspector (Lloyds). The sup lier
replaced the stock of pipes.  About one year was lost in the pricess.
Offshore hook up
3.07     Due to inadequate response to the bids originally issued, there
was readvertisement with the bidding documents undergoing revision and
detailing. Some time was thus lost in selecting a contractor for the hook-
up.
LPG plant
3.08     In this case there was a plethora of 33 bidders at the
prequalifying stage. Rebidding had to be done due to poor soil data at the
first bidding. There were 13 voluminous bids which had to be %nalyzed to
select one single responsibility contractor. All these led to a late award
of the contract. The LPG plant was brought on stream in December i985
instead of the original schedule of September 1983. The LPG contract was
amended to incorporate LPG pumping units. This additional work was
completed in October 1986. The execution of the LPG plant project
component on a single responsibility contract basis proved to be highly
satisfactory. The plant performance has fully met the design criteria and
is operating very efficiently.
Abu Qir Reservoir Study
3.09     This study was originally awarded to a consultant.  However,
during the execution of the study, WEPCO found the methodology and approach
of the consultants unsatisfactory. This study was so crucial to the
determination of Abu Qir reserves, that WEPCO decided to reorganize it;
reevaluating geological data by one consultant, and then providing that
data to a reservoir consultant to assess the gas reserves of Abu Qir field.
The reservoir study was completed in October 1986 and the results were
reviewed by WEPCO and Bank staff. The expectations from the reservoir have
been confirmed.
3.10     During supervision, Bank missions had interacted with WEPCO and
EGPC with a view to minimizing delays and finding remedies to
implementation difficulties. It is creditable that with all the problems
encountered, some of which were beyond anyone's control, the overall
commissioning of the platforms, onshore terminal and plants was only about



15 months behind schedule. The institutions involved presently have a
clearer appreciation of the problerms and will use the experience gained to
better advantage in future projects.
Achievement of Physical Project Objectives
3.11     As noted above, the physical objectives of the project were
successfully achieved.  As part of the project execution the following
studies had been prescribed. (A study for computerization is discussed in
;           section VII).
(i)       Abu Qir Reservoir study;
(ii)      National Gas Pipe line grid Study;
(iii)     Feasibility study for a gas system for upper Egypt;
(iv)      Gas tariff study for Abu Qir gas.
3.12     The resr voir study clarified the position regarding adequacy of
Abu Qir Gas reserves for the production profile in view and --ovided an
optimum gas recovery scheme, which could form the basis for the development
plans underlying phase II and for future gas development.
3.13     The National Gas Pipeline grid study was completed by the Italian
consultants appvinted by EGPC under an Italian grant based on which a
pipeline network interconnecting all sources of natural gas in lower Egypt,
with Cairo as the focal point has been also completed. For upper Egypt, a
feasibility study for a pipeline to Kima about 600 kms from Cairo was
carried out, but the project has so far not been approved for
implementation. The Gas tariff study was carried out internally by EGPC
in September 1984, about 15 months later than the stipulated date. Bank
staff reviewed it in November 1984 and accepted iL in principle. The
tariff structure as reviewed in the study forms the basis for adjustment in
gas tariffs.
Performance of Consultants
3.14     WEPCO and EGPC employed foreign consultants to carry out various
studies included in the project, to provide technical assistance and to
provide third party inspection during project execution. Except for
consultant engaged initially for the Reservoir study, all others performed
satisfactorily and provided valuable assistance in the transfer of
technology to WEPCO and EGPC staff associated with them. As for local
consultants, ENPPI had initial difficulties in carrying out project design,
engineering and preparation of bid documents (e.g. LPG plant) because of
the shortage of experienced staff and lack of adequate interactions with
other agencies who wTere to feed data. The delays in procurement and
project implementat:.on could have been avoided, had ENPPI been better
equipped for preparing the design and procurement documents. After the
compietion of the project, it is concluded that in spite of the original
delays caused by ENPPI's actions, the design and engineering for the
various project components have proved to be good on the test of actual
performance. In future ENPPI could do better if it collaborater with its
foreign partners more actively in accepting overall project responsibility.



-7-
The third party inspection personnel effectively contributed to the success
of the project by alerting WEPCO to design, construction and commissioning
mistakes in the construction of offshore platforms, submarine pipelines and
the LPG plant.
Performance of Contractors
3.15     The overall performance of the contractors for the various project
components was satisfactory. The major delays in construction of offshore
platforms were caused by Petrojet. This local contractor lacked
experience, resources and sufficient construction equipment. Although
Petrojet subcontracted to Mcdermott and others, it could not play its
coordinating role well, neither with the subcontractors nor with the third
party inspectors and in hindsight, it is seen that Petrojet should have
been given an associate role only with competent foreign contractors being
in the lead and reporting to WEPCO. The experience with the LPG plant
which was constructed on a turnkey contract basis has been good. The
turnkey arrangement aided in speedy implementation of the project after the
initial procurement delays were overcome.
Reporting
3.16     WEPCO complied fully with the reporting requirements.  It
forwarded to the Bank regular progress reports on the physical and
financial progress of the project in sufficient detail and also made
available technical data, copies of reports and studies and any other
information sought by the Bank, without hesitation.

Review of Project Costs
3.19     Annex 1 gives a detailed comparison between the SAR ?stimates and
actual project cost. The $12 million project underrun may be mainly
attributed to some reduction in costs in the consultancy and technical
services and some cost savings in changing the mode of transportation of
the drilling rig rram wet towing to dry towing and thus saving about three
weeks of mobilization time. The cost overruns in the offshore platforms,
utilities, submarine pipe line and LPG plant were caused by implementation
delays, bad weather and redoing of certain jobs rejected by inspectors,
amendment to LPG plant contracts for additional tasks required, and
increase in the cost of materials and services used in the drilling phase.
The Alexandria trunk pipeline and distributions lines cost about 362 more
than the appraisal estimates, mainly due to later implementation of this
component as well as allocations made towards centralized tele control
systems for the lower Egypt pipeline network. The cost of studies was
lower as some of the studies were covered by other grant funds made
available to EGPC (e.g. Italian grant) for the feasibility study of Gas
system in Upper Egypt and the Pipeline grid study.
3.20     A comparison of the project financing plan prepared at appraisal
and the actual financing is made below.
US$ Million
SAR        Actual
Estimate
Bank                                    90.0         90.0

EGPC Interest during construction       11.0         15.0
200.0       192.1
The Bank loan of US$90 million was fully utilized. EIB provided
US$35 million for hire of the drilling rig, helicopter services and a part
of offshore platform expenditure. EGPC provided its own resources to cover
the remaining costs.
3.21     Disbursements
Annex 2 presents actual disbursement schedule as compared to the
original disbursement schedule. Disbursements were seriously behind
schedule during the first two years of the project because of the initial
procurement and implementation delays described in para 3.03 in this
report. The loan was fully disbur3ed by December 31, 1986 a year later
than the original closing date.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     In 1979 WEPCO completed the first phase of the Abu Qir development
comprising nine wells and gas production commenced in February 1979. The



_ 10 -
Phase II development of Abu Qir, which formed the project, was designed to
provide an additional ',00 MHCFD of gas, 77,000 tons per year of condensates
and 58,000 tons per year of LPG. The appraisal report had estimated
commencement of production at the end of 1984 with full production being
achieved in 1985 and subsequent years. As has happened, due to project
implementation delays, production could commence only at the end of 1985,
and full capacity production was achieved during 1987. Additional gas
production has been over 100 MMCFD and condensate output, 125,000 tons/yr,
exceeding expectations. LPG output is lower at about 50,000 tons/yr, due
to the LPG being richer in butane (152 propane, 852 butane) than had been
assumed at appraisal. It is expected to increase to the desig8.ed LPG
output when !GPC is ready to use 702 propane and 302 butane LPG mixture for
distribution in the market.
4.02     The Abu Qir gas reserves had been estimated by the consultants
(under LN 1732-EGT/Gulf of Suez Project) at about 2.6 TCF at appraisal. It
was, however considered that after additional dat& were obtained from the
nine new wells of the Project, a reevaluation of the reserves should be
made and reserves confirmed before further investments were undertaken.
The first reevaluation done by consultants did not progress satisfactorily.
On WEPCO's suggestions, the Bank agreed to the engagement of new
consultants, in fact two sets of consultants. One consultant performed a
thorough geological study of the Abu Qir field. The second, reservoir
consultants prepared a reservoir study based on the latest geological
report from the geologicel consultants and the production data. The Bank
staff joined WEPCO in reviewing the results of this latter study with the
consultants. The final report indicated gas reserves of about 1.8 TCF
adequate for Phase II expansions. The deliverability profile given in this
report has conformed to the past production data. This study has also
indicated the areas of the reservoir which are not yet being drained and
has provided new knowledge about the Abu Qir Field. WEPCO has reported
that all equipment and facilities are operating satisfactorily. An
inspection of the project by Bank staff in February 1988 showed good
housekeeping, efficient preventive maintenance, cost conscious operations
and effective management by operations and other staff. At present, all
operations are being efficiently run by WEPCO staff, many of whom had the
benefit of being trained during the design, construction and commissioning
stages of thL Project both abtoad and on-the-job when associating with the
foreign consultants and contractors' personnel. Bank financing supported
53 manmonths of training in various disciplines.
Environmental and Safety Aspects
Safety
4.03     WEPCO is operating its offshore and onshore facilities with strong
emphasis on safety. Adequate provision for fire prevention, detection, and
fire fighting is provided. The stringent safety codes of International Oil
and Gas industry are being strictly followed and its compliance is
regularly inspected by safety experts reporting directly to top WEPCO
management. The staff is regularly given instruction in safety procedures
for offshore platform submarine pipelines, and gas processing plant. WEPCO
is in close contact with Philips Petroleum Company and takes full advantage
of its practices and training facilities for its staff in fire detection,
prevention and safety measures required to be taken in all production and
processing operations.



-11l-                                                 1
Environment
4.04     The offshore gas platforms are located about 39 km from Abu Qir
onshore. Since natural gas which is produced from the wells does not
contain any sulfur or carbon dioxide contents, it does not pose any
environmental hazards. All gas and liquids are transported by submarine
pipelines to onshore Abu Qir Gas processing plant. There is no contact of
produced hydrocarbons externally. The submarinie gas line is closely
monitored for leaks.
4.05     At the Abu Qir plant, which is located away from the dense
populated areas of Alexandria, WEPCO has taken adequate measures for -he
protection of the environment against pollution and safety hazard from
naturpl gas liquids, cheMically treated water and other pollutants. There
are adequate fire detection and prevention measures at the plant. However,
no formal reporting on environmental impact is being done by WEPCO. In
view of the expanding population due to industrialization in Abu Qir area,
greater attention is needed to be given to environmental impacts of the
activities of the operating companies in the area.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.0;     EGPC, the state owned oil and gas corporation has performed
commendably in shaping an effective strategy for the development of the gas
subsecter. International oil companies (IOCs) which have a large presence
in Egypt exploring for hydrocarbons had historically relinquished gas
fincs. Oil finds were alone developed, IOCs retaining operatorship, but
otherwise accepting EGPC in joint partnership for supervision of the
production, sharing costs and of the oil produced. It was a good decision
that GOE/EGPC took a few years back to make use of the technical expertise
in these joint companies for extended activities to cover appraisal of
relinquished gas finds, development of gas fields and production of gas and
LPG. Such extended activities would be conducted on behalf of EGPC at its
cost. To keep technical control by EGPC to the minimum, cons-dering that
the Chairmen of the joint operating companies were already the nominees of
EGPC, a focal point of contact within the EGPC was provided in the person
of a Vice-President, Gas Department. He is assisted by a small core of
technical personnel in interacting on progress of gas projects and matters
concerning day to day gas ope:ations and supply.
5.02     WEPCO has been successfully operatinig and maintaining the offshore
and onshore Abu Qir gas production facilities since February 1979. The
WEPCO personnel were thoroughly trained in international oil company
standards and got training in institutions abroad, as well as hands on
training in seismic survey, drilling, production, processing and project
management during the design, construction and operation of the Abu Qir
Phase I project. For Abu Qir Phase II operations, WEPCO formed a project
management team headed by an experienced Project Manager who organized a
team of project engineers. The Project Team was reEponsible for design,
construction and commissioning of both onshore and offshore project
components. The project team was assisted by foreign consultants and
ENPPI, the Egyptian consulting company (with its foreign partners) who
discharged the various responsibilities assigned to them by the WEPCO
project team. After commissioning, the responsibilities of the Project



- 12 -
were taken over by the Operations Department. The operations staff had
been trained in various suppliers' and consultants' facilities abroad in
offshore drilling, production, pipeline, safety and other operations.
Other operating staff had been trained in LPG plant operations both abroad
and in working with consultants in the initial operating phase of the
plant. WEPCO staff both in Projects and Operations are very competent, and
have acquired useful experience. The Bank mission inspected operations in
February 1988 and was satisfied with WEPCO's operational capabilities and
quality of performance.
5.03     WEPCO makes cash calls on EGPC for all of the gas related
investments and operations as well as for a share of its common expenditure
allocable to gas activities. EGPC has adequate arrangements for scrutiny
of WFPCO's demands. Good budget control procedures exist. Procurement
procedures are well formulated. There appeared to be some need for a
larger degree of delegation cf financial powers to WEPCO, which could be
secured without dilution of its accountability. For example, WEPCO could
make payments to foreign vendors and contractors without every claim having
to be passed to EGPC, so long as the purchase orders and contracts have had
earlier approval, or a post audit could be taken up.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
6.01     The market for Abu Qir gas is expected to be fully developed in
FY88. The project will provide an incremental annual production of about
40,000 MMCF of gas, about 125,000 tons of condensate and about 50, 000 tons
of LPG compared with the appraisal estimates at 36,500 MMCF of gas, about
77,000 tons of condensate and about 58,000 tons of LPG. The build up of
production vis a vis appraisal estimates is shown in the tables at Annex 3.
The following table indicates main gas users and type of fuel replaced:

Condensate is used to upgrade crude oil and LPG to satisfy tne domestic
market demand. Fuel oil replaced by gas can be exported and the LPG
production reduces the need for imports. The project thus has a beneficial
effect on Egypt's balance of payments.
Cost and Pricing of Gas
6.02     A criterion for the pricing of Abu Qir Gas was that the average
price level should, as on July 1, 1984, not be less that the marginal cost
of production and an allowance to account for the depletion of the gas



- 13 -
reserves. This requirement had technically been satisfied. However, on
the basis of the data currently available on actual operating costs and
prevailing tdriffs and the more realistic exchange rate of $1 - 2.2 LE the
long-term marginal cost for Abu Qir gas is $0.75/MCF (equal to LE 75/toe),
including $$0.15/MCF towards depletion against a sales realization for Abu
Qir gas in 1988 in the Alexandria area of about $0.45/HCF or about (equal
to LE 45/toe). in Section IX containing conclusions, this and other facts
are cited to recommend gas price increases on a national level.
Economic Rate of Return
6.03     Using the appraisal methodology (Annex 4) the ERR for the project
is 36.52. The cost stream includes all capital costs and operating costs
involved in the project development and operation of the field. For the
purposes of deriving the benefit stream, gas has been assumed to release
fuel oil and some naphta for export. LPG produced will avoid corresponding
import of LPG. Condensate is blended into crude oil releasing
corresponding quantity of crude oil for export. The ERR is fully
satisfactory, but substantially belo.; the appraisal estimate of 122Z. The
main reason for the lower ERR is the decline in international petroleum
prices, which occurred as the project was cumpieted. The appraisal
projection was based on a crude oil price in 1981 of 034/bbl, which was
assumed to increase by about 32 p.a. in real terms reaching to S60Ibbl. and
petroleum products were assumed to have simiiar rates of increase in
prices. Crude oil prices actually dropped below $15.0/bbl in 1986 and ever
since have been marked by producers' Lforts to raise the prices to
$18.O/bbl and market forces which often have frustrated the efforts. The
delay in gas market development in Alexandria and a part of the gas
replacing naphta and not the more valuable gas oil as was projected, has
affected the ERR only slightly, particularly as the project costs were
lower than the estimates (142 lower for the WEPCO components).
VII. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
7.01     The appraisal report of February 1982 examined the main features
of EGPrc's prevailing financial situation and the finances of the Abu Qir
gas Field, treating it as a financial entity. EGPC's financial situation
has continued to remain satisfactory, largely a result of earnings from
export of petroleum. Due to implementation delays of about 15 months, the
Bank financed Phase II development project had an impact on the revenues
from FY87 only, partially in that year and more fully from FY88. In a
latter paragraph, the financial viability of the Abu Qir field is
considered. But it may be mentioned here that the expectation at appraisal
that "in effect, Abu Qir would be operated as an autonomous enterprise for
accounting purposes within EGPC's accounting system" has not materialized.
WEPCO compiles accounting data on investments and operating costs only.
Gas is delivered free at WEPCO's battery limits to Petroleum Pipeline
Company, a subsidiary of EGPC, which transports the gas through its
pipeline net work in lower Egypt, mixing the gas from all sources. The gas
is then marketed to consumers by Petrogas, another subsidiary of EGPC,
including marketing within the proximate areas of Abu Qir where Abu Qir gas
is presumed to go. In the absence of a cos,ing system to collect detailed
costs and apportion them by sources of gas, by products where more than one
product is handled and such other allocations, the best that can be done is

to develop a proforma income statement based on estimates and
approximations. EGPC should develop a good costing system for which it has
the necessary expertise as well as consultant studies completed under the
Gulf of Suez project (Loan 1732-EGT).
EGPC's Financial Position
7.02     EGPC's unconsolidated income statements for 1983-1987 are
summarized below. Details are shown in Annex 5.

EGPC uses the exchange rate of 1 LE = $1.44.
7.03     The close correspcndence betweer: the export revenue and net profit
is noteworthy. In 1986 and the first half of CY 1987, the decline in
export earnings was an aberration brought by the constrained export market
and low international prices for petroleum. It seems unlikely that the
export prices would get to be lower then what they had dipped to in 1986.

7.05     It will seem ftom the financial statements that EGPC is
conservatively capitalized with a low debt equity ratio and its net
profits, as a percentage of sales revenue is high. Sufficient information
on EGPC's assets, directly owned and through 'investments' is not available
to review profits as a proportion of assets. However, on the basis of
available information it can be concluded that the fina.n_al situation of
EGPC remains satisfactory and with upward domestic price revisions for
which there is much scope and urgent need the position would remain good.

Abu Qir Field
Present Finances
7.07     An income statement in respect of Abu Qir gas operations (Phases I
and II) for the years 1981-1988 has been prepared, making use of investment
and production cost data available !#ftn WKPCO anci estimating revenues from
consumer tariffs and net backs to WEPCO on a notional basis (statement is
at Annex 7). Operations of Phase II were reflected in the income from
FY86, but the full effect was realized in FY88. A summary of the financial
results for FY86 and FY87 together with estimates for FY88 is given below.
Corresponding appraisal report data are juxtaposed.

7.08     The financial results have been poore. than projected, firstly due
to a 15 month delay in implementation and secondly due to sale prices
having been lower than expected. At appraisal, 't was assumed that the
price of gas (notional to WEPCO) would be increased from LE 0.17/MCF in
198, to LE 0.85/MCF in 1987.  In fact, the price was maintained at LE
0.17/0.18/MCF until FY85. The average realization thereafter increased to
LE 0.35/MCF in FY87, following a major price adjustment in May, 1987.
Although the gas price increases were lower than appraisal expectation, due
to the annual inflation being lower than assumed in the appraisal
estimates, the operating expenses have been lower. As a result, the net
income in FY88, the first year of full production, is expected to be close
to the SAR anticipation.
Financial viability of Abu Qir Gas Operation
7.09     It is necessary to test this against one main criterion adopted at
appraisal.  There was to be a return of not less than 10Z on net revalued
fixed assets in the first three years of operations of the Abu Qir project
and 15% thereafter. This criterion was premised on GOE having agreed to
increase gas prices to a level which would be above the marginal cost of



- 17 -
production of the field. In addition, as the subsequent widening gap between
the official exchange rate accordeo to EGPC and the market exchange rate was
not anticipated a mechanism for revaluing assets and calculating production
costs on the basis of the market rate was not stipulated. The exchange rate
used in the SAR (February 1982) is US$l= LE 0.70 which was the Central Bank
pool rate for handling exports of petroleum, raw cotton and rice; pipeline
revenues; imports of essential fo d stuffs, insecticidesand fertilizers, etc.
On the basis of the existing natural gas prices and official exchange rate of
US$1=0.70, Abu Qir gas operations are expected to show a positive net income
and yield a rate of return of 18Z on net revalued assets as shown below.

This compares favorably with the 15% for FY88 assured by EGPC during loan
negotiations.  However, given the magnitude of the divergence between official
exchange rate accorded to EGPC and the market rate of exchange if the assets
were to be revalued at the prevailing market exchange rate of 1US$=2.2 LE an
increase in natural gas prices of 5Z in real terms or about 30Z nominal would
now be necessary to achieve the stipulated financial rate of return.
Subsequent increases may be necessary depending upon exchange rate and
inflation rate movements.



Financial Covenants
7.10     The different covenants stipulated are summarized in the following
and extent of compliance is discussed.
(i)       Review of computer needs of EGPC aud implementation of
consultants recommendations on financial management and
accounting practices as were made under a provision in
Bank .oan to EGPC (1732-EGT)i
EGPC has implemented some of the recommendations of
the consultants but much remains to be done.
Progress made towards review of computer needs is
little, pending full implementation of the
recommendations on financial management and
accounting practices.
(ii)      Maintenance by EGPC of debt service coverage of not less
than 1.5 times:
This is being done.
(iii)     Maintenance of separate accounts for the project:
This was done for costs incurred by WEPCO and not
for revenues generated by Abu Qir sales.
(iv)      Revaluation of Abu Qir fixed assets according to a
method acceptable to the Bank for the purpose of
computlng rates of return on revalued assets:
Since EGPC had no interest in preparing a profoma
income account for Abu Qir field, this and other
assurances bearing on Abu Qir field as such did not
engage its attention. However from FY88, the Abu
Qir field is seen to generate the kind of return
expected but based on the premises of the appraisal
report concerning exchange rates.
(v)       Tariff structure for Abu Qir to yield stated rate of
return and other requirements.
Complied with on the basis of the exchange rate of
$1 - LE 0.7 permitted for EGPC by GOE.
(vi)      Non-incurrance of debts related to Abu Qir field unless
the project debt service coverage for the field is at
least 1.5 for any year.
In the absence of the Abu Qir field becoming an
independent financial entitv, the condition bec  e
impractical.

VIII. ROLE OF THE BANR
8.01     Bank had always emphasized the importance of exploiting the gas
potential in developing countries. In Egypt such interest of the Bank
resulted in three out of four Bank supported projects in the early eighties
being gas related. This project for Abu Qir was jointly conceived and
prepared by the Pank and EGPC/WEPCO. Assistance was continuid through the
successive stages of preparing bidding documents, tendering ard procurement
and later in project implementation. A particularly useful cointribution
was made when Bank staff participated In discussiors with consultants who
reevaluated the reservoir. One conclusion is that there would be further
scope for expansion of the field. Bank staff monitored the progress of the
project both through the reports and data received and field visits. From
time to time, snags and difficulties were discussed such as for example the
delay that was occurring in the construction of the Alexandria trunk
pipeline with its adverse impact on market development. EGPC/WEPCO always
appreciated advice given by the Bank staff. The one area where progress
could not be made was for EGPC to prepare all of the separate financial
statements for the Abu Qir field operations, in particular the 'profit and
loss' statement. EGPC had however appreciated the need for introducing
good costing systems and collection of direct as well as indirect costs on
production, transportation and distribution of gas. Consultants have
prepared costing manuals and have trained EGPC personnel in costing.
Although Abu Qir is not being operated as an 'autonomous enterprise for
accounting purposes' as envisaged in the appraisal report, it is seen that
EGPC would move in that direction once the costing system, now under
implementation, is extended to cover all activities.
8.02     The Bank endeavored to get EGPC to look at some major questions in
the subsector through this project and numbers of studies were indicated.
One good outcome has resulted from the study for the pipeline network in
lower Egypt. Although the study ultimately was not financed under the
project, presently there is a nearly complete network in existence. On
prices and tariffs for gas, where a major thrust was to be made, the
results have been slow in coming. The Gas Tariff study referred to in para
3.13 helped to emphab'ze that, whatever may be the way the prices for gas
are determined, these should enable recovery of marginal costs together
with a depletion allowance. EGPC has consistently made out its case for
increases in prices of petroleum products including natural gas to the
Govert:ment. The macro issues covering such price increases have been under
continuous discussion between the Bank and the Govertunent at the higher
levels.
8.03     On inviting IOCs to explore for hydrocarbons, Egypt has been
successful over the years. But until recently gas prone prospects rarely
interested IOCs, nor would they develop gas finds. This lack of enthusiasm
had been a subject of dialogue between GOE/EGPC and Bank staff, more with a
view to displaying Bank's deep interest in Egypt making conditions
conducive for IOC risk investments in gas. The ratification by Egypt's
Parliament in February 1988 of several agreements for exploration, which
incorporate liberal terms for gas development augurs well for a leap in gas
production and GOE/ EGPC have to be commended for the new measures.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The physical objectives of the project have been achieved,
although with a delay of 15 months, but with some cost savings. An
additional 100 MMSCFD of natural gas is available, as also LPG and
condensates. All facilities and plants have been constructed to good
design standards, are operating efficiently and are -maintained well. The
reservoir is known to be good and has a further potential for adding to
production beyond Phase It.  WEPCO staff h. :e been trained adequately and
are performing competently. The associated engineering consultants, namely
ENPPI have been learning by experience. But for major assignments in
future, it appears necessary chat they should have a more active
collaboration with their foreign partners and have the benefit of a greater
number of experts working with them. WEPCO has a capable project
management team, which can handle future prijects of this nature.
9.02     The economic rate of return at 36.5% is satisfactory.  This is
however lower than the 122% expected during appraisal and is a consequence
of the decline in internatiknal petroleum prices not anticipated when the
appraisal was done. The financial performance of Abu Qir gas field is
satisfactory on the basis of the criteria established univer the project.
-These criteria include use of US$l = L.E. 0.70 for EGPC's transactions. The
return on net revalued assets in FY88 is 18% which exceeds the minimum of 15%
stipulated in the financial covenant under this loan.  However, since revision
of exchange rates in 1987, if the assets were now to be revalued at t'ie
prevailing market exchange rate of US$ = 2.2 L.E. an increase in natural gas
tariffs of 5% in real terms (or 30% in nominal terms) would oe required to
achieve the stipulated financial rate of return in 1988-89. Subsequent
incrteases may be necessary depending upon exchange rate and inflation rate
movements.
9.03     The average price of natural gas, after the last (May 1987)
adjustments is 75% of its LRMC. For Abu Qir gas, the average realization
s $0.45/'MCF as compared with LRMC (for Abu Qir expansion) of $0.75/MCF
(para 6.02). But what is really relevant for a common pricing policy for
gas in a gas net work is a comparison of the average sales realization from
all of the ga4 from offhsore and onshore fields, whether associate gas or
non-associated gas, flowing thrcugh the network and the IRMC cost of new
gas that would be added from new fields awaiting development/expansion.
For all of its gas, EGPC presently realizes an average of $0.40/MCF (equal
to 40 LE/toe). The LRMC cost, including an allowance for depletion, on the
basis of data avaiiable concerning new fields and likely output as well as
costs of development, production and incremental transportation and
distribution, is estimated (by the completion mission) at $0.55/MCF (equal
to 55 LE/toe). It is this gap that should be closed first. An increase of
the gas prices at five percent per year, in real terms, would result in
attainment of LRMC by 1994. EGPC is planning to implement Abu Qir's Phase III
development. The proposed extension will have the effect of enhancing
the financial viability even on the basis of market exchange rate.
9.04     At the appraisa', it had been intended, and EGPC had agreed that
Abu Qir would provide cost data for the evolution of a proper gas tariff



- 21 -
for Abu Qir gas in the first instance, which could then be used to
determine a national average price for gas. Although ZGPC has accepted the
principle of marginal cost. Pricing much remains to be done in setting up
appropriate gas costing system. EGPC's preoccupation has been apparently
with the earnings from exports of petroleum, which have dominated the
profit picture. But some recent apprehensions over the long term
dependability of export earnings and in any case, the increasing conviction
that gas has a significant role to play in the economy, have helped to draw
attention to gas operations being run profitably and gas investments
yielding satisfactory returns. In that perspective, it is time that EGPC
organizes a good costing system and compiles data to analyze the effects of
gas prices and tariffs on return and profitability.
