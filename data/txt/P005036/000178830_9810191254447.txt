I. ENERGY SECTOR
Introduction
1.01      Over the last five years the oil sector has acquired an increasingly
dominant role in Egypt's economy and currently accounts for 75% of commercial
energy used in Egypt. Oil output increased threefold during this period, and
in 1980 export earnings from oil were of the order of $3 billion, constituting
67% of Egypt's merchandise exports. Inspite of extremely low domestic prices,
the fiscal contribution of the sector is substantial and growing; as a propor-
tion of total government revenues it increased from 10% in 1975 to about 35% in
1980. Nonetheless, on account of the rapidly depleting reserves, there was
-oncern, about Egypt's capability to sustain its present production level. In
this context, developments over the last 12 months have been encouraging. Oil
companies efforts to maintain the production level in peaking fields have been
successful, delineation drilling has led to the upward revision of presently
known oil reserves and, most importantly, there has been a series of new,
albeit, small discoveries. These developments will arrest production decline;
as a matter of fact, a modest increase in production can be anticipated.
Spurred by recent discoveries of oil in the Red Sea and gas in the Western
Desert, there has been a resurgence of interest in Egypt's oil prospects and
in the last one year Egypt has entered into 35 production-sharing agreements
with foreign oil companies. Over the next five years, an annual expenditure
of $600 million in exploration is anticipated, almost all of it is by foreign
oil companies. This should allow Egypt to at least maintain and possibly
improve upon the present production levels during the eighties.
1.02      Stimulated partly by domestic prices which are a fraction (14%) of
the international prices, domestic consumption of petroleum doubled during the
last five years and the growth rate is not anticipated to decelerate in the
near future. Such a buoyant growth rate could erode the exportable surplus of
oil. If such a trend has to be retarded, it is important that Egypt increases
the prices of petroleum products significantly, and at the same time, develop
its natural gas resources. Egypt has large and relatively unexploited reserves
of natural gas. Its currently known gas reserves are estimated at about 9.75
trillion cubic feet, equivalent to 225 million tons of oil; but presently
natural gas provides only 10% of the commercial energy. By developing its gas
fields and the concomitant infrastructural facilities, natural gas could
release liquid hydrocarbons for export and become a major source of domestic
energy during the eighties. Further, by optimizing the refinery program, so
as to take note of fractions (essentially light and heavy ends) which natural
gas could replace, Egypt could maximize its foreign exchange earnings from
oil. This would require the development of a natural gas plan and mobilizing
the necessary resources to fund it. Although Egypt has so far refrained from
international commercial borrowing for financing its investment program, it
may now be an opportune time for doing so, and the petroleum sector is likely
to be specially attractive to the banking community.
Energy Balance
1.03      Petroleum and hydroelectricity constitute the principal source
of primary commercial energy in Egypt. Coal deposits have been discovered
in the Western Desert and the Sinai Peninsula and are estimated at around



-2-
100 million tons. As in other developing economies non-commercial fuels in
the form of crop residue and animal waste are used extensively, and a recent
study estimated energy produced by these sources at around 5 million tons of
oil equivalent (toe). The table below estimates the commercial energy
balance in oil equivalent for 1980 and 1985.

-3-
Resource Endowment
1.04      The major existing and potential sources of primary energy are
indicated below:
(a) Oil and Gas
1.05      Hydrocarbons are a predominant source of energy and presently
account for 75% of the commercial energy consumed in Egypt. In 1980, against
an estimated domestic consumption of about 11.3 million tons, the production
level was around 30 million tons (600,000 barrels a day), and the recoverable
reserves are estimated at around 400 million tons (3 billion barrels). In
addition natural gas is rapidly growing into an important source of energy.
Over the last ten years, seven gas fields have been discovered and after
taking into account associated gas from the oil fields, the cumulative
recoverable reserves are estimated at about 9.75 trillion cubic feet (TCF),
equivalent to 225 million tons of oil. Current consumption amounts to 200
million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d); it is anticipated to grow fourfold over
the next four years and will by 1985 account for 25% of the commercial energy
consumed in Egypt.
(b) Hydropower
1.06      Hydropower is the only other important source of primary energy
available to Egypt and in 1980 accounted for 16% of commercial energy used
domestically. The first step to tap hydropower potential was taken in 1960
when the old Aswan Dam was equipped with turbine generators having a cumula-
tive capacity of 345 MW. The Aswan High Dam was completed between 1960 and
1970, seven miles upstream of the Aswan Dam, and equipped with the generating
capacity of 2,100 MW. With this, of the total hydropower potential of about
12000 GWh, as much as 9000 GWh were harnessed. The least cost power develop-
ment program calls for an early exploitation of the remaining hydropower
potential. In June 1980, an IDA Credit (1052-EGT) was approved to help, inter
alia, finance the installation of additional 270 MW capacity (1100 GWh) at the
old Aswan Dam. The remaining 60-meter drop in the River Nile between Aswan
and Cairo represents a generating potential of 460 MW, of which 190 MW could
possibly be realized by adding generating facilities in three existing barrages:
Esna (89 MW), Nag Hammadi (48 MW), and Assiut (53 MW). The Qattara depression
represents the only other hydropower possibility in Egypt. It would, however,
involve canalizing water from the Mediterranean Sea to the Qattara depression
(which extends 135 meters below sea level) and using the descent to generate
power. The economic viability of this project has yet to be determined.
(c) Coal, Oil Shale and Nuclear Fuels
1.07      Coal deposits have been discovered in the Western Desert and in the
Sinai Peninsula and are estimated at 100 million tons of which 35 million tons
are considered exploitable. Amongst the various reserves identified, the
deposits at Magahra in the Sinai Peninsula offer the highest potential for



-4-
development. These appear suitable for power generation and could possibly
sustain a 600 MW coal-fired power plant for about 20 years. Oil shale deposits
have also been located in the Sinai Peninsula and are 10-15 feet thick. The
data indicate that the shale is of poor quality, has low hydrocarbon content
and for the present cannot be considered as a possible energy source. No
uranium or thorium is currently being produced in Egypt. Although geological
conditions appear favorable to finding uranium deposits, airborne surveys and
limited ground radiometric work have yielded no positive results. However,
even if prospecting activities are accelerated, it appears doubtful if Egypt
would be in a position to produce nuclear fuel during the eighties.
(d) Solar Energy
1.08      Egypt has a vast potential for solar energy.  Direct daily solar
intensity is 350 calories/square centimeter in winter and 710 calories/square
centimeter in summer. However, due to the high cost of this energy, current
applications are limited to research. The main areas which are being explored
are solar water heating, water desalination, dehydration plants, and photo-
voltaic uses in deep well pumping and irrigation. This source of energy,
although available in abundance, would have to await a series of technological
breakthroughs before it can be considered for extensive application.
(e) Geothermal Energy
1.09      A few geothermal sources have been identified in northern Egypt, in
the Gulf of Suez, in the Sinai region and in southwestern Egypt. The Gulf of
Suez appears the most promising with two hot springs located in the eastern
shore of the Gulf with high flow rates in a tectonically active region. How-
ever, their low temperatures (48 degrees centigrade and 75 degrees centigrade)
limit the potential application to domestic and commercial requirements.
There is no evidence to indicate the existence of a high temperature (greater
than 200 degrees centigrade) vapor dominated system, and as such geothermal
activity cannot be considered a potential source of energy for power genera-
tion.
(f) Wind Energy
1.10      Two areas, the Mersa Matruth region on the Mediterranean coast and
the Harguda region on the Red Sea, have recorded an average wind speed high
enough (around 20 kilometers per hour) to warrant further investigation.
Research on the use of wind energy in Egypt is currently directed towards
power generation, for lighting purposes and for pump irrigation.
(g) Non-Commercial Energy
1.11      Although no data base exists for quantifying the extent of non-
commercial energy use in Egypt, it is apparent that this form of energy
constitutes a significant proportion of the total energy use, especially
in the rural areas. However, Egypt is not well endowed in biomass, with
only 2.7% of its territory under permanent or seasonal crops, the rest
being desert, or areas covered with dry or extremely arid vegetation. Only
a nominal area is under forests and, therefore, crop residues and animal



-5-
wastes are the main sources of non-commercial energy. According to a recent
estimate, this form of energy currently caters to one-fourth of Egypt's
total energy requirements. As in other developing countries, the level
of utilization of animal and vegetable wastes is very high, although the end
use efficiency is low - typically 10% to 15%. Considerable potential exists
for upgrading the end use efficiency through improved appliances.
II. OIL & GAS SECTOR
OIL
Background
2.01      Hydrocarbons are the major sources of commercial energy in Egypt
and because of limited hydro potential they are likely to be relied upon
increasingly to meet Egypt's incremental demand for energy. Although the
first oil well was drilled in 1886, oil exploration was not done on a sys-
tematic basis until the turn of the century. Commercial production began in
1913, but it was only after 1968 that oil production exceeded 10 million tons.
As of March, 1981, 45 commercially exploitable oil and gas fields have been
discovered. The 1980 production level is around 30 million tons per annum
(600,000 barrels a day); of which about 20% represents the share of foreign
partners, 40% is consumed domestically and the balance is exported. The
recoverable reserves are currently estimated at around 400 million tons
(3 billion barrels).
Hydrocarbon Bearing Structures
2.02      There are three main hydrocarbon bearing zones in Egypt:  The
Gulf of Suez, the Western Desert, and the Nile Delta. Of these, the Gulf
of Suez has been the most prolific producer and is considered to hold the
highest potential. More than 300 exploratory wells have been drilled in this
area, resulting in the delineation of 34 fields. Currently more than 90% of
Egypt's oil is produced from the Gulf of Suez. The Western Desert has been
extensively surveyed and more than 200 exploratory wells have been drilled.
The success ratio of this extensive exploration has, however, been limited.
So far only seven commercial discoveries have been made and the recoverable
reserves are estimated at 30 million tons. Despite limited success, the hope
of making a major strike persists, as giant fields have been discovered in
similar structures in neighboring countries. Exploratory drilling has been
carried out in the Nile Delta, the Red Sea, and the Nile Basin. In the Nile
Delta, while more than 50 exploratory wells have been drilled, no oil has
been discovered. However, four gas fields have been discovered of which two
(Abu Madhi and Qantara) are considered commercially exploitable. Mobil has
recently made two significant discoveries; for oil in the Red Sea near Harguda,
and for gas in the offshore Nile Basin at Temsah. From preliminary production
tests, oil reserves at Harguda are estimated at 300 million barrels and
natural gas reserves from Temsah at 1 TCF. The Nile Delta is considered to be
a very promising gas province, warranting further exploration (see para 2.14).

Exploration Policy
2.03      For exploration, development and production of oil, Egypt has
consistently followed an 'open-door policy' and almost all exploration
and production work undertaken within the country has been through foreign
oil companies. The exploration agreements have evolved from the 'concessions'
of the pre-1960s to participation agreements which were subsequently converted
into production-sharing agreements. Under the current production-sharing
agreements, the cost of exploration and development is borne exclusively
by foreign contractors and amortized, interest free, over a stipulated time
period. After taking these costs into account, (as well as operating costs),
Iprofit oil' 1/ is shared between the foreign contractor and EGPC generally
in the ratio of 20:80, although in certain areas considered highly prospective,
EGPC has negotiated its share of 'profit oil' up to 88%. In order to encourage
foreign oil companies, EGPC has recently reduced the period for amortizing
development costs from ten years to five years. Furthermore, in the Western
Desert, EGPC permits a higher level of excess cost recovery which is subse-
quently split on a negotiated basis between EGPC and the foreign company.
Exploration Plan
2.04      The exploration policy as pursued by Egypt has served well its
objective of maximizing oil production without bearing any risk of explora-
tion or needing to divert public resources for financing development. Of the
1980 production level of about 30 million tons per annum, as much as 29
million tons are a result of these production-sharing agreements. Of late,
there has been a tremendous resurgence of interest by foreign oil companies
and in the last one year 35 new exploration agreements have been entered into
with the foreign companies bringing the number of live agreements to 95,
covering an area of about 200,000 square kilometers (Annex 2.01). At present
the foreign contractors share oil with EGPC on an average, in the ratio of
1:4, and their share in 1980 amounted to an estimated 6 million tons valued at
about $1.5 billion. The seismic work, exploratory drilling and development
wells (both offshore and onshore), expected to be undertaken by oil companies
in various structures, is indicated in the table below. It must be pointed
out that the number and amount relating to exploratory wells represent only
the contractual minimum under the production-sharing agreements; actual wells
drilled (exploration and development) could be higher.
1/   "Profit oil" is the difference between oil productior and "cost oil".
"Cost oil" consists of operating cost and amortized cost relating to
exploration and development.

Current and Anticipated Level of Oil Production
2.05     Production of oil in Egypt increased from 11.5 million tons in
1974 to 20.9 million tons in 1977. The growth in the petroleum sector slowed
thereafter, and oil output grew by 17% (24.3 million tons) in 1978 and
by an average of 10/% over the next two years to reach a level of 29.5 million
tons in 1980. By early 1979, with production reserve ratio increasing, it was
the general assessment that Egypt could not sustain this level of oil pro-
duction and could conceivably become a net importer of petroleum products by
late 1980s. However, developments over the last 12 months have qualitatively
altered this assessment; resulting essentially from: (i) success attending
oil companies efforts to increase reservoir pressure and, therefore, produc-
tion in its peaking fields (July, Ramadan and El-Morgan); (ii) delineation
drilling carried out by the Belayim Petroleum Company (Petrobel), Gulf of
Suez Petroleum Company (GUPCO) and the General Petroleum Company (GPC) leading
to a significant increase in the assessment of the recoverable reserves in the
presently producing oil fields; and (iii) most importantly, a series of new,
albeit, small discoveries made in the Gulf of Suez by Deminex, Total and
Mobil. A list of new discoveries is in Annex 2.02. These developments will
arrest production decline till 1985; as a matter of fact, a marginal increase
can be expected. Thereafter, the production level would depend upon the rate
of new discoveries but given the large investment program for exploration
(over $600 million per year) it appears reasonable to assume that new
discoveries will continue. However, large discoveries in the Gulf of Suez
appears unlikely although the possibility of major finds in the Sinai, Red
Sea, or the Western Desert area cannot be excluded. On the basis of the
existing data, estimates of oil production up to 1985-86 are as under.

Demand for Petroleum Products
2.06      Consumption of petroleum products has been rising rapidly and,
inclusive of natural gas, is estimated at 13.2 million tons for 1980. This
is against a consumption of 9.1 million tons in 1977 and 6.7 million tons
in 1974. The overall annual growth rate has been of the order of 12%;
with fuel oil/natural gas, gasoline, and gas oil recording the sharpest in-
crease. At least over the next five years the growth rate is not anticipated
to decelerate significantly. This results partly from the rapidly growing
thermal power generation which is projected to rise from 8,600 GWh in 1980
to 23,000 GWh in 1985. Estimates of future consumption are as below.

2.07      The projected demand for hydrocarbons by 1985-86 is about 24 million
tons.  A qualitative change in the consumption pattern is, however, anticipated
with natural gas replacing fuel oil. In the event Egypt takes measures to
develop its known gas fields and the concomitant infrastructure, it would be
possible to increase the consumption of natural gas from the present level of
200 MMcf/d (1.85 million toe) to 800 MMcf/d (7.25 million toe) by 1985-86 (see
para. 2.19). This could contain the demand for liquid hydrocarbons to about
17 million tons.
1/   Consultants (PEIDA) commissioned to undertake a pricing study under the
Gulf of Suez Project (Loan 1732-EGT) have recently finalized their study.
The consultants used an elaborate model for projecting future demand for
petroleum products. However, up to 1985-86 their results are not
significantly different from the above projections. The consultants
estimate of the consumption level for 1985 is 23.2 million tons against
the above estimate of 23.8 million tons for 1985-86.

Refining, Transportation and Marketing
2.08      While for exploration and development Egypt has actively sought
foreign assistance and participation, refining, transportation, and marketing
of oil products is undertaken almost exclusively by state-owned entities.
Refining Capacity
2.09      The first refinery in Egypt was built in 1913.  Currently Egypt
has 6 refineries located in Suez, Alexandria, El Ameria, Mastrot and Tanta.
With the completion of the debottlenecking and balancing program, the
refining capacity is about 16 million tons. The current refining throughput
is of the order of 13 million tons. The present and anticipated product yield
from Egypt's refineries is indicated in the table below.

2.10      It can be seen from the table that the proportion of low value
heavy ends like fuel oil and asphalt is fairly high (50%) while the output of
high value middle distillates is relatively low (35%). With increased use of
natural gas as feedstock for fertilizers and as replacement for fuel oil,
there will be a growing imbalance between the consumption pattern and the
product yield, requiring Egypt to export low value fuel oil and import high
value gas oil. The refining program needs to be reviewed and optimized in the
light of the anticipated consumption pattern and Egypt's objectives of
replacing up to 7 million tons of liquid hydrocarbon (essentially fuel oil)
by natural gas. Instead of merely expanding the refining capacity, as is
currently being planned, Egypt should consider the possibility of investing in
secondary processing.

Transportation and Marketing
2.11      For internal transportation of petroleum products, EGPC uses a
variety of modes including products pipelines, railways, river barges and road
transportation. In 1980, it is estimated that 9 million tons of products were
moved by pipelines, 7 million tons through trucks, and about a million tons
through railroad and river barges. A pipeline network to carry 8 million tons
of crude from Ras Shukeir to Suez is nearing completion. From Suez to Cairo,
two pipelines having a capacity of 5 million tons already exist. Additionally,
a product pipeline from Helwan to Tebbin with a capacity of 1.5 million tons
is used for transporting products to Upper Egypt. Two other product pipelines,
each having a capacity of 0.75 million tons, link Cairo to Mansura and Zagazig
in Upper Egypt. In addition there is the Sumed pipeline consisting of two
42-inch pipelines and having a capacity of 80 million tons of crude which
connects Ain El Soukhna on the Gulf of Suez to Sidikrier on the Mediterranean,
and is being used for transporting Gulf crude to Europe. This 320-mile
pipeline is owned jointly by Egypt (50%), Kuwait (15%), Saudi Arabia (15%),
UAE (15%) and Qatar (5%).
2.12      Marketing of petroleum products is largely undertaken by two
subsidiaries of EGPC, namely the Cooperative Petroleum Company and the Misr
Petroleum Company. Mobil and Esso are also marketing products, but share
less than 25% of the market.
NATURAL GAS
2.13      Egypt has a large and relatively unexploited reserve of natural gas.
Its currently recoverable gas reserves are estimated at about 9.75 TCF equiva-
lent to 225 million tons of oil, that is, almost half of Egypt's recoverable
oil reserves. The Gas Utilization Study, recently completed by Consultants
(PEIDA) estimate the probable gas reserves at 15 TCF. This estimate too could
prove to be conservative as exploration has just commenced in the gas prone
Nile Delta and the Northern Sinai Province. Egypt also is a substantial
consumer of fuel oil and its consumption is anticipated to grow significantly
over the next ten years. By developing natural gas fields and the ancillary
infrastructural facilities, natural gas could replace liquid hydrocarbons and
become a major source of energy during the eighties. Further, by optimizing
the refinery program so as to take note of the fractions (essentially light and
heavy ends) which the natural gas would replace, Egypt could maximize its
foreign exchange earnings through the export of oil.
Non-Associated Gas
2.14      Non-associated gas on a commercially exploitable scale has been
discovered over the last ten years in the Western Desert (Abu Gharadig
and T-Structure), in the Gulf of Suez (Amal) and in the Nile Delta (Abu
Madhi and Abu Qir). Egypt has so far developed three non-associated gas
fields with a cumulative supply potential of 300 MMcf/d. Geologically, the
Nile Delta is considered the most promising gas province; an assumption
which has been reinforced by a large offshore discovery at Temsah made



- 12 -
recently by Mobil. The proven recoverable gas reserves of non-associated
gas are presently estimated at 7.75 TCF.
Associated Gas
2.15      The current production level of associated gas in Egypt is around
140 MMcf/d and, except for a nominal amount (20 MMcf/d) which is being used
for meeting oil field needs, the rest is being flared. Most of the associated
gas comes from the oil fields in the Gulf of Suez. The Bank, through Loan
1732-EGT, is financing a project for gathering, processing, and transporting
this gas to Suez and Cairo. Recent discoveries made by GUPCO, Deminex, Mobil
and Petrobel will add significantly to the availability of associated gas.
Currently, cumulative reserves of associated gas in the Gulf of Suez area are
being estimated at 2 TCF. As the new discoveries are developed and after
taking into account gas required for infield use (40 MMcf/d), associated gas
to the extent of 200 MMcf/d would become available. Existing facilities are
inadequate for gathering and transporting this gas. So as to avoid flaring
this gas, action to create gathering facilities and to augment the existing
processing facilities and pipeline, would need to be initiated immediately.

Exploration Policy
2.16      Egypt has not been successful in eliciting the interest of the
foreign oil companies in areas known to hold potential for gas. In fact,
whenever a foreign oil company in search of oil discovered gas in commercial
quantity, the concession was relinquished and the gas field was developed
by EGPC, the national oil company. This was on account of the fact that
export of gas through liquefaction was not attractive, except for a very
large gas field, and the domestic market was neither well developed nor
financially rewarding. Rapidly rising prices of liquid hydrocarbons over the
past few years have made the export of gas a more remunerative proposition.
Further, as the domestic absorptive capacity for natural gas increases, it

delineation drilling.

is in Egypt's interest to rapidly identify and develop new gas reserves. In
order to attract foreign oil companies to explore for gas, EGPC is currently
evolving a new package of incentives. It will permit the export of gas once
the national reserve requirement of 12 TCF has been established. Further,
under this package foreign companies which assist in the establishment of
commercial discoveries will be reimbursed for the cost of exploration; com-
panies which assist in the establishment of the reserves beyond 0.25 TCF will,
in addition, be paid commercial interest on its cost for the period between
the establishment of the reserves and the development of the gas discovery.
For discoveries above a stipulated level the companies would receive an
additional bonus which would be as negotiated in each production sharing
contract. Once the national gas reserves of 12 TCF have been established,
the oil companies would be permitted to export gas in liquified form. However,
in such an export arrangement, the oil companies which helped in the buildup
of reserves up to 12 TCF, would have a share in proportion to the magnitude of
their respective discoveries. Foreign companies have not been excluded from
the domestic market and can develop the discovered gas fields for internal
use on mutually agreed upon terms and conditions. While a large number of
companies have evinced interest in the new package of incentives, no agreement
has so far been concluded.
Demand and Supply of Natural Gas
2.17      Over the past few years Egypt has made significant efforts to
develop its gas potential. Presently the production capacity of natural
gas, approximately 300 MMcf/d, is greater than the current demand of 200
MMcf/d. This situation is anticipated to reverse rapidly and by 1985 the
potential gas demand is expected to be far in excess of potential gas supply,
especially in the areas of Alexandria and Cairo.
2.18      If efforts are not initiated to augment gas supply in Alexandria
and Cairo, by 1985 Egypt would have to divert annually about 4.5 million
tons of liquid hydrocarbons valued at US$1 billion in current prices, from
the export to the domestic market. It is with the objective of attenuating
this shortage that the Bank on December 9, 1980, approved a loan of US$25
million for assisting Egypt in exploring for hydrocarbons in the Abu Gharadig
area of the Western Desert. Similarly, the proposed Abu Qir offshore gas
development project aims at bridging the anticipated shortfalls in gas
supply in the Alexandria area to the extent of about 100 MMcf/d. Even
after the development of Abu Qir, potential demand will exceed supply by
a significant margin. Steps would, therefore, need to be initiated almost
simultaneously to develop fully the Abu Madhi gas field and the new discovery
in Abu Gharadig.
2.19      The table overleaf indicates the demand forecast for gas in
Alexandria, Cairo, Suez and the Delta areas against possible supplies based
on the assumption that timely and adequate investment is made on these
gas fields. Detailed market projections for Alexandria, Cairo, Suez and the
Delta area are in Annexes 2.03, 2.04 and 2.05.

2.20      In the event the potential of the known gas fields is fully
developed, Egypt would be able to replace 7 million tons of liquid hydro-
carbons ($1.7 billion, present prices) by 1985 and 8.5 million tons by
1987.
Gas Pipelines
2 21      Presently Cairo is linked with the Abu Gharadig gas field through a
24-inch gas pipeline, 370 km in length. Similarly a 57 km pipeline connects
Abu Qir gas field with the major consumers in the Alexandria area, namely, the
Abu Qir fertilizer plant and the power stations in Kafr El-Dawar and Damanhur.
Separately the Abu Madhi gas field is linked to the consumers in Talkha and El
Mahala. Under the Gulf of Suez Project, a 16-inch pipeline having a maximum
capacity of 120 MMcf/d, is being constructed to link Ras Sukheir with Suez.
An existing 10-inch white product pipeline can transport gas up to 30 MMcf/d
from Suez to Cairo. The present system essentially links individual gas
fields to specific markets that are not interlinked with one another. Not
only is this network inadequate for handling the projected increase in sup-
plies, it is incapable of transporting surplus from one field to meet the
deficits in other markets. Further, in the absence of interfield linkages,
gas-based industries would become extremely vulnerable to production problems
in individual gas fields. In order to protect the industry against this risk,
economic justification and phasing for establishing a national grid for gas
pipelines and load dispatch stations along with necessary telecontrol and
telemetry facilities would need to be studied (See para. 2.32).
Foreign Exchange Earnings, Pricing and Fiscal Contribution of the Sector
Foreign Exchange Earnings
2.22      Egypt-s export earnings from oil rose from $0.7 billion in 1977
to $1.8 billion in 1979 and were of the order of $3 billion in 1980, con-
stituting 67% of merchandise exports. Impressive increases in the production
of oil coupled with rapidly rising prices has been responsible for such a
significant jump in foreign exchange earnings. On account of rising domestic
consumption, growth of net exports in volume terms has slowed since 1978, but
has been more than offset by the sharp increase in prices.  Further, the
minimum cost recovery factor in almost all production-sharing agreements is
stipulated at 20% and in case the cost of producing oil falls below this
level, the difference reverts to EGPC.  On account of this provision, the
rapidly rising price of oil since 1979 has resulted in a higher proportion of
the cost recovery crude reverting back to EGPC.

Prices
2.23      Domestic prices of refined products in Egypt are established by a
governmental decree and, but for a few adjustments made last year, have
remained virtually unaltered over the last twenty years. This has resulted in
a significant and a growing gap between domestic and international prices. The

have to be taken since Egypt has to import these products to supplement its
domestic production. Natural gas is not traded, but to the extent it is used

in the domestic economy, it releases liquid hydrocarbons, essentially fuel oil
for exports. At least till such time as the supply of gas does not exceed
demand, the opportunity cost of gas can be taken as the fob export price of
fuel oil. The current weighted domestic price of petroleum products is about
14% of its opportunity cost.
2.25      Currently two categories of subsidies can be identified in the
petroleum pricing structure. The first is the financial subsidy which results
from petroleum products being sold at less than the domestic cost of production
(fuel oil, natural gas, kerosene and gas oil) or below the cost of imports
(LPG). The second is the economic subsidy which represents the difference
between the domestic price and the price at which the product can be exported,
but does not impose on the state a direct financial burden. The financial
subsidy for 1980 has been estimated at about $250 million and the economic
subsidy at $2,000 million. Further, unless deliberate measures are taken to
increase domestic prices, the magnitude of the financial and economic subsidy
is likely to grow even larger. (For fuller discussion please see para. 2.35).
Fiscal Contribution of the Sector
2.26      In 1980 Egypt secured a netback of about US$4.5 per barrel from
domestic sales. This is against an average price of $35 per barrel which
it received from the export of oil. The value of aggregate gross output,
and the fiscal contribution of the petroleum sector is extremely sensitive to
the relative weights of domestic consumption and export in overall output.
Despite relatively low domestic prices and rapidly growing domestic consump-
tion, the fiscal contribution of the petroleum sector is significant and
growing rapidly; and as a proportion of the total public revenues, it grew
from 10% (LE 158 million) in 1975 to 35% (LE 1460 million) in 1980. Fiscal
contribution from the sector in 1980-81 is estimated at LE 2200 million.
Investment Plan for the Petroleum Sector
2.27      An investment of about US$7.3 billion is planned for the sector
during 1980/81 - 1984/85 period. The major part of this investment ($4.8
billion) would be for exploration and development, and the balance would be
for petrochemicals, refining, processing, marketing and distribution.
A breakdown of the planned investment is presented below. It should be noted
that the expenditure planned for production and exploration will largely
dependent upon the success of the exploratory efforts.

2.28      According to the current plan, private oil companies would be
responsible for undertaking the major proportion of the investment in explora-
tion and development (81%). Investments in refining, processing, marketing
and distribution would be undertaken almost exclusively by public sector
companies. However, the amounts which have been slated for public expenditures
in development and exploration appear largely insufficient to sustain the
required program for the development of gas reserves. In fact, the projects
currently covered by the investment plan do not include the develoment of
Abu Madhi, as well as the development of Abu Qir North and Abu Qir Phase 11
(see para. 2.31). The total cost of a comprehensive program for gas develop-
ment is estimated at $1 billion, which is more than twice the requirements
taken into account in the five-year plan for EGPC and GPC development/explora-
tion efforts related to gas. The public investment program proposed for
FY81-FY83 is in Annex 2.06.
Sector Issues and the Role of the Bank
Bank Group Participation in the Sector
2.29      The proposed loan would be the fourth loan for Egypt-s hydrocarbon
sector. The first loan was made to EGPC for the Gulf of Suez Project
(Loan 1732-EGT) in June 1979. The objective of this Loan was to gather,
process, and transport associated gas, which would otherwise be flared, from
the Gulf of Suez oil fields to Suez and Cairo. The Project also included
financing for several important sector studies covering prices of petroleum
products, oil/gas reserve assessment and the optimal utilization of gas. The
project is in an advanced stage of implementation, and its first phase is
likely to be commissioned by April 1982 (four months behind the original
schedule). For the second project, an IDA credit of $50 million (Credit
1024-EGT) was made in May 1980 to support domestic gas distribution project in
four Cairo suburbs. The objective of the project was to upgrade the use of
natural gas from being a replacement for fuel oil to substitute for high value
products, namely, LPG and gas oil. This project is under implementation, the
high pressure pipeline along with the distribution network for one suburb
(Helwan) has been completed, the distribution network for the second suburb
(Heliopolis) is under construction and 13,000 households have been converted
to gas. The third loan of $25 million was approved in December 1980. The
objective of this loan was to support exploration in eight identified struc-
tures in the Western Desert. The second and the third exploratory well
drilled in the T and Y structures have resulted in two separate discoveries.
Natural Gas has been discovered in the T structure and preliminary estimates
place the recoverable reserves at 0.4 TCF. Oil has been discovered in the Y
structure; further tests on the existing well and additional delineation
drilling would need to be undertaken to determine the size of the discovery.
The progress of all Bank Group financed projects in the sector is satisfactory;
demonstrating EGPC's capacity to implement projects with speed and competence.
Sector Issues
2.30      The search for new sources of primary energy and its development
continues to be a critical aspect of Egypt's developmental effort. The



- 20 -
Bank through its lending operations has attempted to support these efforts
while encouraging efficient use through an appropriate pricing policy. Our
involvement in the sector over the last two years has provided us with an
opportunity to review sector issues; a few of the important ones are
considered below.
(i) Development of Natural Gas Resources
2.31      To maintain its status as an exporter of oil during the eighties,
Egypt would need to rapidly develop its known gas reserves and also increase
the economy's capability to use gas. Egypt has the reserves to step up gas
use from 2 million toe in 1980 to seven million toe by 1985, and possibly
10 million toe by 1990. To do so would require early and substantial
investment in the development of gas reserves and assiduous efforts to
increase the absorptive capacity of the economy through the development of an
appropriate infrastructure, specifically:
(a)  augmenting the processing and gathering capacity for associated
gas from the Gulf of Suez to potential users. The capacity
created under the Gulf of Suez project is inadequate to transport
associated gas from the new Gulf discoveries. The capacity of
the Ras Shukeir-Suez pipeline would have to be increased through
compression from 80 MMcf/d to 120 MMcf/d. Furthermore, after
the gathering and processing facilities have been completed for
the new discoveries, the capability of this pipeline would have
to be stepped up further, possibly through looping, to 200
MMcf/d. Alternatively, the option of linking Cairo directly
with Ras Shukeir would have to be considered. A feasibility
study for this purpose is proposed to be financed under the
project, which would be completed by March 31, 1983 and its
findings reviewed with the Bank;
(b)  in view of the latest reservoir estimate of the Abu Madhi gas
field, its production potential can be doubled. Development
plan which includes means for transferring surplus gas to
deficit areas would need to be prepared, funded and implemented;
(c)  separately, the Qantara gas field should be developed after
the problem of removing and transporting condensates has been
studied and resolved;
(d)  new discoveries need to be rapidly delineated and developed.
Abu Qir (North) should be developed as soon as delineation is
completed (1982), because even after taking account of the gas
becoming available under Abu Qir Phase II (proposed project),
the. demand in Alexandria will continue to be in excess of
supply. To meet the requirements of Cairo, the new discovery
in the Western Desert should be accorded priority; the existing
infrastructure including a pipeline with excess capacity
would assist in the rapid deployment of this gas;



- 21 -
(e)  even after the above gas fields have been fully developed,
the demand for gas would be in excess of supply, a gap which
would need to be bridged by diverting liquid hydrocarbons from
the export to the domestic market. So as to encourage foreign
oil companies to explore in areas known to hold potential,
largely for gas, EGPC has prepared a fresh package of
incentives. In the event these measures fail to secure the
desired response, EGPC may need to undertake exploration
through its subsidiaries, especially in the Nile Delta,
presently considered the most promising gas province.
(ii)  Natural Gas Pipeline Grid
2.32      Gas demand and supply projections indicate that Alexandria and Cairo
would be deficit in gas, while Suez and the Delta area would be surplus in
gas.  The gas network would need to be designed to transfer gas from surplus
areas to deficit areas. Furthermore, to reduce the vulnerability of gas-based
industries to production difficulties in individual gas fields, the economic
viability and phasing of a pipeline grid which would make it possible to
transfer gas from one field to the other would need to be evaluated. The
proposed loan contains financial provisions to undertake such a study. The
study is expected to be completed by March 31, 1983 and EGPC will review the
findings of the study with the Bank.
(iii) Gas System for Upper Egypt
2.33      Upper Egypt is a significant user of energy.  The requirement of
fuel oil for power, sugar and cement plants is anticipated to grow to 1
million tons by 1985. In addition the Kima fertilizer plant, (which relies on
the obsolescent technology of manufacturing fertilizer through electrolysis)
consumes 15% of the total power currently generated in Egypt and represents an
uneconomic use of energy. Provision of natural gas for Upper Egypt would not
only replace about 1 million tons of oil but also release over 220 MW of power
for lower Egypt. The loan contains financial provisions to undertake a study
to examine the feasibility of setting up a gas system for upper Egypt by using
surplus gas from the Gulf of Suez and from the newly discovered oil/gas fields
in the Red Sea. EGPC has agreed to complete this study by March 31, 1983 and
review the findings with the Bank.
(iv) Commercial Borrowings
2.34      The investment requirement for developing gas resources and establish-
ing a gas pipeline grid would require resources in excess of $1 billion over
the next four years. The present investment plan does not contain provisions
for developing natural gas resources in this magnitude. Similarly there are
other areas, including secondary processing and petrochemicals, where invest-
ment has not been made for want of resources. So far, EGPC has refrained from
international commercial borrowings to finance its investment requirements.
It is felt that financing such development within Egypt could prove attractive
to the international banking community, more so as it would have the direct
effect of increasing EGPC's foreign exchange earnings by augmenting its export
capability. However, this would require familiarization: (a) of the banking
community with EGPC's existing and proposed programs; and (b) of EGPC with



- 22 -
financing sources and techniques available. During negotiations possibilities
in this regard were discussed with EGPC. As a first step EGPC has asked an
international commercial bank to identify, negotiate and finalize a package of
credits for the proposed and possibly other projects.
(v) Pricing Policy and Efficiency of Energy Use
2.35      Movement towards an appropriate energy pricing policy has been
the principal ingredient of the Bank's policy dialogue in this sector. In
order to assist Egypt in this area, a pricing study was financed under the
Gulf of Suez project (Loan No. 1732-EGT) which has since been completed. This
study, inter alia, aimed at evaluating the effect of discrete increases in the
price of petroleum products on various goods and services, evolving policy
options and spelling out the fiscal and other implications of the proposed
measures and their impact on demand, consumption and income distribution.
This study along with the Gas Utilization Study has considerably enhanced our
ability to evaluate and formulate specific policy recommendations. The major
findings of the study are:
(a) Current energy price levels and related energy consumption
growth are unsustainable without impairing Egypt's growth
objectives. The model used by the consultants treats
economic growth as exogenous, and uses as its assumption
the Bank's projections from its DRM model for Egypt. If
energy prices and consumption paths are not changed,
achieving the target GNP growth rate would mean that by
1990 Egypt's balance of payments deficit would be over
$8 billion and its budgetary deficit would be in excess
of $7 billion. The country would become a net oil importer
by 1995. To reverse these gloomy projections will require
a comprehensive energy policy and investment strategy both
for expanded energy production and for increasing the
efificiency of energy use.
(b) The inflationary impact of adjusting energy prices to attain
world price levels by 1990, implying an average adjustment
in these prices in the order of 35-45% p.a., is significant
in that it would add a 6% p.a. to the wholesale price index
and about a 3.3% p.a. to the consumer price index. The
inflationary impact is markedly different for different major
users of energy. Lower income groups in the population, and
particularly those in rural areas, would suffer only margin-
ally while the CPI for the urban upper income groups would
increase by something less than 4.0% p.a., assuming all
price increases were fully passed on. Those groups which are
most seriously affected are basically a few large industrial
users of fuel oil and gas, most of which are in the public
sector. Moreover, in industry the 6% p.a. average impact
is heavily influenced by four major energy using industries
(aluminum, cement, fertilizer and electricity), where the
impacts range between 7% and 17% p.a.



- 23 -
(c) There are major inefficiencies in energy use by the largest
consumers in Egypt. The scope for energy savings is large;
but the studies bring out an important qualification to this
finding. Increases in energy prices are neither a necessary
nor a sufficient condition to improve the energy efficiency
of these large users. They are nearly all public sector
firms, many are chronic loss-makers, in some cases their
technology is outmoded, they are all subject to price
controls on their output; in short, they are unlikely (indeed,
unable) to be very responsive even to major changes in the
prices of their energy inputs. While in some cases, major
investments in energy technology or retrofitting for fuel
substitution would be justified, it may be more economic to
phase out production at certain plants. A cost benefit analysis
needs to be initiated to assess the viability of the current
operation of the Naq Hammadi aluminium plant, and the benefits
of a major investment which would permit the Kima fertilizer
complex to switch its feedstock from power to natural gas
(see para. 2.33). Both these units currently consume almost
30% of the power generated in Egypt. They pay less than one-
fifth of the long-run marginal cost of power, yet operate at
a loss.
(d) As a long term objective, Egypt should endeavour to eliminate
the "economic subsidy" on petroleum products by increasing the
weighted average price of all petroleum products to the weighted
average of their border prices. Within this weighted average,
there may be justification for cross-subsidies based on Egypt's
broader socioeconomic objectives. However, a necessary con-
dition for attaining this objective is restructuring the
prices of a wide range of products within the Egyptian economy.
Special attention would need to be paid to tariffs/controlled
prices relating to power, cement, steel and fertilizer - major
consumers of hydrocarbons which by government directives are
obliged to price their products at a fraction of the long run
marginal cost. However, it would not do to underestimate the
complexities involved in such a fundamental restructuring or
the social, economic and political costs it would entail.
2.36      Based on the results of the above studies, Bank proposes to undertake
a wide ranging discussion with GOE which would focus not only on the question
of petroleum prices, but on the overall issue of efficient energy use and how
best to utilize and develop Egypt's limited hydrocarbon resources for support-
ing its long-term development objectives. Under the proposed project GOE has
agreed to increase the price of gas from the project area from the present
level to a level which would recover for EGPC the marginal cost of production,
and an allowance to account for the depletion of the field. Based on the
current estimates, the cost of production works out to $0.83/Mcf and the
depletion allowance is estimated at $0.27/Mcf in December 1981 prices (see
para. 6.09 for assumptions relating to the depletion allowance). The resulting
price of $1.1/Mcf is still significantly below the opportunity cost of gas to
Egypt, as represented by the border price of fuel oil replaced ($4.0/Mcf) but
would nonetheless represent significant increase over the existing level of
$0.20/Mcf. Further, GOE will review their plans to increase the average
national price of gas and fuel oil to the level agreed to for Abu Qir gas with
the Bank.



- 24 -
2.37      An average revenue of $1.10/Mcf would ensure the independent financial
viability of the project, as measured by its ability to cover operating costs
and debt services, to achieve satisfactory rates of return on revalued net
assets after the initial construction period, and to finance future investment
in the project area. In order to avoid uneconomic fuel substitution and/or
severe financial hardship for certain gas-using enterprises, the average level
of $1.10 may be achieved through a differential tariff structure which would
vary according to end-use. During negotiations EGPC agreed to undertake a
study to evolve an appropriate tariff structure. It further agreed to complete
this study by July 31, 1983 and review its findings with the Bank by December 31,
1983, and implement an agreed tariff structure by July 1, 1984.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
History
3.01      To oversee all matters relating to the petroleum industry, the
Egyptian General Petroleum Company was created in 1956. With the general
restructuring of the public sector in 1962, this authority was converted
into the Egyptian General Petroleum Organization (EGPO) with almost similar
functions. With the promulgation of Law 20 of 1976, EGPO was converted into
the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), the borrower of the pro-
posed loan. The Ministry of Petroleum, which was created in 1973, however
acts as a link between EGPC and other government bodies and the primary
responsibility of managing and operating the petroleum sector rests with
EGPC.
Statutory Functions
3.02      The main functions of EGPC under Law 20 are to:
-    draw up a general policy for granting concessions, negotiat-
ing and preparing concession agreements for approval of the
government;
-    supervise exploration and exploitation activities of the oil
companies engaged in the search of oil and production of oil
and/or natural gas;
-    plan, coordinate and control the activities of various
affiliates in the field of production, refining, trans-
portation and distribution of petroleum products for the
domestic market;
undertake the export of crude oil and petroleum products
and effect similar imports for balancing domestic
requirements.



- 25 -
-    determine, in conjunction with other competent authorities,
the pricing of petroleum products; 1/ and supervise the
the operation and management of all subsidiary companies.
Capital Structure
3.03      EGPC's capital of LE 300 million is invested in the capital of joint
venture companies and in companies established for participation in oil
production with foreign partners. Funds available to EGPC for its operations,
consist of its share in the net profits of all its affiliates in the petroleum
sector, its share in the net profit of the joint venture companies and profits
arising out of supervision and administrative fees. In addition, it secures
funds from the government as loans. EGPC, as a distinct corporate entity, can
and has borrowed from external financial agencies, including the Bank.
Organization and Management
3.04      EGPC is governed by a Board consisting of the chairman and five
vice-chairmen who are in charge of exploration and production, planning
and projects, operations, administration, and financial and economic affairs.
Separately, through a ministerial decree, three chairmen of subsidiary
companies (GPC, GUPCO and the Petroleum Cooperative Society) along with the
General Manager of the Egyptian Petroleum Research Institute have been
appointed to the Board of EGPC (Annex 3.01).
3.05      In relation to other public sector undertakings in Egypt, EGPC
has been vested with considerable autonomy. Within the framework of general
policies set by the Supreme Petroleum Council and stipulated in the Company's
statutes, its Board is competent to issue any decree it deems suitable, any
governmental regulation or system to the contrary, notwithstanding. It is,
therefore, competent to establish its own internal regulations for financial,
administrative and technical management, and also evolve its own norms
regarding conditions of employment, remuneration, etc. EGPC is, however,
obliged to consider policy directives issued by and otherwise function under
the guidance of the Supreme Petroleum Council which is presided over by the
Minister of Petroleum and for which EGPC functions as a secretariat.
Furthermore, all resolutions of the Board have to be approved by the Minister
of Petroleum who can, at his discretion, amend or cancel any such resolution.
3.06      EGPC's management at the senior level is competent and experienced
in various aspects of the oil and gas industry. It has, over the last decade,
expanded the marketing organization to meet growing demand, set up and rehab-
ilitated a number of refineries, laid an extensive network of crude, petroleum
products and gas pipelines; facilities which it operates with competence. It
has created within its organization a specialized group which has successfully
1/   While Law 20 vests with EGPC the authority to determine prices, in
effect prices are fixed through governmental decree in which EGPC, has at
best an advisory role.



- 26 -
negotiated production-sharing agreements with more than 95 foreign oil companies.
Separately, EGPC has developed three non-associated gas fields vwithin Egypt
and linked them to the market. While foreign partners are largely responsible
for the production of oil, EGPC closely monitors their expLoration and develop-
ment programs. Egypt's improved energy position is in no small measure due
to EGPC's effective intervention in the sector. It currently faces the problem
experienced by many national oil companies of comDeting with the private
sector and the Gulf area for experienced staffL. Rapid growth has further
strained its managerial resources. In order to assist EGPC in its multi-faceted
operation under Loan 1732-EGT consultants were appointed to assist it in
devising and installing computerized management information system (see para.
3.12).
Functional Structure
3.07      EGPC functions as a holding company and oversees the entire spectrum
of oil and oil-related operations through fully owned affiliates (8), operating
companies formed in partnership with foreign oil companies (4), and joint
ventures (3) (Annex 3.02). All work relating to geophysical surveys and
exploration is carried out by the General Petroleum Company (fully owned
affiliate) and 95 foreign contractors who have entered in1to production-shatring
agreements with EGPC. The annual work program of each of the foreign
contractors is drawn up under a general framework of its respective agreements,
and reviewed and approved by a joint committee consisti ng of EGPC and the
company.  Once a commercial discovery has been made, a non-profit operating
company is formed, which operates and works the concession. Currently there
are four such operators, namely, GUPCO, Petrobel, SUCO (Suez Oil Company) and
the Western Desert Petroleum Company (WEPCO). All refining and processing of
petroleum products is undertaken by three fully owned affiliates of EGPC,
namely the El Nasr Petroleum Company, Alexandria Petroleum Company and the
Suez Oil Processing Company.  Similarly Egypt-s extensive network of pipeLines
for transporting crude oil and petroleum products is owned and operated by
another fully held affiliate of EGPC, namely, the Petroleum Pipeline Company.
Marketing and distribution of petroleum is undertaken by the Misr Petroleum
Company and the Cooperative Petroleum Company. LPG and natural gas are,
however, marketed by the Petroleum Gas Company (Petrogas). This company along
with WEPCO will be responsible for the implementing of the proposed project.
The Western Desert Petroleum Company
3.08       The Western Desert Petroleum Company was formed in 1967 as a joint
venture company between EGPC and Phillips Petroleum, wilth both partners having
equal shares; as of 1972 Hispanoil has subscribed to 15% of the Phillips
Petroleum Company's share. Like other operating companies in the petroleum
sector, WEPCO is a non-profit making entity whose expenses are proportionately
shared by partners. Presently, WEPCO is producing oil from oil fields of
Alamin, Yidma and Umbaraka. The cumulative production from these fields is
about half million tons of oil. In addition it discovered and subsequently
developed the first phase of Abu Qir gas field, and in 1980 produced 18 bil-
lion cubic feet of gas and 400,000 barrels of condensates.  WEPCO is managed
by a Board of Directors consisting of six members: two designated by Phillips,



27 -
one by Hlispanoil, and three by EGPC. The Chairman of WEPCO is designated by
EGPC and the Managing Director by Phillips Petroleum. In as much as Abu Qir
gas field has and will be developed by EGPC under the -sole risk' clause of
the production-sharing agreement, WEPCO will function under the exclusive
direction of EGPC, with EGPC bearing all administrative and management expenses
relatable to this field. At its senior managerial level, WEPCO has competent
and experienced staff and as it developed the first phase of the project on
its own, it is in a position to satisfactorily oversee the development
of the second phase. A review of its management capabilities, however,
indicates that it would require expatriate assistance in certain specific
areas. Therefore EGPC has appointed a project management firm to take up day
to day implementation function under the direct supervision of WEPCO (see
para. 4.17).
Petrogas
3.09      While WEPCO will be responsible for implementing activities related
to the onshore and offshore gas production facilities and extractioa of LPG,
Petrogas (beneficiary under IDA Credit 1024-EGT) will be responsible for the
construction of the trunk pipeline to Alexandria. Petrogas was created in
1978 with the primary objective of promoting and implementing a natural gas
distribution network in Cairo. In addition it is responsible for distributing
and marketing LPG in Egypt.
3.10      The pipeline, proposed under the project, will provide gas to the
major industrial consumers in Alexandria, though it would be sized so as to
meet the load requirements of domestic consumers who would be converted to gas
at a subsequent stage. Petrogas, under its statutes, is run by a Board of
Directors consisting of a chairman and eight members. The chairman and four
members of the Board are appointed by the prime minister and the remaining
four are elected by the labor syndicate. Petrogas has drawn upon competent
and experienced personnel of EGPC and subsidiaries of EGPC to man its senior
levels. While the present managers have extensive experience in the oil
industry, they have limited experience in gas distribution. Project imple-
mentation as currently designed takes note of these limitations. Overall
design specifications and network analysis will be carried out by qualified
consultants, and the task of pipeline construction would be entrusted to a
contractor who has extensive experience in similar projects. This, supple-
mented by the training and experience Petrogas secures under the Cairo gas
distribution project, should permit it to oversee project implementation in a
satisfactory fashion. It was agreed during negotiations, however, that all
obligations relating to the implementation of the trunk pipeline and
distribution line components will be assumed directly by EGPC. This would
provide EGPC with flexibility in assigning work under these components among
its agencies. In the event of a decision to assign the work to an agency
other than Petrogas, the Bank would be in a position to ascertain the
competence of such agency in the course of its normal supervision.
Accounting System and Management Information
3.11      EGPC follows the  Unified Accounting System  which was established
by Presidential Decree in 1966. Its objective was to achieve uniformity in



- 28 -
the denomination of accounts, rules and terminology for all public sector
undertakings. EGPC was, however, vested with considerable autonomy in setting
standards which would apply specifically to the petroleum and gas sectors for
cost accounting and financial reporting.
3.12      For this purpose, a general review of accounting practices as well
as financial reporting system was initiated as part of the first Bank loan to
EGPC (1732-EGT). Consultants were appointed in September 1980, and the study
started in October, 1980. The terms of reference specifically covered: 1(i)
a comprehensive assessment of EGPC½s accounting and reporting system, including
the review of cost accounting and valuation principles, and the internal
control and audit; (ii) the design of a system for capital project accounting
and control; (iii) the design of a management information system; (iv) the
design and implementation of a planning and forecasting system; (v) the
review of the financial structure of EGPC; and (vi) the identification of the
training needs of EGPC's staff. The consultants, beside making recommenda-
tions, have undertaken the implementation of the agreed improvements, as well
as the training of accounting staff. The improvements should lead to the
production of meaningful information including consolidated statements by
FY82. During negotiations, EGPC agreed to extend the study financed under
loan 1732-EGT to the review of the computer needs and applications in order to
achieve an optimum utilization of the new computer facilities.
Audits
3.13      EGPC undertakes internal audit through its internal cortrol depart-
ment and its department for financial evaluation. The financial consultants
have proposed a new set up for internal control which is satisfactory and
final recommendations have been accepted by EGPC. Procedural manuals have
been written, and full implementation is expected by January, 1982. Besides
internal audit, EGPC accounts are subject to an annual external audit by the
Central Accounting Authority. This review of EGPC accounts is supplemented
by a review by the Ministry of Finance of the past expenditures as compared
with budgeted amounts. EGPC has agreed to provide the Bank with duly audited
financial statements. EGPC has agreed to provide a separate set of accounts
for the Abu Qir field operations, duly audited. It was agreed during negoti-
ations that both sets of audited statements should be provided to the Bank
within six months after the end of each fiscal year.
Insurance
3.14      EGPC affiliates carry comprehensive coverages on their assets against
major risks. EGPC takes its insurance from Egyptian insurance companies which
are in turn reinsured by foreign insurance companies. Abu Qir existing f-eld
assets are insured with Misr Insurance Company. Current insurance policies
cover risks to platform, process plant, living quarters, pipeline, as well as
redrilling expenses. Onshore facilities are also covered for all risks cf
physical loss or damage. Similar coverage will be taken for the onshore and
offshore facilities proposed under the project; which is adequate.

IV. THE PROJECT
Background
4.01      The Abu Qir offshore gas field was discovered by the Western Desert
Petroleum Co. (WEPCO). The field is located in the Mediterranean Sea in
about 60 ft of water approximately 17 km from the shore and 35 km from
Alexandria (see Map 15212). Since Phillips had no interest in gas production,
EGPC undertook in 1973 the development of the field under "sole risk" terms of
the production sharing agreement as the exclusive owner. WEPCO completed the
first phase development comprising nine wells drilled from a fixed platform
along with the necessary offshore and onshore production facilities in 1979.
Production commenced in February 1979, but the full production potential of
100 MMcf/d has not been reached because of market constraints. However, this
situation will soon reverse itself.  It is expected by early 1982 Abu Qir
production will no longer be able to satisfy the Alexandria market. Without
additional supplies, all incremental demand beyond the 100 MMcf/d presently
available from Abu Qir would have to be met through the use of liquid hydro-
carbons.  Development of the Abu Qir gas reserves represents the least cost
means for filling the growing demand-supply gap in the Alexandria area because
of the field's proximity to the market and the existing Phase I infrastructure
(para. 2.19).
4.02      The proposed project would supply an additional 100 MMcf/d of gas
to the Alexandria area market.' A new pipeline would transport gas to
Alexandria where it would be distributed to existing consumers 1/ and to
industrial plants for which investment commitments have already been made
and which are scheduled to be completed by the time gas becomes available.
These consumers would otherwise have to use liquid hydrocarbons which can
be exported (fuel oil) or those which must be imported (diesel). The
project would also produce about 58,000 tons of LPG per year which would
displace an equal quantity now imported. Condensate recovered from the
incremental gas production, approximately 77,000 tons per year, would be
processed in the local refinery, freeing an equivalent amount of crude oil
for export.
Gas Reserves, Production Potential and Field Development
4.03      The productive sands of the Abu Qir oas field are found in the
Abu Madhi and Sidi Salem formations dating from the basal Pliocene to the
middle Miocene epochs. They are distributed in four units: upper, middle
and lower Abu Madhi and Sidi Salem. The field is bounded by a major fault
on the south and by complex faulting on the west and southwest (see Map IBRD
15695). Additional seismic data is needed to determine closure to the south-
west and additional wells (not included in the project) will have to be
1/   Annex 2.03 shows market projections in the Abu Qir area.  Existing
industries which will convert to gas comprise paper, textile, chemical,
copper, tire, sanitary ware, cement and aluminum plants and the two local
refineries.

drilled in the northwestern and eastern parts of the structure to completely
delineate the areal extent of the field.   Consultants financed by the Bank
(Loan 1732-EGT, Gulf of Suez Project) have estimated potential recoverable
reserves from the four producing zones to be as follows:

4.04      The project proposes to drill nine wells directly southwest of the
existing producing area. Spacing and location of the wells, subject to
confirmation during drilling, have been agreed to between Bank staff, EGPC,,
WEPCO and the consultants (see Map IBRD 15695). Wells 3, 4 and 9 will be
development wells and wells 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 as appraisal/production
wells to ascertain t-he extent, thickness and productivity of the sands to
the west. They will be completed as producers in those formations showing
the best productivity. During negotiations agreement was reached with EGPC
and WEPCO that:
(i)  wells 1 1/ and 2 would be drilled first as their results
would allow a more precise positioning of the other
appraisal/production wells. Development wells 3 and 4
would be drilled while these results are analyzed;
(ii) well 1 would be drilled vertically and cored continuously
in the pay zones of Abu Madhi and Sidi Salem to calibrate
logs and study the geological and petrophysical character-
istics of the sands;
(iii) precise gas-water contacts would be determined for all
wells through appropriate testing and sampling;
(iv) consultants, if considered necessary, would be engaged
to check completion procedures for each well; and
(v)  finding from the drilling of each well would be forwarded
promptly to the Bank.
1/   Well 1 would be located directly under the platform which is
positioned at 310 24  00"N and 300 12- 00" E.  The others would
be drilled directionally to a distance of approximately 1.5 km.

4.05      Interpretation of old seismic data shows two prospective
structures in the general area of the Abu Qir field (see Map IBRD 15695).
The project includes a seismic survey (approximately 300 line-km) to map
these areas and also to detail the westernmost closure of the Abu Qir
field. Southward, the seismic lines will attempt to link, through Lake
Idku with previous onshore lines to detect any new structures in this area.
4.06      After completion of the project drilling program, WEPCO will
engage consultants to undertake a reservoir study based on the data acquired
from drilling the nine wells to determine the optimum plan for further
development of the field. The study will entail a new gas reserves estimate
and through simulation techniques determine the number and spacing of wells,
type of completion and production in each sand and well performance under
various development schemes.
4.07      The maximum production capacity of the existing Abu Qir wells is
estimated to average about 13 MMcf/d per well or approximately 120 MMcf/d for
the field as a whole. In view of the gas supply deficit forecast for
Alexandria beginning 1982, it is important to maximize production from the
field in the interim period before the project facilities are on stream. In
this context, the project includes a feasibility study to determine the
maximum gas volumes which can be withdrawn (in accordance with good reservoir
management) from the field and the "debottlenecking" measures necessary
to increase existing surface facility capacity to handle the higher well
flow rates. During negotiations EGPC and WEPCO agreed to undertake and
complete, through qualified consultants, such a study by December 31, 1982.
Project Design
4.08      The proposed project provides for augmenting Alexandria's gas
supplies as the least-cost means of meeting its energy requirements. Abu Qir,
because of its close proximity, existing infrastructure and proven production
potential is the most economical source of such additional supplies. However,
additional production will have to be developed from Abu Qir or elsewhere, to
avoid substantial shortfalls over the next five years. Abu Mahdi, in the
delta about 200 km west of Alexandria, is the only other gas field now known
to have a surplus production potential which could be diverted to Alexandria.
Its reserves, however, are dedicated to the Delta market and to make-up
shortages in Cairo. If, in lieu of Abu Qir, Abu Mahdi were fully developed
and its gas sent to Alexandria, it would not be able to supply the necessary
demand. Abu Qir production would still have to be developed to cover short-
ages not only in Alexandira but also Cairo which would require facilities
to transport the gas from Abu Qir to Cairo.
4.09      In October 1980, Technip (France), qualified consultants appointed by
WEPCO, carried out an optimization study of the offshore and onshore production
facilities required for the second phase development of Abu Qir. The study
included: (i) the type of drilling equipment to be used; (ii) the number and
size of platforms; (iii) separation and gas treatment processes; (iv) source
of power supply; (v) whether to transport the gas and condensate in a single
or separate pipelines; and (vi) onshore facilities including an LPG plant.
In evaluating these facilities importance was given to such considerations as
investment and operating costs, operating flexibility, safety and reliability.



- 32 -
4.10      After examining the various drilling rigs suitable for drilling the
Abu Qir wells the consultants recommended the use of a cantilever Jack-up.
This recommendation was based on the fact that such a rig was available when
required and the fact that it provided the most flexibility and reliability in
drilling, and the minimum interference with platform equipment and installation.
4.11      Platform size and design is directly related to the type of rig
employed in drilling. To accommodate drilling with a jack-up and provide
space for the production equipment a six-pile platform is required. For
safety reasons a smaller four-pile platform is provided for operator living
accommodations and utilities.
4.12      The offshore gas processing facilities are essentially a duplication
of the existing facilities and comprise desanding, gas-liquid separation
and dehydration. Design capacity for these facilities is 100-150 MMcf/d.
For reliability and ease of well control, the offshore treatment facilities
are based on individual separators and glycol contactors.
4.13      Power supplied from offshore and generated on the platform was
studied by the consultants. The platform option was found to be less
expensive and more reliable than the shore supply. A power cable will
connect the existing and project platforms to provide emergency power in
case of a power outage on one of the platforms.
4.14      Gas delivery to shore can be achieved by a single pipeline carrying
both gas and condensate (two-phase) or by separate gas and condensate lines
(single phase). The two-phase line results in the least cost, and since it
works satisfactorily in the existing installation, it is the recommended
alternative.  The 18" pipeline is designed to carry 250 MMcf/d of gas at an
inlet pressure of 1305 psig and 1128 psig onshore. This should provide
sufficient capacity to accommodate the peak additional production which can be
developed from the field in the future and allows gas to be transported from
the existing platform in the event of an interruption of flow through the
existing 14" line. A 14" line connects the two platforms for this purpose.
4.15      The onshore facilities are essentially an expansion of the exist-
ing condensate separation and stabilization units. The consultant has also
carried out an LPG recovery study which shows this to be an economically
attractive undertaking. Production of LPG by means of the turbo-expansion
process was shown to be the best alternative for optimum LPG and condensate
recovery. The LPG plant will be sized to handle 250 MMcf/d of gas which is
large enough to meet the maximum expected throughput, and at the same time
provides sufficient operating flexibility (turn down) for operating at low
demand rates.
4.16      The trunkline to Alexandria is still under study and on its
completion the findings of the study will be reviewed with the Bank. It
will be designed to meet peak demand loads in Alexandria including future
domestic consumers. Allowance will be made for future gas supplies from

North Abu Qir discovered by Elf Aquitaine. Preliminary engineering indicates
a 24" pipeline will meet these requirements.
Description of the Project
4.17      The proposed project comprises the second phase development of the
Abu Qir gas field. Nine additional wells will be drilled from a combined
drilling and production platform located approximately 3 km southwest of the
existing platform. After processing the gas on the platform it will be piped
via an 18" submarine line to the shore terminal where it will be stripped
of condensate and LPG. From the shore terminal, the gas will then be sent
to the Alexandria area over a 24" pipeline and distributed to major industrial
consumers in that area. Map IBRD 15212 shows the location of the proposed
project, and Map IBRD 15695 the platform and well locations.

Project Implementation
4.18      WEPCO will be responsible on behalf of EGPC for implementing the
Abu Qir onshore and offshore and LPG portions of the proposed project.
Subject to the qualification mentioned in para. 3.10, Petrogas will be
similarly responsible for the Alexandria pipeline and the distribution



- 35 -
network. WEPCO implemented the original Abu Qir project and operates the
existing facilities. It is capable of handling, with some outside assistance,
the second phase. Accordingly, backup assistance to WEPCO and day-to-day
implementation functions will be assigned to ENPPI, a joint engineering
enterprise between EGPC and Brown and Root (USA). Petrogas is constructing
the Cairo Gas Project (Credit 1024-EGT) and will appoint an engineering firm
to carry out its portion of the project in a similar manner. Technical
assistance in carrying out of studies would be by consultants whose qualifi-
cations, experience and conditions of employment would be satisfactory
to the Bank and EGPC.
4.19      The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4.01.  Be-
cause of the world wide shortage of drilling rigs, WEPCO has had to award a
drilling contract in April 1981 to Reading and Bates (USA) for a contract
period of two years. The rig is scheduled to be on site no later than mid-
October 1982, and drilling should take approximately 405 days (45 days per
well). The remaining contract period after completion of the Abu Qir wells
will be used for other EGPC operations. The various services required in
drilling, testing and completing gas wells will be supplied by well service
companies specializing in these operations.
4.20      WEPCO issued prequalification documents in March 1981 for the
main equipment supply and construction contracts. The contract for the
offshore platform was awarded to Petrojet in November, 1981. Contract for
other long lead equipment modules are likely to be awarded by February, 1982.
This is necessary to enable drilling to start when the drilling rig arrives on
site.   The remaining contracts are less urgent, and can be deferred until the
end of the first quarter 1982.
4.21      Based on the estimated drilling rate, which is consistent with
the previous Abu Qir drilling operation, the offshore work should be
completed by January 1984 and commissioning by April 1984. This allows
ample time to complete the onshore facilities including the LPG plant and
the trunkline to Alexandria.
Project Costs
4.22      Including contingencies the proposed project is estimated to
cost US$189 million of which US$156 million or 83% represents the foreign
exchange component. Interest during construction is estimated to add US$11
million to these costs. A physical contingency of 10% was applied to all
project costs, and the basic cost estimate, based on 1981 prices, was
escalated as follows:
Foreign costs - 8.5% (1982); 7.5% (1983 and 1984)
Local costs   - 14% (1982); 13% (1983) and 12% (1984)
4.23      Detailed engineering, project management, procurement and construc-
tion supervision costs are estimated at US$10 million and provide for 700
man-months of expatriate and 350 local engineering personnel from the joint
venture engineering firm and other expatriate firms as needed. The average



- 36 -
man-month cost for expatriates is estimated to be US$12,000 per man-month and
US$3,000 for local personnel. US$250,000 is included for vehicles and other
local operating expenses. Studies are estimated to cost US$2.0 million based
on 200 man-months expatriate consultants at US$10,000 per man-month; the
reservoir evaluation cost is estimated at US$700,000 at US$15,000 per man--month
for 50 man-months of expatriate services; and technical assistance in driLling
in other project services is expected to cost US$2.6 million for 170 man-months
of expatriate services at US$15,000 per man-month. The rate for drilling and
related project services reflects the current high demand for experts in
petroleum exploration and development. All expatriate rates include salaries,
benefits, fees, international travel and subsistence.
4.24      Duties and taxes on goods and materials are not included since
EGPC is exempt from such payments. The estimated project costs, excluding
the US$11 million estimated interest during construction, are summarized in the
following table.  Annex 4.02 gives a more detailed breakdown of these costs.

Project Financing Plan
4.25      EGPC will provide the estimated US$33 million equivalent local
expenditure costs, US$11 million of the estimated US$156 million equivalent
foreign exchange requirement and US$11 million interest during construction
from its own resources and budgetary allocations from the Ministry of Finance.
The remaining foreign exchange expenditures would be funded by the proposed
US$90 million equivalent Bank loan and the US$55 million equivalent from the
European Investment Bank (EIB) and/or export credits. In this regard, EGPC is
in an advanced stage of discussions with EIB for a loan (expressed in ECU's)
equivalent to approximately US$32 million and with Chase Manhattan Bank (UK)
for arranging a line of credit from various export credit agencies. The
proposed Bank loan represents 58% of the foreign exchange portion of the
project and 48% of the total estimated project. The proposed allocation
and source of funds for the project is shown in the following table.

4.26      The proposed US$90 million loan would be made to EGPC at the current
Bank lending rate plus an annual guarantee fee of 1% for a period of 20
years including 3 years of grace. The life of the gas field is estimated to
be of the order of 18-20 years. The loan would be guaranteed by the Government,
and EGPC would assume the foreign exchange risk.
Procurement, Disbursement and Advance Contracting
4.27      All procurement for works and goods financed by the Bank would be by
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Drilling services and materials needed for operational flexibility or which
might delay the well drilling operation if procured through ICB may be procured
through the Government's competitive bidding procedures which do not exclude
foreign bidders and are acceptable to the Bank. The aggregate of such procure-
ment should not exceed US$2.5 million and no single contract should exceed
US$500,000. Goods and materials costing less than US$500,000 equivalent may
also be procured through the above-mentioned competitive bidding procedures up
to an aggregate amount of US$10 million. Tendering for pipeline construction,
platforms, production modules and civil works will be limited to prequalified
contractors. All bid packages having a value of US$500,000 or above would be
subject to Bank review prior to contract award. The others would be reviewed
subsequently. Any goods and equipment which might be available from local
suppliers would be granted the usual 15% preference or customs duty if less.
Technical assistance consulting and training services would be engaged in
accordance with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants (August 1981).
4.28      Disbursement would be made against:  (i) 100% of the foreign exchange
expenditure for the LPG plant, 100% of the foreign exchange expenditures for
directly imported goods and equipment and 70% of local expenditures for goods
procured locally; (ii) 90% of installation expenditures for the submarine
pipelines; and (iii) 100% of the foreign exchange costs for consultant services,
studies and training. Annex 4.03 gives the estimated disbursement schedule.
In the absence of a regional profile for this sector, the disbursement profile
is based on: (i) a three-month lag between the time the expenditure has been
incurred (according to the project schedule) and the time funds are disbursed
against this expenditure; and (ii) the loan becoming effective in July 1982.
The loan would be fully disbursed by June 30, 1985, and the closing date would
be December 31, 1985.
4.29      As indicated (para. 4.19), WEPCO has already had to contract
(approximately US$16 million) for a rig to begin drilling operations in
October 1982. It was also necessary to award a contract for the offshore
platforms and long delivery production and utility modules on the platforms
in the fourth quarter 1981. This will necessitate advance contracting to the
maximum extent of about US$25 million for these items. It is proposed that
expenditures which may be incurred for downpayments for the above purpose be
retroactively financed from the Bank loan to the maximum amount of US$2.5
million.

4.30      The project carries operational and geological risks inherent to
the petroleum production and pipeline industry. Offshore operations pose
additional risks, but the industry has developed techniques and technology
over the years to minimize these, especially since it has had to cope with
the hostile environment in the North Sea. Because of the growing deficit in
gas supplies for the Alexandria area, there is minimal commercial risk.
4.31      The offshore project facilities are located in shallow water (about
60 ft), and weather conditions are relatively mild. In view of this and the
fact that WEPCO is operating similar facilities successfully, risks associated
with offshore operations are considered to be minimal. The facilities are
designed by qualified consultants with extensive experience, and only pre-
qualified contractors will be invited to bid for construction of the project
facilities. Construction standards and the structural integrity of the
offshore platforms and pipeline will be reviewed by an internationally
recognized authority (probably Lloyd's Register of Shipping, which reviewed
the existing installations). Onshore operational risks are minimal. The
risks of accident and fire are discussed separately (para. 4.34). In the
event of a blowout and fire during drilling it is possible that the drilling
platform and production equipment could be lost. This would delay production
by two years, but even with this production loss, the project would still
yield an economic rate of return of over 50%.
4.32      Reservoir consultants financed under Loan 1732-EGT have assessed
the field's recoverable reserves and production potential (para. 4.03).
Data from the nine wells already drilled and the seismic survey of the area
indicate that there is a high probability that the new wells will be capable
of producing at least 100 MMcf of gas. Nevertheless, it must be recognized
that subsurface geological formations can never be predicted with absolute
certainty, and that there is a possibility that not all the wells will be
producers. However, we believe it is reasonable to expect that at least six
of the nine wells will be producers, which would still give an attractive
(over 50%) economic rate of return on the project.
Training
4.33      WEPCO has been successfully operating and maintaining the offshore
and onshore Abu Qir gas production facilities since February 1979. Additional
personnel recruited for the corresponding project facilities can be trained
in-house in accordance with WEPCO's present recruitment and training pro-
cedures. The LPG production facilities, however, will introduce new equip-
ment, instrumentation, processes and quality control measures requiring
different operating and maintenance skills. An effective training program
will be essential to the successful operation of this facility. Provisions
for training are included in the proposed loan. WEPCO has agreed to submit
to the Bank, for its review by December 31, 1982, a satisfactory recruitment and



- 40 -
training program detailing job classification, duties and duration. Petrogas
has an ongoing training program provided under Credit 1024-EGT (Cairo Gas
Distribution Project) which should cover its needs for operating the onshore
pipeline and distribution system.
Ecology and Safety
4.34      The proposed project is not expected to have a significant impact
on the environment. Although negligible when compared to total marine
pollution (by tankers), offshore oil operations do pose the danger of
pollution from oil spills during the drilling and production phases. However,
in the case of gas fields, such as Abu Qir, there is little chance of appre-
ciable oil spillage. Water and condensate are separated from the gas on
the production platform, but the oily water effluent is treated to reduce
the oil content to 100 parts per million before disposal, which is satis-
factory. Both the offshore and onshore pipelines will be buried and original
surface features restored. Since the gas will go largely to consumers who
would otherwise burn fuel oil, the project in effect will reduce atmospheric
pollution in the Alexandria area.
4.35      In handling gas the chief safety concern is fire.  During drilling
operations, EGPC and WEPCO will monitor and enforce all safety equipment,
blowout prevention and well control regulations. In addition EGPC has
agreed to allocate funds immediately for recruiting specialized interna-
tional services in the event of a blowout and fire. Platform and production
facilities will be designed and constructed in accordance with appropriate
international safety standards. Adequate provisions will be made for fire
detection, fire safety and fire fighting systems and for abandoning the
platforms, if necessary. Additional safety to personnel is provided by
having their living quarters on a separate platform away from the production
unit. To ensure safe operation of the wells, EGPC and WEPCO have agreed
that all wells will be equipped with surface controlled subsurface safety
devices, using the best technology presently available, and with surface
safety valves.
4.36      The offshore and onshore pipelines offer no particular safety
problems other than what might result from poor operating and maintenance
practices. So far, EGPC-s affiliates have an excellent track record in
operating pipelines safely. Moreover, the pipelines will be designed and
constructed in accordance with internationally accepted standards and pro-
vided with the necessary protection against corrosion and overpressure
for safe operations.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
5.01      EGPC functions as a holding company and oversees all the operations
related to the petroleum industry. Full corporate analysis of EGPC's finances
is not feasible at this time due to lack of information about the operation of
its many subsidiaries and of consolidated accounts, nor is it necessary as
yet. Bank's projects are self-contained components of EGPC or of its different
financially sound subsidiaries. EGPC's foreign exchange revenues from exports
alone were LE 1.1 billion in FY 1979. They far exceed operating expenses,
debt service, as well as the entire capital expenditure program. Indeed they
contribute massively to Egypt's foreign exchange earnings and also to
Government fiscal revenues. EGPC is allowed to retain between 10% and 15% of
net profits as needed to help meet the company's investment requirements.
This situation will continue into the 90 s if the very active exploration
programs undertaken by EGPC and foreign oil companies - currently LE 500
million per year - continues and if domestic pricing is increased, contributing
to higher revenues as well as improved efficiency in the use of hydrocarbons.
5.02      As noted in para 2.34, EGPC could become a large borrower of foreign
capital markets on its own credit, thus help to free additional resources for
Egypt's economic development. The three earlier projects as well as the
proposed project helped prepare a number of public sector projects, primarily
gas development, focused on domestic consumption, and complementary to the
large export-oriented program of foreign oil companies. Over the next few
months, the Bank will help finalize feasibility studies for various proj-
ects and integrate them into a time phased and costed program of priority
investments which are eligible for commercial financing as well as Bank
support. In parallel, the completion in October 1981 of the financial
studies and their implementation in the coming year should allow a full
corporate analysis of EGPC's condition, prospects and projects to be initi-
ated within FY 1982. The financial analysis in this report is another
interim step in the general direction of a full corporate analysis. It
highlights the main features of EGPC's present financial situation, and the
finances of the Abu Qir gas field which, in view of the foregoing, is still
treated as a financial entity.
Past Financial Performance
5.03      EGPC's unconsolidated statements over 1977 - 1979 are summarized
below. Details are shown in Annex 5.01.

In FY 1979, domestic sales accounted for about one third of total EGPC revenues
although they were about 50% of the sales volume. This was mainly due to the
low level of domestic petroleum product prices (see para. 2.23, 2.24 and 2.25)
in relation to international prices. Distribution of net profit to Government
was 177 million LE in 1977, and increased to 192 million LE in 1978 and 729
million LE in 1979. Total resource mobilization from EGPC, including all
profit distribution, taxes, duties, etc., was 379 million LE in 1977, and
1,460 million LE in 1979, a consequence of the boost in the level of export
earnings in the last three years.
5.04      The unconsolidated balance sheets of EGPC are shown in Annex 5.02
for the period 1973 - 1979. A summary balance sheet for 1979 (the latest
audited balance sheet available) is given below.

Fixed assets                      56.8         10

Long term financing              179.0         32
Total equity and liabilities   559.7          100
These unconsolidated statements largely underestimate the net worth of EGPC.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at costs, and have never been revalued.
The debt equity ratio as shown on the unconsolidated statement (32/68) would
therefore be much lower on a consolidated basis, as the indebtedness of the
subsidiaries is currently very limited. This is indicative of the borrowing
capability of EGPC as a group. It emphasizes the financial ability of EGPC to
seek commercial borrowings to finance its future projects.
Current Income
5.05      Export Sales.  EGPC's export sales from 1978 to 1979, which were
mainly crude oil, and to a lesser extent, naphtha were as follows:
Export Sales

5.06      Domestic Sales.  As described in para. 3.07 to 3.10, EGPC's
activities in refineries, transmission and marketing are handled by specialized
subsidiaries. EGPC reimburses its refineries on a cost plus basis. EGPC
sells refinery products to its marketing companies at the consumer prices 'Less
a commission to cover marketing expenses and to provide an adequate rate of
return to the marketing entity. Although these practices do not encourage
efficiency improvements, they provide for the financial viability of all the
subsidiaries of EGPC in an environment of administered pricing structure.
5.07      EGPC's Net Back.  The "net back" to EGPC (i.e. the average price
of the sales of refined products to marketing companies less the budgeted
costs paid to refining and transportation companies, as well as Government
taxes, excise fees and dues) has progressed from 1977 to 1979 as follows:

Weighted average revenues from sales to distributors grew by 22% in 1979,
following the price increase of selected domestic petroleum products. The
revenues to EGPC, net of payments to Government were 16.4 LE per ton in 1977,
and 19.1 LE per ton in 1979; however, increases in the level of excise fees
resulted in a fall of the final "net back" to EGPC from 7.1 LE in 1977 to 5.1
LE per ton in 1979.
EGPC's Future Position
5.08      As indicated in para. 2.05, Egypt-s oil production is not expected
to decline until the late 1980's. Production is expected to marginally
increase from a level of 29.5 million tons in 1980 to a level of 34 million
tons in 1986. In comparison to the forecast production, domestic consumption
of liquid hydrocarbon products is expected to increase from 11.3 million
tons in 1980 to only 17 million tons in 1986 due to the increased use of

natural gas. Egypt will therefore remain in a large oil overall surplus
position until at least the last years of the 1980's. EGPC income statements
for the period 1981 - 1983 are summarized below.

same period. A summary of EGPC's group financing plan is shown below:

This financing plan reflects the increasing role that foreign borrowings
and suppliers credit are expected to play in the financing of EGPC's investments
for the next three years. The review of this investment plan indicates that
adequate provisions have not been made for developing Egypt's natural gas
resources and the related infrastructure (see para. 2.34). Projects such as
gas distribution and pipeline construction projects would be especially
suitable for external borrowings. In the context of this project, it was
agreed to repeat the condition of loan 1732-EGT, that the debt service coverage
of EGPC should at all times be not less than 1.5.

ABU QIR FIELD
5.10      Introduction.  Although separate accounts are maintained for
present operations in the Abu Qir field, there is no separate company to
administer and operate the field; operations are controlled by EGPC.
Production at Abu Qir is presently carried out by WEPCO on a reimbursable
basis. Revenues and expenses for the field form part of the overall revenue
and expenditures of EGPC. With the extension of production under the project,
EGPC has agreed to closely monitor the financial viability of the operations
of the Abu Qir field. In effect, Abu Qir would be operated as an autonomous
enterprise for accounting purposes within EGPC-s accounting system.
5.11      Accounting Arrangements.  The objective of the proposed arrangements
would be to protect the project finances and allow at all times an assessment
to be made of the financial performance and cash requirements of Abu Qir field
operations independently from the rest of EGPC operations. Therefore, during
negotiations, EGPC agreed to maintain separate accounting records for the
operation and development of Abu Qir field. EGPC has also agreed to prepare
separate financial statements for the Abu Qir field operations. It was agreed
that these statements would be audited by independent auditors satisfactory to
the Bank, and forwarded to the Bank within six months after the end of each
fiscal year (see para. 3.13).
Present Finances
5.12      Fixed assets held by EGPC in the Abu Qir field at the end of FY 1980
consisted of a nine well platform and related facilities and installations
amounting to LE 39.9 million ($58 million) in revalued terms. These assets
had been financed by a loan from the Kuwait Fund (15 years - 4%) of LE 10
million with the balance coming from EGPC's internal funds. Gas production
from existing facilities which was 25,422 MMcf in FY 1980, is expected to
reach 36,500 MMcf in 1981 and thereafter; condensate production was 47,850
tons in FY 1980, and is expected to be 68,700 tons per year starting in
FY 1981.
5.13      Production from the Abu Qir field contributes significantly to lthe
earnings of EGPC, as it permits EGPC to export fuel oil at LE 110/ton against
selling it in the domestic market for LE 7/ton. It is estimated that at
full production from existing and project facilities alone, the contribution
of gas replacing fuel oil to EGPC-s earnings would be LE 160 million per
annum. The current price of gas however does not ensure the recovery of ithe
direct costs of production of the field and the gas field, per se, incurred
net losses of LE 0.7 million and LE 1.8 million in 1979 and 1980 respectively.
Even at full production in 1981, the field would still be expected to achieve
a net loss of LE 0.3 million. The operating ratio was 150% in 1980, and would
remain at about 100% at full production from the existing facilities unde;r
current pricing policy. Return on revalued net assets was -3.5% in 1980 and



- 47 -
at the current pricing level would be .2% in 1981. Debt service coverage was
2.1 times in 1980. EGPC currently ensures the financial viability of the
operation of the field through direct contribution as needed.
Financial Viability of the Abu Qir Field
5.14      The production of gas from the project facilities is expected to
start in March 1984 at a rate of 100 MMcf/d; this would bring total gas
production from the field to 73,000 MMcf/d per year; the production of
condensate and LPG would then reach 146,000 tons and 58,000 tons per year
respectively. As indicated in para. 2.18 the Alexandria market is expected
to take all the expected gas production; condensate production would be sold
to refineries and LPG to Petrogas for domestic consumption. This substantial
increase in production would not result, however, in the recovery of the
cost of production of the gas of the field at present prices. The cost of
production of the gas is estimated at $.83/Mcf for the new wells, and
$.60/Mcf in average for the overall field. This cost compares with current
average selling price for Abu Qir gas of $.20/Mcf. 1/ The Government s
decision to increase gas prices to a level which would be above the marginal
cost of production of the field will significantly change the financial
performance of Abu Qir field; and the new pricing levels would permit the
field to achieve independent financial viability. The prime financial objec-
tives of the financial conditions agreed upon during negotiations are:
5.15      Firstly, the field should yield a normal return on the investment.
For this purpose, GOE and EGPC agreed to ensure that revenues from the sale of
gas of Abu Qir field are sufficient to earn a rate of return on revalued net
fixed assets of not less than 10% in the first three years of operation of
the Abu Qir project (FY 1985 - FY 1987) and 15% thereafter. Secondly, the
cash flow position of the field should be satisfactory at all times. In order
to achieve this objective, during negotiations GOE and EGPC agreed that (i)
EGPC would promptly provide any funds (in local and foreign currency) needed
for the project; (ii) revenues from the sales of Abu Qir gas should cover at
all times operating expenses, debt service, working capital requirements of
the Abu Qir field, and a reasonable contribution to the investments in the
project area; and (iii) EGPC would not incur any debt for the Abu Qir field
other than that for the proposed development, unless the projected internal
cash generation from the Abu Qir field for each future fiscal year shall be at
least 1.5 times the total debt service of the field for that year.
Financing Plan
5.16      The following table gives a summary of the capital investment
requirements of the Abu Qir field for the period FY 1981 - FY 1985 and the
sources from which they would be met, based on the revenues required to meet
the financial criteria indicated in para. 5.15. A detailed sources and
application of funds statement for the field is given in Annex 5.03.

5.17      The proposed Bank loan would be lent to EGPC at the current Bank
lending rate, with a repa,-nt period of 20 years, including three years of
grace; in addition, GOE would charge EGPC a guarantee fee of 1%. This would
bring the average cost of the loan to EGPC to about 14%, i.e., somewhat higher
than the projected domestic inflation rate in the country after FY 1982. EGPC
will bear the foreign exchange risk. During negotiations, EGPC indicated that
it intended to seek co-financing of up to $55 million for this project.
Projected Financial Position
5.18      The table below summarizes the performance of Abu Qir field under
the assumption that Abu Qir field earns a rate of return on revalued net
assets reaching 10% in the first three years of operation of the project (FY
1985 - FY 1987), and 15% thereafter. Detailed forecasts for the period FY
1981 through 1988 are shown as Annexes 5.04 and 5.05, with related assumptions
in Annex 5.06. It is expected that internal cash generation would contribute
LE 33 million towards the project, and that EGPC would further contribute LE 6
million.

Straight-line depreciation over the life of the field has been assumed. For
the purpose of computing rates of return on revalued assets, EGPC agreed
at negotiations to annually revalue its Abu Qir fixed assets, according to a
method acceptable to the Bank. In the financial projections a revaluation
rate of 9% a year has been assumed.
5.19      Forecasts indicate that the financial performance of the Abu Qir
field as measured in terms of earnings, debt service coverage, current ratio
and debt/equity ratio would be satisfactory after project completion. The DCF
rate of return has been calculated at 8% in real terms over the life of the
project. The financial criteria described above will make Abu Qir field an
independently viable unit within EGPC.
VI.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.01      The project, once fully developed, will allow the yearly incremental
production of 36,500 MMcf of gas (100 MMcf/d); 77,000 tons of condensate and
58,000 tons of LPG. Gas produced will replace mainly exportable fuel oil
(16,800 MMcf) and imported gas oil (19,700 MMcf) which would have been consumed
by industries and power stations. Condensate will upgrade crude oil and
result in the production of higher value refined products. LPG will substitute
imports and will serve requirements of the domestic market. The project would
result in major foreign exchange gains for Egypt. It is the least cost
solution for meeting energy needs in the Alexandria area, and makes optimal
use of the Abu Qir field production. Under this project gas prices will be
increased, as an interim step toward general energy pricing reform (see paras.
2.36 and 2.37), resulting in a substantial decrease of the gap between domestic
price and opportunity cost. For the purpose of economic analysis, the shadow
value of the currency has been taken to be 1 $ = .84 LE.



- 50 -
Least Cost Solution
6.02      The potential market for gas in Alexandria will increase from 50 MMcf/d
in CY 1980 to 265 MMcf/d in FY 84 and 380 MMcf/d in FY 86 (see para. 2.19).
This forecast potential consumption compared to existing gas supply would
leave, in the absence of new development, a growing gap reaching 280 MMcf/d in
FY 86, which would have to be served with liquid hydrocarbons. Due to the
location of the Abu Qir field and the established demand, it is clear that the
best domestic use of the gas is the Alexandria market. The project has
further been designed as the least cost solution of meeting this demand, as
demonstrated in para. 4.08.
6.03      The reserve estimates are not sufficient to justify any LNG project
at this time. However, even if reserves were proven in sufficient amount to
permit LNG production, such alternative would be less attractive. It is esti-
mated that the net back of LNG would be $2.50/Mcf. In comparison, the fuel
oil international prices are taken to be $4.0/Mcf FOB, and the marginal
extraction development cost of Abu Qir are about $.8/Mcf, leaving a "net back"
of $3.2/Mcf.
6.04      The other main alternative would be to keep the gas in the ground
for use in the future. This would be a more economic alternative if the real
increase per year in the net back from oil replaced were greater than the
social discount rate in Egypt. The current discount rate is, however, esti-
mated at 10%, while the increase in oil prices is estimated to be 3% per year
in real terms. The optimum use of Abu Qir gas is therefore the replacement of
fuel oil/gas oil and LPG in the Alexandria area.
Cost Stream
6.04      The cost stream includes all capital costs and operating costs
involved in the project development and the operation of the field. The
economic analysis also takes into account the capital costs to be incurred in
1993 to maintain the field production at the forecast level, through the
addition of compressors. Based on current estimates, the marginal cost of
extraction of the gas would be $0.83 per Mcf using a social discount rate of
10% per year.
Direct Benefits
6.05      For the purpose of deriving the benefit stream, gas has been assumed
to release fuel oil for export at $160 per ton, and to replace imported gas
oil at $300 per ton in 1982 terms. Condensate will be blended with crude oil
in order to derive higher value refined products. For the purpose of economic
projections, its value has been conservatively assumed to be 90% of gasoline
value, i.e. $310 per ton. LPG value was taken at $400/ton. These prices are
based on December 1981 international prices for petroleum products and are
assumed to increase by 3% in real terms each year until they reach a ceiling
equivalent to $60 per barrel of crude oil. They are assumed thereafter to
remain constant in real terms.



- 51 -
Rate of Return
6.06      The economic projections are shown as Annex 6.01.  The economic
rate of return for the base case is over 100% and the net discounted benefits
are estimated at LE 1.5 billion. Should the project be delayed by one year,
the net discounted benefits would still be LE 1.3 billion. Should the
production be only 70 MMcf/d, the net economic benefit would be LE 1 billion.
In the worst case, where the project is delayed by one year, incurs 10% cost
overruns and only achieves a production of 70 MMcf/d, the rate of return would
still be very high (62%) and the economic benefits would reach LE .9 billion
over the life of the project.
Gas Pricing
6.07      The economic value of Abu Qir's natural gas is the border price of
fuel oil displaced for export. This would indicate a price of LE 3.3/Mcf
($4.0/Mcf) in December 1981 terms, as compared with the current domestic price
for the Abu Qir field gas of LE 0.17/Mcf ($0.20/Mcf).
6.08      The objective of gas pricing policy in Egypt must be considered as
part of an overall energy pricing policy. Toward this end, a petroleum
products pricing and gas utilization study was undertaken as part of the Gulf
of Suez project, financed under Loan 1732 EGT. This study, completed in
September 1981, provides valuable guidance on the impact of various price
scenarios on the different sectors of the economy (para 2.35).
6.09      In the meantime, under this project GOE and EGPC have agreed to set
the price of Abu Qir gas at a level sufficient to recover at least the marginal
cost of extraction of the gas, and an allowance for its depletion. As noted
above, the marginal extraction cost is estimated at $0.83/Mcf. The depletion
allowance has been taken to be the present value of future imports required
when Egypt's reserves are exhausted by depleting the field at this time. The
computation of the depletion allowance is based on an estimated life of
Egypt-s reserves of 35 years, a real increase of 3% per year of the inter-
national price of fuel oil, until international prices of crude oil reach an
equivalent of $60/barrel, and on a social discount rate of 10%. Based on
these assumptions, the minimum level of gas prices from Abu Qir would be
$1.1/Mcf in December 1981 terms.
Other Benefits
6.10      In addition to the direct benefits described above, this project
will result in a reduced level of environmental pollution, with the replace-
ment of fuel oil with natural gas. It will also be an important step toward
encouraging more efficient energy usage through more appropriate energy
prices.

7.02      During negotiations assurances were obtained that WEPCO would carry
out the drilling activities in accordance with a program satisfactory to the
Bank. Agreement was also reached that WEPCO would:
(a) undertake through consultants, a reservoir study by December 31,
1984 for evolving the optimum development plan for the field,
and review the findings with the Bank (para. 4.06);
(b) undertake and complete by December 31, 1982 a study to increase
production from existing Abu Qir installations and review the
findings with the Bank (para. 4.07);
(c) submit to the Bank for its review a satisfactory training and
recruitment program by December 31, 1982 (para. 4.33).
7.03      During negotiations assurances were obtained that EGPC would (i)
undertake through qualified consultants, a feasibility study for domestic gas
distribution network for Alexandria, and review the findings with the Bank;
and (ii) review the findings of the Alexandria trunk pipeline study with the
Bank (para. 4.16).
7.04      During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government
and EGPC to (a) as of July 1, 1984, set prices for Abu Qir field gas in such a
way as (i) to reach an average level representing at least the marginal cost
of gas production and an allowance for depletion of gas resources; (ii) to
achieve a minimum of 10% rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in FY
1985 - FY 1987 and 15% thereafter (paras. 5.15 and 6.09); and (iii) revenues
from the sales of Abu Qir gas should cover at all times operating expenses,
debt service, working capital requirements of the Abu Qir field, and a
reasonable contribution to the investments in the project area; (b) review
with the Bank their plans to increase the average national price of gas and
fuel oil to the level agreed to for Abu Qir gas (para 2.36).
7.05      With satisfactory resolution of the items outlined above, the
project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank Loan of US$90 million for
a period of 20 years, including three years of grace at the current Bank
lending rate plus an annual guarantee fee of 1%.

Retained earnings of the group will be insufficient, by far, to cover
the estimated public funding of LE 1.3 billion over the next three years. The
balance would have to be contributed through loans and appropriation of Govern-

sector will permit the release of Government resources for users in other
sectors.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
ABU QIR GAS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial and Economic Statements
1.        Inflation on local cost has been estimated at 16% in 1981, 14% in
1982, 13% in 1983 and 12% in 1984 and thereafter. Inflation on foreign costs
has been estimated at 9% in 1981, 8.5% in 1982, 7.5% in 1983 to 1985, and
6% thereafter.
2.        Sales of gas are based on a selling price increasing progressively
to meet a 10% rate of return in FY1985 through 1987, and 15% thereafter.
Sales of condensate are taken at LE 7.4/ton in 1981 increasing with local
inflation thereafter, based on the EGPC average net back for one ton of crude
oil. Sales of LPG are supposed to be realized at LE 24/ton in 1981 increasing
in line with inflation each year.
3.        Assets are assumed to be depreciated on a straightline basis over
the life of the field (18 years). Royalties are taken at 15% of the sales
and income taxes are 50% of net income. For income tax purposes, depreciation
expense is based on historical cost.
Balance Sheet and Flow of Funls
4.        Gross capital assets and accumulated depreciation are revalued at
