MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A BASIC AND PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to Nepal for SDR 21.8 million, the equivalent
of US$30.6 million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help
finance a project for Basic and Primary Education. The US$136.5 million
project will be cofinanced by the Royal Government of Denmark with a grant
equivalent to about US$10.0 million; the Government of Japan with a grant
equivalent to about US$15.0 million; the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) with a grant equivalent to about US$7.0 million; and the Un.ted Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) with a grant equivalent to about US$10.8 million.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided financing equivalent to US$20.2
million. Each will administer its portion of the project and follow its own
guidelines for procurement and employment of consultants.
2.        Background.  The low level of literacy (352) hampers the economic
and social development of the Kingdom of Nepal. The literacy rate for women
is only 18S. Literacy rates are not likely to improve quickly unless steps
are taken to reduce the high drop-out rates which erode primary school
enrollment. In addition, non-formal basic education programs which currently
enroll only 100,000 adults and children per year will need to be greatly
expanded. A pervasive problem which has hampered both the growth and the
quality of basic and primary education has been the chronic underfunding of
the sector. Nepal spends only on average about 2.0-2.22 of GDP and 10.52 of
total Government expenditures in education. Low income countries spend an
average of 3.0? of GDP and about 12.32 of their Government's total budget in
education.
3.        The high drop-out rates in the primary schools are in large part
due to the poor quality of the system. The curriculum is overly complex and
inappropriate to the developmental needs of the children. Although textbooks
are free for girls (and for boys through Grade III), they are outdated, poorly
written and with inadequate durability. Teachers are for the most part
untrained, they are inappropriately supervised, and morale is low. Management
problems are pervasive, with the system suffering from lack of planning, poor
data, and little monitoring. School buildings are poorly constructed and not
maintained.
4.        The Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) is welt aware of these
problems and has developed a master plan for the subsector which emphasizes
the need for investment in quality improvement and increased access. The
master plan has provided a valuable analysis of the major issues and realistic
costs of addressing them. The plan is serving not only MOEC but an ongoing
review of the sector by an Education Commission for the new Government.   With
the support of IDA, UNDP and UNICEF, MOEC has conducted pilot projects
designed to test methods to Improve the curriculum, teaching materials,
teacher training and supervision. As a result, education quality has
increased significantly in the pilot schools. Utilizing grant funds (US$1.6
million) from the Japan Policy and Human Resources Development Fund, MOEC has
begun a two-year project of training and technical assistance to prepare
ministry personnel to adapt these pilot projects to a country-wide program of



-2-
quality improvement. The proposed project is part of this overall national
program.
5.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to address
the quality and access issues listed above in a systematic manner, utilizing
increased external and HMG resources to fund the subsectoral program. The
project's main objectives are: (a) to improve the quality of primary
education, (b) to increase equitable access to primary schooling, and (c) to
strengthen the management of the formal and non-formal primary education
delivery system.
6.        Project Description.  The proposed project is organized into three
components which wouldt (a) increase the quality of primary education
(US$61.4 million) by simplifying and making more relevant the curriculum of
the primary schools; providing improved teacher instructional materials,
textbooks and supplementary materials; and institutionalizing a teacher
supervision, support, and training system; (b) improve access to educational
resources (US$61.1 mlllion) by strengthening the non-formal primary education
and literacy programs. Girls, the very poor and those in remote areas would
have increased opportunity to receive a basic education, renovate and
construct additional classroom facilities for primary schools; and (c) improve
the institutional development of the subsector (US$14.0 million) by
strengthening MOEC's capacity to plan, manage and monitor its formal and non-
formal primary education programs; assisting in the development of its
capacity to coordinate and manage donor-aided projects; and improving the
design of efficient classroom facilities. Various donors would provide the
financing required to complete the program during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (FY92-97). IDA's financing (US$30.6 million) would be predominantly
for resources to imprwve quality and efficiency by strengthening in-service
teacher training and the improvement of classroom facilities. Financing for
studies leading to future projects will also be provided.
7.        Pro3ect Implementation.  The existing patchwork of donor-financed
Project Implementation Units would, during the life of the project, be
replaced by a Division of Program Management in MOEC. While the division
would have no direct implementation responsibility, it would assist the
Secretary of Education coordinate development activities. Planning,
monitoring and evaluation would be provided by a strengthened Planning
Division of the Ministry. The educational development activities of the
project would be implemented by the operational units of MOEC such as the
existing Curriculum, Textbook, Supervision, and Development Center (CTSDC).
It would be expanded and reorganized into the National Center for Educational
Development to coordinate and implement all primary school teacher training,
curriculum and instructional materials development. Non-formal primary
education and adult literacy programs would be implemented by the Department
of Adult Education (upgraded from its existing status as a section in the
Ministry). The school construction activities of the project would be
implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning through a School
Rehabilitation and Construction Unit. Communities would be mobilized to carry
out construction works through agreements between the Government and the
school management committees.
8.        Project Sustainability.  The emphasis of this project will be upon
building the foundation of an efficient delivery system for higher quality



primary education. This project will finance the foundation of a nationwide
quality enhancement program. The completion of such a program is likely to
take some 15 years of consistent investment in improved curricula and teaching
materials, and in greatly strengthened training and supervision of teachers.
Therefore the potential gains will not be fully realized without a series of
follow-on projects. However, both HMG and the donors have expressed their
commitment to a series of projects in the subsector. The costs will be
substantial and they will require an increase in the allocation of resources
to the primary subsector coupled with cost-saving measures. Beyond the life
of the project, when project inputs are institutionalized throughout the
Kingdom, efficiency gains would be considerable. Reduction in drop-out and
repeater rates and more efficient teacher deployment could reduce the cost of
producing a literate completer of the primary schools by 302. Cost savings in
textbooks could be as much as 40? through wastage reduction and reuse of
books.
9.        Lessons from Previous I2A. Involvement.  The lessons learned in the
subsector have been substantial. Because of the recent pilot programs in
primary education in Nepal and neighboring countries, it is now reasonable to
expect that the quality of primary education can be improved by providing such
inputs as increased teacher training and supervision, especially when combined
with clusters of primary schools and resource centers. When more frequent
teacher training and supervision are combined with a regular supply of high
quality teachingilearning materials, noticeable improvements result in student
achievement, reduced student repetition and drop-out, as well as increased
professional satisfaction among teachers. However, as important as these
inputs are to increased quality, they are but limited results unless the
management system is capable of delivering these inputs effectively. To
improve sectoral management in Nepal experience indicates that a number of
changes should take place. First, the leadership of the educational,
financial and planning establisbment and the donor community must agree on
priorities, goals and programs. Second, a more efficient use of scarce
resources needs to be obtained through the coordination of donor-supported
activities in the subsector to integrate the foreign-aided activities. Third,
in addition to the need for a well staffed, experienced and organized
management system, the success of a project has been directly associated with
the qualities of the senior manager of the program, indicating that more time
and attention needs to be paid to the recruitment and training of top staff.
Finally, in programs to improve the physical quality of schools in Nepal, it
has been learned that primary school constr.uction and classroom rehabilitation
can be effectively delivered by utilizing the Ministry of Housing and Physical
Planning's nationwide technical and supervisory experience and encouraging
community support and participation in the program.
10.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA has played a significant role
in assisting HMG develop the sector. Six education projects and related
sector work have given IDA a strong voice in the dialogue of donors and HMG in
the establishment of sectoral objectives. As the proposed project
demonstrates, IDA financing has not only been used to assist HMG reach its
objectives, but also to complement and maximize grant financing from other
donors.



11.       Aareed Actions.  JMIN has agreed that it would:  (a) increase the
number of female primary school teachers in accordance with a plan
satisfactory to the Association; (b) by December 31, 1993 complete
administrative arrangements with staff, resources and powers satisfactory to
the Association, for the efficient management of foreign-aided education
programs; (c) carry out the Project, in accordance with a management plan
satisfactory to the Association; (d) cause construction and renovation of
buildings under the Project, to be carried in accordance with design and
engineering standards satisfactory to the Association; (e) carry out the
Project, in accordance with successive annual financing plans satisfactory to
the Association. Such plans shall include estimates of the funds, from the
Borrower's own as well as other sources, required to carry out the Project for
the following fiscal year; (f) by December 31, 1992 furnish to the Association
for approval, model contract agreements with School Management Committees for
the construction and renovation of classrooms and for the construction of
resource centers; and (g) by December 31, 1994 conduct a comprehensive mid-
term review with the Association with regard to actions taken pursuant to the
carrying out of the Project. The following are conditions of credit
effectiveness of the Credit: (a) that the Borrower has furnished to the
Association a program for the appointment of female teachers in fiscal year
1993; (b) that the Borrower has established with staff, resources and powers
satisfactory to the Associations (i) a unit responsible for implementation of
the Project; (ii) a unit responsible for planning of physical facilities for
,primary schools and resource centers; and (iii) a unit responsible for
construction and rehabilitation under the Project; and (c) that the
Association has received assurances from the Borrower that adequate funds are
available to carry out the Project in fiscal year 1993.
12.       Project Benefits and Risks.  The major benefit of the project will
be the creation of a more efficient delivery system to provide higher quality
instruction in basic education at the primary level. However, because of the
time it takes to institutionalize significant change in the education sector,
most of the direct and visible benefits will occur after completion of the
project. The cost of educating a primary school graduate will begin to be
reduced because of lower drop-out and higher retention rates. The curriculum
will be simplified, and textbooks revised. Teaching skills and teacher morale
will be improved. Girls, the very poor and those in remote areas will have
increased opportunity to receive a basic education. The proportion of female
primary schcol teachers will rise from 12.52 of the work force to
approximately 19Z by the year 2000. A second, and more immediate, benefit of
the project will be increased effectiveness in the utilization of domestic and
foreign resources. The process of planning the project for the subsector has
already resulted in the integration of inputs financed by six foreign donors.
The project will integrate the grade-by-grade improvements in curriculum and
textbooks with the teacher training program. The major risks to the project
would be inadequate management and delays in counterpart funding. MOEC is
mitigating the first risk by strengthening its management (the Division of
Program Management) and administrative (the National Center for Educational
Development) units. While the delays in the release of funds are, for the
most part, the result of HMG financial control mechanisms outside MOEC's
management, the risk will be somewhat mitigated by the strengthened program
management enabling MOEC to anticipate funding delays and possibly head them
off.
