MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THEENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE D)RECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
-TO THE PEOPE'S R3PUIUC OF CINA FOR A
BASIC EDUCA TION IN POOR AND MNORITY AREAS PROJECT
1.-         I submit for your apprval the followiag memoradum and recommendation
on a propd development creit to the People's Republic of China for SDR 69.2 mmion,
the equivalent of $100 million, on standard IDA trm  with a maturity of 35 years, to help
finance the Basic Education in Poor and Mnority Areas Project. The Governmt of
China would onlend approximately $98 million equivalent to the project provinces for 20
years, including a 5-year gre period, at a fixed annual interest rate of 1.2 percent. The
provinces would bear the foreign exchange risk. Approximately $2 million would be used
for a central component administered by the State Education Commission (SEdC).
2.          Background. Compared with ote developing countries, China's  cess
in providing comprehensive basic education to its populaton has been remarkable.
Enrollment rates in the first nine years of schooling are higher than most other lower
income countries, with more than 95 percent of the 6-11 age cohort enrolled in primary
school and over 60 percent of the 12-15 age cohort in lower secondary school.
3.          These impressive summary statistics, however, conceal the disparity in
education attainment among China's 1.185 billion inhabitants. While the goal of nine-year
compulsory education is already achieved in most large cities and coastal areas, many poor
and remote areas have not even reached universal primary education. The education
system m these areas suffers from insufficient, dilapidated or dangerous classrooms and
schools; high numbers of unqualified teachers; poor teaching materials; high dropout and
repetition rates; unsatisfactory management; and difficult access.
4.          Many of the poor and remote areas in China are inhabited by minority
nationalites 1/ with economic and education levels lower than the national average. The
average rural annual income per capita in state-supported poor minority counties is below
Y 320 compared to the national average rural income of Y 784.21 According to a
sample survey of 25 minority counties carried out by SEdC, fte gross enrolment rate of
school age minority children is about twenty percentage points lower than the national
mean, with the female enrollment rate being much lower. In addifion to the chaacteristics
of education in poor areas, education of minority nationalities suffers from shortage in
1/    China has 55 minority nationalites toaling 91.2 milln people and constitng 8 percent of the
populatia  Areas inhabitd by these minoities occupy 64 percent of the entie couy. Uwere are
80 spoken I _ asnd over 30 wwntiog systems used by th minort natonalities
Both are Stato Staddical Bureaw (SSB) figures for 1992, expressed in 1992 pries.

teachiag mates and adequatey trained teachers. -3ilingual educatton,/ tgrded as
instrumental to promoting minority nationalities to advance to upper and postseondary
education, also suffers from various shortcomings: -a shortoge of qualified teachers;
unsatisfactory instctional materials; and insufficient attention and reseah in the
pedagogical, linguistic, psychoogical and curriculum aspects of bilingual education.
5.          A dispadrty also exists between the education of girls and boys. Although
thie Chinese government has made significant progress in equalzing access to education fr
boys and girls, high female dropout rates at the primary level and low female enollment
at the secondary level continue to be difficult problems. Factors that contribute to these
problems are related to (a) high direct and indirect costs of schooling; (b) a nonsupportive
leaning environment; (c) limited access; and (d) low expectations for continuing education
and employment. Somne of these problems cal be dealt with at the macro level, e.g.,
measures to address fee structures, expand access to higher levels of educaton, or modify
labor ma.-ket structes. Others can be tackled within the specific sociocultural setting in
which they arise as is the intent of the proposed project's innevation program. For
example, expanding boarding facilities may be acceptable to some groups but not to others.
Still other problems will have to be dealt with by changing the social environment within
which education is offered, for instance through informaton campaigns and increased
community involvement. This project will specifically advance female education by
(a) maintaining a dialogue with educational officials at the Government, proveice and
county levels on important macro issues (through the innovation progam-supported
studis, project supesion, and national semis); (b) imprving the lening
environment (through gender sensitive textbook development, teacher/administrative
taining, a specidal program of supporting female principals, and experimnts with single-
sex schools); (c) expanding access, espeay in the poorer and more remote rural areas
(through such programs as distribution of free textbooks to girls); and (d) fostering
innovation and experimentation to promote female education within a local context.
6.          Lesons Larned Under Prevlous Bank Group Projects. China has two
ongoing IDA-supported projects assisting poor provinces in their efforts to universalize
basic education, Gansu Provincial Development Project-Education Component (Loan
2812/Credit 1793-CHA) and the Educational Development in Poor Provinces (EDPP)
Project (Credit 2339-CHA). Implementation of these projects is pwceeding smoothly and
experience gained with them has been used in the design of the proposed project. Leons
learned have been that (a) national cordination of technical assistance, aining, coLection
of educational and project indicators, and disseminaion of lessons leamed are necessary
to achieve efficiencies of scale, countrywide coherence in the development and expression
of education policy and the development of national standards; 0) projects are better
designed and implemented when they concenae on fewer provinces; and (c) local
capacity building is necessay t phn, monitor and direct project activities. Experience
derived from earlier project also improved the poverty and minority targedng capacity of
SEdC in this project.
3/    Bilnga educaion is urently employed by 24 minority nationalities.

7.          Ratonle for IDA liwolveImet.   The prwosed leing operaton is
conistent with the Country Asistance Strategy discussed by the Board on August 3,1993
which calls for priority in-the  cial secrs to be given to the problems of the poore
areas, including basic educatio of girls. Under the project, the Association would be
deepening its support for China's efforts in improving basic educaion in poor and remote
area m China, inchlng those inhated by minonity nationsaties. The poject would also
be in line with IDA's report Cli. S=vegiesfbr Reducing Poveny In &e 1990 (Report
No. 10409-CA, 1992) which identfiinvestment i human captal, in paricular targeted
intevtion to the poor and vulnerable, as a key cumponent of the poverty alleviation
efforts  g   to healthier and smller families, higher adoption rates of new agricultural
technology, and increased access to altenative off-farm employment. The project also
incorportes the Association's concern about improving the status of women in the
development process by supporting targeted opeaions resr-rch activities and possible
consequent interventions to incras girls' enrollments, esialy ' minority areas.
8.         Prject Desig and Preparation. ihe proect uas bee designed to fiuter
develop the Borrower's capacty to prep= and implement projects. Building on the xectr
work which informed the design of the EDPP project as well as the current proposed
project, SEdC, with IDA's assistance, has prepared six subprojects, one for each province.
Five of the six subprojects have been fully rmviewed. The sixth subproject, Ningxia, has
been preared by the provincial authorities with assistance from SEdC and the Assoation.
IDA has done a prelminary review of the Nmgxia subproject; SEdC will carry out a full
review acording to agreed cntena. The SEdC report will be reviewed by the Association.
Tbis approach will be expanded and refined for the prepartion of psible future education
projects.
9.          Project Objectives. The project would (a) support the aainent of
universal primary education and expsion of covrage of lower secondary education in
poor and minority areas, and @) build stronger institutions responsible for education
delivery. The project would contribute to the Government's poverty reductio efforts by
focussing on education, and thus the income earning potential, of about 5 milion children
in some of the poorer counties in China. The project will have a direct impact on
approximately 40,000 schools, and will provide varyn  lengths of training for
approximately 135,000 teachers and education managers.
10.        Dsrption. The project would comprise thre  components. Under the
bisiuaiona cponent the project would finance renovation, abilitation, and some new
construction of primary and lower middle schools; furniture, instruc    equipment and
texts and other books; staff upgrding; and a pilot activity in rationalizing and
strengthenng a small number of normal schools that train elementary school teachers.
Technical assistace in this component relates directly to training claom teachers,
school principals and local education admini   to provide better instruction in and
leadrhip of educational institutions at the provincial, county and village levels.
11.        The mamageent imVrovment component will develop maagement
capabilities for the education system at the cental, provincial and institutional levels



-4-
through staff tain, e provision of equipment aid euprt evices. It wil indude three
suboomponents: (a) the training of local education mangemneit au ies; (b) the tining
of local project imlementaion authorifies; and (c) the development of an educaon
information management system. The qualy enhawcem   component would finance
inovatons and other improvements by supporting a prognrm of self-generated acdon-
odentod rarh activits and th deopment- of minority and biling       book and
textok preparation, production, publication and- distribution, as well as constuctiton of
a minority educaton tWaining center, and eblishment of an Innovation Assement Group
and a p.nel of experts for the project. The innovation progam will provide resources to
facilitate research and eimion  I a number of areas suh as: (a) improving
education deliveq to poor and minority communities; and (b) working with individual
schools and school prncipals, as well as county and provincial education bureaus, to
oveome problems of girls' educaton, esecilly low initia; enrollment, high repetition
rate, and low transition rates to lower secondary schools. This componet will also
support national capacity building and the coordinaton of cean technical asistance
activities.
12.        The project is estimated to cost about $177 million. The povincial and
county governments are exected to provide $77 million and IDA about $100 million
(56 percent of total project cost). A breakdown of project cost and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of p ent and disbursment, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A fimetable of key pojec pcessig
events and the sts of Bank Group opeations id the country are preseted in Schedules
C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13026-
CHA, dated August 8, 1994, is being distributed sepaately.
13.        Jpladon.   SEdC will implement national level tning, foreign
study tours - overseas study, auditing and reporting, and the innovation program.
SEdC's Finance Department will be responsible for -the coordination of the project's
innovation program while other national level activities will be coordinated by the Foreign
Invesnt and Loan Office (FILO) aud o     apprpriate SBdC techical dqartmts,
using technical and administrativ procedures that are  fil  to the Assodaion and have

University Development Proect (Loan 2021-CHA/redit 1167-CHA) and has exensive
epeience in the technical aspects of project execution. The aspects of implementation
devolved to p   cial educational bureaus will include monitoring implementation
progress, povincial-level staff trning, p ent of goods and works, and development
of the EMIS at that level, with coeation of FILO and the Educational Management
Information Center of SEdC.
14. -      The provincial components have been stucrd  as a sector investment
opeaon, with provinces meetng agreed eligibility criteria Qarge poor and/or minority
populations, high  ucbnal needs) and wishing to paracipate in the prqect, being
reqired to prr acceptabe  Education Pams for inclusion in tfe project and enter
into acceptable Educaion Prgam Implementation Ar        with the Govemment.
So far, Education Pgams  for five  ovin     (Xinjiang, Inner bongolia, Guang,



. .~~~~~~~5
Jiangx and Sichuan) have been appoved and one for a sixth pwvince (Ningtia) is under
preparadon. At the provincial level, project activities would be overseen by provinci
FLOs, which are headed by the Vice Commissioners of the respective Prvncial
Fducation          s, and staffed with officials fa    witi educaton panning and
management, financial management and accounting, civil works and equipmient. A similar
sucture has been rpeatd at the couuty level. the proncal   Os  win ovsee the
activities of the county PLOs and arnge for necessary q ainng. This model has proven
successful under the EDPP project.
15.  Sutalnablity.The project will partially finace school-base activities att
the villge, township, county and provincial levels, which .support the key naional
educadon policy of achieving univesal nine-year education by the year 2000. The
modeate level of IDA financing for the project (approximately 56 percent) and the annual
provincial level of counterpart fimding as a raio of the 1992 provincial educational budgets
(i.e., a modest 10.6 percent on average) increase both the chances for susainability and
affordability of the proect activites. Provincial education budgets are set for 1995 and
1996 and are generally expected to go up af  that period, which will decrease the
percentage of counterpar fumding (which has been budgeted at fixed annual levels duing
the project) as a part of the provincial budgets. Additionally, the source of provincia
counewpart fimding is balanced and sustainable-on average p ately 27 percent from
the county, 66 percent from the province alf of which comes from an education surtax)
and 7 peet from the national level. Likwise, the poverty reduction focus of the project
is centmal to the Government's recently announced seven-year plan tf elminate abject
poverty by the year 2000, a plan that specifically aims at upgrading education and litr
in backward and poor areas. Built into the project are mtenance costr for schools,
classooms and equmepnt procured under the project, equipment purement, technical
ssistance and trining to develop an EMIS system. One component of the project, the
innovations program, specifically supports policy-focused research and expeiiments in
areas of increased efficiency of school adminis . The tning of   ximay
135,000 teachers and school manage  builds and strengthens existing and new human
resource capacity which will remain in place long after the end of the project.
16.        Agreed Actions. Agreement was reached with the Government on (a) credit
relending trms to the provinces; (b) guidelines for the appraisal of provmcial Education
Prgms; (c) by December 1, annual submission to IDA of the proposed Innovatis
Prgam for the coming year; (d) arangements for project oversight at the prvincial,
prefectural and county levels; (e) indicators and procedures for project monitorn and
evaluafion, including amnual submision to the Association by April 1 of the results of the
Government's review of project iplementation and a mid-term review report by June 30,
1997; and (f) project auditing reqements.
17.        The provinces would be required to (a) carry out annual Education Progam
action plans, which would be previously submitted to and found satisfactory by IDA; (b)
for nonprqect supporedc      carry out satsf    action plans desged to ensure
that educational achievements in-these counties do not deteiorate durng proect
implementtion, monitortheprogress of suchplansbasedon agreed iicat, and submit



-6-
mid-term and fna reports an such monitoring to the Government and ll)A; c) -prepare
annual Innovation Prgramresech actvities for government and IDA approval; and
(d) ensur adequate projec monitrng at the couty level.
18.        As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Government will (a) esablish a
Miority Education Training Center under SEdC's a t      with terms of refernce
and saffing satsfatory to IDA; (b) provide IDA with completed Education Progim
Iuplementation Agreements, acceptable to IDA, between the Government and at least five
provinces; and (c) establish an Innovation Assessment Group with terms oC reference and
staffing acceptable to IDA.
19.        Environmental A     ossment. No negative environmental impact from the
project is foreseen. No resettlement will be involved in this project.
20.         Benefts. The project is expected to benefit about 5 million of the poorest
school children in some of China's poorer provinces. It will significantly expa  basic
education among the poor, espeay in the remote areas ihabited by minority
nationalities. Provision of education to remote and rural areas not only helps to create
opportunitiesfor rural development but also helps to provide the skills necessary for target
groups to participate in the economic growth in township and urban centers. It would also
improve school attendance of female students. Minority nationalities students will be better
prepard to partcipate m Chinese schools in the upper and postsecondary levels.
Furthermore, the project includes speific interventions designed to improve planning and
management capacity of the Central, provincial and county governments to prepe and
imnplement similar comprehensive projects and to replicate them in other parts of the
country. The project will have a direct impact on about 5 million children in 111 counties
and approximately 40,000 schools, and wil provide varying lengfts of trainng for
approximately 135,000 teachers and education managers.
21.         Risks. There are thre main risks in this project. First, the central,
provincial and county officials may not be able to adequately oversee the implementation
of the project activities. Cognizant of this risk, management training at aU three levels is
an important activity of the project. Additionaly, lessons leamned from implementing the
IDA-supported EDPP project will be included in the training of provincial and county level
implementation units for this project. Implementation experience of the EDPP project and
the strong provincial and county level work necessary to develop the current prject
indicate that this risk is not excessive. Second, the provinces may not ensure that the
poorest population benefits from improved access to and quality of basic education. To
deal with this, the project will require provinces to carry out acceptable and monitorable
action plans to ensure that educational achievements in nonproject poor counties will not
deteriorate during the implementation of the project. Finally, the tight fiscal situation in
partcipating provinces may result in insufficient counterpart funding to match IDA credit
funds. To reduce this risk provincial authorities have committed themselves, after
extensive discussion, to provide adequate countrpart funds, which are estimated on a
reaistic basis. Furthermore, SEdC has indicated that, if necessary, it will allocate funds



-7-
from special categories in its budget earmarked for education in mnoty and poor areas
to the six prqject provinces to assist in providing for any possible counterpart sotas.
22. . R.mdal. I am sified tat the prpod redt would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directo  approve the proposed credit.
