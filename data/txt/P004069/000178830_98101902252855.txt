REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of $90.0 million to help
finance a proposed third highway project. The loan wouLd have a term of 24
years, including four years of grace, with interest at 3-1/2 percent per annum.
The Saudi Fund for Development is considering providing a loan of $35 million
to cover part of the local costs (see paragraph 45).
PART I - 'iHE ECONOMY
2.        The latest Economic Report ("Current Economic Position and Pro-
spects of the Republic of Korea") was distributed under cover of SecM75-437
dated June 9, 1975. The Country Data Sheets are attached as Annex I. An
Industrial Sector Mission report is under preparation.
3.        Korea's economic performance over the last decade has been out-
standing. It entered the sixties with one of the lowest income levels in
the world; it had little experience of participation in international trade;
and it lacked natural resources. Despite these unpromising beginnings,
Korea embarked on a course of export-oriented industrial growth that has
led to its recognition as one of the most successful examples of develop-
ment. Its rich endowment with the human capabilities for economic success,
the availability of considerable entrepreneurial talent, a social environ-
ment which is conducive to rapid economic change, and a national dedica-
tion to unambiguous economic goals, all contributed to Korea's impressive
performance. In the period 1964-74, the GNP growth rate averaged 10 percent
a year in real terms, reaching the record level of 16.. percent in 1973.
This, together with a decline in population growth (from about 2.7 percent
per year at the beginning of the period to 1.7 percent at present), caused
per capita income to more than double in the period. The mainspring of
economic growth has been the increase of exports of martufactures (from about
$65 million in 1964 to over $4 billion in 1974). The ratio of exports to
GNP rose rapidly from 4 percent in 1964 to 27 percent in 1974, and the
manufacturing sector as a proportion of GNP increased f'rom 12 percent to
28 percent in the same period.  Agriculture, despite an annual growth rate
of about 3.5 percent during the last decade, declined aLs a proportion of
GNP (from 43 percent in 1964 to 23 percent in 1974).
4.        Total real investment grew ten-fold between 3.964 and 1974, and
the ratio of investment to GNP rose from 13 percent to 29 percent. External
resource requirements also grew rapidly, averaging about 9 percent of GNP
during 1970-71, roughly the same level as in the early 1960's. The marginal

saving rate during the last decade was 30 percent, which indicates that large
capital inflows did not weaken efforts to mobilize resources domestically.
However, Korea entered upon a period of rapid growth with a very low level
of domestic savings and, therefore, the Government pursued a policy of rela-
tively heavy dependence on external capital in the interest of a rapid ac-
celeration of investment and growth. Moreover, since exports during 1964-74
were rising at an average rate of nearly 47 percent, the burden of additional
external debt was not excessive, and the debt service ratio stood at around
13 percent in 1974.
5.        Korea's performance in attempting to achieve a balanced distribution
of the benefits of growth is also creditable. However, despite the fact that
income distribution in Korea is generally more equitable than in comparable
developing countries, the absolute gap in incomes between the urban and rural
areas widened during the 1960's despite substantial migration to the cities,
a modest reduction in the farm population, and high yields per unit of land
under cultivation. Growth of labor productivity in agriculture was neverthe-
less considerably slower than in manufacturing. Since 1967, the Government
has attempted to raise farm incomes and to provide other incentives for
increasing foodgrain production through a price support system covering rice
and barley. It broadened its efforts to achieve more widely and evenly dis-
tributed income growth by pursuing policies of decentralizing industry and
emphasizing investment in the less developed regions. Also, in 1971, the
Government initiated the Saemaeul (New Community) Movement as a nationwide
self-help program, aimed at increasing productivity and incomes (especially
in the rural areas where nearly half the population still lives) and at
improving the quality of rural life. Partly as a result of these various
measures, average rural household incomes are now nearly in line with those
of average urban households.
Recent Trends
6.        During the last three years the Korean economic situation has
been subject to sudden and sharp changes. Beginning with the latter part
of 1972, the Korean economy experienced an unprecedented boom. 1973 was an
exceptional year, even by Korean standards, and set new records of growth
in GNP, exports and savings. In the latter part of 1973, Korean economic
aspirations were expressed in terms of official targets for the early 1980's
of $1,000 per capita GNP and $10 billion of exports. The long-term strategy
implied the continuation over the next decade of an overall rate of GNP
growth of about 10 percent per annum but with reduced dependence, in rela-
tive terms, on net inflows from abroad.
7.        The favorable economic developments of 1973 were interrupted by
external developments in 1974. The sharp rise in the price of petroleum
beginning in late 1973, the recession in Korea's principal export markets,
Japan and the U.S., in 1974, and the high level of foodgrain and other
import prices, combined to bring about a major change in the short-term
economic position of Korea. With its heavy dependence on foreign trade,
Korea was inevitably severely affected by these international developments.



- 3 -
8.        The higher costs of energy and food importoi alone placed a severe
burden on the economy and the balance of payments. lCorean dependence on
imported fuels is not only extremely heavy but also, because it is very closely
linked to essential industrial and transport uses, cannot be readily reduced.
The additional cost of petroleum added almost $800 mLllion to the import
bill in 1974 (considerably more than twice the current account deficit in
1973) and a doubling of the prices of foodgrains increased foreign exchange
requirements in 1974 by more than $300 million, desp:Lte a decline in the
volume of these imports. Together, the increase in i:he costs of petroleum
and foodgrains accounted for about 45 percent of the increase in Korea's import
bill in 1974 and for 25 percent of total import paymants. The cost of
imported raw materials and intermediate goods also increased appreciably
and compounded the balance of payments problem. The magnitude of the effects
of these adverse developments can be gauged by the fact that Korea's terms
of trade deteriorated by 18 percent, or about 5 percent of GNP, in 1974
compared with 1973.
9.        This terms of trade loss combined with a siLmultaneous setback to
export growth resulted in an appreciable slowdown of the economy in 1974.
Real export growth, which had reached a peak of 52 percent per annum during
1972-73, was only 9 percent in 1974; this was attributable primarily to the
deep recession in the U.S. and Japan. The volume of Korea's exports to
Japan declined by about 6 percent during 1974 and its trade deficit with
Japan widened to $1.2 billion compared to $0.5 billion in 1973. The volume
of exports to the U.S. increased even in 1974. It is noteworthy that
Korean exports to countries other than the U.S. and Japan showed a marked
increase during 1974 denoting considerable initial success of the inten-
sifying market diversification efforts. Although exports have revived some-
what in 1975, they are estimated to have increased by only 14 percent during
the year as compared with an average of 36 percent during the 1970-74 period.
10.       Imported inflation has also led to a very stharp upward pressure on
the domestic price level. In addition to the sharply higher prices of
imported petroleum and foodgrains, the average unit value of other imports
increased by 45 percent during 1974. Consequently, t:he rate of domestic
inflation accelerated; in calendar year 1974, consumer prices rose by about
26 percent and wholesale prices increased by about 45 percent.   Since the
middle of 1974, the rate of domestic inflation has sLowed somewhat, reflect-
ing seasonal factors, the slower increase in the prices of imported goods
and the dampening effects of rising inventories of manufactured goods.
Government Policy Response
11.       Until the end of 1974, the Government followed policies which were
based on the premise that worldwide economic recovery would commence by
early 1975. Thus, the principal objectives of policy in 1974 were to ease
the adjustment to higher oil and other import prices, and to avoid the
slowing of domestic investment and employment growth.



12.       In general, the Government has accepted necessary price adjustments
arising from higher energy and other import costs; one major exception to
this general policy was its unwillingness to place on consumers the full
burden of higher import costs of basic foodstuffs. Thus, although prices
paid by consumers for foodgrains increased, substantial subsidies are in-
volved in the sale of wheat and rice. Complete avoidance of subsidies at
a time of growing unemployment and declining real wages in manufacturing
would have been difficult. The Government is greatly concerned with the
heavy burden these subsidies have placed on the budget and their reduction
is a major objective of the Government.
13.       Selective credit measures to assist the most distressed industries
were another element in the Government's effort to cushion the impact of
recession in 1974. These measures were intended to enable industry to
finance stocks of specified raw materials, and to carry raw materials and
finished goods inventories that had become excessive as a result of the
decline in export demand. Small- and medium-sized firms which were particu-
larly hard hit by the onset of the recession were assisted by a large credit
program embracing both working capital and investment loans. These firms
also benefitted from a preferential (government subsidized) interest rate of
12 percent, 3 percent below the normal bank rate on such loans. Similarly,
special subsidized credit facilities were made available to the machinery
industries and to finance equipment purchases by export industries. All
told, such programs provided credits totalling some W 200 billion ($495
million), equivalent to over 20 percent of the increase in total credit to
the private sector in 1974. Overall monetary policy, which had been made
quite tight in the first half of 1974, was significantly eased after
mid-year. The increase in domestic credit in the second half of the year
was more than double that in the January-June period and, over the year as
a whole, domestic credit expanded by about 50 percent compared with an in-
crease of only about 30 percent in 1973. However, owing to the contraction-
ary influence of the external deficit, the money supply increased by only
about 30 percent, compared with 40 percent in 1973.
14.       In December 1974, the Government introduced a further set of
special measures to offset the sluggish demand for exports and to relieve
the liquidity problems of exporters. It expanded the program of export
financing, undertook to purchase excess inventories of finished goods from
industries particularly hard hit by the fall in export demand, and increased
credits to exporters for the purchase of imported and domestic materials.
On December 7, 1974, the currency was devalued by 17.5 percent to W 485 per
U.S. dollar. The devaluation was not expected to increase exports appreciably
because of the depressed state of Korea's overseas markets, but like some of
the other measures, it was intended to improve the liquidity position of
manufacturing enterprises. It should also improve the competitive position
of import substitution industries which had been weakened during the year.
But the devaluation has also contributed to continued inflationary pressures
in 1975. Among measures taken by the Government to help the low income
groups are substantial income tax relief, a 30 percent increase in salaries
of Government employees and the initiation of public works projects, mainly
in the urban areas, to alleviate unemployment. The rural areas appear to



- 5 -
have been hit less hard by the economic slowdown. The terms of trade moved
further in favor of the farmers during 1974 as the support price for rice
was adjusted sharply upward.
15.       It was largely because of the efforts to sustain the 1973 momentum
of growth that the real GNP rose in 1974 by more than 8 percent; sizeable
gains were recorded in both consumption and investment. However, notwith-
standing the support provided by Government, there was a sharp slowdown in
industrial output, private fixed investment and export sales in the second
half of 1974.
16.       The impact of the adverse turn of events in 1974 was borne
primarily by the balance of payments. The current account deficit widened
from $0.3 billion in 1973 to $2.04 billion in 1974 and was somewhat
smaller in 1975. The current account deficit in the first four months of
1975 alone amounted to $1.2 billion; however, by July there were signs that
import and export trends were coming into better balance.    The financing of
the 1974 deficit involved a very large reduction ($738 million) in net
international reserves (to $300 million); the continued deficit meant
further reduction in net international reserves during 1975. The financing
of the large balance of payments deficit for 1975 required an increase in
disbursements of medium- and long-term loans.
Longer-Term Prospects
17.       Before the international developments of late 1973 and 1974, Korea
appeared to be set on an economic course which could have led to its exceed-
ing its long-range economic goals. However, the changes since the long-term
framework was formulated in 1973 have necessitatee a re-examination of both
the objectives and the strategy. Although revisec! plans have not been
completed, it appears that the .target for the average annual increase in
GNP will be lowered to 8 percent, and that the pattern of future growth
will be somewhat different from that originally envisioned. Nevertheless,
industrial development will remain an important e]ement of the long-term
strategy. Greater emphasis is also being given to increasing agricultural
production and rural incomes. The preparation of the Fourth Plan (1977-81)
affords an opportunity for a careful reconsiderat:Lon of strategy; the Govern-
ment has been extended financial assistance by the UNDP to meet the cost of
consultants (and fellowships for Korean staff) to assist with the preparation
of the Plan, and the Bank is acting as Executing Agency.
18.       Korea will in all probability be capable of sustaining an annual
growth rate of GNP of 8 percent during the next decade, provided the large
external capital inflows required to meet the sizeable balance of payments
deficits are available on reasonable terms. Considering that 90 percent of
Korea's exports now consist of manufactured goods, that its links with the
Japanese economy remain strong, that vigorous efforts are being made to



- 6 -
penetrate new markets (especially in Europe and the Middle East) and that
some progress has already been made in diversifying the industrial structure,
a long-term real growth rate of exports of at least 12 percent appears possi-
ble even if world trade in manufactures should expand at a much slower rate.
However, this would represent a substantially slower export growth than in
the past, and Korean plans already envisage greater emphasis on import
substitution in three key areas (a) foodgrains, (b) energy and (c) machinery
production, all of which will probably mean sharply higher investment costs
per unit of output.
19.       The Government is aware of the need for careful monetary and fiscal
management in the months ahead. The ability to contain the balance of pay-
ments deficits will depend partly on the speed of the recovery of exports
and partly on the Government's determination to narrow the fiscal deficit
and to reduce the rate of domestic credit creation. However, substantial
reduction in the current account deficit is likely to take several years
unless the upturn in the U.S., Japanese and other OECD economies is very
sharp in the years after 1975. Finding the means to finance the external
deficits will continue to be Korea's most urgent economic challenge. The
servicing of the sizeable foreign borrowing required should not pose serious
difficulties for Korea given the present debt service ratio and the long-term
prospects for continued export growth, provided that the proportion of debt
incurred on short- and medium-terms and at high interest rates is not exces-
sive. The debt service ratio stood at about 13 percent at the end of 1974.
It is expected to rise moderately to around 17 percent by 1977 and decline
to about 15 percent by 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
20.       As of November 30, 1975, Korea had received 22 Bank Loans and
8 IDA Credits, amounting in total to $883.8 million in loans and $107.0
million in credits (taking into account cancellations and the refinancing
of one IDA Credit in a subsequent Bank loan).
21.       A substantial part of the total has been for the transport sector --
$219.7 million for railways, $101.5 million for highways and $80 million for
ports. $130.5 million has been lent for agriculture projects. The Korea
Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) has received $150 million, the
Korea Development Bank (KDB) $60 million and the Medium Industry Bank (MIB)
$30 million in Bank loans for relending to private industry. A program loan
of $100 million was made for the financing of urgently required imports of
capital and intermediate goods. A total of $80.3 million has been provided
for three education projects; $25.0 million for a tourism project; and $15.0
million for a secondary cities project.
22.       Excluding cne project that was subsequently cancelled, IFC had, by
November 30, 1975, entered into nine commitments: five in the financial sector
and one each in the fields of textiles, electrical and electronic products,



- 7 -
synthetic fibers and tourism, totalling $30.4 milLion (net of participations
and cancellations). In December 1975, IFC's Board approved a tenth commitment
of about $5.5 million in loan and equity for a paper manufacturing company.
Currently, IFC has under advanced consideration a zinc smelting and a tire
manufacturing project; under preliminary consideration are projects in the
fields of steel products, cement distribution, construction materials, bear-
ings, electronics and development finance.
23.       Korea's ambitious industrial development programs require large
capital expenditures in the private sector, a situation which enhances the
need for IFC presence. With the closer relationship established as a re-
sult of recent promotional efforts, we expect IFC's activities to continue
expanding rapidly. IFC would seek projects that would: (i) result in for-
eign exchange revenues or savings; (ii) contribute to modernizing or deepening
the industrial structure; and (iii) increase value added in manufacturing.
24.       As of November 30, 1975, about $470 million of the total Bank
lending remained undisbursed on effective Loans and Credits; of this,
$265.5 million was committed within the last twelve months. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank Loans, IDA Credits, and IFC Invest-
ments as of that date and Notes on the execution of ongoing projects. As
indicated in the Notes, progress on project implementation is generally
satisfactory.
25.       The emphasis which the Government places on agriculture and rural
development will be reflected in the programs for FY76 and 77. A Second
Integrated Dairy Development Project was approved recently; in addition,
a rural infrastructure project, a Watershed development project, the second
stage of the Yong San Gang Irrigation Project and a second agricultural
credit project have been appraised; the Okseo irrigation and regional
development project has already been identified and is under preparation.
A second agricultural products processing project is also under consideration.
26.       The further development of the industrial and agricultural sectors
and the anticipated growth of exports will require concurrent infrastructural
development. Although the transport sector will be given relatively less
emphasis than in the past, the investments required are large, and thus
there is considerable support for this sector in the proposed program.
27.       The share of the Bank Group in Korea's total external debt (dis-
bursed) outstanding at the end of 1974 was about 6.0 percent, and the share
of debt service was of the order of 2.4 percent at that time. These ratios
are expected to increase somewhat by the end of the present decade.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
28.       The development of the transport sector: in Korea is seen most
clearly when viewed in the context of the remarkable growth and structural



- 8 -
change experienced by the economy in recent years. Manufacturing output
grew at an annual average rate of 18 percent in the 1960-73 period and the
export of manufactures at an even faster rate. This rapid expansion of
production and exports placed a severe strain on the transport sector, partly
because relatively modest amounts were invested in the enlargement of its
capacity under the First Development Plan (1962-1966).
29.       During the Second Plan period (1967-71), the demand for transport
facilities increased at an even faster pace than many of the other indicators
of economic growth. Domestic passenger traffic (in terms of passenger kilo-
meters) increased at the annual average rate of 11 percent and freight
traffic (in ton-kilometers) at 19 percent; international traffic handled
through the ports rose by 22 percent a year. The Government realised that
the further growth of the dynamic private sector could be seriously impeded
by bottlenecks in transport infrastructure. Accordingly, the allocation for
investment in transport was raised from 17 percent of the Government's capital
expenditure in the First Plan period to 27 percent for the Second Plan. During
the latter period, over W 240 billion was committed for the improvement of the
railways, the construction of new and maintenance of existing roads, and the
expansion of port and airport capacity. The demand for transport services has
continued to grow during the first four years of the Third Plan (1972-1976) in
the course of which the Government intends to invest about W 490 billion (about
$1,000 million) in transport infrastructure, or just over a quarter of total
governmental capital expenditure proposed in the Plan.
30.       The Bank Group's association with the Government's efforts to
mo8ernl7e'and expand the transport sector in Korea dates back to 1962 when
a $14.0 million Credit was made to help finance the First Railway Project.
The railroad system, which had been rehabilitated following the Korean War,
was at that time the only means for the large-scale movement of goods and
passengers, since the country had a very small network of roads and few
motor vehicles. The rapid economic progress of the succeeding years called
for a wider range of transport services. In 1965, the Bank made a technical
assistance grant for a comprehensive survey of land transportation modes,
which was carried out by consultants. Their report, which was completed in
late 1966, concluded that the railways could be expected to handle most of
the country's freight traffic, of which a large proportion consisted of
moving bulk commodities over relatively long distances, and that since the
road-system was inadequate the Government should emphasize highway improvement
in its development programs. It suggested that an organization to coordinate
transport policy was needed. In 1968, the Association extended a $3.5 mil-
lion technical assistance Credit (Cr. S-4K0) to help finance feasibility and
detailed engineering studies to improve the highway network and a study on
transport coordination. A UNDP-financed port development study was initiated
in 1971 with the Bank acting as the Executing Agency; the study recommended
an investment plan for Korea's 17 first-class ports, which is now being im-
plemented.



- 9 -
31.       The Bank Group's lending operations have: been directed towards
assisting the program of investments which stemmed. from a review of the
recommendations of the various studies referred to in the previous paragraph.
The Korean National Railroad (KNR) has continued to receive Bank Group
support to improve and expand its services. To dtte, KNR has received about
$220 million in the form of loans and credits to help finance five projects.
In June 1973, the Bank made an $80 million loan to support the expansion of
two ports -- Busan and Mukho. Following the studies financed from the pro-
ceeds of the technical assistance Credit (S-4KO), a Bank loan of $54.5 mil-
lion (769-KO) was made in 1971 to finance the consEtruction of about 400 kilo-
meters of national highways, feasibility and detailed engineering studies
(covering 900 additional kilometers of priority roads), a highway maintenance
study and the purchase of equipment and spare parl:s for a pilot highway
maintenance program. The studies and maintenance program led to the formula-
tion of the Second Highway Project for which a loan of $47.0 million (956-KO)
was approved in early 1974; it is progressing satLsfactorily.
32.       The Government has made efforts to improve transport coordination.
Following)extensive discussions between the Goveriment and the Bank, a Trans-
port Planning Office (TPO) was set up in 1970 untdr the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Transportation (MOT). Its main functLons are to collect data
and assist in the assessment of major investment proposals. TPO is control-
led by, and reports to, a Transport Coordination Ministers Conference (TCMC)
consisting of eight cabinet members whose ministrLes are most concerned with
transport matters. TPO's work is supervised by a Transport Coordination
Working Group (TCWG -- a Civil Service Committee vn which the same ministries
are represented). TPO encountered a series of teething troubles, especially
in recruiting adequately qualified staff. Certain measures designed to
increase its effectiveness were discussed during the negotiations for the
Second Highway Project in November 1973 and were to have been implemented
during the course of 1974. However, little progress was made largely because
the Government had not reached firm conclusions about TPO's functions. The
role of TPO and measures to increase its effectiveness were discussed during
negotiations for the Fifth Railway Project. The Government, as a condition
of effectiveness of the Loan, submitted to the Bank in July 1975 a time-
phased program for the effective formulation and review of policies and
investment proposals of all its agencies and ministries related to the
transport sector, including the role and staffing of TPO. Further, the
Government undertook to take measures within one year, including issuing
appropriate decrees acceptable to the Bank, for carrying out the formulation
and review of policies and investment proposals in accordance with the program.
A transport sector mission, the first phase of which has been completed, will
review these matters and examine the general questions of inter-modal coor-
dination in future.
33.       The development of the various transport modes in Korea has been
influenced by the nature of the terrain (about two-thirds of the land is
hilly); the concentration of economic activity and population around the



- 10 -
Seoul-Incheon and Busan areas; the location of domestic natural resources,
e.g. coal, iron ore and limestone, in the north, northeast and center of
the country; a long coastline with increasing industrial activity; and the
economic dependence on exports of manufactured goods and imports of bulk raw
materials.
Railways
34.       The Government owned Korean National Railroad (KNR) at the end of
1973 operated 3,086 route-km of standard gauge, of which 529 km are double
track. Electrification of some 321 km of industrial lines from Seoul to the
northeast coast (carrying mostly mineral traffic) was completed in October
1975. Also about 100 km of suburban lines have been electrified which, with
the subway opened in 1974, constitute the rail transit system in the Seoul
area.
35.       Of the rail freight traffic, over 78 percent consists of bulk
commodities (38 percent coal, 15 percent cement, 7 percent petroleum products,
8 percent ore, 4 percent grain and 6 percent fertilizer). The railway is
expected to retain, or increase, its share of the long distance traffic in
line with its increased capacity resulting from operational improvements and
additional rolling stock. Continued competition from other modes is expected
for the remaining 22 percent which is general freight traffic and for passenger
traffic; however, the railway is likely to retain a significant amount of
such traffic. The railway is expected to continue to increase its efficiency
of operation, partly resulting from Bank financed railway projects, but further
tariff adjustments will also be required to effect a major improvement in its
finances.
Ports and Shipping
36.       Freight traffic through the ports, including both overseas and
coastal shipping, increased from about 11 million tons in 1965 to 58 mil-
lion tons in 1973. This sharp increase resulted in serious port capacity
problems, particularly at Busan, the largest port. Port facilities are
being expanded, chiefly at Busan, Incheon, and Mukho, with the help of
loans from the Asian Development Bank and the Bank; a new port has been
constructed at Pohang by the Government for the steel mill and related steel
industries. Korea's share in merchant shipping is increasing slowly; over
the last three years only about 22 percent of the country's total foreign
trade tonnage has been carried by Korean vessels. The important role of
coastal shipping is largely due to the country's geography, the Government's
policy of developing industrial complexes at Pohang, Ulsan, Masan and other
coastal sites, and the existing shortage of rail and road capacity. Until
1972 the shipbuilding industry in Korea produced ships in the range of 500
to 5,000 gross tons only. However, shipyards have recently been constructed
at Ulsan which are now producing supertankers and have an annual capacity
of one million gross tons. Another large shipyard is under construction
on an island near Busan.



Aviation
37.       Domestic passenger traffic carried by air is growing rapidly, but
still amounts to only about one percent of the total. Domestic air freight
traffic is negligible. Internal routes are servetd by the privately-owned
Korean Airlines (KAL), which also operates a number of international flights.
There are two international airports: Seoul, which was expanded recently,
and Busan.
Highways
38.       The road network in Korea consists of about 9,300 km of national
highways, 10,900 km of provincial highways and roughly 24,000 km of city
and county roads. The major road arteries are shown on the attached map.
Only 44 percent of the national highways and 19 percent of other roads are
paved, the rest of the network being either gravelled or unsurfaced.   The
present highway system is still inadequate to cope with the rapid growth of
road transport, despite the Government's efforts since 1968 to catch up with
the backlog of necessary road improvements. This reflects the under-invest-
ment in road facilities in the past. Until 1967, the amounts allocated to the
highway system were inadequate even for maintenaiice needs. In the period
1968-70, the bulk of the funds invested in the hLghway network was used to
finance the construction of two toll expressways (Seoul-Busan, 428 km and
Seoul-Incheon, 30 km). This resulted in a shortage of funds for the improve-
ment of road communications between many other areas of high economic activity.
39.       The rapidly rising demand for road transport resulting from the
quickening pace of economic development in Korea urgently requires the ex-
tensive improvement of the highway network. Passenger traffic and freight
traffic on the highways represent about 74 percent and 23 percent respect-
ively of the total for all modes. During the 1967-71 period the highways
absorbed nearly all the increase in passenger traffic, which has grown at
an average annual rate of 18 percent. During the same period, highwav
freight traffic increased at an annual average rate of 49 percent - well over
twice the rate for freight carried by all modes (19 percent).    Highways still
continue to take all the increase in inter-city traffic. The growth rate for
highway passenger traffic in 1971-75 was about 15 percent, with highway freight
traffic growing at 7 percent during the same period. This was still above the
average for all modes (5 percent). The share of freight traffic by road is
expected to continue to increase in the long-term, but at a declining rate.
40.       The Government in response to the present and anticipated needs for
improving the highway system had originally plartned to spend a total of
W 227 billion on highways under the Third Plan (1972-76), but this has been
revised to W 268 billion ($554 million) - including about W 192 billion for
national highways and W 36 billion for provincial and local roads. Because of
cost increases, the target for national highwaysl was scaled down to 500 km



- 12 -
from 1,000 km for new construction or major reconstruction, including
realignments, and about 3,000 km from 4,000 km for paving and improvement
mainly on present alignments. For provincial roads, the target is to pave
and improve a total of about 3,500 km. The concept of paving and making
minor improvements to existing road alignments as a considerably cheaper
alternative to undertaking new construction of roads to higher standards has
been a subject of discussion between the Government, its consultants and the
Bank over the last few years. The Bank concurs with the Government's decision
to undertake a relatively large paving program and to construct new road
lengths only in cases where traffic levels and the anticipated benefits
justify it.
41.       The Government has become increasingly aware during recent years of
the necessity to improve the maintenance of highways. For many years, finan-
cial allocations for maintenance were extremely low in relation to needs, the
maintenance agencies had inadequate staff and equipment, and most roads, with
the exception of expressways, were in a state of disrepair. Accordingly, as
indicated in paragraph 31, funds were included to engage consultants to carry
out a Highway Maintenance Study under the First Highway Project. Their plan,
which was accepted by the Government, was for a new field organization to be
set up to maintain the entire national highway network; the organization was
initially established in a pilot province. Under the Agreement for the Second
Highway Project (Loan 956-KO), the Government undertook to complete the estab-
lishment of the nation-wide highway maintenance organization in accordance
with an agreed program, with equipment being financed under the Project. After
some administrative delays, the Government is now pressing ahead with the
establishment of the new organization under a revised implementation schedule
which was proposed by the Government and accepted by the Bank. The setting
up of the field sections, which include depots, workshops and other instal-
lations will be completed by March 1, 1976, and the organization is expected
to be fully staffed and equipped and have completed taking over the mainten-
ance of national highways by October 1, 1976.
42.       The Loan Agreements pertaining to the two ongoing Bank-financed
Highway Projects contain covenants to the effect that tolls would not be levied
on roads constructed under these Projects except with the concurrence of the
Bank. The Government's request that approval be granted to levy tolls on the
Busan-Masan section of the Jeonju-Busan highway constructed under the First
Highway Project and that the more general question of the levying of tolls on
other highways be reviewed was considered by the Transport Sector Mission (first
phase) which visited Korea in November 1975. The following decision was taken
in the light of its findings: (a) that tolls at the rates proposed by the
Government with an open barrier system (where tolls are collected at barriers
on the toll road, instead of at points of access) were justified in the case of
the Busan-Masan section; (b) that requests for the levying of tolls on other
sections of the highways under the two ongoing Bank-financed Projects and the



_ 13 -
proposed project should be supported by an economic evaluation prepared on the
basis of agreed criteria, 1/ and (c) that the Govermnent should develop a policy
framework within which decisions regarding the future application of tolls
would be taken in respect of other roads (Sections 3.09 and 3.10 of the Loan
Agreement relate to (b) and (c)).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
43.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Third Highway Project"
(No. 920a-KO dated January 13, 1976) is being distributed separately. A Loan
and Project Summary is attached as Annex III. Negotiations were held in
Washington from December 15 to 19, 1975 with a Koreaa delegation led by
Mr. Hung Ki Kim, Economic Counsellor, Embassy of the Republic of Korea,
Washington, D.C.
44.       The objectives of the proposed project are to assist in improving
the highway system to cope with the growing traffic by extending t!he network
of all weAther paved highways between the main centres of population by
nearly 800 km (see attached map), and, through studies and engineering, prepare
future projects for improving the network. Specifically, the project consists
of:
(a) construction, chiefly on new alignments, iacluding
paving, of about 195 km of four national highways,
including supervision of the work by consultants;
(b) paving and improvement, chiefly on present alignments,
of nine national highways totalling about 600 km,
including supervision of the work by consultants; and
(c)  feasibility studies by consultants of about 1,200 km of
national and provincial roads, to be followed by detailed
engineering if found justified.
Cost and Financing
45.       The estimated total cost of the project is about $220 million, in-
cluding a foreign exchange component of $90 million which will be financed by
the proposed Bank loan. Detailed cost estimates are given in Annex III. The
1/   The agreed criteria shall be, inter alia:  (i) the effect of tolls on
generated traffic; (ii) potential traffic diversion resulting from the
imposition of toll]s and the reduction of access to the road caused by the
toll collection requirements; (iii) investments on toll booths and equip-
ment and additional approach lanes, interchanges and overpasses required
with a toll system; and (iv) toll collection expenses.



- 14 -
foreign exchange component of the cost of highway construction and paving has
been estimated at 45 percent on the assumption that all contracts would be
won by local contractors, as was the case under the First and Second Highway
Projects. The Korean Government would be responsible for financing the local
cost component and would be able to do so from its budgetary resources. How-
ever, to assist in financing the local costs, the Government has requested a
loan of $35 million from the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD). A decision by
the Board of SFD is expected in the near future and, if the loan is approved,
the terms and conditions of the loan will be set during the negotiations be-
tween the SFD and the Korean Government.  The SFD may request the Bank to play
a role in the administration of their loan (as in the case of the Suez Canal
Rehabilitation Project -- Loan 1064 -- in Egypt); in this event, a letter
would be exchanged between the SFD and the Bank detailing the procedures that
would be followed in respect of such matters as withdrawal applications and
disbursements.
Execution
46.       As in the case of the First and Second Highway Projects, the Korean
Ministry of Construction (MOC) will be responsible for the execution of the
proposed project through its Bureau of Public Roads (BPR). Consultants will
assist in the supervision of the construction and paving of the highways
included in the project. They will also help the BPR in carrying out
feasibility and detailed engineering studies of the roughly 1,200 km of
roads, some of which will be selected for construction and paving in the
future.
Procurement and Disbursements
47.       Contracts for highway construction and paving will be awarded on
the basis of international competitive bidding among pre-qualified firms, in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
48.       Disbursements from the proceeds of the loan will be made over 5 years
on the basis of:
(a) 45 percent of the total cost of construction
and paving.
(b) 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the
consultants' services.
A schedule of disbursements is included in Annex III.
Benefits and Economic Return
49.       The proposed project will assist the Government's efforts to
improve and modernize the road transport system. It will help to cope with



- 15 -
the present and planned growth of the transport deman,i of Korea's fast growing,
export-oriented economy, and particularly with the demand for road transport
which registered in recent years the highest increase in freight and pas-
senger traffic of all modes. The project will also help to reduce the
high costs of moving goods and people and provide easLer access to some isolated
areas with high economic development potential.
50.       The four road sections for construction are scattered throughout
the country but are located mostly in the immediate influence areas of fast
growing cities such as Seoul, Daegu, Masan and Pohang. The Seoul (Seongman)-
Icheon Highway (43 km) will provide a new access to Seoul and so help to
reduce traffic congestion on roads on the south side of the city; it will
also aid the planned expansion of the Seoul metropolitan area and shorten the
distance (by 23 km) between Seoul and Icheon. Similarly, the Daegu-Masan
highway (85 km) will help reduce congestion on the present road accesses to
Daegu by adding a new access which will also act as a beltway for the west
side of the city. The Pohang-Yeongdeog highway (45 km) will serve an isolated
area of the east coast; the existing poor gravel road. is the only access to
this area. The Suncheon-Beolgyo highway (22 km) in the southeast serves an
essentially agricultural area, producing rice and vegetables, and the coastal
fishing villages.
51.       The nine road sections to be paved under the project are located
in five different provinces. Five roads are in the eastern central part of
the country and two along the east coast, all oriented north-south. The
two other roads are located in the southwestern region and run east-west.
All nine roads are national highways but serve largeLy regional interests as
they link towns and villages to major arteries. Thei.r improvement will assist
the development of regions which are densely populated but presently rather
isolated. The areas served are essentially agricultural, although in a few
areas (notably the east coast), the major activities are, fishing, forestry
and tourism.
52.       The economic rates of return for the roads to be constructed, (cal-
culated over an assumed 20 years service life of the investment) vary between
21 percent and 37 percent. Insofar as the paving program is concerned, the
economic rate of return ranges between 15 percent ani 37 percent. The weighted
average rate of return for construction is 31 percent, and for paving is 37
percent. The combined weighted average rate of return for construction and
paving is 29 percent. Sensitivity tests assuming substantial increases in con-
struction costs concurrent with a decrease in benefits, have shown that, even
under the most pessimistic assumptions, the rates of return for construction
and paving would justify both elements of the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHCRITY
53.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Korea and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)



- 16 -
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the pro-
posed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Loan Agreement follows the general pattern of loan agreements relating
to highway projects.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Loan No. 600        Pyongtaek-Kungang Irrigation ProJect: US$45.0 million
Loan of May 23. 1969; Effective Date: May 25, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Project includes irrigation for about 35,000 ha, improvement
of drainage and roads, consolidation of paddy fields, benching of upland
and tidal land reclamation. Construction was delayed by a reorganization
of the executing agency and a delay in hiring consultants. The major proj-
ect components (two sea dikes, the main distribution system and pumping
plants) were largely completed by the end of 1974. Contracts for nearly
all of the remaining work have been gwarded. Cost considerations have led
to the exclusion of about 5,000 ha of land from the project. Costs have
risen from US$90 million at appraisal to about US$130 million largely
because of the increased costs of right-of-way, engineering, administra-
tion and land consolidation. Preliminary estimates indicate increases in
the price of rice will partially offset the effects of higher costs and
reduced irrigable area. The economic rate of return is now estimated to
be about 10 percent, compared with the appraisal estimate of 14 percent.
The implementing agency (ADC) has reviewed ways of economizing on the
remaining work which should lead to some marginal cost savings. About
90 percent of the Loan has been disbursed. Construction is progressing
satisfactorily and is scheduled for completion by mid-1976.
Credit No. 151      First Education Prolect; US$14.8 million Credit
of June 4. 1969; Effective Date: May 25. 1970;
Closing Date: September 30. 1976
This Project comprises: (a) the expansion and equipping of 27
technical, commercial and agricultural high schools, 5 post-secondary
higher schools and 4 university teacher training departments; and (b)
26 man-years of technical assistance and 20 man-years of overseas fel-
lowships to support the development of agricultural and technical educa-
tion. All civil works, furniture, technical assistance and fellowships__
included in the Project have been completed.  Equipment procurement is more
than 90 percent complete and contracts have been awarded for about one third
of the remaining items. Disbursement has now reached about 93 percent of the
total. The total project cost is estimated to remain about 3 percent below
the appraised estimate. Due to delays in final equipment procurement, the
Closing Date has been extended by nine months.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report

Loan No. 669        Third Railway Proiect; US$40.0 million loan and
Credit No. 183      USS15.0 million Credit of May 14. 1970; Effective
Date: September 11, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The bulk of the Loan and Credit was earmarked for the purchase of
freight cars, diesel locomotives, and telecommunications and track mainte-
nance equipment. Progress is generally satisfactory except for delays in
the procurement of some microwave equipment which had to be re-tendered,
and delivery is now expected in October 1976. The Closing Date has been
extended by a year to December 31, 1976 to provide adequate time for the
completion of procurement.
Credit No. 234      Integrated Dairy Beef Development Prolect: US$7.0 million
Credit of February 11. 1971: Effective Date: August 24.
1971: Closing Date: March 31. 1977
The development of about 700 small and medium-sized dairy farms by
providing long-term loans and the construction and operation of two dairy
products processing plants were the principal components of the Project which
also includes the provision of management and technical services. To date,
about 580 farmers have participated and farm loans of about US$4.5 million
equivalent have been approved. About 4,900 head of cattle have been purchased
and two dairy plants have been constructed and are in operation. The proceeds
of the Credit are almost fully committed.
Loan No. 769        First Highway Prolect: US$54.5 million Loan of
June 29. 1971; Effective Date: December 7. 1971
Closing Date: December 31. 1916
The construction of approximately 370 km of national highways
between Jeonju and Busan was satisfactorily complel:ed in December 1973, at
a final cost about five percent above the appraisaL estimate. Feasibility
studies and detailed engineering have been completed for 1,400 km and 1,100
km of national highways, respectively. A study of road maintenance and the
establishment of a pilot maintenance organization formed the basis of the
creation of a country-wide Highway Maintenance Org;nization which is being
carried out under the Second Highway Project. The Closing Date has been
extended by 13 months to permit completion of procurement of highway main-
tenance equipment.
Loan No. 795        Yong San Gang Irrigation Projezt; US$33.0 million Loan

Datd: Se*t&* t'15. 1972:'Clo3iug Date: September 30. 1977
This Project aims at transforming an area with the highest drought
frequency in Korea into one with reliable irrigation and crop diversifica-
tion. Also, there will be increased production of high value crops such as
fruits and winter vegetables. Design work is proceeding satisfactorily and
the work on four dams, the main canals and land consolidation has started.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 9 pages
Award of all major contracts have been made, although the delay on several
means that construction will begin roughly a year later than scheduled at
appraisal. The delay was caused mainly by increased costs due largely
to price escalation and design modification. The cost increases will
be partially compensated for by benefits attributable to the enlargement
of the area to be irrigated by about 1,400 ha., and ADC plans to reduce
costs by constructing only canals, roads and drainage systems for contour
furrow irrigation on all lands exceeding 2 percent slope. Also the Bank
has begun monitoring construction costs on each of the ten major civil
works contracts on a monthly basis.
Credit No. 335     Agricultural Credit Prolect: US$10.5 million Credit of
September 29. 1972: Effective Date: May 24. 1973:
Closing Date: September 1. 1976
The Credit supports a three year lending program to small farmers
to develop orchards, sericulture and mushroom production and to encourage
the bree4ing of poultry and swine. It also finances an organizational and
accounting study of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF)
and the strengthening of its training facilities. The Project is progress-
ing satisfactorily and disbursement is proceeding on schedule.
Loan No. 863        Fourth Railway Project; US$40.0 million Loan of
November 22. 1972: Effective Date: February 26, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31. 1976
The main elements of the Project are: electrification of lines
in the Seoul suburban area; purchase of electric railcars and locomotives;
the completion of electrification of 350 km of line running from Seoul to
the northeastern part of Korea; track and bridge renewal; provision of
yard facilities; acquisition of passenger and freight cars; and improve-
ment of facilities for the maintenance and repair of motive power and
rolling stock. No major problems have been encountered; nearly all of
the Loan proceeds have been committed.
Loan No. 905        Fourth KDFC Project, US$40.0 million Loan of June 13,
1973: EffectiveiDate: September 10, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
The Project is progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 906        Second Education Prolect: US$23.0 million Loan and
Credit No. 394      US$20.0 million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective
Date: September 10. 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1977
The Project provides equipment for and extensions to the buildings
of: 18 technical and 14 agricultural high schools; ten higher schools/junior

ANNEX II
Page 6 of 9 pages
of agriculture, engineering and natural sciences in nine universities and a
merchant marine college; and ten junior teacher colleges and 12 colleges of
education. It also includes pre-investment studies on health and manage-
ment education. Implementation is about seven monthE; behind schedule due
to delays in the preparation of equipment lists (civil works, which are
being financed by the Government, are slightly ahead of schedule). The
Project has encountered two problems: delays in equi.pment procurement
and lack of counterpart funds to cover cost overruns on civil works (about
75%). However, steps have been taken by the Government and the Bank to
overcome these problems and therefore implementation should improve within
the next six months. The Project is expected to be completed on schedule
by the end of 1977. Disbursement has been somewhat slower than expected
at appraisal due to the delay in the preparation of equipment lists but is
expected to improve.
Loan No. 917       Ports Prolect: US$80 milLion Loan of June 27. 1973;
Effective Date: September 18. 1973; Closing Date:
June 30. 1979
The Project includes the provision of container and bulk cargo
facilities and equipment at Busan and coal piers and handling equipment
at Busan and Mukho. Work on the first three civil works contracts, amounting
to about one-third of the estimated project cost, is somewhat behind schedule
but is now proceeding satisfactorily. Bids received for the Mukho coal-
handling equipment and for the Busan grain handling Eacilities were close
to the revised cost estimates. Preparation and issuance of the remaining
contract documents is on schedule. The estimiated project cost has risen by
about a third from the appraisal estimate, but the foreign exchange cost
should not increase by more than 20 percent because inost of the civil works are
expected to be carried out by local contractors. The percentage disburse-
ment of the Loan is being reduced appropriately. The legislation for the
establishment of the Korean Port Authority has been approved by the National
Assembly and the necessary action is expected to folLow shortly.
Loan No. 942       Seeds Project; US$7.0 million Loan of November 16, 1973;
Effective Date: April 24, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978

seed processing and storage facilities; (b) farm macdlinery for seed produc-
tion; (c) procurement of seasonal seed inventories through the operation
of a revolving fund; (d) seed testing laboratories and equipment; (e) crop
research (financed in part by USAID); (f) feasibility studies for irrigation
and area development; and (g) technical assistance. The necessary legisla-
tive and administrative action for revising the Seed Law and establishing
an "Office of Seed Production and Distribution" has been taken. Project
implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Preliminary estimates suggest
that Project costs would be somewhat higher than envisaged at appraisal; the
estimates are being reviewed.
