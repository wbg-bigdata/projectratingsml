I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Sector Characteristics and Performance
1.01      Despite the rapid development of petroleum production and the
steady growth of manufacturing during the 1970s, agriculture continues to
be one of the important sectors of the Ecuadoran economy. The sector's
contribution to GDP declined from 23% in 1972 to 14% in 1980, and its
growth rate over this period was only 1.5% per annum. Subsector growth
rates between 1972 and 1978 were 0.6% for crops, 3.9% for livestock, 9.6% for
forestry and 7.4% for fisheries. Agriculture's relative contribution to total
exports has also been displaced by petroleum. Agricultural exports decreased
from 75% of total exports in 1970 to 26% in 1980. Nevertheless, the agricul-
tural sector provides employment to nearly half the country's labor force, and
the sector's potential contribution to national production remains high.
Annex 1, Tables 1 and 2 present information on agricultural production and
exports.
1.02      Since Ecuadoran agriculture is traditional and export-oriented,
food production has stagnated and therefore is lagging behind the continuously
increasing demand for food resulting from a high population growth (3.3%) and
higher incomes in the urban areas. With food production lagging, overall
growth demand for food has spilled over into imports and supply shortages have
exerted an upward pressure on domestic food prices; main imports are vegetable
oils, animal fats and dairy products, supplemented from time to time by rice
and sugar.
1.03      The domestic food supply problem now emerging, as evidenced by
upward pressures on food prices and increasing imports, is partly a result
of the chain of events set in motion by the petroleum-based economic expansion
which began in the early 1970s, along with unfavorable weather conditions in
1977 and early 1978 and, in the case of sugar, poor labor-management relations.
While in the past much of the growth in agriculture was achieved by settle-
ment of new lands (mostly in the Costa) and was export-oriented, most of
this was done by private initiative, with the Government helping through
the provision of basic infrastructure (such as roads). The increase in
food production now needed requires a basic shift, with more emphasis to be
put on the transfer to farmers of new technology, more farm-level technical
guidance, better methods of agricultural organization and more incentives
to farmers in the field of pricing and marketing of agricultural produce.
Although the Government is aware of these shortcomings, its public sector
services in the field of agriculture will need a great deal of upgrading
and policy guidance to address these issues effectively.
The Rural Subsector
1.04      Although Ecuador has been subject to an accelerated urbanization
process, 57% of its 7.8 million population still live in rural areas and
about half of them, or 30% of the total, are Indians. About 2.9 million
persons (65%) of the rural population, have per capita incomes below the
US$315 absolute poverty income level. While rural poverty is a national
problem, it is generally more serious in the highlands (Sierra) where the



-2-
Indian population lives and where there is a continuous migration to the
Costa and Oriente regions.
1.05      Education, health and living conditions of the rural population are
poor and social services are inadequate. Although statistics show a relatively
high (74%) literacy rate, a high proportion of the rural population is function-
ally illiterate; schools and education centers are usually located in large
populated areas and villages, making it difficult for the widely dispersed
rural population to use the facilities. Curricula are academically oriented
and include very little vocational training; teachers are not adequately
trained or paid and their living conditions are poor. Most of the rural
population is affected by water-borne and fecally transmitted diseases; about
45% are anemic and 40% are undernourished. Despite Government efforts
to extend health service coverage, a high proportion of the rural population
still does not have access to primary health care. Besides, health programs
are mainly curative and do not give enough emphasis to preventive medicine;
also, cultural and economic barriers make the population reluctant to use
the services. Finally, only 13% of the rural dwellings have access to public
water supply and to sanitation facilities.
Resource Base
1.06      Ecuador is divided into three ecological regions--the Costa, Sierra
and Oriente. The Costa, covering about one-fourth of the country's 26.1 million
ha, and about 50% of the 7.8 million population, comprises the low coastal,
humid-tropical lands in the western part of the country; it is the region with
the best agricultural potential and produces bananas, plantains, coffee,
cacao, sugarcane, beef, hard corn, cassava, citrus and oil crops (annual and
perennial). A major portion of the area is being exploited, but much land
still remains to be brought under cultivation. Some areas, such as the Puerto
Ila-Chone and Esmeraldas, to the north of the region, are still being settled.
The Sierra accounts for another fourth of the country's area and about 47% of
the population, and comprises the Andean highlands, with broken terrain, high
valleys, and a variety of climatic conditions. This region produces temperate
climate foodgrains and pulses, as well as potatoes, vegetables, deciduous
fruits and dairy products. The Oriente region covers slightly more than half
of the Ecuadoran territory at the east of the Andean mountains in the Amazon
basin and accounts for only 3% of the population. This region suffers from
having only limited access, but with construction of roads and the exploita-
tion of oil, spontaneous settlements are taking place with some Government
support. Although the Amazon basin has limited agricultural potential,
some areas have good soil suitable for intensive cultivation of tree crops
and natural and artificial pastures for livestock development.
Government Objectives and Strategy
1.07      The Government's development objectives for the agricultural sector
in general and for the rural poor in particular are stated in the recently
published 1980-84 development plan. These objectives are to increase pro-
duction and productivity in order to ensure self-sufficiency in food and
to increase exports, thereby increasing income and living standards of the
rural population. In conjunction with production objectives, the plan also



-3-
aims at strengthening farmers' organizations and participation in the decision-
making process and at improving social services in the rural areas. The plan
includes implementation of an integrated rural development program consisting
of 17 projects, some of which are already being executed and many are in
preparation. The on-going Tungurahua Project (Loan 1644-EC), the recently
approved Puerto Ila-Chone and the proposed Esmeraldas projects are included in
the program. Projected Government public investments amount to US$800 million
over the five-year plan period. The success of this program, however, would
depend on decisive efforts by the Government to improve public sector capabili-
ties for preparing and implementing projects.
Bank Involvement and Strategy for the Sector
1.08      IDA and the Bank have made nine agricultural credits and loans to
Ecuador in the period 1967-79. Four of them, totalling US$30.7 million,
were for livestock and general agricultural development credit--Livestock I
(Loan 501-EC) for US$3.7 million in 1967, Livestock II (Credit 173-EC) for
US$1.5 million in 1969, Livestock III (Credit 222-EC) for US$10 million in
1970, and Agriculture I (Loan 1459-EC) for US$15.5 million in 1977. Disburse-
ments of Loan 501-EC were completed about six months ahead of schedule and
Credit 173-EC was a small "bridge" operation. A Project Performance Audit
Report (PPAR) (SecM75-735) covering both projects states that the projects re-
sulted in a 6% increase in the Ecuadoran beef cattle herd and caused notable
improvements on participating farms, but that, because the technology proposed
was capital-intensive and participation limited to large producers only, the
impact on income distribution was regressive. The Livestock III Project was
completed two years behind schedule and its PPAR (SecM80-l0) states that, while
the project made an impact on beef and milk production, mostly through increases
in herd size, it was not of the magnitude expected. The PPAR also questions the
need for the project on the grounds that production increases were, for the most
part, due to price incentives established by the Government at the time of the
project and that project benefits accrued only to middle and upper income pro-
ducers., The on-going First Agricultural Credit Project took into account the
lessons learned in the previous projects. It provides financing for all agricul-
tural activities and agro-industry and includes a separate component for small-
scale farmers. It had a slow start but it is now progressing satisfactorily;
funds allocated to medium- and large-scale farmers have been fully committed,
but the small-scale farmer and small-scale agroindustry components have moved
slowly because of a lack of capacity for subproject identification and prepara-
tion and technical assistance on the part of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock and participating banks.
1.09      The status of the remaining projects is as follows.  The Fisheries
Project (Loan 555-EC) of 1968 for US$5.0 million, later reduced to US$3.9 mil-
lion was completed in 1980 and a completion report was submitted to OED in
May 1981. On the Milagro Irrigation Project (Credit 425-EC) of 1973 for
US$5.5 million, the main irrigation works were completed ahead of schedule.
However, because of land tenure problems and lack of agricultural extension,
construction of the distribution system was not completed, farm development
was delayed and US$1.5 million was left undisbursed at the closing date. The
Seeds Project (Loan 1229-EC) of 1976 for US$3.0 million was delayed earlier
due to administrative and managerial problems and shortage of counterpart



-4-
funds; the closing date was extended for two years and, with new management,
execution is now proceeding satisfactorily. The Technical Assistance Project
(Loan 1230-EC) of 1976 for US$4.0 million has partially achieved its objectives
but loan disbursements have been very slow because of the complicated procedures
of the National Preinvestment Fund for making subloans and because use of funds
was restricted to financing only the foreign exchange costs of consulting
services; in September 1980, the loan closing date was extended two years and
loan financing was expanded to partially cover local costs, which is expected
to speed up implementation. The Tungurahua Rural Development Project I (Loan
1644-EC) of 1979 for US$18 million initially had problems in the processing
and signing of operational agreements between the Central Bank and the executing
agencies; however, the difficulties have been overcome and project investments
are starting. A new loan for a second rural development project, Puerto Ila
Chone, was approved by the Board on May 12, 1981.
1.10      In addition to the aforementioned projects, Highways Projects V
(Loan 1429-EC of 1977) and VI (Loan 1882-EC of 1980) include substantial
feeder road components, aimed at improving access and the transport of pro-
duce in rural areas.
1.11      For the future, the Bank intends to pursue its efforts to foster
agricultural and rural development in Ecuador. Priority will be given to
assist the Government in the organization of the recently created Secretariat
for Integrated Rural Development (SEDRI) and in the implementation of the
three rural development projects to be financed by the Bank. Further opera-
tions in agricultural credit, irrigation and rural development are under
consideration. In all these projects, substantial efforts will be made to
strengthen the managerial and implementation capabilities of the agricultural
public sector which has been and still is the main bottleneck in the prepara-
tion and execution of projects.
II. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK - PARTICIPATING AGENCIES
The Integrated Rural Development Framework
2.01      Until recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG)
was responsible for rural development in Ecuador, but in October 1980, the
Government established a new institutional framework to promote integrated
rural development within the national system of public administration. Under
this new scheme, the office of the President of the Republic formulates
policy on rural development and approves the National Program of Rural Devel-
opment Projects. The National Development Council (CONADE) proposes the
national program to the President and is responsible for monitoring and
evaluating it. SEDRI, created by the same decree, is responsible for pro-
gramming, preparation and coordination of implementation and for channeling
of funds to the 17 rural development projects included in the national plan.
Project implementation is the responsibility of Executing Units (UEs) to
be established for each project, with the participation of ministries and of



-5-
public and private specialized agencies. To finance implementation of the
Rural Development Program, the Government also established the Integrated
Rural Development Fund (FONADRI) in the Central Bank; through this fund, SEDRI
will channel both local and external financing for the projects. This new
administrative framework is expected to address the coordination and financial
problems affecting rural development activities in Ecuador.
The Secretariat for Integrated Rural Development (SEDRI)
2.02      SEDRI and its project executing units are to be the executive arm of
the Rural Development Program. SEDRI is attached to the Office of the President
of the Republic and its head, the Secretary, reports to the President through
the general secretary for Public Administration. Its headquarters are in Quito.
An advisory committee made up of one representative each of CONADE, the Ministries
of Agriculture and of Social Welfare, the Provincial Councils, the private
rural development organizations and the organizations of farmers and Indians,
advise the secretary on general policy matters, but it does not have decision
making authority. At the central level, SEDRI is organized in three General
Directorates: Programing, Technical and Administrative. The technical
directorate is the operating branch of SEDRI and consists of the departments
of Projects and Farmers Organization and Training. SEDRI staff, at headquarters,
consists of 25 technicians and 20 administrative and support personnel. The
UEs are headed by a project director reporting to the secretary of SEDRI and
are made up of technical staff seconded by the participating agencies and
administrative staff belonging to SEDRI. Participation of the ministries
and specialized agencies is ensured and spelled out by means of project
specific agreements that SEDRI signs with each of them. It is expected that,
because of its direct access to the president, SEDRI will enjoy a certain amount
of political and bureaucratic influence and, therefore, it would be able to
establish adequate coordination among Government agencies and speed up
implementation of projects. For the purpose of the proposed project, SEDRI
would establish the Executing Unit in Quininde.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG)
2.03      MAG is the ministry in charge of formulating and applying policy
on agriculture research, production and marketing of agricultural products,
agrarian reform, land settlement, irrigation and adequate use of renewable
resources. Implementation of most of these policies is carried out by spe-
cialized autonomous agencies, while the ministry itself undertakes production
support and organization of farmers' activities through its local offices.
2.04      In November 1980, the organizational structure of MAG was changed.
Under the new organization, the ministry will operate at four levels:
Executive (Minister and General Undersecretary); Advisory (Agrarian Superior
Council, National Planning, Legal, Security for Development and Internal
Auditing); Auxiliary (Administration and Finance, International Affairs and
Public Relations); and Operational (Technical Undersecretariat).
2.05      The Technical Undersecretariat is headed by an Undersecretary and
consists of four departments--Programing and Evaluation, Technical Norms,
Campesino Development and Extension--and 14 national commodity-oriented
semiautonomous programs--banana, rice, cacao, coffee, cotton and oilseeds,



-6-
corn, cereals, livestock, forestry, control of plant diseases, animal health,
soil conservation, agricultural mechanization, and seeds. The Departments
of Campesino Development and Extension would participate in the project in
the organization and training of farmers and in extension work, and the cacao,
coffee and livestock programs would assist in production matters.
2.06      Regional operations of MAG are carried out by 10 Agricultural Pro-
vincial Directorates (DPAs), one for each province, in cooperation with the
national programs and under the supervision of the general directorates. The
DPAs carry out field work through the Agricultural Service Agencies (ASAs) and
the Integrated Agricultural Development Projects (PIDAs). The ASAs operate at
the subregional level and generally are responsible for extension and other
agricultural services to farmers. The PIDAs operate in areas where the Ministry
implements a multi-sectoral project, directed mainly toward small-scale farmers
and including, not only agriculture, but also other development programs such as
feeder roads and social infrastructure. While the national programs have a
single commodity approach, oriented mainly toward assisting commercial farmers,
the ASAs and PIDAs take an integrated approach, aiming at overall development
of small- and medium-sized farms. Although the regional offices have their
own budgets and are independent of the central offices in Quito, their authority
is limited, mainly when it comes to hiring staff and procuring goods and
services. The project area falls into the jurisdiction of the Esmeraldas DPA
and of the Quininde PIDA.
2.07      MAG suffers from the general structural and operational problems
which affect the entire Ecuadoran public sector. Professionals, especially
medium-level technicians, are in short supply and low salaries make it
difficult for MAG to attract and hold qualified staff, particularly at the
field level where living conditions are usually poor. Cumbersome administra-
tive procedures (which often lead to overlapping of authority among agencies),
expanded operations not properly funded and untimely allocation of resources
seriously hamper MAG's effectiveness: thus, only a few DPAs and, through
them, ASAs and PIDAs operate effectively in the field. Moreover, frequent
reorganizations and management changes have created uncertainty and affected
staff morale and have led to a lack of policy guidance in agriculture; as a
result, MAG's reputation is not that of an efficiently run organization.
National Agricultural Research Institute (INIAP)
2.08      INIAP, responsible for crop and livestock research, works through
a head office in Quito and six experimental stations: one in the Sierra
region, one in the Oriente region and four in the Costa. The Pichilingue
and the Santo Domingo stations in the Costa would support the project.
INIAP has enjoyed the support of the Government and external donors, which
made it possible for it to assemble a highly qualified staff and establish
a fine research program. INIAP has made significant contributions in devel-
oping and adapting improved varieties and production techniques for cacao, oil
palm, coffee, cassava, potatoes, wheat and corn as well as for swine production.
However, the lack of adequate extension and other production support services
has hampered the dissemination of agricultural technology to medium- and
small-scale farmers. INIAP is a participating agency in three agricultural
projects currently being financed by the Bank, and its performance, although
limited in scope, has been good.



Ecuadoran Land Reform and Land Settlement Institute (IERAC)
2.09      IERAC is responsible for the expropriation and redistribution of
land, the management and settlement of national lands, and the granting of
titles. It has 10 regional offices, among which the Quininde office has
jurisdiction over the project area. Unfortunately, IERAC has been handicapped
by lack of Government support, inadequate financial resources, a high rate of
management turnover, and complicated and lengthy titling procedures. Conse-
quently, the impact of the agrarian reform program on improving income distri-
bution has been very limited. The Government carried out a study on the
impact of agrarian reform in Ecuador, but it has not been made public and
therefore there is no comprehensive information on the matter. IERAC claims
that, since 1964, it expropriated and redistributed some 580,000 ha to 66,000
families and has settled and granted provisory or firm land titles to about
100,000 families, involving 2.2 million ha of land. In relative terms, IERAC
has been more successful in land settlement than in land distribution.
Although it has not been able to control spontaneous settlement, which is
understandable, it has been able to achieve at least a relatively uniform dis-
tribution of land in the new settlement areas in which it has intervened.  This
has been the case in Santo Domingo de los Colorados, to the south of the project
area, the project area itself and the Napo Province in Oriente. However, lack
of adequate follow-up action and a long processing period for land titles has
led to illegal ownership transfers, resulting in abnormal conditions of land
tenure in the early settled areas.
National Development Bank (BNF)
2.10      BNF, a Government-owned bank which was created in 1928, is the
largest bank and the most important source of agricultural credit in Ecuador.
BNF has 2,900 employees, with a network of 65 branches and 10 agencies
covering the entire country. BNF's main sources of funds are its equity,
rediscounts from the Central Bank--trust funds and development bonds--and
external loans. BNF has received no direct loans from the Bank, but it has
been the main financial institution participating in Bank-financed livestock
and agricultural credit projects in Ecuador. BNF is also in charge of the
execution of the agricultural credit component in the Puerto Ila Chone Rural
Development Project.
2.11      In 1979, BNF's agricultural lending was S/3.1 billion (US$125.2
million), amounting to about 76% of its total lending operations and to 53%
of total lending to agriculture in the country. At the end of that year,
its total agricultural loan portfolio was S/10.8 billion (US$432.0 million).
BNF's lending operations can be divided into two categories: (a) credito
de capacitacion - loans to small-scale farmers, defined as those with total
net assets of less than S/750,000 (US$30,000), including land, but excluding
houses, and whose main source of income is the land for which the subloan
is made; and (b) credito bancario - loans to all other beneficiaries, at
interest rates between 9% and 12% plus commissions, depending on the repayment
period. Regarding repayment terms, about 70% of the annual loans are short-
term and the remaining 30%, medium and long term.
2.12      BNF has made a valuable contribution to agricultural development in
Ecuador. However, in the 1970s with the oil boom, it received large amounts
of Government resources and had to carry out credit operations initiated by



- 8 -
MAC and directed to producers who often were not creditworthy. Moreover, BNF did
not have sufficient qualified technical staff for credit evaluation, supervision
and technical assistance, and it was, therefore, not prepared to manage this
sudden increase in operations. As a result, by the end of 1976, the quality
of BNF's portfolio had deteriorated considerably. After writing off 5% of the
delinquent loans and rescheduling 38% of the outstanding debt, overdues still
were 19%. In 1978 the Government made another substantial capital contribution
which, as the previous ones, has enabled BNF to maintain a constant level of
lending in real terms and to cover its operating expenses.
2.13      In 1979, a new management was appointed by the Government and it
committed itself to making BNF an efficient banking institution. To support
this commitment, a three-year UNDP/FAO technical assistance project has been
underway since mid-1980. It provides for 102 man-months of expatriate specialists
to assist BNF in improving its managerial, technical and operating capabilities.
Furthermore, in compliance with commitments made under Bank and IDB loans,
BNF has retained a well-known international firm of auditors to audit its
financial statements and to revise its accounting procedures. The firm has
already completed the auditing of 1978 accounts and has presented detailed
proposals for changes in accounting practices to correctly reflect the
financial situation of BNF. The proposals are in the course of implementation
and the auditors are proceeding with the auditing of 1979 and 1980 accounts,
which are expected to be completed by mid-1981. The joint effort by BNF's
new management, the UNDP/FAO and the auditors will undoubtedly result in
significant changes in BNF operations.
Ministry of Public Works and Communications (MOP)
2.14      MOP is primarily responsible for overall planning, construction and
maintenance of the main highways system of the country and for coordinating
construction of secondary and feeder roads. Feeder roads in Ecuador are cur-
rently constructed by the provincial governments and by other Government
institutions for their own specialized purposes. MOP has implemented four
Bank-financed highway projects (Loans 94-EC, 176-EC, and 379-EC and Credit
51-EC) and has three more under implementation (Loan 1231-EC, 1429-EC and
1882-EC). Thus far, Bank experience with MOP has been good and it may be
considered one of the best agencies the Bank is dealing with in Ecuador.
Ministry of Public Health (MSP)
2.15      MSP was created in 1967, but it was only in 1977 that it took over
responsibility for rural health. MSP's functions are handled by two under-
secretaries: Public Health and Environmental Health. The former consists
of a Directorate General, three administrative and five operational depart-
ments and four specialized institutes and services. The National Rural
Development Department is responsible for staffing and supervising rural
health facilities and for promoting community participation. At the pro-
vincial level, MSP has the Provincial Health Departments reporting directly
to the Directorate General. MSP is developing a regionalized health system
consisting of health promoters, health posts, subcenters and centers at the
local level, base hospitals at the provincial level, and specialized and
university hospitals in major cities. Patients are to be referred from the
health promoters upwards. However, because of transportation and other



-9-
operational constraints, this is not always possible. Health facilities are
unevenly distributed and sometimes underutilized, because of lack of staff or
medicines and other inputs, and because they often do not enjoy the confidence
of the population. About 25% of the population, mainly those living in
isolated areas, do not have access to health services and instead seek help
from traditional healers and midwives. An additional 40% do not use available
health services because of cultural and economic constraints.
Ecuadoran Institute of Sanitary Works (IEOS)
2.16      IEOS is a semi-autonomous agency reporting to the Undersecretariat
of Environmental Health of MSP. It is responsible for: (a) design and construc-
tion of health facilities; and (b) planning, design and construction of water
supply and sewerage works in the country, except for Quito and Guayaquil.
IEOS has extensive experience in constructing sanitary works and has carried
out several national plans with IDB financing. It is now in a transitional
period of reorganization, which has caused operations to slow down, but it is
expected that once this period is over, IEOS will resume its normal working
pace.
Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC)
2.17      MEC is responsible for the overall administration of the educational
system in Ecuador, below university level. Under the direction of the minister
and a vice-minister, MEC operates through five national directorates; among
them are the Directorates of Planning (DNP) and School Construction (DINACE)
and the Directorate of National Education (DNE), responsible for staffing and
operation through provincial directorates. Although properly structured
to cover all aspects of education, MEC's effectiveness is weakened by frequent
managerial changes, excessive paper work and shortage of qualified personnel
and equipment. DNP is very weak and therefore DINACE prepares practically all
construction plans on its own and carries them out independently.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
Location and Access
3.01      The project area is located in the northwestern part of the country,
in the Costa, within the jurisdiction of the Quininde canton, Esmeraldas
province (IBRD Map 15619). It comprises about 94,200 ha of recent settlement,
with good soils, sufficient and well distributed rainfall and therefore sub-
stantial potential for crop and livestock development. A paved highway borders
the west end of the area connecting it with the port of Esmeraldas, 92 km
to the north; Santo Domingo de los Colorados, 83 km to the south; and Quito,
208 km to the southwest. Three large rivers, the Guayllabamba, the Blanco
and the Canande, cross the area from the east-southwest. These rivers are
natural access ways to the area but are also barriers for internal road
communication.



- 10 -
Climate
3.02      The climate in the project area is humid-tropical.  Average annual
rainfall ranges between 2,500 and 3,500 mm. Rains occur every month of the
year, but the wettest period is between December and July. Average annual
0                                          0         0
temperature is about 25 C, with maximum and minimum at about 35 C and 13 C,
respectively. Relative humidity is about 89% all year round. Average
annual evapotranspiration is estimated at 1,442 mm.
Land Resources
3.03      The project area is located at altitudes ranging between 200 and
400 meters above sea level. Topography is generally flat, with moderately
undulating slopes in areas surrounding the river banks. The area is rather
well drained by the rivers crossing it and by numerous streams. Surface
water is abundant and ground water is available at depths of 10 to 20 meters
and, in many places, is as shallow as 3 meters.
3.04      A reconnaissance soil survey of the project area was carried out
by OAS-INERHI in 1975 (para 4.01). In most of the area, the soils, consisting
of recent alluvial and volcanic ash deposits, are fairly deep and friable and
therefore susceptible to erosion when left uncovered. Fertility is moderate to
high with low nitrogen and phosphorus content and moderate to high potassium
content. With adequate management to protect against erosion and with correct
fertilizer mixtures, these soils have good potential for tree crops and
pasture development.
Land Use and Development
3.05      As the project area is one of recent settlement, land use and
development very much reflect the usual pattern of spontaneous settlement
in the humid tropics. The natural vegetation of the area is tropical rain
forest. The species most commonly found are Chanul (Hurnaceae sp.), Sande
(Horaceae sp.), Cuangare (Mirysticeae sp.), Anime (Burceraceae sp.) and Jigua
(Laureaceae sp.). Settlers are exploiting the valuable trees by selling them
to timber operators well established in the project area. The remaining
forest is usually slashed and burned; and the cleared land is sown with corn
for one or two seasons as pioneer crops and for consumption purposes. When
financing and labor are available, the land is simultaneously intermixed
planted to cacao, coffee, banana and plantain or sown to pasture, mainly
panicum maximum. When left uncultivated, the cleared land is invaded by
natural grasses and weeds and by secondary forest.
3.06      Out of the total 94,178-ha project area, about 23,100 ha (25%) are
in crops (of which about 8,100 ha are coffee, 6,100 ha cacao, 6,100 ha banana
and plantain, 1,700 ha oil palm 1/ and 1,100 ha in annuals and others); another
11,500 ha (12%) are in pasture, 54,700 ha (58%) are forest and the remaining
4,878 ha (5%) are riverbeds, roads, and such. Livestock consists of some 9,350
1/   Corresponds to an industrial plantation.



- 11 -
head of cattle and some 4,650 swine, mostly in farms larger than 10 ha. Land
use systems are related to farm size: small-scale or recent settlers have most
of their farms in crops, with reduced pasture lands and some heads of live-
stock; larger farmers are, in contrast, involved in ranching, mainly because
of their better access to credit. In general, land development is constrained
due to lack of adequate access and agriculture technical assistance and credit.
3.07      Overall crop production and productivity are low.  Cropped areas
consist of rather young intermixed plantations of coffee, cacao and plantain,
rudimentarily established and maintained. Planting is usually done using
self-sown seedlings, with little use of nursery seedlings or selected planting
materials. Cultural practices are limited to weeding and few farmers use
fertilizers or disease and insect control measures. Consequently, average
yields are low: cacao 0.11 m ton/ha of dry beans; coffee 0.93 m ton/ha of
cherry beans, banana and plantain 5.1 m tons/ha. Pasture lands are in good
condition but generally understocked. The predominant cattle type is Criollo
by Zebu breeding, raised mainly to produce steers to be sold at any time upon
family's money needs. Cattle management practices are limited to herding to
and from the paddocks, morning milking, and minimal pasture maintenance and
fencing; castration, vaccination, deworming and dips are rarely carried out.
Although disease and parasites are not yet a problem because of the low
population intensity, they may become so with the introduction of additional
livestock. Swine fattening is extensive; pigs run freely over the farm and
are fed with banana and plantain residues, and cassava and human residues;
health practices are nil.
Land Tenure and Land Titling
3.08      Land tenure in the project area reflects the settlement pattern
of the population. Before the 1960s, the area was almost empty except for
small population groups of Caribbean descent settled on the Esmeraldas river
banks covering an area of about 3,000 ha, and a Cayapa Indian community living
on some 5,000 ha north of the Canande River. Since the 1960s, with the
construction of the road to Esmeraldas, spontaneous settlers have come to the
area in a steady flow. To comply with the Agrarian Reform Law and thereby have
the right to land titles, the newcomers have settled in continguous parcels of
20 to 50 ha along access paths and have organized into cooperatives through
which IERAC has been granting provisional land titles. As of today, practically
the whole project area has been settled and is being developed. However, about
12,000 ha are part of a forestry concession that, according to Government
officials, has not been adequately exploited and has been occupied by settlers.
There are some 2,567 farm units in the project area, including the land parcels
in the occupied forestry concession and the Cayapa reservation. The distribu-
tion by size of these farms is as follows:
Average
Size                Farms                   Area                Size
No.    %             Ha        %              ha

3.09      With regard to land titling, the situation in this project is
different from that in Puerto Ila Chone. Because land settlement is relatively
recent, only few informal transactions of land have taken place, since pro-
visional titles were granted, mainly to consolidate property in farms larger
than 50 ha. Therefore, there are no major problems of illegal possession of
land. Also, the IERAC regional office is working in the area delimiting land
parcels and granting provisory titles. However, this office needs strengthening
to handle the increasing demand for land titles and the likely subdivisions of
land that may take place as a result of increasing population. Improvements
are needed especially in recording land titling applications and in their
subsequent administrative legal processing in Quininde and Quito. According
to the feasibility study, the land titling situation among farms up to 50 ha
is as follows: about 132 (5%) of the farmers in the project area have farm
titles; 988 (41%) have provisory titles or are in the process of obtaining
them; 906 (37%) need to start the process of obtaining titles; 230 (10%), are
in the forestry concession and have an undefined legal status; and 166 (7%),
in the Cayapa reservation have legal titles. The feasibility study does not
provide information on land titles on farms over 50 ha, but it is presumed that
a majority of them have firm titles. The farmers with firm and provisory titles
and those in the Cayapa reservation have access to medium- and long-term investment
credit. Under the project, IERAC would speed up and complete land surveys as well
as granting of land titles (para 4.09). Also, the project would address itself to
solving the problems of settlers occupying the forestry concession (para 4.10).
Population, Employment and Farm Income
3.10      In 1980, there were an estimated 28,000 persons, or about 5,100
families in the project area. The region has been subject to a high immigra-
tion flow. Population has been growing at about a 9% annual rate and is
expected to reach about 43,000 persons, or 7,800 families in 1985. The only
urban center is the town of Quininde (8,000 inhabitants). The remaining
population live scattered in the area on their farms and in small population
clusters. About 80% of the population (4,100 families) have their main source
of income in agriculture. Of them about 2,600 families own land and the
remaining 1,500 are relatives of landholders or transient workers. The
employment situation of    the project is characteristic of newly settled
areas. Although available family labor is not fully used, people tend to stay
on the farm because of seasonally uneven labor requirements and because means
of transportation are limited, making access to other areas difficult. The
few larger farms, including the existing oil palm plantation, that require
hired labor, normally provide food and lodging as well as salaries, and hired
laborers tend to live in the immediate vicinity of those estates. Year-round
unemployment is therefore not a problem. Expected increased demand for labor
as a result of the project would provide employment to the increasing population
of the area. Although farm sizes are relatively large, incomes are still low,
because farms have not yet been fully developed. Annual average per capita
income among farmers with land-holdings up to 50 ha range from about US$173 to
US$377 and it is estimated to be about US$230 among landless workers. The
current estimated absolute poverty level for Ecuador is US$315.



- 13 -
3.11      Basic education, health and general standard of living of the
population leave much to be desired. A reported 44% of the adult population
have not had any formal instruction, and a good number among the remaining
56% are functionally illiterate. Also about 30% of the people under age 15
are illiterate and do not attend primary school regularly. General and
infant mortality rates are above the national averages. Gastro-intestinal
infections, worm infections, tetanus in mothers and newborns, pneumonia
and other respiratory disorders are endemic. Most of the population suffer
from protein and calorie deficiency and malnutrition, especially children.
Housing conditions are rather poor and there are no sanitary facilities
whatsoever. Only the town of Quininde has a rather inefficient water supply
and sewer system.
3.12      Farmers' organizations are weak.  There are six cooperatives
which were established with the purpose of obtaining land titles from
IERAC. There are also a number of transitory associations aiming at the
attainment of basic services such as roads and schools.
Agricultural Services
3.13      Agricultural Extension.  The project falls within the jurisdic-
tion of the MAG's PIDA Quininde, which has overall responsibility for agri-
culture extension in the area. Also, the MAG's national programs of animal
health, cacao, coffee and banana operate in the area. However, the PIDA and
the national programs are inadequately staffed and ill equipped and lack funds
to operate. Hence, work with farmers, mainly with spontaneous settlers, is
very limited.
3.14      Agricultural Research.  The project area is well supported by
agricultural research work carried out by INIAP in the Pichilingue and
Santo Domingo (La Concordia) stations. For coffee and cacao, INIAP has
developed improved cultural practices and simple inexpensive techniques
and equipment for processing beans and for propagating high yielding cacao
and coffee clones. INIAP has developed high production grazing systems with
sown grass-legume mixed pastures for dual-purpose beef and milk production.
For swine production, INIAP has been working on a semi-intensive fattening
operation with crop residues of oil palm, banana, plantain and roots. All
these production packages have been documented and published in a number
of bulletins and pamphlets and would be the basis for the extension program
under the proposed project (Annex 2).
3.15      Agricultural Credit.  The BNF branch of Quininde, established
in 1976, is the only source of agricultural and other credit for the
project and surrounding areas. About 70% of its loans have been for
livestock operations and only 25% have been made to farmers in the project
area. The operational capabilities of this branch satisfy the volume of
operations it now handles (about US$1.1 million equivalent per year). But
it would have to be strengthened to manage the agricultural credit program to
be carried out under the project, especially considering that it would be
directed mainly to settlers with little credit experience.



- 14 -
3.16      Marketing.  Marketing of forest and agriculture products is carried
out through private millers and middlemen operating in the area. The millers
buy standing trees from the settlers and saw and market the wood. Farmers
sell green cacao and coffee beans to small-scale traders in Quininde. The
traders dry and process the beans and market them in the export ports of
Guayaquil and Manta. Cattle are usually bought on the farm by small-scale
traders, mainly for local consumption.
Existing Infrastructure
3.17      Roads.  The three large rivers crossing the project area divide it
into four geographical zones. These rivers, while providing natural access
also are barriers for road communication among the zones. Road access to the
project is provided by the Santo Domingo-Esmeraldas highway bordering the
western end of the project. A bridge over the Blanco river at Quininde and a
number of gravel and dirt roads give access to Zone I, the largest, located
between the Blanco and Guayllabamba rivers; the Cupa Malimpia gravel road, and
three low standard penetration roads provide access to Zone II, located
between the Blanco river and the highway. Zone III between the Guayllabamba
and Canande rivers and Zone IV to the north of the latter can be reached by
boat only. Altogether, there are some 114 km of gravel roads in the area,
and some 40 km of timber tracks. Road engineering and construction work are
very poor, and, except for those roads built by an oil palm company operating
in the area, roads have irregular alignments, no drainage structures or side
ditches, and irregular surfaces because of poor grading of gravel material.
These shortcomings make most of the road network passable only during the dry
season.
3.18      Social Infrastructure.  Health facilities consist of one hospital
and two subcenters, but the scattered population has little access to primary
health care and except for Quininde's limited services, there are no water
supply and sanitary facilities. There are 56 primary schools and four high
schools. The schools are, in general, adequately staffed but some classrooms
need to be repaired and additional ones have to be built to cope with the
demand of increasing population. Since the project area is in the process of
being settled, small villages are springing up requiring minimal physical
infrastructure for basic services.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Identification and Preparation
4.01      A Bank mission exploring the possibilities for rural development
in Ecuador made a preliminary identification of a project to be located
in the Esmeraldas province in 1975. Based upon a four-year INERHI-OAS study
of the Esmeraldas river basin, the Government proposed to the Bank, among
five projects identified within the basin, the development of the so-called
"Zona Cuadrangular" north of Santo Domingo de los Colorados and east of
Quininde, covering an area of about 150,000 ha, within which the proposed
project is located. Future development stages would include additional



- 15 -
areas within the same general region. Project preparation was carried out
by an interinstitutional group directed by MAG, with the participation of OAS
staff and assisted by the IBRD-FAO Cooperative Program. The feasibility study
was completed and submitted to the Bank in July 1980. Complementary aerial
photography and mapping of the area are in the process of contracting and
execution under Loan 1230-EC. A Bank mission appraised the project in November
1980.
B. Project Objectives and Brief Description
4.02      The project would use an integrated approach to the solution of
production problems and the provision of social services to the population
living in the area. Implementation of an agriculture development program
reinforcement and further construction of basic infrastructure and provision
of basic education and health services are expected to increase agriculture
production and productivity and raise the health and education status and the
standard of living of about 5,100 families in the project area. This approach
is justified for this project, considering the pioneer stage of development of
the area and the weakness of Government services in the zone.
4.03      The  proposed project's main components would be:
(a) the execution of an agricultural development program to
be carried out by an extension service and designed to
(i) support agriculture production and marketing pri-
marily among farmers with landholdings up to 50 ha; and
(ii) encourage and promote farmer organizations and farmer
training;
(b) completion of land titling procedures for about 900 farms
and execution of land surveys over about 31,000 ha and
provision of land titles to some 1,150 farmers;
(c) provision of medium- to long-term investment credit and
short-term production credit to about 1,210 farmers,
mainly for rehabilitation of coffee and cacao and
livestock development;
(d) upgrading of 128 km of existing roads and construction
of 102 km of new ones; construction of a 100-m bridge
over the Guayllabamba river and a 40-m bridge over the
Cupa river; and implementation of a road maintenance
program, including purchase of maintenance equipment;
(e) construction of service centers, including an administrative
center, four marketing facilities and eight community centers;
(f) establishment of a primary health care program, including
training of auxiliary and professional health workers, con-
struction and equipment of health facilities, and construction
of water supply systems for small villages;



- 16 -
(g) strengthening of elementary education in the project area,
including construction and equipment of school facilities
and provision of additional teachers; and
(h) execution of feasibility study for a new rural development
project in the Esmeraldas Province.
The project would be implemented over a period of six years (see Chart 22621)
under the responsibility of SEDRI, which has established a Project Executing
Unit (UE).
C. Detailed Features
Agricultural Development and Extension
4.04      The proposed project would support agricultural development of
the area by promoting adequate soil use, expanding production and increasing
productivity. Agriculture development would basically consist of (a) re-
habilitation and renovation of coffee, cacao and plantain/banana plantations
and improvement of production and processing practices for these and annual
crops; (b) improvement and expansion of pasture lands, increasing stocking
rates and enhancing cattle management among farmers with 10 to 50 ha;
(c) support of hog fattening operations among farmers with less than 10 ha;
and (d) promotion of soil conservation and forestry practices. These would be
achieved mainly through the execution of an agricultural extension program and
through provision of agricultural credit. The extension program would work
two ways: (i) replacing traditional agricultural practices (para 3.07) by
introducing and disseminating agriculture production techniques already
developed by INIAP in the nearby Pichilingue and Santo Domingo and other
research stations in the country (para 3.14), and (ii) encouraging and pro-
moting organizations of farmers and training them in agriculture and social
matters. Details of agriculture production techniques are presented in the
relevant working papers and INIAP's publications listed in Annex 2.
4.05      The rehabilitation of coffee, cacao, bananas and other perennials
would include opening or closing the canopy, pruning, spraying for disease
and pest control, and fertilizing and hand pollination (for cacao). Renova-
tion would involve replacing the very poor cacao and coffee tree shrubs with
high yielding clones or selected seedlings available at the Pichilingue
research station. Farmers would be taught how to properly depulp and dry
coffee beans, as well as how to properly ferment and cure cacao beans on the
farms. This would greatly improve the product quality and facilitate marketing.
Also, for coffee as well as for cacao, farmers would be advised to improve and
construct drying and processing facilities on the farm.
4.06      With regard to cattle, farmers would be assisted in developing semi-
intensive dual-purpose meat and milk operations. Existing pasture lands would
be improved.  Cleared lands would be sown to guinea grass (Panicum maximum),
which is well adapted to the area. Construction of fences, corrals and other
farm structures to facilitate cattle management would be encouraged. Stocking
of existing and new pasture lands would be done with pregnant cross-bred
heifers (Zebu-European) available in the surroundings of the project area.
Management practices would mainly consist of rotational grazing, use of
mineral supplements, and parasite and disease control. Also, in livestock,



- 17-
the extension program would support semi-intensive hog fattening operations,
mainly among farmers with less than 10 ha. Hogs would be fed mainly with
locally produced plantain and banana residues, supplemented with high protein
and mineral feeds. To improve health and management practices, financing
would be available for construction of simple fattening facilities with
inexpensive local materials, establishment of improved pasture areas, and
purchase of piglets and supplementary feed and medicines. Piglets would be
provided by the nearby INIAP research station of La Concordia and by MAG's
Santo Domingo swine breeding center, which is being rehabilitated and provided
with fresh breeding stock under the Bank-financed Puerto Ila Chone Project.
Additional information on this matter is presented in working paper No. 1.
4.07      Regarding conservation, the extension program would see that
ongoing settlement and agricultural development cause minimal detrimental
impact to the environment. In the clearing process, farmers would be induced
to exploit all commercially useable wood and to avoid burning the left-
overs. Young valuable trees would be maintained to provide shade and for
future utilization. Besides, farmers would be recommended to maintain
part of their farms in forest, to protect river banks and steep land and to
ensure permanent supply of posts and firewood. On a pilot basis, the exten-
sion program would try to develop forest management practices. This would
include selective exploitation of softwood, maintaining young valuable trees
and planting small plots of fast-growing exotic species. Seedlings for these
plantings would be made available by MAG's forestry nurseries of Santo
Domingo (being improved under the Puerto Ila Chone Project) and of Quininde.
4.08      With respect to social promotion, training and organization of
farmers, the extension program would include seminars and courses for farmers
on community development, farm management, record keeping and other relevant
subjects. Existing informal organizations of farmers would be strengthened
and encouraged to play a more active role in decision-making and marketing
and processing of agricultural produce. Special emphasis would be given to
promote participation of women in the project. They would be helped to
organize and to obtain financing for income-generating activities such as
cheese production.
Land Titling
4.09      The project would seek to provide firm land titles to all farmers
in the area. About 1,000 farmers who have already received provisory titles
would be assisted to complete the process to obtain firm titles. Topographic
surveys would be carried out and land titles would be granted over some
additional 1,100 farms covering about 31,000 ha, including those within the
area of the forestry concession (para 3.08). IERAC would also monitor closely
changes in land tenure and would prevent, within its legal authority, the
subdivision of land parcels into uneconomic units. Annex 1, Table 3 shows
details of the land titling program.
4.10      While the forestry concession contract referred to in paragraph 3.08
is in effect, land titling would not be accessible to settlers living in the
concession area. The Government is in the process of rescinding this contract,
an action which is expected to take about one year. However, until the process



- 18 -
6s completed, the concession area would be excluded from the project for
all purposes. Assurances in this matter were obtained at negotiations.
Feeder Roads
4.11      Civil Works.  An improvement of the existing road network is nec-
essary to provide permanent access to the zones into which the project is
divided.  Basically, the improved network would consist of two main roads
parallel to the rivers, complemented with lateral roads providing access to the
settlement areas. Under the project, 128 km of existing feeder roads and dirt
tracks would be improved and an additional 102 km would be built to provide
for a basic all-weather network of 230 km, exclusive of private roads. Also
to be built would be a 100-m bridge over the Guayllabamba river and a 40-m
bridge over the Cupa river. The roads would be built or improved to MOP's
design standards developed under the Fifth Highways Project. Improvement
works would consist of meeting the minimum requirements for permanent access,
including road widening and graveling, and construction of drains, culverts
and bridges as well as of road embankments in low-lying terrain. Engineering
designs of about 60 km of road improvement for the first construction year are
under execution; the remaining 170 km of engineering designs would be carried
out during implementation. Information on design criteria and on the roads
included in the network is presented in Annex 1, Tables 4, 5 and 6. Additional
information is presented in working paper No. 2. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that the feeder roads included in the project would be improved
and constructed in accordance with engineering design standards as shown in
Annex 1, Table 6.
4.12      Road Maintenance.  In addition to construction, the project would
support the organization and establishment of a road maintenance system in
the project area, including purchase of the necessary equipment (para 5.08).
A tentative list of this equipment is presented in Annex 1, Table 7.
Service Centers
4.13      The project would provide for the construction of buildings for
Project headquarters, four marketing facilities and eight community centers.
Project headquarters would be located at Quininde and would consist of about
240 m2 of office space and about 800 m2 of living quarters for staff, as
well as internal roads, electricity, water supply and other services. One of
the marketing centers, also located in Quininde, would be for marketing and
processing of coffee and cacao. It would consist of civil works buildings and
equipment for depulping coffee and cherries and for drying coffee and cacao
beans. There would also be a storage warehouse with 110 m tons capacity. The
other three would be public markets, each consisting of a central building for
offices and storage and open space for merchants. These centers would be
located in Quininde, Malimpia and Renovacion. The community centers would
provide space for operation of basic services. The facilities to be included
in each community center would basically consist of a meeting hall and office
space for :-he local authority, the agriculture extension service and the
cooperative. Also, as the case may be, the health posts to be established
under the project (para 4.14) would be integrated into the centers. Designs



- 19 -
of all centers are at the preliminary stage; final designs are currently being
prepared and would be ready by December 1981. Construction would be done,
making the best possible use of locally available materials and with the
beneficiaries providing unskilled labor.
Health Care
4.14      The project would support Government's efforts to establish in the
area a regional health service in line with the national health regionalization
system (para 2.15). Emphasis would be on increasing and improving primary health
care services through training and deployment of rural health promoters and active
participation of the community, mainly women and children, in primary health and
nutritional education. The Quininde hospital would be rehabilitated and equipped
and two new health subcenters and seven health posts would be built and equipped.
To the extent possible, the health posts would be made part of the community
centers to be constructed under the project (para 4.13). On-the-job and
external training courses would be given to medical and paramedical staff,
and administration and management of the service would be strengthened.
Besides health care, the project would provide for the implementation of a
survey on the nutritional value of locally produced foods and their place in
the local diet and of the nutritional status of preschool children. This
would be the basis for a nutrition program, also to be implemented under the
project, which would include promoting better use of locally produced foods
and executing a family garden subprogram.
Sanitation
4.15      Sanitary conditions of the population would be improved by
constructing water supply facilities and sanitary units for villages and for
the scattered rural households. Two water supply systems with household
connections would be established in villages with projected population
higher than 500 inhabitants. About 15 "water units" would be built in
population clusters, generally in the same places where community centers
would be established. One or more units would be erected in each cluster
according to its population. The units would be water-fed from shallow wells
equipped with hand pumps and would include lavatories, showers and laundries.
For the scattered rural population, some 21 wells operated with hand pumps
would be built, each well serving an average of 10 families. On a pilot basis,
the project would also support construction of about 945 household sanitary units
of the latrine-pit and latrine-with-running-water types. Water and sewage units
would be built in accordance with IEOS's typical designs, which are adequate.
Elementary Education
4.16      Under the proposed project, the primary education system of the
area would be strengthened and provided with necessary facilities and staff
to satisfy the needs of the increasing population. During the implementation
period, school attendance rates would be raised from 91% to 95%, while attaining
a 1:35 teacher-to-pupil ratio and an average 40 pupils per schoolroom. This
would be achieved by creating 12 new teacher positions, rehabilitating 21
of the existing 105 schoolrooms, constructing 55 new schoolrooms, providing
equipment and teaching materials for existing and new schoolrooms, constructing
55 living quarters for teachers, and constructing 55 sanitary units. Buildings
and sanitary units would be constructed in accordance with MEC and IEOS
architectural and engineering standard designs, which are adequate.

D. Project Costs
4.17       Total project costs amount to US$49.0 million, including a foreign
exchange component of US$13.6 million, or 28%. Base cost, calculated at
December 1980 prices, is estimated at US$28.9 million, physical contingencies
at US$3.3 million, and price contingencies at US$16.8 million. Cost of
feeder roads and other civil works are based upon feasibility study and
participating agencies estimates, adjusted by the appraisal mission. Main-
tenance cost for feeder roads is based on unit prices developed under the
on-going technical assistance program included in the Fourth Highways Project.
Costs of road maintenance equipment, vehicles and other imported goods are
estimated CIF Ecuadoran port. Average fees for consultants are estimated at
US$10,000 per man-month, including salaries, travel and living expenses.
Project costs include identifiable taxes, estimated at US$0.4 million, but
exclude import duties. Physical contingencies are estimated at 15% for all
civil works and 10% for equipment, salaries and operating costs. Price
contingencies were estimated: for foreign exchange costs at 9% for 1981,
8.5% for 1982, 7.5% for 1983 through 1985, and 6% for 1986 onward and for
local costs at 18% for 1981, 15% for 1982 through 1984, and 12% for 1985
onward. Total project costs and schedule of investments are presented in
Annex 1, Tables 8 through 14, and summarized below:

E. Financing
4.18      The Bank loan of US$17.0 million would finance 35% of total project
cost, covering US$13.6 million in foreign exchange, plus US$3.4 million local
costs; financing of local costs is justified on project grounds, because of
the low foreign exchange. The Government, through regular budgetary alloca-
tions to FONADRI would finance US$26.1 million, or 53% of total project
costs, and the beneficiaries would finance US$5.9 million, or about 12%. The
loan would be made to the Government of Ecuador for 17 years, including four
years of grace. The proposed financing plan is detailed in Annex 1, Table 15
and summarized below.

F. Procurement
4.19      Civil works amount to US$6.7 million, comprising feeder roads
(US$4.6 million), buildings for service centers, (US$0.7 million), health
subcenters and posts (US$0.4 million), water supply systems (US$0.2 million)
and schools (US$0.8 million). Because of their relatively low cost and
scattered location, contracts are expected to be of low size and unlikely
to be attractive to foreign contractors; local contractors' building capacity,
moreover, is adequate for the needs of the project. However, to encourage
competition and to facilitate Bank supervision, assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the following procedures would be followed: (a)
contracts for construction and improvement of feeder roads and bridges would
be awarded following LCB procedures currently being applied in the ongoing
Sixth Highways Project; the roads would be grouped in lots with an estimated
cost of not less than US$500,000 each in accordance with availability of
engineering designs and geographic location; (b) for works other than feeder
roads, contracts costing in excess of US$150,000 equivalent would be procured
under LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank and would be reviewed by the Bank
before award; and (c) other works costing less than US$150,000 equivalent and
in the aggregate not more than US$1,000,000 could be carried out by force
account or contracts awarded following local procedures and in accordance with
annual construction and procurement plans satisfactory to the Bank.
4.20      Goods purchased under the project would amount to US$1.6 million
and comprise vehicles (US$200,000); topographical, medical, and office equipment
(US$610,000); and road maintenance equipment (US$790,000). Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that procurement procedures would be as follows:
(a) all operation and maintenance equipment, vehicles and other goods costing
US$150,000 equivalent or more would be purchased following ICB procedures; and
(b) goods costing US$150,000 or less but more than US$50,000 and in the aggregate
not more than US$400,000 would be purchased following local procedures, provided
that no less than three quotations are obtained; and (c) goods costing US$50,000
or less and in the aggregate not more than US$200,000 could be purchased through
negotiated contracts from established and reliable suppliers.
G. Disbursements
Amount of
Disbursements
(US$ '000)
4.21      The proposed loan would be disbursed as follows:
Category I        45% of total expenditures for engineering and
construction of civil works and buildings for:
(a) feeder roads; (b) service centers; (c) health
subcenters and posts; (d) water supply systems;
and (e) schools.
(i) under contracts awarded through
competitive bidding; and                     4,000



- 23 -
(ii) under force account or
negotiated contracts                            700
Category II       100% of foreign exchange, or 80% of local currency
expenditures, for: (a) purchase of vehicles and
equipment for the UE, the extension service, the
land titling program, maintenance of feeder roads,
health subcenters and posts and schools; and
(b) materials for the agricultural extension and
medical care training programs and for the nutrition
program.                                                 2,100
Category III      100% of foreign exchange, or 45% of local currency
expenditures, for: (a) training courses for project
staff and farmers under the agricultural extension
and medical care programs; and (b) consultants'
fees, travel and living allowances.                      1,200
Category IV       55% of medium- and long-term subloans disbursed
by BNF to finance on-farm investments, household
improvements, and materials for sanitary units.          7,400
Category V        Unallocated.                                             1,600
4.22      Disbursements would be made against normal documentation except
for works carried out by force account, medium- and long-term subloans made
by BNF and local training courses for project staff and beneficiaries, which
would be made against statements of expenditure (SOEs). Disbursement applica-
tions based on SOEs would be signed by an appropriate representative of the
executing agencies concerned and be accompanied by an annex showing a sum-
marized breakdown of payments for: (a) civil works by force account; (b) cost
of training courses including fees, travel expenses, materials and per diem;
and (c) detail of subloans under the credit component. Documents showing
evidence of payment would not be submitted to the Bank but would be maintained
by the executing agencies or the UE for further review by Bank staff during
supervision missions. SOEs would be audited as indicated in paragraph 5.17.

V.   ORGANIZATION, MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization
Project Executing Unit
5.01      Overall responsibility for project implementation would rest with
SEDRI, which would enter into implementation agreements (para 5.12) for each
component with the related ministries and Government participating agencies.
By presidential decree, a Project Executing Unit (UE) has been established
within SEDRI, with adequate operational, financial, and administrative autonomy
to execute the project. The UE has its headquarters at Quininde, and it would
be fully staffed and operational no later than March 1, 1982. It would be
headed by a Project Director, a senior professional recruited with qualifica-
tions and under terms of employment acceptable to the Bank and who would
report directly to the secretary of rural development. An Advisory Committee
made up of representatives of the provincial and local authorities and of the
participating agencies would advise the Director in general project planning
and implementation matters. The committee would meet at least once every six
months in Quininde. It would not have decision making authority.



- 25 -
5.02      In implementing the project, the Director would be supported by
several staff and line offices. Attached to the office of the Director
would be a Planning and Monitoring, an Internal Auditing and a Legal section.
The Departments of Production, Campesino Development and Engineering would be
responsible for operations. The Department of Production would be responsible
for implementing the agriculture extension program (para 5.04) and for super-
vising the credit (para 5.15) and land titling (para 5.07) programs. The
Campesino Development Department would be responsible for the organization of
farmers' part of the extension service, promoting and establishing the organiza-
tion of the service centers and supervising the health and education programs
The Engineering Department would be responsible for contracting and supervising
construction of the service centers and for coordinating implementation of the
infrastructure aspects of the project. An Administrative and Service Depart-
ment would complete the organizational structure of the UE. Details on staffing
and operating costs and of the organization structure of the UE are presented
in Annex 1, Tables 10(a) and 10(b). Suitable assurances on the operation of
the UE were obtained at negotiations.
Consultants
5.03      Project implementation would be supported by internationally recruited
specialists. One specialist would assist the Project Director in the organiza-
tion and management of the UE for 24 months. Another specialist would assist
the UE for 24 months in agricultural marketing aspects, including the organiza-
tion of a Farmers Marketing Union and the establishment of the marketing
centers and processing facilities for coffee, cacao and milk. Also, 24 man-
months of short-term specialists would be used to assist the UE for initial and
follow-up assistance in project-related matters such as monitoring and evaluation
(para 5.18), establishment of project accounts and farm planning and management.
Besides, other specialists contracted under the Puerto Ila Chone project, would
support the UE in the establishment of the agriculture extension services and the
development of technological packages for coffee, cacao and livestock. All
experts would be internationally recruited and contracted under terms of
reference and conditions of employment acceptable to the Bank. The two first
mentioned experts would be employed not later than September 30, 1982.
Assurances in these matters were obtained at negotiations. Finally SEDRI would
utilize about 36 man-months of specialists to assist in the preparation of the
feasibility study for a new rural development project (para 5.11).
B. Implementation
Agriculture Extension Service
5.04      To implement the agricultural extension and farmers' organization
program, an extension service would be established in the UE. The service
would be staffed by personnel seconded by MAG and INIAP and would be operated
by the UE's Departments of Production and Organization of Farmers. It would
be headed by a senior agriculturist and staffed by six subject matter
specialists in livestock, coffee, cacao, forestry, social communications and
marketing, and 16 extension agents and six social promoters. The extension
staff would implement the extension program by: (a) working directly with



- 26 -
individual farmers and groups of farmers; (b) holding demonstrations at
selected sites in the project area and at the nearby research station;
(c) conducting training courses for farmers in matters related to
organization, farm management and other relevant subjects; and (d) in
cooperation with BNF, assisting farmers in the preparation of farm development
plans and corresponding credit applications (para 5.16). Each extension agent
would be working with a group of about 150 farmers. Training courses for
extension agents, credit supervisors and inspectors and farmers would be
carried out by INIAP. The courses would take place mainly in the Santo
Domingo and Pichilingue Research Station under curricula prepared by INIAP and
MAG staff and consultants. Lecturers would be INIAP staff and subject matter
specialists, externally recruited and financed by the project. Extension
staff would also be sent abroad to universities and other institutions to
receive on-the-job and academic training on selected subjects. During negotia-
tions, assurances were obtained that the extension service would be established
and that the head of the service, the subject matter specialists and no less
than 10 extension agents would be employed no later than March 31, 1982.
Service Centers
5.05      Implementation of this component would also be the responsibility
of the UE. Construction of the centers would be carried out through contracts
supervised by the UE's engineering department. Marketing facilities for
coffee and cacao would be operated by the Farmers Marketing Central to be
established under the project (para 6.05). The Public Markets would be
operated by the local authorities and the community centers by each community
concerned. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, before start-
ing construction of each of the marketing and community centers, the organization
responsible for operating and maintaining the respective center had been estab-
lished and was satisfactory to the Bank.
Land Titling
5.06      IERAC would carry out the land titling program through its Quininde
zonal office. For this purpose IERAC would, no later than January 31, 1982:
(a) reinforce its field staff working in the project area, where it is made up
of at least, a coordinator, one lawyer, four promoters, four land surveyors,
two draftsmen, and auxiliary staff; and (b) establish within the Quininde
zonal office a department responsible for recording and following up land
titling. Assurances on these matters were obtained during negotiations.



- 27 -
Feeder Roads
5.07      MOP and the Esmeraldas Provincial Council (CPE) would be charged
with the responsibility for the feeder roads program. MOP would prepare
bridges and feeder roads engineering designs through consultants, and would
contract and supervise construction of the long-span bridges. CPE would
contract and supervise construction of roads, assisted by MOP's Feeder Roads
Coordination Unit established under the Bank-financed Sixth Highways Project.
Execution of the feeder roads maintenance program would be modeled along the
same lines established for other provinces under the Sixth Highways Project;
CPE would be responsible for implementing the program, assisted by and in
accordance with MOP standards; and maintenance equipment provided under the
project (para 4.12) would be purchased and owned by MOP, but operated and
maintained by CPE. Assurances on this were obtained during negotiations.
Health Care
5.08      MSP would be responsible for planning and operating the health
program. MSP would declare the project area a pilot area for testing the
national health regionalization program and, no later than June 30, 1982
appoint an area coordinator reporting to the Esmeraldas Province Health
Service to supervise implementation of the program. The Quininde hospital
would be the referral center for secondary care and would provide technical
support to the health subcenters and posts. To ensure adequate field coverage
and operation of the existing and new facilities, MSP would contract at least
two additional doctors, 10 auxiliary nurses and 12 health promoters, as
needed during implementation. The chief nurse would schedule and supervise the
work of auxiliaries and rural health promoters. She would also coordinate
implementation of the school health program ("ants operation") with school
directors. All health staff would be given on-the-job and external training
in community organization, primary health care, health statistics, epidemiology
and health administration. A simple but efficient information system would
be established to monitor progress and evaluate impact of the program on the
beneficiaries. During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the afore-
mentioned organization and staffing of the health program.
Sanitation
5.09      IEOS would construct health subcenters and posts and water supply
facilities and would assist farmers in the construction of sanitary units.
Health centers and posts would be constructed through contracts.  Water facili-
ties would be built mainly by force account, with the communities contributing
in kind, labor or cash no less than 20% of the cost of construction. Operation
of each water system would be the responsibility of the respective beneficiaries,
who, before starting construction, would establish an administrative committee
and would commit themselves to pay for all operation and maintenance costs.
Assurances on these matters were obtained at negotiations. Construction of the
household sanitary units would be carried out by the beneficiaries assisted by
IEOS. Financing of materials and equipment for these units would be made avail-
able by BNF under the long-term agricultural credit program.



- 28 -
Elementary Education.
5.10      MEC would be responsible for the elementary education program.
Construction of schoolrooms and other facilities would be carried out under
contract with the CPE. As required during implementation, MEC would appoint
12 additional teachers to satisfy the needs of increased coverage.
Feasibility Study
5.11      SEDRI would prepare assisted by consultants recruited under the
project, a feasibility study for a new rural development project in the
Esmeraldas Province. The study would include, inter alia, collection and
analysis of socioeconomic and base resource data, formulation of an agri-
cultural development plan, and planning and design of engineering and
architectural infrastructure works. Terms of reference for the study and
for the consultants would be prepared and submitted to the Bank for approval
no later than December 31, 1983. Assurances in this respect were obtained
during negotiations.
Implementation Agreements
5.12      To ensure participation, SEDRI would, under its charter, enter into
five implementation agreements (Convenios) with the participating agencies,
except BNF, as follows: with MAG and INIAP for agricultural extension, with
IERAC for land titling, with MOP and CPE for feeder roads, with MEP and IEOS
for health and sanitation and with MEC and CPE for elementary education.
Each agreement would inter alia spell out: (a) scope, cost and schedule of
investments of the relevant project component; (b) financial arrangements,
defining which parts of the investment and project costs would be financed
by SEDRI and which by the agencies with their own resources; (c) procedures
for transferring local and Bank funds to the agencies; and (d) responsibili-
ties of the agencies with regard to participation in the UE preparation of
annual investment plans, provision of required staff and services, procurement,
reporting, and accounts and auditing. The signing of each agreement under terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank would-be a condition of disbursement
under the relevant project component.
C. Project Funding
5.13      Project funds would be channeled through FONADRI (para 2.01), in
which SEDRI would establish a special project account. To ensure timely
availability of resources, the Government would transfer an amount of US$500,000
equivalent to establish a revolving fund in the special project account. The
funds would be at the disposition of the Project Director, who, in accordance
with implementation plans, would transfer funds to the participating agencies.
As the revolving fund is expended, it would be replenished on a quarterly basis
with Bank loan disbursements and Government counterpart funds in accordance
with budgetary allocations for the project. SEDRI would directly request loan
disbursements from the Bank. Assurances on this matter were obtained during
negotiations. Establishment and Government's first funding of the project
special account would be a condition of loan effectiveness.



- 29 -
D. Lending Terms and Conditions for Agricultural Credit
5.14      Agricultural credit would be made available through BNF to finance
investments and production. Medium- to long-term credit would finance rehabili-
tation and renovation of cacao, coffee, plantain/banana and tree crops; pasture
development; breeding cattle; construction of on-farm facilities for livestock
and processing of cacao and coffee beans; and house improvement and materials
for household sanitary facilities. Short-term credit would finance farm
operation and maintenance costs, production of annual crops and pig fattening
operations. It is expected that about 1,210 farmers with land holdings up to
75 ha would obtain credit during the project implementation period. Farm
investments are estimated at US$12.4 million, of which about US$9.0 million, or
73%, would be covered by medium- and long-term credit and the remaining portion
by the beneficiaries. Short-term production credit requirements are estimated
at US$0.6 million.
5.15      Lending terms and grace periods would be as set forth in the
technical and financial farm plans and are expected to vary between three
and 12 years, including grace periods of one to three years. Subloans to
small-scale farmers would finance up to 90% of investment costs exclusive of
family labor, with the remainder contributed by the small-scale farmer in cash
or labor. For the purpose of the project, small-scale farmers are defined
as those with land holdings of up to 40 ha and with total net assets of less
than S/750,000 (US$30,000), including land but excluding houses and whose
principal source of income is the farm for which the sub-loan is made. Sub-
loans for beneficiaries with land holdings up to 75 ha, would finance up to
80% toward investment costs. Not less than 50% of the total amount of
subloans would go to small-scale farmers. The minimum annual interest rates
(including charged commissions allowed by the Monetary Board regulations)
would be 12% for small-scale farmers and 15% for other beneficiaries.
Inflation between 1977 and 1979 averaged 11% and rose to 13% in 1980; for
1981 inflation is expected to be in the 15% to 20% range because of drastic
increases in the price of gasoline, and it is expected to remain around
15% from 1982 onwards. The country's maximum legal interest rate for all
sectors is currently 12% for short-term lending and 15% for medium- and
long-term operations, with commissions of 1% to 2% allowed. Bank-financed
projects (Agriculture Credit and Tungurahua Rural Developments) provide
for 11% interest rate for subloans to small-scale farmers and 14% for
others. Thus, the interest rates proposed for this and the recently
negotiated Puerto Ila Chone project represent a further step in closing
the gap between general interest rates and the slightly higher inflation
most recently experienced by Ecuador. Furthermore, the Government, in
consultation with the Bank, would review not later than one year after loan
signature and at least once a year thereafter the interest rates and other
charges on subloans and if necessary revise them in line with relevant changes
in the rate of inflation. Bank loan and local counterpart funds for medium-
and long-term credit would be made available to BNF by the Government on the
same repayment terms as the Bank loan; however, Bank funds would be made
available in Sucres and would bear interest at the same rate as the Bank loan,
while counterpart funds would be interest-free. The resulting blend of funds
would permit BNF to relend at a margin of at least 6%, which is adequate to
cover administrative costs and financial risks. BNF would finance short-term
credit with its own resources and through rediscounts from the Central Bank.



- 30 -
courses in preparation of farm development plans and credit operations
(para 5.04). For these courses, advantage would be taken of the experience
and material developed by the UE of the Agriculture Credit Project, Loan
1459-EC. The Government and BNF would enter into a Subsidiary Agreement making
Bank and local counterpart funds for agricultural credit available to BNF, and
spelling out the lending terms and conditions of subloans as described before.
Signature of this subsidiary agreement, under terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness. In addition a condition
of disbursement under this component would be that BNF had established guidelines
acceptable to the Bank, for preparing farm development plans and credit appli-
cations in coordination with the extension service.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.17      Separate project accounts, with appropriate subsidiary accounts
for each project component, would be maintained by the UE and each partici-
pating agency, respectively. These accounts, maintained according to sound
accounting principles consistently applied, would reflect receipts and expen-
ditures undertaken in relation to the project and clearly identify the goods
and services procured and works performed. These accounts would be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and said audit
reports, together with certified copies of the audited accounts and auditor's
observation thereon, would be submitted to the Bank within five months of the
close of the fiscal year. Each audit report would include, as applicable, a
separate opinion as to whether the procedures relating to the use of statements
of expenditure (para 4.22) were complied with. Assurances on these account-
ing and auditing procedures were obtained during negotiations.
F. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.18      The UE would consistently monitor and evaluate project progress and
its impact through its Office of Planning and Monitoring (OPM). With Bank
and consultant assistance and in collaboration with the participating
agencies, OPM would establish and manage an information system for monitoring
physical progress of project components, evaluating the impact of these
components and identifying problems in implementation. Project monitoring
would give particular attention to determining: (a) the performance and
effectiveness of the extension service in reaching farmers and bringing about
increases in agricultural production and productivity; (b) the impact of the
agricultural credit program in bringing about farm improvements and increasing
production; (c) the effectiveness of IERAC in carrying out field work and in
processing legal documents in the land titling program; (d) the impact of the
feeder road network on improving access of agricultural produce to markets;
(e) the impact of medical care, nutrition, sanitation and education programs
on improving health and education status and the standard of living of the
project beneficiaries; and (f) the impact of the project on women. No later
than September 30, 1982 SEDRI would, with consultant assistance, prepare
and submit to the Bank a proposal for operation of the monitoring system.
Assurances on this were obtained at negotiations.

5.19      OPM would prepare and submit to the Bank through the Project
Director semi-annual project progress reports which would: (a) present
in a descriptive and tabular manner the advance of the different project
components; (b) point out problems detected in the monitoring process
and their proposed solution; and (c) present the status of project
investments and financing. Also, at the end of the investment period,
OPM would prepare a project completion report according to Bank guidelines,
and submit it to the Government and the Bank within six months of the
loan closing date. To undertake these tasks, OPM would be staffed with at
least two professionals and support staff with relevant experience in the
subject. Assurances on these matters were obtained at negotiations.
VI AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FARM BENEFITS
Land Use and Cropping Pattern, Farm Models
6.01      No significant increase in cropped area is expected as a result of
implementation of the project, but pasture lands would be substantially
increased. Based on current trends in the project and surrounding areas, it
is projected that most of the newly developed land would be devoted to pasture
and ranching. Soil use of the estimated 76,400 ha in farms under 50 ha would
develop as follows: the area in perennial crops (coffee, cacao and plantain/
banana) would increase from 15,200 ha to 16,500 ha; annual crops (mainly corn
and soybeans) would remain about constant at 700 ha cultivated on a rotational
basis; pasture lands would increase from 5,800 ha to 39,000 ha; and forest
lands would decrease from 54,800 to 19,500 ha. Farm development was analyzed
with three farm models. One model is representative of older farms smaller
than 10 ha, located in the surroundings of Quininde and Malimpia and along
the main highway and river banks. Land use of these farms is and would
continue to be mainly in coffee, cacao and plantain/banana, which would be
improved; also, small-scale fattening operations would be developed in these
farms, by using plantain residues supplemented with high protein and mineral
feeds and by establishing about 0.2 ha of pasture land and handling facilities
for the animals; existing forest areas would be maintained. The other two
models of 27 and 47 ha, respectively, are representative of farms between
10 and 50 ha located in the more recently settled areas. In both types of
farms, existing areas in coffee, cacao and plantain/banana, as well as in food
crops, would remain substantially unchanged but productivity would be improved.
Existing pasture lands covering between 2.4 ha and 10.6 ha would also be
improved, and an additional 12 ha to 22 ha of pasture would be established in
newly cleared lands. Annex 1, Tables 16 through 19 present projected land use
and cropping pattern for the whole project area and the proposed farm models.



- 32 -
Crop Yields, Livestock Coefficients and Production
6.02      Although climatic and soil conditions in the project area are favor-
able (para 3.04), current crop yields are rather low. Perennial and annual
crops are intermixed and planted in a disorderly way, making their management
difficult; improved varieties and selected planting materials and seeds are
not used; few farmers use fertilizers and fungicides or are acquainted with
adequate cultural harvesting and processing practices. The extension program
would direct its efforts toward removal of these constraints (para 4.05) and,
therefore, it is expected that yields would increase substantially. These
practices are already being followed by progressive farmers in the area, and
such increases in yields have been projected conservatively to take place
gradually over a period of eight years up to average levels already being
attained. With rehabilitation and renovation and with the use of fertilizers
and pest and disease control practices it, is projected that: coffee yields
would increase from an average of 0.93 m ton/ha, to 3.4 m ton/ha (cherry
beans), cacao from 0.11 m ton/ha to 0.64 m ton/ha (dry beans), and banana from
5.11 m tons/ha to 23.6 m tons/ha. Likewise, improved management and increased
stocking rates would permit the achievement of good levels of productivity on
pasture lands; technical cattle coefficients are expected to change as follows
in a period of 5 to 12 years: stocking rates, from 1.3 to 1.9 au/ha; calving
rates, from 50% to 70%; adult mortality, from 16% to 3%; calf mortality, from
10% to 6%; lactation periods, from 150 to 200 days; milk production per cow
per day, from 1.5 liters to 3.5 liters; and liveweight (LVWT) gains for
cattle, from 71 to 209 kg. Regarding pig fattening, it is expected that each
farmer would fatten two groups of 10 pigs each per year, from about 23 kg
liveweight (three months old) to about 90 kg liveweight (7.5 months old);
daily liveweight gains are projected at 500 g per day.
6.03      As a result of the above changes, annual agricultural production
in the area would increase by 10,737 m tons of coffee, 1,068 m tons of cacao,
54,400 m ton of banana/plantain, 21.7 million liters of milk, 7,827 m tons
of beef (LVWT), and 828 m tons of pork (LVWT). The aggregated value of this
incremental production would be about US$27.9 million by the 20th year of
the project. Estimated production costs, yield development and volume and
value of costs of production are presented in Annex 1, Tables 16 through
21 and are summarized in the table of page 33.
Prices
6.04      Financial prices for inputs, crops and livestock products to be
produced under the project are those which prevailed in the area in
December 1980. There is in Ecuador a complex system of price controls
and price referencing designed to protect consumers without discouraging
production. However, the system is weak and the Government does not have
the mechanism to enforce it. Therefore, with the exception of milk, prices
of agricultural products, and specifically those produced in the project
area are determined by market conditions. Prices of coffee and cacao are
determined by the international market. There is a 25% export tax on FOB
value of cocoa exports but such a tax is expected to be reduced to 20% in
1981 to promote production and to reduce the impact of lower international
prices. Coffee beans are subject to a 35% export value tax which growers
are requesting the Government to reduce, but no decision has yet been taken.

The price of fresh milk used in the analysis in S/7/ liter which is lower
than the current market price in the project area. This figure is derived
from an ex-factory border price equivalent for reconstituted powdered milk
of S/5.6 plus a 20% premium for fresh milk. Economic prices for traded
commodities (cacao, coffee, corn and meat 1/ were calculated according to
Bank projections adjusted for handling, processing and transportation costs
to reach average farmgate prices. For banana/plantain, economic prices were
assumed to be at prevailing market prices, since the variety produced in the
project is not exportable. Financial and economic prices are presented in
Annex 1, Table 22.
Marketing
6.05      Incremental agricultural production generated by the project
would be marginal in terms of national and world-wide availabilities.
Therefore, it would not have any significant impact on the market, nor
would it have any marketing problems. All production would be locally
marketed at the farm or at Quininde for further distribution to the inter-
national, national and regional markets. Most coffee and cacao production
would be exported; beef and pork production would go to the national urban
centers where demand is growing rapidly. About 6% of milk production
would be consumed on-farm and the rest would be absorbed in the regional
centers of Esmeraldas and Santo Domingo where consumption per capita is
only 45 liters per annum, and where higher incomes and a population growth
rate of about 6% is pushing demand up. It is expected that at full develop-
ment the project will supply a large part of the projected increased
consumption in the region. While expansion in other areas may decrease
prices slightly, this contingency has been allowed for in the price assumpt-
tions (para 6.04). Corn, plantain and other food products would be for
on-farm and local consumption. Middlemen would continue to play an important
role in marketing (para 3.16). However, the project would support the organi-
zation and establishment of a Farmers' Marketing Union which, by intervening
in the market, would aim at improving prices and marketing conditions for
farmers. The Union would be a mixed Government-farmers-owned enterprise.
At the beginning of the project, the Union would deal mainly with cacao and
coffee. It would operate the cacao and coffee marketing and processing center
to be established under the project. Later on, when milk production becomes
important, the Market Union would also establish a milk cooling plant and
acquire refrigerated vehicles for farm pick-up and transport to the regional
processing plants. Furthermore, construction of feeder roads would sub-
stantially improve farmers' access to markets and thereby improve their
bargaining position.
I/   Meat is presently not tradable officially but there are substantial
unofficial imports from neighboring countries due to a fast increase
in consumption.

Farm Benefits
6.06      At full development, execution of the agriculture development
program would have benefited some 2,400 families with farms smaller than
50 ha. Of these, 1,200 are expected to receive credit during the project
implementation period. It is also expected that a significant number of
the remaining farmers would develop their farms during and after the
implementation period either with their own resources or Government credit.
In accordance with the propoqed farn models, farm. incomes are expected to
increase over a period of 10 years between four and seven times, while
the financial rate of return would range from 33% to 69%. The cash flow
projections also show that there would not be a substantial reduction
of family disposable income during the investment period. Annex 1,
Tables 18(b), 19(b) and 20(b) presents the financial analysis of the
farm models, according to which the beneficiaries' farm incomes would
evolve as follows:
Family Income and Financial Rate of Return

1/   Average number of persons per family:  5.5.
2/   At full development, by farm year 10.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      Execution of the project would primarily benefit some 4,100 families
whose main source of income is agriculture. Among them the 2,400 small- to
medium-scale farmers with landholdings up to 50 ha would derive substantial
improvements in income levels and therefore in their standards of living.
Farm development and increased production would generate about 0.95 million
man-days of labor per year (Annex 1, Table 23), leading to full employment
among farmers and providing jobs for the additional families migrating into
the project area. Other families not having their main source of income in
agriculture would also benefit from the project. Increased agriculture produc-
tion and income of farmers would generate demand for services and thereby
create additional jobs in Quininde and in the surroundings of the project
area. Construction of feeder roads and provision of social infrastructure
and services would contribute to improve the standards of living in the area.



- 36 -
About 610 families would have access to water in villages and population
clusters and about 945 families would be served by the construction of house-
hold sanitary units. Further, it is expected that execution of the project
would make a significant contribution   to institution building.  Together
with the ongoing Bank-financed Tungurahua and Puerto Ila Chone projects, it
would support and encourage Government efforts to improve institutional
cooperation and coordination among Government agencies in the implementation
of the national rural development program to which the Government is committed.
For the first time in Ecuador, these three projects are offering to the rural
population, particularly to the small- and medium-scale farmers, a comprehen-
sive package for delivery of agriculture extension and credit services,
coupled with production support and social infrastructure.
Economic Analysis
7.02      The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project has been estimated
at 22% (Annex 1, Table 24) and was derived under the following assumptions:
(a) land development of individual farms would take place over a period
of about four years, and crop yields and livestock productivity improvements
would take place in about six to 10 years as described in the farm models;
(b) agricultural production was calculated under the assumption that about
only 60% of farm land would be developed during the period of annalysis;
(c) costs and benefits were denominated in December 1980 constant prices;
economic prices for traded commodities were based on the Bank projections but
adjusted to farmgate level, while prevailing farmgate prices were used for
other products (Annex 1, Table 24); production costs, except for unskilled
labor were based on local market prices and reflect their respective oppor-
tunity costs given their market structure and current Government policies;
(d) family and hired unskilled labor were shadowed at 70% of market wages for
both agricultural investments and production; (e) the period of analysis was
20 years; (f) border prices used for all tradable and non-tradable commodities
were based on a unit standard conversion factor; and (g) calculations of the
ERR include costs of the UE, feeder roads, service centers and corresponding
physical contingencies; components for which tangible benefits are difficult
to quantify such as health, nutrition, sanitary services and education have
been excluded from the economic rate of return calculations.
7.03      The results of a sensitivity analysis to test the effects on the
ERR of cost overruns and delays or shortfall in benefits are presented in
Annex 1, Tables 24(b) and (c). A delay of one year in benefits would reduce
the ERR to 17%, while a 20% increase in investment costs would lower it to
18%. The switching value test shows that either of each incremental benefits,
or price of coffee, or price of cacao, or price of livestock products should
decrease by 35%, 127%, 399% and 60%, respectively, or investment costs should
increase by 54%, to lower the ERR to the level of the opportunity cost of
capital in Ecuador (12%).
Project Risks
7.04      Implementation of the project does not present major technical
risks. Expected yields and agriculture output are within reasonable ranges
and production techniques are readily available to attain them. The feeder



- 37 -
roads and other production support and social infrastructure are relatively
simple and no technical problems are expected in their construction. Main
project risks would be on the institutional and managerial side. The fact
that SEDRI has been established should, on the one hand, improve interagency
coordination and general project management but, on the other hand, this
institution's lack of experience may create delays, particularly in the
initial stages of the project.  A number of international donors, including
USAID and FAO, are providing technical assistance to SEDRI and it should
contribute to an effective operation of the new agency. With regard to the
participating agencies, previous Bank experience with MAC, BNF and IERAC
indicates that close assistance and supervision would be required to assure
timely execution of their respective project components: extension, credit and
land titling. Strengthening of their local offices and provision of technical
assistance under the project should help to improve the services provided by
these institutions.
Environmental Impact
7.05      Project implementation would try to minimize adverse effects of
ongoing spontaneous settlement to the environment. Particular attention would
be paid to the erosion risk. In the preparation and implementation of farm
development plans, agriculture and forestry extensions agents would disseminate
adequate natural resources utilization and conservation practices. All
clearing would be done by hand to ensure minimum soil disturbance and to maintain
a degree of ground cover during the early establishment of pasture lands.
In addition implementation of the land titling and credit programs would help
farmers to consolidate their settlement, thus preventing excessive subdivision
of land. The extension agents would see to it that the use of fertilizers and
pesticides is limited to those with low toxicity and would stress safety in
application and handling. Construction of water supply systems and sewage
units would improve sanitary conditions, thereby helping to prevent diseases.
Fiscal Impact
7.06      The impact of the project on Government's finance would be minimal.
During the first six years of implementation, the average yearly Government
contribution would be about US$3.4 million, or less than 0.2%, of the 1981
National Budget. After this period, the Government would have to continue
to finance the long-term credit program, as well as the agricultural extension
(about 50% of its initial level), road maintenance, health and primary education
services. Average outlays in this period would amount to US$3.2 million between
years seven and 20, including debt service of the Bank loan. Government revenues
from the project would come almost evenly from recuperation of agricultural
long-term subloans and export taxes for coffee and cocoa. The Government cash
flow from the project shows a deficit up to year eleven and an increasing
surplus from thereon, mainly as a result of export tax revenues (Annex 1,
Table 25). During negotiations assurances were obtained that the Government
would maintain and adequately fund the long-term credit program, and the
extension, road maintenance, health and primary education services as may be
required to fulfill project objectives.

of farm development plans and sub-loan applications in coordination with the
extension service (para 5.16).
8.03      Additional conditions of loan effectiveness would be:
(a) that the Government had established, within FONADRI, a special
project account and revolving fund under the terms spelled out
in paragraph 5.13.
(b) the Government and BNF had entered into a Subsidiary Agreement,
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, making Bank
and local counterpart funds for Agricultural Credit available to
BNF, and spelling out lending terms and conditions of subloans
and guidelines for processing them (para 5.16).
8.04      With the above assurances, the proposed project would constitute
a suitable basis for a Bank loan to the Government of Ecuador for US$17.0
million equivalent for a term of 17 years, including four years of grace,
with interest at the rate prevailing at the time of loan approval.
