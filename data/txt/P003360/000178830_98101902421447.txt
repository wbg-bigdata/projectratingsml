THIRD PORT PROJECT
Development Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:              The Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma
4~~~~~~
Beneficiary:           The Burma Ports Corporation (BPC)
Amount:                Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) 46.4 million
(US$50 million equivalent)
Terms:                 Standard
Relending              20 years including a grace period of 5 years, with
Terms:                 interest at 8.5% per annum.  The Government will bear
the foreign exchange risk.
Project Description:  The proposed project is designed to enable the port of
Rangoon to handle, until about 1990, the projected growth
in international breakbulk and containerized traffic by
improving port efficiency and basic port services. The
project would obviate the need to construct additional
berths and would include: (a) provision of additional
general and containerized cargo handling equipment and
telecommunications equipment to increase throughput of
existing twelve general cargo berths; (b) construction
of a container yard and freight station; (c) improvements
to port area lighting, electrical installations and
pontoon berth repairs; (d) acquisition of two new marine
vessels; (e) renewal and rehabilitation of BPC's exist-
ing service vessels, harbor craft, and navigation aids;
(f) dredger overhaul; and (g) consultants  services and
training of staff.
The risks are not expected to be greater than in similar
projects. Measures have been proposed to minimize delays
in completing civil works and the vessel rehabilitation
program which require considerable managerial and
and technical inputs.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF THE UNION OF BURMA
FOR A THIRD PORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation for a proposed
Development Credit to the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma for
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) 46.4 million (US$50.0 million equivalent) on
standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Port Project. The proposed Credit
amount will be onlent to the Burma Ports Corporation for a term of 20 years,
including five years of grace, at an interest of 8.5% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      The latest economic report entitled, "Burma:  Priorities for
Continued Growth" (Report No. 3852-BA, dated May 7, 1982) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 10, 1982. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.      The present leadership of Burma assumed the responsibilities of
Government (GOB) in 1962 and vested authority in a revolutionary council.
Then, the Constitution was adopted in a nationwide referendum in December
1973, and under it, the Pyithu Hluttaw (People's Assembly) was created with
supreme executive, legislative, and judicial authority. The Burma Socialist
Program Party (BSPP) was confirmed as the only authorized political party.
The Government's guiding philosophy stated in the 1962 document entitled The
Burmese Way to Socialism reflects a combination of traditional Burmese values
and socialist doctrine. Its economic objectives are set out in the Twenty-
Year Plan, which was adopted by the BSPP in 1972 and is being implemented
through a succession of Four-Year Plans. U Ne Win, who had been President
since 1962, announced his resignation just prior to the national election in
November 1981 and was succeeded by U San Yu, former Secretary General of the
BSPP. Insurgency remains a problem, particularly in the hills and border
areas, although there is definitely greater territorial control by the
Government now than at any time since Independence in 1948.
4.      During the 1960s and the early 1970s, the Government made substantial
progress in the attainment of its social and political goals, particularly in
1/ Parts I and II of this report are substantially the same as in the Presi-
dent's Report (Report No. P-3427-BA) dated November 29, 1982 for the Tank
Irrigation Project in Burma. The report was distributed to the Executive
Directors under cover of the Secretary's memorandum IDA/R82-135-L.



-2-
terms of extending public ownership and Burmese control of economic institu-
tions. On the other hand, economic performance suffered over this period,
the major features being slow growth, a fall in domestic savings and a
shrinking of the external sector. In recognition of this poor economic
performance, the Government came up with a new development strategy in 1972
with the publication of the Twenty-Year Plan. The main objectives of the
Plan are to foster economic growth within the context of a socialist system,
to enhance economic strength and self-sufficiency by converting from an
agricultural to an agriculture-based industrial society, to eliminate
unemployment and to reduce income disparities.  The main elements of this
strategy are: (a) to give higher priority initially to the directly produc-
tive sectors, especially to agriculture, forestry, and mining; (b) to make
greater use of aid, trade, and to a lesser extent technical assistance;
(c) to follow a price stabilization program which emphasizes cost reduction,
through increased efficiency in industry and technical change in agriculture;
and (d) introduce work incentives and commercial principles, especially in
the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs).
5.      A wide range of policy reforms followed the publication of the
Twenty-Year Plan. While pricing policy still reflected the desire to provide
basic consumer goods cheaply and to prevent inflation, procurement prices of
a variety of agricultural products were raised substantially to improve the
economic position of the farmer. In industry, the Government increased the
ex-factory prices for many of the SEEs. Meanwhile, the official exchange
rate was devalued and the interest rate on savings deposits raised. In
addition to these pricing reforms the Government introduced a major tax
reform designed to restore the country-s public finance to a sound basis.
6.      In part, as a result of these measures, and in part as a result of
favorable weather and increased capital inflows, GDP during the Second
Four-Year Plan (1974/75-1977/78) increased by an annual average of 4.7%,
compared to 2.7% in the previous decade. Gross fixed capital formation
increased by about 8% per annum in real terms, and domestic savings as a
percent of GDP also increased. The improved budgetary provision of the
Government lessened its dependence on the banking system, which, in turn,
contributed to a reduction in the rate of inflation.
7.      The growth momentum was sustained through the Third Four Year Plan
period (1978/79-1981/82). During this time, Burma achieved an average annual
GDP growth of 6.5% in real terms, accompanied by rising exports and stable
prices. This favorable performance has been largely due to (a) steadily
rising agricultural production, resulting mainly from the Government's intro-
duction of high-yielding varieties; (b) higher capacity utilization primarily
in industry; and (c) rapid increases in investment, particularly in the
public sector.
8.      The Government's introduction of an agricultural intensification
program, the Whole Township Program, has contributed to a revitalization of
agriculture in Burma in recent years. Program coverage for paddy, expanded



-3-
from 2% of paddy-sown area in 1977/78 to 51% in 1981/82; during this period,
paddy production increased by about 50%. The Whole Township Program has also
been extended to other crops, including groundnuts, maize, wheat, sesame,
cotton, beans and pulses with good results. The focus of the Government's
agricultural program over the next few years will be on the consolidation of
past gains in paddy, with particular emphasis on quality improvements in
export rice, and further extension of the Whole Township Prog.am to non-paddy
crops. There are indications that the dramatic increases in agricultural
production in recent years have highlighted the bottlenecks in complementary
transportation, handling, storage and milling facilities. In the coming
years, the Government will have to deal with these bottlenecks through
investments in additional capacity.
9.     Benefiting from increased domestic supplies of agricultural raw
materials as well as from a steady growth of intermediate good imports,
capacity utilization in the light and agro-based industries in the public
sector has improved. The increased level of economic accivity during this
period is also reflected in the higher gross domestic capital formation. The
share of investment in GDP in constant prices increased from 15% in 1978/79
to 17% in 1981/82. On the other hand, the rapid expansion of public invest-
ment, which accounts for 70% of the total, has been largely responsible for
the widening in the overall budgetary deficit from 10% of GDP in 1978/79 to
an estimated 17% in 1981/82. Public savings have shown only a modest growth,
and the increasing deficit has been financed by large increases in external
assistance and domestic credit.
10.     Over the same period, merchandise exports increased in nominal terms
by 19% per annum, though the export growth in 1981/82, the last year of the
Third Four Year Plan period, was adversely affected by a sharp decline in the
international price of rice. Merchandise imports increased in current prices
by 20% annually. The current account deficit stabilized at about 6% of GDP,
and net disbursements of loans at around US$350-400 million a year. The
relatively small current account deficit reflects the Government's conserva-
tive approach to balance-of-payments management, not the real import needs of
the country. The Government controls all imports through a foreign exchange
budget, drawn up in accordance with anticipated financing. Although foreign
exchange availabilities have improved, shortages of imported intermediate and
consumer goods still remain.
11.     The Government's planned annual GDP growth for the Fourth Four Year
Plan is 6.2%. In order to attain this ambitious target, the Government needs
to achieve: (a) continued success in the development of the agricultural
sector; (b) further improvements in capacity utilization especially in
industry; (c) a judicious choice of investment projects; and (d) sufficient
resources - both foreign and domestic - to expand the investment program at
the required rate. Over the medium term, rice exports will undoubtedly
continue to be the mainstay for Burma's foreign exchange earnings. However,
the Government-s longer term strategy is to broaden the country-s export base
through agricultural diversification and promotion of agro-based industries,



-4-
to reduce Burma-s reliance on rice and teak and to insulate the economy
progressively from the international price fluctuations of less processed
primary commodity exports.
12.     Moreover, in order to maintain the growth momentum, the Government
will need to expand absorptive capacity for external assistance by emphasiz-
ing institution building and management development to a much greater extent
than in the past. The Burmese planning and administrative system, as it now
exists, is complex and rigid in its manner of operation and appears to focus
excessively on the formulation of targets. Streamlining of the entire plan-
ning and administrative apparatus, decentralization of decision-making, and
strengthening of the capability of Government entities to prepare and imple-
ment projects are urgently needed.
13.     Burma-s debt service ratio increased from 13% in the 1977/78 to about
28% in 1981/82, due primarily to a substantial increase in the loans from
private financial institutions and suppliers' credits. By March 1982,
Burma's external public debt, disbursed and outstanding, was approximately
US$1.6 billion. Burma's exports have been showing steady growth in recent
years, but the prospects over the medium term is less favorable. According
to the World Bank's price projections, Burma's terms of trade which had
deteriorated during the last two years would, at best, recover slowly over
the next four years. Moreover, because of the rising debt service burden
and because of Burma's low income level, external assistance should continue
to be on concessionary terms and should, in addition, finance part of local
cost requirements which cannot, at present, be covered adequately by domestic
savings. Local cost financing is particularly needed for the agricultural
sector where most investments have a low foreign exchange component.
14.     Burma is potentially one of the richest countries in South Asia.
Apart from an impressive natural resource base, it is endowed with a rela-
tively healthy and literate population. The crucial question is the quality
with which these resources will be managed and developed. The Bank continues
to discuss with the Government further improvements in economic management
(paras 12 and 18) which would help Burma realize its promising potential for
economic development as well as external assistance requirements. Discus-
sions on these topics are carried on jointly with other donors and the IMF
during the Burma Aid Group meetings which the Bank has organized at the
Government-s request.  The first meeting of the Group was held on Novem-
ber 30, 1976, in Tokyo; and there have been four subsequent meetings, with
indications of increasing donor support each year.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.     Burma became a member of the Bank in 1952, IFC in 1956, and IDA in
1962. Between 1956 and 1961, the Bank made three loans totaling US$33.1
million, all for transportation projects. One loan for the Port of Rangoon



-5-
helped finance the reconstruction of cargo berths and storage facilities, and
the purchase of cargo handling and port equipment. Two loans helped finance
the post-war reconstruction and dieselization of the railways. All three
projects were satisfactorily completed and the loans fully disbursed by FY68.
16.     No lending was requested between 1962 and 1972.  IDA lending resumed
in 1973 and since then 20 credits totaling about US$536 million equivalent
(net of cancellations) have been made. About 60% of this assistance was for
the agricultural sector, consisting of twelve projects: irrigation pumps,
rubber, livestock, seed development, two paddyland development projects,
grain storage, two forestry projects, a wood industries project, the Kinda
Dam multipurpose project, and a tank irrigation project. About 12% of IDA's
assistance supported the rehabilitation of the transport sector through four
projects, namely inland water transport, railways, a second ports project and
a construction industry project. The remaining 28% of IDA assistance has
been for two projects in the telecommunications sector (10%), one project in
the mining sector (3%) and a power project (15%). Six credits have been
fully disbursed so far. On the resumption of operations in 1973 there were
some difficulties with disbursement performance. However, performance has
improved considerably particularly as agencies, such as the Irrigation
Department, have become more familiar with the Bank's procedures. In
general, IDA-financed projects have been carried out satisfactorily. The
proposed Credit would be the second in FY83. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA Credits as of March 31, 1983, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects. IFC has made no investments in Burma.
17.     In the past, lending was partly constrained by incomplete knowledge
of some sectors and the lack of adequately prepared projects. Through the
ongoing projects and sector work, the Bank's knowledge of many sectors has
improved. A US$4.1 million UNDP technical assistance project (Burma Umbrella
Project), for which the Bank is the executing agency, has developed a project
pipeline suitable for external financing in priority sectors such as agricul-
ture, transport, power, and industry. Several projects, namely, Seed
Development, Rubber Rehabilitation, Power, Construction Industry and
Groundwater Irrigation were prepared under the Umbrella Project, which is now
in its third phase. Furthermore, the Association plans to continue its
technical assistance on a project-by-project basis to help improve Burmese
project preparation and implementation capabilities, as well as administra-
tive and managerial skills through in-service and overseas training.
18.     The Bank Group strategy is aimed at easing the most immediate con-
straints to growth and, particularly, at increasing and diversifying produc-
tion for export in order to alleviate the shortage of foreign exchange.
Within this overall strategy, primary emphasis is being placed on the
development of agriculture, forestry, and mining. Within this framework and
where possible, priority is being given to quick-yielding projects. At the
same time, financing of infrastructure improvements will continue in the
development of power and such areas as transportation, telecommunications,



-6-
and construction, mainly to rehabilitate and maximize utilization of existing
facilities.
19.     In line with the need to increase Burma's foreign exchange earnings,
many of the projects under active preparation are designed to have an impact
on increasing agricultural surpluses for export. Projects under preparation
include paddy development, tubewells, rubber rehabilitation, textiles finish-
ing plant and an integrated export commodity transport project.
20.     The Bank Group currently accounts for about 15% of Burma's total
external debt outstanding and about 1% of its debt service. In five years,
the Bank Group's share in the total external debt is projected to rise to
about 20% and its share in the debt service to about 2-3%.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
21.     Burma has a land area of about 262,000 square miles comprising
lowlands, in the basins of the rivers Irrawaddy, Chindwin, Sittang and
Salween, surrounded by hills and mountains to the east, north and west, and
divided by a hill range running from north to south in central Burma. The
country is well endowed with natural resources and has a population of about
35 million, which is growing at a rate of 2.3% per annum. About one-quarter
of the population lives in urban areas and the rest is dispersed in a large
number of villages mostly located in the main agricultural areas in the river
basins and the Irrawaddy delta. The main centers of population and economic
activity are Rangoon and Mandalay; Rangoon is the capital, the seat of
government and the country's only international port and airport.
22.     Transport and communications together account for about 5% of GDP and
over 3% of total employment. Between 1976/77 and 1980/81, mechanized freight
traffic, in terms of tons loaded, increased from 49 million to 63 million
tons at a growth rate of 6.5% per annum; the share of agricultural com-
modities being about 35%, forestry products 30%, manufacturing and processing
24% and mining 11%. Passenger traffic, on the other hand, grew at only 3.3%
per annum during the same period. It would, therefore, seem that the recent
surge of demand for freight transport is largely a reflection of the rapid
growth of the agricultural sector. Continued economic development will be
reflected in increased import and export levels, which will put additional
pressures on the port of Rangoon which handles over 90% of all cargos. The
proposed project is aimed at easing potential transport bottlenecks by
increasing capacity utilization, productivity and overall quality of services
at the port of Rangoon.



-7-
The Transport System
23.     The transport system of Burma now comprises about 16,000 miles of
road; 2,000 miles of railways; 5,000 miles of navigable waterways of which
3,700 miles are navigable throughout the year; one main international port
and eight coastal ports (called outports); and 45 airports, of which only
Rangoon airport handles international traffic. The topography of the country
and the location of population and agriculture along the rivers have
encouraged greater use of river and road transport. The north-south tran-
sport corridor connecting Rangoon with Mandalay and Myitkina is the main
artery of the transport system and is served by road, river, railway and air.
Complementing these modes, coastal shipping services meet the demand for
transport along the coast and in the Irrawaddy delta. Of the total freight
ton-miles currently transported inside the country, an estimated 57% is
carried by water, 39% by road and 4% by rail.
24.     Since 1962, the government has increased its conitrol over the sector,
by nationalizing transport firms and by allocating government-controlled
freight preferentially to public transport agencies. Railways, air transport
and ocean-going shipping are now entirely public but private sector activity
is allowed in road transport, inland water transport and coastal shipping.
It is estimated that about 80% of tonnage loaded in the country is carried by
the private sector, 16% by the public sector and 4% by cooperative institu-
tionse Between 1976/77 and 1980/81, tons loaded by private sector transport
(including cooperatives) grew by 6% per annum; by state transport corpora-
tions, 7%; and by other public sector transport, 9%. Transport statistics
for the cooperative sector--available only since 1978/79--show an increase of
25% a year, but over a very low base. Although there has been an increasing
trend toward long-haul traffic, roughly one-third of total tons loaded con-
tinrues to be handled by small and slow crafts and carts, all short-haul.
About 60% of the remaining traffic is carried by road trucks, 35% by water,
and 5% by rail. The Central Movement Coordination Committee (CMCC) in the
Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) is responsible for allocating
public sector freight among available carriers, including private operators.
25.     Inland Water Transport is provided by the state-owned Inland Water
Transport Corporation (IWTC), under MOTC, and by a large number of private
operators. In 1981/82, IWTC hauled about 1.5 million tons of freight and
carried over 17 million passengers. No transport statistics are collected
concerning private inland water transport but, on the basis of fleet statis-
tics, it is estimated that private river craft carry the bulk of all inland
water freight transport (about 32 million tons of cargo in 1979/80). Private
river operators are also estimated to carry about 50% of passengers, mainly
over short distances.
26.     The Road Network is about 16,000 miles of roads, of which one-third
have bituminous surfacing. The main arteries are the two north-south roads
between Rangoon and Mandalay. A major problem has been lack of maintenance
over the years, with many roads and bridges now requiring extensive



-8-
rehabilitation. Road Transport in Burma is provided by private operators,
cooperative institutions and public corporations. The vehicle fleet has been
growing at an average annual rate of about 2.5%. In 1980, there were 96,000
registered vehicles, one-third being trucks, of which about 80% are owned by
the private sector. The private sector comprises mostly owner-operators and
small bus and trucking companies. There are five cooperatives engaged in
transport and vehicle repair activities, operating on commercial lines. The
public sector consists of the Road Transport Corporation (RTC) and the fleets
owned by major public sector corporations to cater to their own needs.
27.      The Railways are operated by the publicly owned Burma Railways
Corporation (BRC), in MOTC, and have about 2,000 miles of meter gauge track.
In 1981/82, railways carried about 56 million passengers and 2.5 million tons
of freight. The railway track is generally in fair condition, but the
availability of motive power in 1979/80 was only 70% and that of rolling
stock about 75%. There have been some improvements, however, and the
shortage of spare parts and skilled mechanics, particularly for diesel
locomotives, is abating. Wagon turnaround time, for instance, decreased from
16 days to 13 days between 1975 and 1980.
28.     Airports in Burma are administered by the Civil Aviation Department,
also under MOTC.. Navigational aids are of poor range and quality and standby
equipment is virtually non-existent. Aircraft maintenance and repair
facilities are old, and the condition of runways at a number of airports is
deteriorating. Burma Airways Corporation (BAC), a government undertaking, is
the sole Burmese commercial airline. It operates domestic and limited inter-
national routes and carried about 5,000 tons of freight and 500,000 pas-
sengers in 1981/82.
29.      Ocean Shipping is handled by Burma's Five Star Shipping Corporation
(BFSSC), which operates eleven sea-going vessels (six of them with more than
10,000 deadweight tons), eleven coasters and tankers, and charters a number
of foreign flag vessels. Freight carried on BFSSC's own vessels in ocean and
coastal trade amounted to about 950,000 tons in 1981/82. It is estimated
that about 80% of Burma's foreign trade is carried by vessels owned by BFSSC
or vessels chartered by it and tramps.
30.      The Ports of Burma are administered by the Burma Ports Corporation
(BPC), also in MOTC.  The Port of Rangoon handles nearly 95% of the country's
exports and virtually all imports. In 1981/82, total seaborne freight
traffic loaded and unloaded at Rangoon was about 2.8 million tons, mostly
international cargo; also the port handled about 1.4 million tons of cargo
coming from or going to inland waterways destinations. Traffic at the eight
outports totalled about 0.5 million tons, of which over 0.1 million tons were
exports, mainly rice.



-9-
Transport Administration
31.     MOTC is responsible for formulating and implementing government
policies regarding transportation, except for highway planning and construc-
tion, which come under the Ministry of Construction (MOC). MOTC approves the
budgets of t-:nsport agencies in consultation with the Ministry of Planning
and Finance; appoints top level officers; sets tariffs and tariff policies
and enforces relevant regulations in the operation of the sector. Transport
planning is carried out within the context of overall national planning and
MOTC and MOC prepare four-year plans for all transport modes on the basis of
explicit targets for the transport sector. In recent years, the Government-s
planning function has improved because of better data base and means for
progress reporting and project evaluation. The general operation of the
transport sector has also improved as a result of the Government's policy to
enable state enterprises to operate increasingly on commercial lines and
select public or private carriers providing the best service.
Burma Ports Corporation
32.     The Burma Ports Corporation (BPC) was established in 1972 and
operates the Rangoon Port and and eight other outports. BPC has a con-
siderable degree of financial and operating autonomy even though its annual
budget, including setting of tariff levels, must be approved by the Govern-
ment. The Managing Director is the chairman of a seven member board
appointed by MOTC and is responsible for dealing with all matters of policy
affecting the port. There are 194 officers and 7,500 other employees. BPC
has seven departments, each headed by a principal officer, but some organiza-
tional changes are to be effected (paras 46 to 49). The Traffic Department
is responsible for cargo handling and stevedoring functions of the port and
for assessing future berth and equipment requirements to meet changing tech-
nology and growing traffic volume. It also acts as the shipping agency for
all ships calling at Burmese ports. BPC is among the more efficient SEEs in
Burma and its management and staff are competent and well qualified.
Issues in the Transport Sector
33.     Overall, Burma's transport system has shown substantial resilience in
the past to meet the increasing demands of a growing economy. Nevertheless,
transport capacity is reaching its limit and urgent  attention to the follow-
ing issues is needed in order to improve the efficiency of the sector: (a)
transport statistics are not routinely compiled on all modes, and those that
are available are not fully used as an input to decisions on investments,
pricing and regulatory measures; (b) allocation of traffic to public tran-
sport agencies is done by CMCC using criteria that do not adequately take
into account the comparative advantages of different modes; (c) maintenance
of infrastructure and equipment is generally deficient; (d) transport
tariffs, in many instances, do not reflect the average cost of providing
transport services, particularly in the case of public transport agencies;
and (e) the private sector is not given sufficient attention and support by



-10-
the Government, despite the fact that this sector carries the bulk of gocds
and passengers in the country.
34.     The Bank Group-s lending strategy in Burma has stressed, inter alia,
the importance of improvi°ng, rehabilitating and maintaining transport
facilities to achieve greater utilization of existing assets. Within this
scope, past lending operations have covered many important transport modes
and financed capital items and spare parts as well as technical assistance.
The proposed project has beer designed in line with this strategy and would
aim at easing a major potential export bottleneck and would address some of
the issues outlined above. It contains provisions for a minimum financial
rate of return (para 55), which would require periodical tariff adjustments
for port services; improvement of planning, management information system and
training functions at the port; and overall improvement of maintenance prac-
tices of the port facilities. Other projects under preparation, such as the
proposed timber distribution project, will encourage improved coordination
among agencies and allocation of traffic on the basis of economic cost.
Past Bank Group Assistance to the Transport Sector
35.     The First Railways Project in 1956 (139-BA, US$5.35 million) and the
Second Railways Project in 1961 (247-BA, US$14 million) were designed to help
BRC in the postwar reconstruction of infrastructure and the introduction of
diesel motive power. After a decade, a Third Railways Project (414-BA,
US$16.7 million) was approved in 1973 to continue the improvement and
rehabilitation,  All projects were satisfactorily implemented.  A Project
Completion Report (PCR) for Project 414-BA was issued on October 10, 1978
followed by a Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on June 29, 1979. In
1973, a credit of US$16.3 million (Cr. 413-BA) for Inland Water Transport
also helped IWTC rehabilitate its fleet and acquire new vessels, engines and
other equipment and spares. This project was satisfactorily completed and
the relevant PCR and PPAR were issued on January 24, 1979 and June 18, 1979,
respectively. The most recent transport sector operation is the Construction
Industry project (1253-BA, US$20.0 million) approved in 1982, which would
help improve highway maintenance procedures and techniques and strengthen the
Construction Corporation.
36.     The Bank Group-s association with the Burma Ports Corporation began
in 1956 with a project to reconstruct cargo berths and storage facilities and
to provide cargo handling and other equipment (140-BA, US$14.0 million).
This project was followed in 1977 by a Second Port Project (671-BA) for
US$10.0 million, to help prevent deterioration of the access channel to
Rangoon Port, and to improve cargo handling and other port facilities. The
project included provision of cargo handling and position finding equipment;
machinery and tools for workshop, riverside berths and pontoons; spare parts
for suction and bucket dredgers, harbour vessels and cargo handling equip-
ment; and consultants' services and training of staff. This project was
successfuLly completed but the PCR dated February 24, 1983 points out that
major delays occurred in rehabilitation of suction dredger Thaung Naing Nay



-11-
(TNY) and procurement of position finding equipment; the former because of a
fire and protracted procedural delays and the latter due to need for fresh
bids after a controversy with original tenderers. Nevertheless, the project
benefitted BPC and the Burmese economy; deterioration of channel depth was
contained and cargo handling operations improved. Traffic volumes and finan-
cial benefits surpassed appraisal expectations. In order to meet the need
for greater port capacity up to end 1980s, further development work and
improvement of port operations are still necessary and the proposed Third
Port Project has been designed to meet this need.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
37.     The proposed project is based on the feasibility study carried out by
BPC and its consultants Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, (UK) in 1981/82,
financed under the UNDP Umbrella Project. A staff Appraisal Report is being
distributed separately. A timetable of key events relating to the project
and special conditions are given in Annex III. Negotiations were held in
Washington, D.C. from April 4 to April 8, 1983. The Burmese delegation was
led by His Excellency Thura U Saw Pru, Minister of Transport and Communica-
tions and included Commander Tin Maung Soe, Managing Director, BPC.
Project Objectives and Description
38e     The proposed project is designed to enable the Port of Rangoon to
handle until about 1990 the projected growth in international breakbulk
general cargo and containerized traffic by improving port efficiency and
basic port services. This would avoid construction of additional berths.
The project will comprise:
(a) (i) provision of additional general and containerized cargo handling
equipment and pallets to accelerate general cargo and container
operations; (ii) provision of telecommunication equipment for setting
up a centralized operating control center for cargo handling opera-
tions; (iii) installation of improved lighting to operating areas of
the port; and (iv) measures to reduce cargo dwell time and delays in
*                  delivery of rice and timber to ships berthed in the port;
(b) construction of a container yard and container freight station, and
enlarged timber log and rice storage areas;
(c) renewal and rehabilitation of BPC's harbor craft and navigation aids
with provision for: (i) acquisition of two new marine vessels;
(ii) construction of small grab dredgers, self-propelled hopper
barges and mooring buoys in BPC-s yards; (iii) rehabilitation of
three service vessels, mooring and navigation buoys, work barges and
boats in BPC's yards; (iv) overhaul and provision of spares for the



-12-
suction dredger TNY; and (v) procurement of ancillary equipment for
dockyard workshops and for communications and navigation aids;
(d) restoration of floating pontoons berths used for the foreshore jet-
ties and two deep sea berths, together with approach bridges and
ancillary equipment;
(e) consultants- services to supervise (i) construction of the container
yard and container freight station; and (ii) construction of two new
harbour vessels; and
(f) training courses for BPC-s staff in major port activities and provi-
sion of training equipment.
Project ERecutiOn
39.     BPC will be responsible for the execution of the project in accord-
ance with the agreed implementation program. Project implementation is
expected to take about 5 years; July, 1983 to June 1988. BPC will continue
to maintain a Project Implementation Unit headed by a Project Manager and
with appropriate support staff acceptable to IDA [Section 3.03 of the draft
Development Credit Agreement (DCA)].
40.     Productivity and Throughput will be increased by improvements
proposed under the project including provision of additional mechanical
equipment for faster unloading of break bulk general cargo. Use of fork lift
trucks and increased palletization of cargo in the ship-s hold will also
improve the unloading rate and will avoid double handling in moving cargo
from the ships side to the sheds, as well as in shed storage and delivery to
consignee. Provision of new modern lighting fittings and improved main-
tenance of existing fixtures would help increase cargo throughput by improv-
ing night shift performance. An operating control center for cargo handling
operations will be established. A constant and rapid flow of cargo to the
consignee is essential to ensure that the cargo will not remain in the port
for more than 10-15 days. While the current cargo dwell time is about 30
days, BPC is instituting measures to enable Government agencies to take
earlier delivery of imported goods. These and other steps (para 41) would
enable BPC to reduce and thereafter maintain cargo dwell time in the port of
Rangoon to a maximum of 15 days by December, 1985 (Section 4.04 of the draft
DCA). Intermediate targets for reduced cargo dwell time would be 25 days by
December 31, 1984 and 20 days by June 30, 1985. The Government will provide
additional rice storage space in or around the port as may be recommended by
the ongoing grain storage study (section 4.05 of the draft DCA).
41.     Port Efficiency Targets.  The proposed productivity targets to
improve general cargo and berth throughput to be achieved by 1984/85 and
1989/90 have been established. In order to assess periodically the impact of
the measures proposed under the project (para 40) on the port's operation,



-13-
BPC will compute and monitor, on a quarterly basis, the following operational
data: (a) cargo handling rates (and associated berth throughput) for the main
categories of cargo; (b) average dwell time of cargo in port; (c) average
ship service time; (d) average ship waiting time; and (e) berth occupancy
for each deepwater berth. BPC will begin to compute such efficiency
indicators no later than January 1, 1984, and quarterly thereafter, and will
achieve substantially the agreed efficiency targets established for 1984/85
and 1989/90 (Section 4.03 and Schedule 4 of the draft DCA).
*             42.     Container Yard.  About 11 acres of land behind Brooking Street
wharves have been earmakred for the construction of the container yard. A
large part of this area is occupied by the offices of three government
t             departments, the Customs Department, the Construction Corporation (CC) and
the Irrigation Department; there are also a few godowns and staff housing
belonging to the Customs Department and the BPC. The Government has released
the land to BPC but before the construction of the container yard and the
container freight station could begin it will be necessary to a) arrange
alternative accommodation to which the present occupants could be relocated;
and b) demolish and clear the site of existing buildings and structures.
Clearing the site of buildings and structures will be done in stages as and
when the present occupants are relocated. In view of the need for providing
additional storage area as speedily as possible and to remove the existing
constraints on efficient handling of container traffic, BPC would need to
start the construction of the container yard, in phases, as the cleared
parcels of land become available. According to the agreed program, the area
designated as Phase I will be completely cleared by June, 1984, Phase II by
December, 1984, and Phase III by December, 1985. BPC will be responsible for
the implementation, but considering the modest work load involved in each
phase, BPC would entrust the construction of the container yard to CC and
have it completed by about mid-1986 and in any event not later than Decem-
ber 31, 1986. Contractual arrangements between BPC and CC will be reviewed
and approved by IDA prior to award of contract. Besides making available the
land for construction of the container yard and the container freight sta-
tion, the Government will enable BPC to complete demolition and leveling not
later than December 31, 1985 (Section 3.06 of the draft DCA). The terms and
conditions of consultants engaged to supervise the construction will be
approved by IDA (Section 3.02 of the draft DCA).
43.     Marinie Construction.  Under the project, two new harbor vessels are
expected to be constructed outside Burma. To supervise construction of these
vessels, BPC would retain experienced consultants, on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA (Section 3.02 of the draft DCA). For operational and
economic reasons, BPC proposes to carry out the balance of the proposed
marine rehabilitation program [para 38(c) and (d)] in BPCs own ship repair
yards. As none of the vessels in question is a deep sea-going craft, the cost
and risk involved in preparing and transporting the crafts to and from over-
seas repair yards would be very high. Further, all the vessels being still
in service, the timing of their release for rehabilitation will have to be



-14-
determined at short notice to ensure that the port operations are not adver-
sely affected. This would be possible only if the rehabilitation is carried
out in BPC-s own yards where available facilities and staff are considered
adequate to undertake the work and the provision of additional workshop
equipment under the project will further improve their capabilities.
44.     The Suction Dredger.  Total dredging on the inner and outer bars of
the Rangoon river channel to maintain a 15 ft depth at low water is estimated
to be about 1.0 million cubic yards based on consultants' assessment of the
regime of the river.  BPC's only suction dredger, TNY, has a rated capacity
of about 1.25 million cubic yards, but its full operational effectiveness has
not been demonstrated. BPC has agreed to undertake controlled and sustained
(working two shifts, as necessary) dredging to cover two full dredging
seasons (November to June each year), with the position finding equipment in
use, in order to test TNY's performance capability. Based on the results of
this test period a financial, economic and technical evaluation of options
available to BPC should be made to provide the basis for a decision on
whether the service life of TNY should be extended further by a major over-
haul, or whether TNY should be replaced by another dredger. It is expected
that TNY would demonstrate its capacity to cope with the dredging task and
qualify for an overhaul. The project, therefore, provides the funds for such
an overhaul and also up to US$150,000 for the spares required during the test
period. Nevertheless, withdrawal from the proceeds of the Credit will not be
made for dredger overhaul prior to agreement between BPC and IDA based on the
dredger's performance (Section 4(b) of Schedule 1 of the draft DCA). In the
event of such agreement, the contractor for the dredger overhaul will be
prequalified in accordance with the Bank Group guidelines.
45.     Congultantts  serviteg.  BPC would engage consulting engineers for
supervising construction of the container yard and the container freight
station and for the construction of two new vessels. About 40 man-months of
specialist services have been provided under the project. Supervision of
the dredger overhaul, if agreed, would be undertaken, as part of the con-
tract, by an appropriate international marine inspection agency approved by
IDA.
Ifigtitatitonal Developnefit
46.     Otganization Struettre.  A new management organization structure
proposed by BPC has been submitted to MOTC for approval with the object of
improving distribution of workload and managerial decision making. As a
first step, duties and responsibilities which are at present overlapping will
be more clearly defined and new divisions (paras. 47-49) will be established.
Initially a greater number of functional units will be operating under the
General Manager. However, informal arrangements have been made to group
similar activities under a small number of principal officers, who will be
reporting directly to the General Manager. After gaining experience with
these new arrangements, BPC would propose an intermediate layer of management
for formal incorporation into its organization structure.



-15-
47.     Planning.  BPC has relatively flexible and realistic planning proce-
dures. Under the Second Port Project (Credit 671-BA) several port officials
obtained experience in planning and finance at various ports in Asia and the
UK. Nevertheless, the planning function needs to be strengthened and BPC,
recognizing this, has proposed creation of a Progress Coordination Division
(PCD) which would be responsible for coordinating activities amongst BPC's
Planning, Engineering, Traffic and Finance departments and related economic
and planning entities in the Government. PCD will utilize services of the
Computer Division and expand its computer operations to meet management
planning needs and to refine the costing system. PCD will be guided by a
Planning Steering Committee, which would comprise the Managing Director, the
General Manager and nominated principal officers. As part of the overall
organizational changes (para. 46), PCD will be established not later than
December 31, 1983 (Section 4.02(i) of the draft DCA).
48.     Internal Audit.  BPC prepares a Four-Year Investiient Program and an
annual budget which includes estimates of revenue, current expenditure and
capital expenditure. Budgeting control is rigid and a pre-audit system
disallows expenditures outside the approved budget without prior sanction of
the Board. BPC has a competent group of about 40 staff members performing
audits on expenditures, revenue, payroll and verification of stock. To
ensure continued independence of the audit process, BPC will establish, by
December 31, 1983, a new Internal Audit Division, the head of which will
report directly to the General Manager (Section 4.02(ii) of the draft DCA).
49.     Training.  Presently, the Traffic Department conducts  a number of
training programs mainly for stevedoring and cargo handling and dredger
operating. Under Credit 671-BA, the Organization for Rehabilitation through
Trai°ning (Switzerland) presented courses and introduced a program of
instructions in a number of technical subjects. A further refinement of the
training program is essential to cope with newer technology and especially
container operations. BPC is well aware of the value of organized training
but lacks a central training organization to initiate, coordinate and
administer all aspects of training and development. To meet this need, BPC
will establish, not later than December 31, 1983, a Training Division, within
the Administration Department, suitably staffed and headed by a Training
Manager (Section 4.02(iii) of the draft DCA). Also, BPC will discuss with
IDA a plan of action for implementing a local training program for skilled
and semi-skilled labor by September 30, 1984, including proposals for
instructors' training.
Cost Estimates
50.     The total cost of the project, including duties and taxes, is
estimated at about US$98 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange com-
ponent of US$50 million equivalent. Contingency provisions estimated at
about 22% of net project costs are: (a) physical contingency of 10% for all
items excluding cargo handling equipment; and (b) annual price escalation of



-16-
8% for 1983; 7.5% for 1984; 7% for 1985 and 6% for 1986 and 1987 for foreign
costs; and 6% for local costs for 1983-87.  The local price contingency is
based on the nature of goods to be procured under the project. Provision for
technical assistance and training is based upon 12 man-months expatriate
specialist services at US$13,500 per man-month, including fee, per diem and
travel, and 138 man-months of overseas training at US$4,250 per man-month.
Fitiancitg Plati
51.     The proposed Credit would cover the estimated US$50 million foreign
exchange cost of the project; local costs of about US$48 million equivalent
would be met by BPC from its own resources. The Socialist Republic of the
Union of Burma will be the Borrower and the proceeds of the Credit would be
onlent to BPC (para 55), under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (Section 3.01(b)
of the draft DCA). Execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the
Government and BPC would be a condition of credit effectiveness (Section 7.01
of the draft DCA).
Proctrement
52.     Contracts will be let on the basis of international competitive
bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank Group's Guidelines for (i) con-
struction of two new marine vessels, (ii) procurement of cargo handling and
other equipment, and (iii) imported materials to be procured for all electri-
cal and lighting installations, renewal and rehabilitation of service and
harbor craft and pontoon berth renewals, and the container yard. Construction
of the container yard will be by a negotiated contract with CC acceptable to
IDA (para 42). The container freight station will be a prefabricated build-
ing procured by ICB, and erected by local labor supervised by a manufac-
turer's representative under arrangements satisfactory to IDA. Rehabilitation
of BPC's service and harbor craft will be undertaken in BPC's own repair
yards (para 43). The contract for overhaul of the suction dredger TNY, will
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding from prequalified repair
yards.  A preference of 15% of the c.i.f.  cost or the customs duty,
whichever is less, will be allowed for local manufacturers. The cost of
spares and components for existing equipment, not subject to competitive
bidding, is not expected to exceed US$500,000, including US$150,000 for
spares earmarked for dredger TNY.  Documents for all contracts estimated to
cost over US$100,000 for equipment and other goods will be reviewed by IDA
before bids are invited and submitted to IDA for approval prior to the award,
Di _bursem_ nts
53.     The project would be implemented over a  period of about five years
from September 1983 to June 1988. All procurement would be completed by
December 31, 1987, but the rehabilitation of some marine service vessels may
extend up to the project completion date of June 30, 1988. Disbursements
from the proposed credit would be made as follows: (a) material and equipment
for container yard construction, new vessel construction, cargo handling



-17-
equipment, materials procured for port lighting, electrical installations and
vessel and pontoons rehabilitation and renewal, dredger overhaul and spares
and components for existing equipment: 100% of foreign expenditures if
imported; 100% of local expenditures ex-factory; and 65% of local expendi-
tures if procured locally other than ex-factory, (b) consultants services,
technical assistance and training: 100% of total cost. Retroactive financ-
ing, not exceeding US$700,000 equivalent, would be made available (Section
4(a) of Schedule 1 of the draft DCA) for procurement of an oxyacetylene plant
and mobile lighting towers.
Investment Program and Finances
54.     Itvesttaeit Program.  BPCs five-year Investment Program (1983/84-
1987/88) amounting to Kyats 1,200 million would comprise the proposed Third
Port Project (K 780 million; 65%), the ongoing ADB/OPEC Outport Development
Project (K 250 mIllion; 21%) and BPC's own construction and rehabilitation
works (K 170 million; 14%). The proposed Investment Program is adequate and
reasonable considering the financial resources of BPC. BPC will not make
annual investments in excess of US$3 million equivalent outside the agreed
program without prior consultation with IDA (Section 5.06 of the draft DCA).
55.     Financing and Onlending.  BPC's financial position has been sound for
several years. Substantial net operating revenues have been generated as a
result of growing traffic and increases in demurrage income; the latter
should decrease in the future as cargo dwell time in the port area is reduced
(para 40). Nevertheless, forecast financial statements indicate that BPC
would continue to maintain a viable financial position. As the proposed
project is implemented, the debt equity ratio is expected to increase from
19:81 in FY83 to about 48:52 in FY88. To enable BPC to generate sufficient
funds to meet its debt service commitments and to provide for future capital
needs, it is estimated that tariff increases of up to 20% would be required
annually during each of the three years 1985 to 1987. BPC will earn annually
a minimum rate of return of 6% on its average net revalued fixed assets in
operation (Section 5.04(a) of the draft DCA). BPC is developing appropriate
methodology, satisfactory to IDA, for revaluation of its fixed assets in
operation and will reflect revalued assets on its balance sheets as of
March 31, 1985. Further, revaluation of BPC's fixed assets in operation will
be carried out every four years thereafter. (Section 5.03 of the draft DCA).
The second revaluation will, therefore, be undertaken in 1988/89. Neverthe-
less, after completion of the revaluation in March 1985, IDA and BPC will
review the frequency for such revaluation to be undertaken in the future and
also, on the basis of the findings of the revaluation, review the
appropriateness of the annual rate of return of six per cent (6%) on BPC's
average net revalued fixed assets in operation to ascertain whether any
adjustment is needed, keeping in view the financial position of BPC at that
time. The proceeds of the proposed Credit would be onlent to BPC at an
interest rate of 8.5% p.a., with a term of 20 years, including five years of
grace (Section 3.01(b) of the draft DCA). This proposed interest rate, which

is in line with the current interest rate structure in Burma, is positive.

56.     Fithatcial A8p!cts of Contaitier Opetations.  Although BPC is already
handling some container traffic, it does not yet have a separate tariff for
containers in its tariff structure.  Consultants  findings were reviewed and
agreement was reached on a tariff structure for container services which
would enable BPC to generate sufficient revenues to cover the cost of con-
tainer operations including the container yard.  The tariff rates for con-
tainer services will be incorporated into BPC-s tariff structure not later
than March 31, 1984 (Section 5.05 of the draft DCA).
Future Port Dovelopmefnt 
57.     Traffic forecasts indicate that around 1990, congestion will develop
and reduce the efficiency of the port, causing unacceptable delays to ships
and cargos unless additional port capacity is provided. Nevertheless, fur-
ther capacity expansion at the present site will not be feasible because of
lack of adequate backup space. To meet the projected traffic after 1990, a
new port site at Thilawa, some 20 km downstream from the present Rangoon
Port, has been identified. The Government has earmarked funds under the UNDP
Umbrella Project for conducting a feasibility study for developing this new
port on terms of reference acceptable to the Government/BPC and the Associa-
tion.
Ecotomit Justifitation
58.     The proposed project would enable the Port of Rangoon to handle,
within acceptable congestion levels, the increasingly larger traffic volumes
expected to develop through the end of the 1980's. The benefits identified
in the economic analysis largely reflect expected increases in port produc-
tivity and throughput, which will result from improved handling of cargo and
containers. These benefits, however, would not fully materialize without
improvements in labor productivity, service vessels, dredging, lighting,
navigational aids and pontoon jetties. Since the actual impact of these
components may not be easily quantified, they have not been explicitly
included. The project benefits that have been taken into account are the
avoided construction of new berths, which the proposed project will render
unnecessary; and the avoided increases in ship turnaround time, reflecting
the fact that both average waiting time before berthing and average service
time at berth will be lower with the project than without it. Among the
benefits that have not been taken into account are the reduced cargo handling
unit costs, the avoided maintenance of new berths and the postponement of
investment on a greater number of new vessels, which would be required
immediately as an alternative to the vessel rehabilitation program. No
attempt has been made to quantify the broad effect that improved and modern
port facilities will have on the level and composition of the country's
international trade. For all these reasons, the economic justification is
necessarily conservative. The streams of costs and benefits thus calculated



-19-
yield an economic rate of return (ERR) of 29%, which is acceptable. To
illustrate the adverse effect on the ERR of possible departures from the
assumptions used in the estimation of the base case (29%), the sensitivity
analyses give a return of 22%, if project costs are 20% higher; a return of
20% if project benefits are 20% lower; a return of 14% if project costs are
20% higher and project benefits are 20% lower; and a return of 16% if the
materialization of benefits is delayed by two years. It may be concluded
from this analysis that the project remains feasible even under adverse
eventualities.
Risks
59.     Given Burma's growth-oriented macroeconomic trend, potential devia-
tions from the assumptions used herein are likely to increase rather than
decrease the project's ERR. Such would be the case, for instance, if traffic
were to grow faster than is now envisaged, which wo,t1d result in a
more-than-proportional increase in avoided ship waicing time. The procure-
ment of cargo handling equipment and vessels (which represent about one-third
of project base costs) is unlikely to suffer any major delays. Some delay
may occur, however, in the implementation of civil works and the vessel
rehabilitation program, both of which require significant managerial and
technical inputs. To minimize these risks, steps are being taken to secure
timely land availability, as required for the phased construction of the
container yard and the container freight station (para 42); the capacity of
repair yards in Rangoon has been examined and found to be adequate to carry
out the proposed marine vessel rehabilitation program (para 43); and provi-
sions have been made under the project for supervision of construction work
and training of BPC's staff in major port activities.
EnvirotimLnt
60.     None of the proposed works in the project are expected to have any
adverse impact on the environment, either in the river or the city of
Rangoon.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
61.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Socialist Republic
of the Union of Burma and the Association, and the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agree-
ment are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
62.     Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of Annex
III. The execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Socialist
Republic of the Union of Burma and the Burma Ports Corporation will be a
condition of effectiveness.

Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The milk plant is
expected to be completed by July 1983 and commissioning by September 1983.
Organization of the milk collecting centers is underway. The Veterinary and Animal
Husbandry Department (VAHD) has equalled or exceeded the targets set for number of
villages to be covered, number of cows inseminated, semen produced, vaccine
produced, establishment of water points, and staff and farmZ1. training. Nine
thousand acres of pasture remain to be established. The seeds have been procured
and establishment will be completed in May/June 1983 when rains begin. The
Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science (IAHVC) has completed about
50% of the move to Yezin. The program of training and fellowships abroad has been
a success.
Cr. No. 642    Paddylatid Developmeftt Project; US$30.0 Million Credit of
June 21, 1976; Effective Date: Agust 2_0_1T&77_`losng
Datea  Jute 3O, 1983
The project is about two years behind schedule due to delay in the procure-
ment of construction equipment at the outset of implementation.  After the delivery
of equipment, construction progress had been satisfactory until 1982 when further
delays were encountered due largely to shortages of fuel and cement. A revised
implementation schedule envisages completion of the project, within the original
cost estimates, by end 1984/85. Preliminary survey suggests that substantial
agricultural benefits are being obtained in four completed polders.

The dredge has completed delivery tests and is operative.  MC2 is procuring
spare parts to avoid future delays of dredge operations. In addition, MC2 has also
increased its efforts in training by sending selected staff to Malaysia. GOB has
advised the Bank that they would cancel $200,000 allocated for a sector study. The

progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.  They
should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not pur-
port to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

project activity is nearly completed. The closing date has been put forward to
March 31, 1984 to complete small outstanding disbursements.
Cr. No. 745    Seed Development Project; US$5e5 Million Credit of November 14,
1977; Effective Date:  February 14, 1978; CloSiTg Date:
June 30, 1984 
Procurement, civil works, applied research, seed production, and seed
quality control continue to make satisfactory progress. Staff is now at full
strength. Overseas training is proceeding satisfactorily. The project has been
extended by 18 months, to accommodate previous delays.
Cr. No. 835    Paddyland Developflent 1I Project, US$34.5 Million Credit of
July 28, 1978; Effective Date: October 13, 1978; Closing
Date:  April 30, 1986
The project is proceeding broadly according to schedule. However, shortage
of fuel has caused slight delays in construction. Land reclamation is proceeding
at a satisfactory rate. The allocation of reclaimed land for settlement is await-
ing completion of the necessary surveys, and is a little delayed. The agricultural
extension service and other components of the project are progressing satisfac-
torily.
Cr. No. 879    Rtubber Rehabilitation Projett; US$4.5 Million Credit of
March 13, 1979; Effective Date: May 25, 1979; Closing Date:
Decemaiber 31, 1983
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily, except for the delay
in the construction of the crumb rubber factory. Management performance is good
and the project has now made up for earlier delays in procurement. Project plant-
ing is expected to be completed by June 1983. Civil works is 74% of target, and
procurement is nearly completed. Disbursements totalled US$2.2 million up to March
31, 1983, compared with SAR estimates of US$3.8 million, largely due to the delay
in the construction of the crumb rubber factory which accounts for about 20% of the
credit. A team of geophysicists has visited the factory site in March 1983 to
advise on the equipment necessary to obtain the 10,000 gallons of water per hour
required by the factory. The present output is 2,000 gallons per hour with a
2-inch outlet. If the test results are satisfactory, the factory would be com-
pleted by mid 1983. The Second Rubber Rehabilitation Project, appraised during
November 1982, has been negotiated.
Cr. No. 949    Forestry II (East Pegt Yoma) Projett; US$35.0 Million Credit of
September 21, 1979; Effective Date: December 20, 1979;
Closing Date.  September 30, 1985
Implementation of the project is going well. Log extraction targets are
being met with the necessary balance with sawmilling capacity. The sawmill
rehabilitation program is achieving good results with capacity increases to date
totalling about 25,000 HT. The construction of the first of two new hardwood
sawmills is now complete and trial runs began in January 1983. Construction of the
second mill has now started. At Okkyin civil works is about complete and equipment

Dat: Deemberbr 31, 1984
The project, after a slow start caused by delay in the creation of the
project implementation unit and consequent delays in procurement action, is now
progressing satisfactorily.  Overall the project is expected to suffer a delay of a
year and a half. Financial results continue to be satisfactory.

Overall progress of the dam and allied structures has been impressive and
on schedule, except the diversion tunnel which was originally delayed by about two
months. All steel lining, upstream diversion channel and saddle dike 3 are com-
pleted and diversion tunnel concreting is 85% complete. Excavation of inlet struc-
ture/spillways/plunge pool, and construction of coffer dam core-filling and rock-
fill, saddle dike 2, and Kirnda weir radial gate section are in progress. The
irrigation and agricultural development works are presently about 12 months behind
schedule due to delays in selection of the engineering consultant and procurement
of some equipment. Most of the equipment has now been delivered. The selected
consultant firm for irrigation/development works has recently started the plan-
ning/design works which are progressing well.

Progress on construction of godowns has been held back by shortage of
cement and problems of local procurement of sawn timber.  The Government has,
however, assigned high priority to allocation of construction materials sufficient
to speed up progress, under the coordination and mornitoring of the Project Coor-
dination Committee. Engineering consultants have assisted AFPTC in finalizing
designs of mechanical ecuipment and prefabricated steel superstructures. A major
start on the rehabilitation of godowns, Jetties and railway wagons is underway.

Project procurement continues on schedule. Mtost equipment contracts for
sawmills, plywood mills, and the furniture factory have been awarded. Civil works
conistruction for sawmills, furniture factory, and plywood millis is underway.
Project staffing needs to be strengthened to cope wilth the increased level of
activity expected in the future.

The project would help establish an integrated approach to the development
of the Electric Power Corporation-s (EPC) transmission facilities and contribute to
improving the efficiency of EPC-s power system. The project start up has been
satisfactory to date. Bid evaluation and tendering for equipment is slightly
behind schedule and a delay of two months is expected in awarding contracts. A
supervision mission is scheduled to return end-April 1983.

The implementation of the project continues to make good progress. Selec-
tion of a consulting firm for the technical assistance to be provided under the
project has been made and the contract signed. With respect to equipment procure-
ment, by early February 1983, Construction Corporation had already opened bids for
abut 70% of the total list of credit equipment and by the end of February 1983 they
were expecting to have opened almost all equipment bids. In April/May 1983 Con-
struction Corporation will be presenting evaluation reports for IDA approval.

The project consists of two subprojects, each located in distinctly dif-
ferent regions, namely Kinmundaung and Azin. The Kinmundang subproject lies in
Magwe Division in the dry zone of central Burma. The subproject would provide
year-round irrigation for about 5,000 acres. The Azin subproject is located in the
southern coastal area of Mon state. The subproject would provide irrigation for a
dry-season crop in the area as well as a full drinking water supply for Mudon Town
which has a population of 40,000. Implementation is underway.
