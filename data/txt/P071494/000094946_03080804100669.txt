(a) Pr-oject Area antd Comnpon ents
Trhc pro ject, to be financed from Worldl Banik fuLdcs will consist of the following two compollellts:
Component 1: State Programis for the Imiplenielitatioii of Universal Basic Ecducation
Thlie project will support Government of Nigeria's plans to imnplemilent universal basic
educationi (UBE). The objectives of the project are to raise the primary school completion

CCeLI ca'tion.
A dceceitralized appl)'ach will be followed for this project, with sUpport provided lirectly to
states and local goveinirments to carry out their implemenitationi of UBE, accordii, to the
policies and strate nes as set f0or thle COuILtry as a whole ancd addressing the prioI ;y needs of

T lhe Barnks's UBI- project will provide to up to sixtecn statCS, as folloWs: Ekiti, EntIgo,
Jiuga\va, 13eriue, Bloino, Taraba, Katsina, Kaduna, Niger, Plateau, Lapos, Oyo, Rivers,
13ayelsa, Ebonyi ancl Iino. Tlhe sixteen states will be eligible for a maximnumil budget of UtS $
5,()(0,00 (ccedit am-iount) each, over a five-year period. For all 16 states, the project \vill

LGA's.
Support for EMIS development.
Project management and monitoring and evaluationi of the project.
In addition, each state will need to select a maxilmlumIL of five operatiolIs from the followilng
list, providing a balance, to achieve a whole-school approach andc reflectling the priority areas
towards achilevinro UB1E in thie state:
A. PhIy.sical Injr?-ostriuctuire (a maxi'mum ojf 60% of thefiunds requiestedfor thef ie
opera ioins)
Rienovation or reconstiuction of existinig schools, inclucing, construction of additional
classroomis and toilet facilities; following the procedCuL-es set in the self-help model for
COmImIulLnllitiCS under PEP II,

IIncenitive schemnes for disadvantaged grouLps, suchI as girl eniollment, boy eniollment,
including SUppOrt for alternative sclhools (mlar-et schiools, girl ceFters, etc.)
'lo prepare for the project, states prepared an overall proposal for Bank financing, \vithin the
ramine\vork of a state plan for the impiciniciitatioin of UBE. Each year, states are preparing>
annual work plans, proposing the activities for financilng for the coining year. accor-ding to
the agreemenits as presenite(d in tlhe initial proposal. States are startinig otit with SuppOIt to 6
Local Goveriniiments (LGA's) during the first two years of the project. If iimplemeiation
p)ro-ress is satisfactory, they can expand the project to othier LGA's in the later ycars of the
project, and to continue into an) follow-oni project.

of the supl)port provided througlh tI-ie project will targets thesc levels. Howevcr, effective
iniplieilnnlationl of the prog1mim \vill also require con-.sicderable stren-gthoriiig of the caipacity of
key federal institutiolns charged vwith policy developinent and \Vith training of education
planners, managers and policy rmakers at all levcis ol the educaLion1 systemil.
A total credit amriount of US 20 million \Vill be allocated for this componenit. It is proposed
lhal thlC project support capacily developmiienit activities in six areas:
1. Iiileractioni betlweeut I-NV/iADS anid ediucationi. lhe project is proposed to Support
thlree areas:
a) Strengthen the capocity of lthe ediucationi system  to p)revent HIV/IAIDS.
J0o sul)port the implemI.Ientation of th-ie national lII V/AIDS Emergency Actioni Plan
(HEAP) in the edLucaLion sector, FME, through NERDC, has dceveloped a 'National
Sexuality Education CuL-ricilIuILI'. The Baank will support the nlext step in this process
\vhich is to translate this curriculum inito a set of practical intervenitions and materials In
diffei-erit subjects and grade levels thioughout thle school system.
Tlhe Banki will suppoit stirengthening of the capacity of the staff of the 1-lV/AIDS
prOgrFamIl i mpleieCnItatiOn Ulnits in the 1eder-al M'Ii nistry of EdLucaLtion anid in other- relevant
aglnicics. especially in the preparation of action planis and(c ftiucling plroposals, incIluiLngL
the preparation of lhe 2002/2003 actionl plan for immediate activities in line with H-lEAP
The activities onl Ihis plaIn Will be iaiainly fuLnicded undel the NIAP.I credit thiough1 thle

(b) Lstrablish capaciry3 to a.ssess the imiipaict of HI1 /AIDS oni ilhe educaitioni S%stenz
'Ir aininio wvorkshops have already been carried out wVith planners fromil five states to
increase tI-icir awvareness and understandini of AIDS is.sues andl to assess the iLttIre
impact Onl ptipil eniolenit and teaceric numbers, usinIg the Elid-SIDA imodel developed for
the Banik. It is proposed to extend this work under the UBE project to embrace education
planners from othel staLtes. NJEEPA has expressed its willingness to becorne the base for
future training workshops using this approach, and has the necessary resicdenitial and
computeL flcilities, It is proposed to strengthen the capacity of NIEPIt, in ICr sklills
thiough thc project in ordler- to enable NIEI'A staff to delivel thi.s triLinigi withouL the
need for frequent visits by internationial consultailts.
(c) Develop alternative optionsforprovidino basic edtucationi to AIDS orphans
Alhotilih the [uimber of childrein who are orphancd as a iesutlt of AIDS is not yet a big
problem in Nigeria, the falct must be faced that there is a growing poptilation of SuChI
childirei and it is better to begin early to make plans for their care and education. T his
sub-coiriponienit will help establish (possibly within UBEC):
a knowledge base oni oood practice and prog1am1ls t:r ensLirinig basic edLicatioII fOr
AIDS orphans
a ameciLanlisimi for ensuLinlg financial suLpport for cdication programs for orphans (eg.

eoocvriiiient funds and niot fr,om, the IDA conti ibLutioll) or pCeop)le ImaL;y niecd to be resettled. Th is
could rCsult in loss of p)roductivc assCts, lo.st productionI anid disturbance and the need for
