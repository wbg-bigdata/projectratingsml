CAEROON OIL PALM PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        Loan No. 593-CM for the Cameroon Oil Palm Project was signed on
April 15, 1969 and became effective on August 14, 1969. For an amount of
US$7.9 million it was made to finance part of the cost of establishing 9,000
ha of oil palm on two estates of 4,500 ha each, including two palm oil mills
and necessary infrastructure. Total project costs were estinated at CFAF
3,463 million (US$14 million equivalent at CFAF 247/US$) iLncluding operating
losses during the development phase and interest on the Bank loan, but exclud-
ing the value of the land. The loan was made to Societe des Palmeraies de
Mbongo et d'Eseka (SOPAME), an autonomous Government agency. The name of
this agency has since been changed twice, firstly to Societe des Palmeraies
du Cameron Oriental (SOPACOR) and recently to Societe Camerounaise de
Palmeraies and in this report is referred to as SOCAPALM. The balance of
project financing was provided by two French agencies, Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation (FAC) a grant of CFAF 443 million (US$1.U million equivalent)
and Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) a credit of CFAF 443
million (US$1.8 million equivalent) and by Government equity in SOCAPALM
of CFAF 611 million (US$2.5 million equivalent).
ii.       Since the loan became effective five Bank supervision missions
have visited the project. Initially the project proceeded satisfactorily,
but in 1971 it was clear that significant cost overruns were occurring and
that the Eseka estate site was unsatisfactory. A supervision mission in
May 1971 recommended that SOCAPALM prepare a detailed analysis of expendi-
tures needed to complete the project and proposals for overcoming the prob-
lem of the poor site at Eseka.  SOCAPALMI submitted its new estimates early
in 1972. These estimates were unsatisfactory because no attempt had been
made to seek means of reducing costs. Consequently, the Bank decided to
reappraise the project.
iii.      In the course of reappraisal the project was modified.  It is now
proposed that the project development period be extended by 1--1/2 years to
9 years; the area of palms at Eseka be reduced from 4,500 ha to 25500 ha and
that at Hbongo increased from 4,500 ha to 6,000 ha. These changes result
in total plantings of 8,500 ha instead of the original 9,000 ha, however,
project production at maturity is forecast to be similar to original appraisal
estimates due to the higher yields that are now anticipated. Total revised
project costs are CFAF 4,958 million (US$19 million) including capitalized
interest on the existing Bank loan. This represents an :increase of CFAF 1,495
million (US$5.8 million equivalent at current exchange rate) over appraisal
estimates. About CFAF 230 million (US$0.9 million) of the increase is due to
the extension of the project development period, about CFAF 53 million (US$0.2
million) to the provision of a warehouse and workshop facilities not included
at appraisal and the remainder CFAF 1,212 million (IJS$4.7 million) to cost
overruns on palm oil mills, management and overhead, vehicles and equipment,



- ii -
buildings, land clearing and increased contingencies. A substantial part of
these overruns is due to the underestimation of price inflation when the pro-
ject was appraised in 1968.
iv.       The higher project costs will be more tlian compensated for by in-
creased benefits which were significantly underestimated at appraisal in re-
spect of crop yields and prices. Consequently the economic rate of return
from investment in tie project is now calculated as 10% without siuadow pric-
ing and is 2.4 percentage poillts above the rate estimated at appraisal. With
appropriate and justified shadow pricin- the economic rate of return would
be 12%/.
v.        Since the approval of the first financing the exchange rate
CFAF/US$ has altered.  Disbursements to June 1972 were made at an average
of CFAF 270 per US$ and subsequently at the current rate of CFAF 256. As
a result the total funds available in CFAF under the original financing
hlave increased by CFAF 172 million, about US$0.6 million at the current ex-
change rate.  After taking into account these extra funds the amount required
to finance the cost overrun of CFAF 1,495 million (US$5.8 million) is CFAF
1,323 million (US$5.2 million).
vi.       The revised project is technically and economically sound and is
suitable for a supplenental Bank loan.  It is proposed that a Bank loan
of US$1.7 million (CFAF 435.2 million) should be made to finance 33% of the
additional costs. FAC and CCCE have indicated that they would make a grant
and loan respectively totaling CFAF 495 million (US$1.9 million) or 37% of
the supplemental costs. The remainder of CFAF 393.1 million (US$1.6 million)
or 30% of the supplemental costs would be financed by Government and self-
generated funds. If tihis proposal is accepted, the Bank would finance ap-
proximately 50% of total project costs, FAC and CCE 28% Government and self-
generated funds 22%.  This compares with the original financin- plan of Bank
57%, FAC and CCE 24% and Government 19%.  The 'orrower would be SOCAPALM.

CAIOEROON OIL PALM PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Loan No. 593-CbM based on Appraisal Report No. 70-654a for the
Cameroon Oil Palm Project was appraised in February/March 1968 signed
on April 15, 1969 and became effective on August 14, 1969. For an amount
of US$7.9 million it was to finance part of the cost of establishing 9,000
ha of oil palm on two estates of 4,500 ha each, including two palm oil mills
and necessary infrastructure. Total project costs were estimated at CFAF
3,463 million (US$14 million equivalent at CFAF 247/US$) including operating
losses during the development phase and interest on the Bank loan but exclud-
ing the value of the land. The loan was made to Societe des Palmeraies de
Mbongo et d'Eseka (SOPAIIE), an autonomous Government agency.  The name of
this agency has been changed to Societe des Palmeraies du Cameroun Oriental
(SOPACOR) and then to Societe Camerounaise de Palmeraies and in this report
is referred to as SOCAPALM. The balance of project finarncing was provided
by two French agencies, Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FrAC) a grant of
CFAF 443 million (US$1.8 million equivalent) and Caisse Centrale de Coopera-
tion Economique (CCCE) a credit of CFAF 443 million (US$11.8 million equiva-
lent), and by a Government contribution to SOCAPALM equity of CFAF 611 mil-
lion (US$2.5 million equivalent).
1.02      Since the loan became effective five Bank supervision missions have
visited the project. Initially the project proceeded satisfactorily, but in
1971 it was clear that significant cost overruns were occurring and that the
Eseka estate site was unsatisfactory (para 2.06). A supervision mission in
May 1971 recommended that SOCAPALM prepare a detailed analysis of expend-
itures needed to complete the project and proposals for overcoming the prob-
lem of the poor site at Eseka.  SOCAPALM submitted its new estimates early
in 1972. These estimates were unsatisfactory because no constructive attempt
had been made to effect economies.
1.03      A Bank reappraisal mission consisting of Messrs. Elz, Huas and
Losson visited Cameroon from May 23 to June 7, 1972. The mission reestimated
project costs to completion at CFAF 4,958 million (US$19 million) an increase
of CFAF 1,495 million (US$5.8 million equivalent at current rate of exchange)
over the appraisal estimate. The mission recalculated the economic rate of
return from investment in the project as 10% cormpared with the 7.6% estimated
at appraisal. Improvement in the rate of return stems from the use of a higher
economie value for palm oil produced by the project. The use of a higher eco-
nomic value for project produced palm oil is justified since the import sub-
stitution price for project oil is estimated to be highier than the price fore-
cast at appraisal. Despite the reduction of the area of palms, project pro-
duction at maturity is forecast to be similar to original appraisal estimates
due to the higher yields that are now anticipated. The higher yield estimates
are based on information that has become available from field trials in the
five years since original appraisal.

II. TUE PROJECT
2.01      In this Chapter, the major changes in the project and in its
implementation which have occurred since appraisal, or which are now pro-
posed, are described and their impact on costs discussed.
A. Defiiiition
2.02      The appraisal report defined the project as consisting of:
(a)  the establishment of 9,000 ha of oil palms on two estates
of 4,500 ha each;5
(b)  the creation of a state-owned corporation, Societe des
Palmeraies de !'lbongo et d'Eseka (SOPAME), to owm and manage
the two estates at Mbongo and Eseka;
(c)  the setting up of a palm oil mill on each of the two
estates, which by the end of the project development period
would have capacities of 12 tons/hr at Ubongo and 6 tons/hr
at Eseka: and
(d) the provision on each estate of necessary roads, buildings,
and other infrastructure.
2.03      Following reappraisal it is proposed to redefine items (a), (b)
and (c) as follows:
(a)  the establishrient of about 8,500 ha of oil palms, about
6,000 ha at M1bongo estate and about 2,500 ha at Eseka
estate;
(b)  to agree to the change in name from SOPMIE to Societe
Camerounaise de Palmeraies (SOCAPALU), to own and manage
the two estates at Mbongo and Eseka and to take on additional
responsibilities for all existîng and future public oil palm
development in Cameroon,
(c)  the setting up of a palîi oil mill on each of tae two
estates, which by the end of the project development period
would have capacities of 20 tons/hr at Mbongo and 12 tons/hr
at Eseka;
and to add another item:
(e) the building of a warehouse and office at Douala.
Reasons for the proposed modifications are given in paras 2.06, 2.12, 2.17
and 2.30 respectively.



-3-
B. Objectives
2.04      The major objectives of the project remain the same.  Basically
they are to increase the estate production of oil palm products in Cameroon.
C. Project Development Period
2.05      When the project was appraised its development period was taken
as the 7-1/2 years 1968/69 through 1975, although the cash break-even was
not expected until 1970/79. But since expenditures not covered by self-
generated funds during 1976 and 1977 were estimated to be comparatively small,
Covernment chose to provide any funds required during these years rather than
extend the loan period and thereby increase long-ternl commitments (see para
3.28 of appraisal report No. TO-654a and para 3.01 in this report). The re-
appraisal estimates show cash break-even will now be achieved by 1977/78.
However, to ensure adequate working capital, it is proposed to use a major
part of the self-generated funds in 1976/77 for this purpose and to extend
the project development period to the nine years 1968/69 through 1976/77.
Both the existing and supplemental Bank loans would be disbursed within this
period (paras 3.04 and 3.07).
D. Project Areas
2.06      The original planting program called for 4,500 ha of palms at Mbongo
and 4,500 ha at Eseka.  The N.lbongo site is satisfactory- but experience
shows that the conclusions of the soil and topographical survey of Eseka 1/
were very misleading.  Swamps, ravines, and numerous small streams mnake the
site unsuitable. To compensate for this, Government granted SOCAPALM a
second concession at Bidjocka about 15 km away (see Eseka Map). The Bidjocka
site is little better and a total of not Trmore than 2,500 nha of palmis can be
developed efficientlv at Eseka and Bidjocka.  To offset the shortfall in
plantable land at Eseka, it is proposed to extend the area under palms at
Mbongo by 1,500 ha to a total of 6,000 ha.  1,500 ha of additional land
at Mbongo have been surveyed and found suitable. Durin- negotiationls
assurances were obtained that the additional 1,500 ha at M.bongo, which are
owned by Government, would be transferred without charge to SOCAPALM.

E. Planting Program
2.07      Planting started in 1968/69, has proceeded faster than envisaged
at appraisal, and will be completed in 1973/74 as planned. All plantings
will be in production by 1977/78 in line with original appraisal forecasts.
The maintenance of project plantings is of a high standard. Appraisal,
actual, and reappraisal planting schedules compare as follows:

2.08      It was planned that oil palm seedlings would be raised in field
nurseries. This has been discarded in favor of the newer and more efficient
polybag technique which has reduced nursery and planting labor requirements
and consequently establishment costs.
F. Labor, Labor Housing and Other Buildings
2.09      Labor requireraents will be less than estimated at appraisal.  Re-
duction in the area to be planted and thus exploited is a factor, but use
of polybag planting has reduced labor requirements for oil palm establishment
by nearly 30% (from 204 days to 145 days/ha). Appraisal and reappraisal
estimates are compared in Annex 1, Table 1.



- 5 -
2.10      Saving in labor numbers has been offset partly lby higher labor
costs. The latter have increased by about 6.6% per year. Annex 1, Table 2
contains details of labor cost calculations.
2.11      At appraisal it was estimated, on the basis of a study by IRHO,
that up to 75% of the labor force in the project development period would
be unmarried, and it was assumed that one family or 4 unmarried workers would
occupy one house. In practice about 33% of the labor force is married, and
only 2 unmarried workers can be induced to occupy a single house. Further-
more, it was found necessary to improve sanitary facilities by providing
permanent shower facilities, water supplies and electricity. This increases
the number of houses required as shown at Annex 2, Table 1.
2.12      Considerable quantities of materials such as fertilizers, building
materials, equipment, and spares, are either imported or locally purchased
for the project. Originally, it was believed that these could be distributed
to the estates at time of purchase or import. Practice shows that it would
be more economic if such materials were stored centrally at Douala until
required on the estates.  Revised project estimates thus include CFAF 47.5
million for the construction of a warehouse and small off'ice at Douala.
Office space now used is rented. Estimates for these ner items are at
Annex 2, Table 2.
G. Land Clearing
2.13      At appraisal cost estimates for land clearin- rere prepared on
the basis of a unit cost per ha planted. Because of poor terrain, the edge
effect (land that has to be cleared around blocks of plantings but which is
not plantable) and the extent of roads have been greater than would be the
case under more normal circumstances. It is now estimated that a total of
about 10,500 ha will be cleared to permit planting 8,500 ha of palms. 11
Annex 3 contains details of past land clearin- operations and projected
land clearing requirements. At Mibongo, about 18% more land will be cleared
than will be planted; but at Eseka and Bidjocka where clearing has been
completed 35% more land has been cleared than currently :Ls plantable.
2.14      The Eseka site was surveyed and mapped by IRIO in conjunction with
Office de la Recherche Scientifique et Technique d'Outre Mer (ORSTOII).  Ex-
perience now shows that the topographic work was performed inadequately.
The consequences of the inadequate survey have been aggravated by the expen-
sive mechainical land clearing method considered essential by IRIO advisers
and accepted reluctantly by the Bank after nearly a year of argument. Due
to the novelty and lack of experience with large-scale land clearing in
1/   Once the estates are in the operating phase it will be possible to
plant up some of the 2,000 ha, but the benefits frem this have not
been taken into account in calculating the economic rate of return.

Car,eroon and because of the anticipated shortage of labor projected at
appraisal, it was nlot possible to refute this method at that time.
2.15      Land clearing cost for 9.000 ha was estimated at appraisal at
CFAF 77,400 per ha. 8.400 ha were contracted to Entreprise Africaine de
Travaux (ENAT) after international competitive bidding. ENAT won the contract
with a price of CFAF 75,000/ha cleared.  Since that time costs have increased,
through operation of the escalation clause in the contract, to CFAF 93,500/ha
cleared because of increases in the costs of fuel and other consumables wlhich
have averaged 6.5% annually. Consequently, the average land clearing cost
per plantable hectare to date lias been CFAF 110,000, CrAF 35,000 or 47%
above the original estimate.  About 50% of this increase is due to infla-
tionary factors, and the remainder to the excessively high edge effect and
extensive road network.
2.16      At the end of October 1972 a total of about 2,200 ha remained to
be cleared.  Of this amount ENAT has still to clear 660 hectares and to
windrow 920 ha to complete its contract, the balance of about 1,500 ha will
be cleared by hand by contractors at a cost of CFAF 51,000 ha. The average
land clearing cost for 8,534 ha is thus reestimated at CFAF 105,900 per
plantable ha instead of CFAF 77.400 estimated at appraisal, an increase of
37%,.
H. Processing
2.17      At appraisal it was estimated that an 18 ton of ffb/hr 1/ palm oil
mill would be needed at each of the Mbongo and Lseka estates.  The total
cost of each mill was estimated at CFAF 467 million (US$1.8 million).  This
plan has had to be changed in the lignt of the reduction in plantings at
Eseka and the increase at Mbongo.  Ubongo wil' now require eventually a 30
ton/hr mill and Eseka one of 12 ton/hr capacity. Construction at Mbongo
would be in 3 phases with the first 10 teo/hir capacity phase becoming
operative in March 1974, the second 10 ton/ha capacity phase in July 76,
and the third in 1980. At Eseka, construction would be in two phases with
the first phase of 6 ton/hr being commissioned in 1975/76. Details of the
phasing, are at Annex 4.
2.13      Initial production at Yfbongo would be in 1972/73 and at Eseka in
1973/74. Mill construction would be deferred to delay opening until 1974/75
and 1975/76 respectively to avoid heavy investment in capacity that would be
underutilized. Production prior to mill commissioning would be transported
to and processed at the SOCAPALM owned Edea mill. Allowance is made in re-
vised costs for the costs of transportin- fruit from Eseka and Mlbongo to Edea.
1/   Fresh fruit bunch (ffb) is the prcduct of the oil palm.  Each ffb is a
large cluster of fruits, and each fruit comprises a nut containing the
palm kernel which is surrounded by oily flesh from which palm oil is
extracted.

2.19      The Mbongo factory is financed by CCCE and FAC.  Contracts for the
machinery and civil works were signed in June 1972. A French company, Speichim,
will supply the machinery and equipment and ENAT has been contracted to under-
take the necessary civil works. Costs for the two first phases, each of 10
ton/hr capacity, which would be constructed in the project development period
are CFAF 719.1 million (US$2.8 million), see Annex 4. Total cost for the 30
ton/hr capacity is CFAF 754.1 million (US$2.9 million). This compares with
the appraisal estimate of CFAF 467 million (US$1.8 million) for an 18 ton/hr
factory. Thus a 67% increase in Mbongo mill capacity is accompanied by a 62%
increase in costs.
2.20      The Eseka mill would be financed by the Bank, and would be completed
to full capacity within the project development period. iCosts are estimated
at CFAF 380.0 million (US$1.48 million) for a 12 ton/hr factory, compared
with an original appraisal estimate of CFAF 467 million (US$1.8 million) for
an 18 ton/hr factory. Thus, while capacity has been reduced by one-third,
costs have been reduced only by 19%. Provision for constructing and equip-
ping a mechanical workshop has been included in revised project costs to
enable SOCAPALM to perform more civil works, fabrication and repairs on
its own account in order to reduce investment and operating costs.
2.21      Experience shows that the time required for the preparation of
specifications calling for tenders and the beginning of construction of a
palm oil mill is about 18 months. To guarantee timely start of construction
and to avoid price increases through delays in tendering, assurances were
obtained during negotiations that SOCAPALM would call for tenders for the
Eseka mill not later than March 1, 1973.
I. M4anagement Staff
2.22      As foreseen in the original appraisal report, there have been
difficulties in finding Cameroonians with experience in modern estate prac-
tice and commercial oil palm production. However, it has been possible to
replace the expatriate initially appointed as manager of Mbongo with a
Cameroonian and in-service training is being provided to upgrade subordinate
staff. Annex 5, Tables 1 and 2 give details of staff and labor requirements.
2.23      Detailed estimates of staffing costs are in Annex 5, Tables 3 and
4. Not all of these charges will be borne by the project, since as shown in
Annex 5, Table 4, they will be shared with the new developments which SOCAPA12
proposes to undertake. Total costs for management staff charged to development
are reestimated at CFAF 282.7 million (US$1.1 million). This compares with
CFAF 229.4 million (US$896,000) estimated at appraisal. 0f the difference
of CFAF 53.3 million, about 50%, CFAF 27.0 million (US$106,000) is explained
by the extension of the project development period and the remainder by
underestimation of salaries and inflationary factors.



8 -
2.24      Requirements and costs of subordinate staff arc given iii Annex 5,
Tables 2 and 3.  Physical requireaients are about the same as at appraisal,
and revised costs are CFAF 130.0 million (US$703,000), compared with CFAF
151.5 million (US$592,000) estimated at appraisal. Of the difference of
CFAF 28.5 million (US$111,330) CFAF 16.3 million is accounted for by the
extension of the project development period, and the remaining CFAF 12.2
million by underestination of costs and inflationary factors.
2.25      Overhead charges in revised project costs amount to CFAF 231.5
million (USS904,300) compared with CFAF 35.5 million (US$334,000) originally
estimated. The difference of CFAF 146.0 nillion (US$570,000) is large and
only CFAF 11.5 aillion a result of the extension of tlhe project development
period.  Tne bulk of the remainder (CFAF 134.5 million)  is due to renting
accommodation for headquarters staff and offices rather than locating them
in quarters built on the estates under the project. Renting proved neces-
sary at the beginning of the project when it became clear that it was advis-
able to centralize the administration in Douala to recruit local staff, to
purchase and import materials for two widely separate estates and to foster
relations with Government agencies. Furthermore the road between the nearest
estate 'vbongo and Douala is interrupted by a river with only a limited ferry
service which causes considerable delays. Other factors which contributed
to the cost overrun on overheads were underestimating and inflation.
2.26      As described in para 2.12 provision has been made for the construc-
tioni of a warehouse including office space at Douala. The Administrative
Manager would continue to live in Douala to be responsible for Lhe office
and warehouse. It is considered essenitial, however, that the General Manager
and other senior neadquarters staff (as these are recruited) should live on
an estate. Provision has been made in revised project costs for the con-
struction of sucli accommodation.  Assurances were obtained during negotia-
tions that thle General Mlanager would move to an estate once the plantations
presently being established are sufficiently c1eveloped to permit such trans-
fer, subject to thie results of a studv to be carried out under the supervi-
sion of the Goverumeint and according to tears of reference satisfactory to
the Bank.
J. Miscollaneous
2.27      Cost increases for vehicles and equipment amount to CFAF 172.8
million (US8675,000) over the estimate at appraisal of CFAF 62.6 million
(US$253,000). About CFAF 44.0 million of the increase is due to extension
of the project development period, CFAF 56.0 million to inflationary fac-
tors and CFAF 72.8 million to underestimation of physical requirements.
Annex 5, Table 5 gives the schedule of requirements.
2.28      Costs of topographic surveys and the construction of various
drainage structures and bridges amounting to CFAF 120.9 million (US$472,266)
were not foreseen at aDpraisal. The overrun has been been caused by the



-9-
inadequacy of th.e soil and topograpuic survey at Eseka which led to addi-
tional survey needs at Mbongo. The high costs of drainage structures and
bridges at Eseka sten partly from the same cause since the initial survey
failed to indicate the difficult terrain at Eseka.
K. Organization
2.29      Societe des Palmeraies de Abongo et d'Eseka (SOPA2IE') was formed
on November 23, 1968 to own and manage the two estates. The status and
objectives of SOPAME conform with those proposed in the original appraisal
report and were agreed with the Bank.
2.30      Government's second five year plan (1971/72-1975/76) calls for the
establishment of two new palm oil estates at Dibombari and Edea (see Mbongo
Map), and Fonds Europeen de Developpement (FED) has been asked to provide
finance for this purpose. FED has agreed in principle to provide financing
but reserves its final decision until the results of this reappraisal and
especially of the examination of domestic demand and supply for palm oil
are known, (see paras 4.04 and 4.08). Under the plan 6,000 ha of oil palms
would be planted at Dïbombari and 500 ha at Edea. SOPACOR would own and
manage these new estates. Accordingly, Government changed the name of the
company from SOPANE to Societe des Palmeraies du Cameroun Oriental (SOPACOR)
in January 1972. Following the establishment of a unitary form of govern-
ment, the name of SOPACOR was changed to Societe Camerounaise de Palmeraies
(SOCAPALM) in December 1972. In the light of the examination of the supply
and demand projections, it is proposed that the Bank should not object to
SOCAPALM assuming responsibility for the Dibombari and Edea developments.
Bank agreement to the assumption of expanded responsibilities by SOCAPALM
is required under Section 5.10 of the original loan agreement.
L. Technical Support and Supervision
2.31      As proposed in the original appraisal report, SOCAPALM has
contracted IRHO to provide technical assistance. This contract runs until
January 1975. IRIIO advice has proved to be satisfactory in agronomic
matters.  Ilowever, IRRO advice has not sufficiently takeri into account
considerations of cost efficiency. As a result, cost overruns have occurred
otl land clearing. Continued IRLO advice on agronomic and mill technology
is essential and it is proposed that the present technical assistance con-
tract be continued. IRHO's attention has been drawn to the importance of
cost efficiency to avoid the type of mishap that has occurred in the past.
2.32      The appraisal report proposed additional technical supervision
through a Visiting Agent; to some extent this stemmed from the Bank's
awareness of IRHIO shortcomings on cost issues. The individual selected as
Visiting Agent was employed by the Cameroon Development (orporation (CAIDEV).
Due to his workload, however, the extent and value of his supervision has



- 10 -
been inadequate and new arrangements are essential. It was agreed during
negotiations tlhat SOCAI'ALM would engage and pay for a management consulting
agency or visiting agents, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, to carry out regular inspections cf its estates factories and services,
and to report to the Government, the Colenders, the Bank, and SOCAPALM Board
of Directors on such inspections. Draft terms of reference for the agents
are at Annex 6.  In a recent referendum the electorate voted for a unitary
form of Governnent rather thaln the present Federal system. Following this
the large 32,000 ha CAMDEV operation will become the direct responsibility
of Central Covernrnent. CAMDEV, together with the ongoing and planned SOCAPALM
operations, constitute a Central Government-owned estate sector of about 47,000
ha.  Currently, Govermnrent does not have staff with experience either to plan
the sector or to mnonitor its progress or efficiency. If it had such ability,
it is probable that SOCAPAL]f managemer.t would have been more efficient than
has been the case.  CAI4DEV is managed by the Commonwealth Development Cor-
poration (CDC) of the United Kingdom.  While there have been failings on the
part of CDC, a greater appreciation by the Federal Government of CA@DEV prob-
leins probably would have enabled greater efficiency at CAMDEV. The CDC con-
tract ends on December 31, 1974 when alternative arrangements for management
of CAIMD"V will have to be found.
2.33      The Governmient of the United Republic of Cameroon has recently re-
organized its tiinistries and has created a Ministry of Agriculture which will
allow a strengthening of the supervision of the publicly owned estate sector.
During negotiations it was agreed that details of organization and an organ-
ization chart relating to the structure of the new Ministry of Agriculture
would be sent to the Bank, and agreed further that the Government would ex-
change views with. the Bank on the best way of using and improving the new
structure to meet the organizational and supermZ-sion requirements of the
industrial plantations in which the.Government controls a majority of shares.
2.34      Following the establishment of a unitary form of Government, it is
possible that substantial benefits would accrue from the amalgamation of
SOCAPALI1 and CAMDEV. If the Dibombari and Edea developments take place, the
two groups of estates will be physically contiguous, and there would be many
cases where the duplication of staff, equipment and services could be avoided.
Consequently, during negotiations, Government confirrned its intention to iai-
tiate, as soon as appropriate and after consultation with the Bank, a study
of all the possibilities for cooperation, coordination of management and in-
tegration in the public estate sector and to fonnulate action proposals which
would take into account the conclusions of such study.



III.  COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS,
PROCURFIENT AND DISBURSEI4ENTS
A. Cost Estimates
3.01      In the following table project costs estimated at appraisal in
1968 are compared with project costs re-estimated in 1972.. At appraisal
project costs included all development costs and operating losses through
1975 and capitalized interest on the Bank loan. The project was not ex-
pected to be self-financing until 1978 but since the cumu:Lative deficit for
1976-77 amounted to only CFAF 100 million (US$400,000), Government agreed to
provide the short term funds to meet this deficit rather than contracting
long term loan commitments.  Under the revised financing arrangements (see
paras 3.05 through 3.09) cash deficits would not arise. To achieve this
and to ensure adequate working capital from self generated funds the proj-
ect period has been extended to cover the 9 year period 1968/69 througn
1976/77.  Revised project costs include all development expenditures through
1976/77 and capitalized interest on the existing Bank loan. Project costs
through June 1972 have been converted into US$ at an average rate of CFAF
270lUS$ based on actual disbursemeints; all subsequent costs have been con-
verted at current exchan-e rate of CFAF 256/US$. The physical timing and
implementation envisaged at appraisal have not substantially changed.

3.02      Of the. estimated CFAF 1.495 million (US$5.8 million) increase in
project costs, about CFAF 230 million, (15%) is accounted for by the proposed
extension of the project development period and CFAF 53 million (US$0.2 mil-
lion) for the provisior. of a warehouse and workshop facilities not envisaged
at appraisal. If appraisal estinates are adjusted to cover the same nine
year period now proposed, and costs of warehouse and workshop are excluded
the total cost overrun falls to CFAF 1.212 million (USS4.7 million), and its
principal components are as follows:

Annex 7, Table 1, gives a detailed comparison between appraisal and revised

1,153 million (US$4 million at current exchange rate).
3.03      In the following table revised project costs are summarized and
broken down into foreign exchange and local currency components. Detailed

Revised estimates are based upon actual costs incurred where appropriate; costs
of the Mbongo mill are those agreed upon in the contracts signed for its con-
struction; and costs of the Eseka mill are based on the costs of a similar mill
under construction in Malagasy. Costs for land clearing are based on a formula
combining land and mechanical clearing that was agreed with SOCAPALM during
negotiations. Revised costs include a physical contingency of 5% per annum,
and a price contingency of 5% compounded annually on both local and foreign
costs.

B.  Financing Arrangements
Original Financing
3.04      The original project cost of CFAF 3,463 million (US$14 million
at 1969 exchange rate) was finanzed as follows: a Bank loan of US$7.9
iLllion at 6-1/2% for 20 years with a grace period for principal of 10
years during which interest is capitalized; a CCCE loan.of CFAF 443 million
(US$1.8 million equivalent) at 4.0% interest with a grace period of 9 years:
a FAC grant of CFAF 443 millior (US$1.3 million equivalent) and a Government
cash contribution in the form of share capital of CFAF 611 million (US$2.5
million equivalent). The Bank loan covered 57% of project costs as estimated
at appraisal, the CCCE loan and the FAC grant 24% and Government the remain-
ing 19%.
3.05      The original financing was approved in April 1969.  At that time
the official dollar exchange rate was CFAF 247; in August 1969 it was in-
creased to CFAF 273 and in August 1971 it was reduced to CFAF 256. Disburse-
ments to June 30, 1972 were made at an average of CFAF 270 to the US dollar
and subsequently at the current rate of CFAF 256. As a result the total
funds available in CFAF under the original financing have increased by CFAF
172 million, about US$0.6 million at the current exchange rate. This is
taken into account in the proposed supplemental financing plan.
Proposed Supplemental Financing
3.06      After taking intu account the extra funds in CFAF available under
the original financing (see para 3.05) the amcant required to finance the
cost overrun of CFAF 1,495 million (US$5.3 million) is CFAF 1,323 million
(US$5.2 million). It is proposed that thrLs would be met as follows: a sup-
plemental Bank loan of US$1.7 million (CFAF 435.2 million); a grant from FAC
of CFAF 205 million (USSO.8 million equivalent); a loan from CCCE of CFAF 290
million (US$1.1 million eluivalont)  a Government contribution of CFAF 350
million (USS1.4 million equivalent); and CFAF 43.1 million (USS168,000 equiv-
alent) from self-generated funds. The revised financing plan assumes that
the terms of the existing Bank and CCCE loans and the FAC grant remain un-
changed, that interest on the proposed supplemental Bank loan would not be
capitalized and that adequate working capital would be available.
3.07      The supplemental Bank loan would have a term of 14 years including
5 years of grace for principal and would be repaid 1978/79 through 1985/86.
It would be made to SOCAPALM and would be disbursed 1972/73 through 1976/77.
3.08      The Government would receive a FAC grant of CFAF 205 million, and
CCCE would make a loan of CFAF 290 million to the Government at 4.5% over
11 years including a five-year grace period for principal. Government would
pass on the FAC grant and CCCE loan to SOCAPALI on the same terms as charged
to Government. Grant and loan would be disbursed during 1972/73 through 1976/
77 and the CCCE loan would be repaid 1978/79 through 1983/84. Assurances were



- 15 -
obtained from the French aid agencies that the FAC grant would be disbursed
before the CCCE funds; consequently, the first disbursement of the CCCE sup-
plementary loan would not be until 1973/74.
3.09      Governnent's cash contribution would be in form of equity.  Costs
include indirect taxes amounting to CFAF 153 million (US$0.6 million), see
Annex 7, Table 3. If this amount, which eventually revert:s to Government,
is excluded from Government's financing share of the cost overrun, its total
contribution would be reduced to CFAF 880 million. In order to guarantee
SOCAPALM sufficient working capital, Government would make its contribution
during the period 1972-1975. Assurances to this effect were obtained during
negotiations together with assurances that Government wouLd provide any ad-
ditional short-term funds needed by SOCAPALI4 in the project development
period.
3.10      In summary the project would be financed as follows:

A cash flow for the project is at Annex 7, Table 4.  It is estimated that by
1979/80 the annual cash surplus would be about CFAF 230 million (US$0.9 mil-
lion) and thereafter substantially higher. This would be available for dis-
tribution, subject to working capital requirements and provision for invest-
ments in new developments and eventually for replanting.

C. Procurement and Disbursement
3.11      With the exception of the Mbongo mill which is financed by FAC and
CCCE all goods for the project would be procured by internlational competitive
bidding. Disbursements from Loan 593 CM and the supplemental loan would cover:
- The c.i.f. cost of imported goods or a percentage of total
expenditures (representing the foreign exchange component
of goods acquired locally);
- 100% of total expenditures for design, installation and
construction of Eseka oil mill, ancillary installations
and buildings;
- 55% of total expenditures for land clearing and 40% of
total palm planting expenditures.
A schedule of estimated disbursements is at Annex 8. Disbursements
from the supplemental loan would not commence until the proceeds of Loan 593
CM are fully disbursed. It is proposed that any surplus funds should be
available for cancellation.
Accounts and Audit
3.12      Full accounts are kept by SOCAPALM and are subject to annual ap-
proval by the Minister of Planning and Development. A private auditing
firm, Fiduciaire France Afrique Cameroun, has been employed to audit SOCAPALM
accounts and this arrangement is proving satisfactory.
IV.  PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND ESTATE OPERATING REISULTS
A. Project Yields and Production
4.01      When the project was appraised it was estimated that maximum yields
would not exceed 13.5 tons/ha ffb. Since appraisal, four years of results at
the La Dibamba IRHO station, which is adjacent to Mbongo, have become avail-
able. These indicate that at Mbongo and Eseka, yields of 15 tons/ha ffb can
be expected, as indicated in Annex 9, Table 1. Briefly, it is now estimated
that yields at both estates would increase from 5 tons/ha ffb in the fourth
year after planting to 15 tons/ha in the eighth, remain there until the twenty-
sixth year and decline over the following 4 years to 10 t1ons/ha.
4.02      On the basis of these new estimates, the two estates at maturity
would produce about 140,000 tons of ffb annually, yielding about 28,000 tons
f--palm oil and 6,000 tons of palm kernels at extraction rates of 20% and 4.7%
respectively. Annex 9, Table 2 shows projected production at Mbongo and Eseka.
Projected production coincides roughly with the original appraisal forecast
since higher yields would be offset by the reduction in hectarage.



- 13 -
B. Marketing and Prices
4.03      Domestic consumption of palm oil in the Cameroon has been increasing
faster than was estimated at appraisal. At that time total consumption in
1980 and 1985 was forecast to be about 73,000 tons and 83,000 tons respect-
ively. A revised demand analysis indicates that total consumption will be
about 10,000 tons above the original estimates. Annex 10, Tables 1 and 2
give estimates of the production, consumption and export of palm oil and
palm kernels.
4.04      Tle appraisal estimates of production of palm products took into
account only projects for which finance was likely to be forthcoming. Con-
sequently, they excluded production from the proposed developments at Dibombari
and Edea (see para 2.30). In this report, production estimates have been re-
vised to include all planned projects, including Dibombari and Edea, whether
or not financing has been secured. The revised estimate indicates that in
the period 1980-85 production would be about 15,000 tons/year higher than
forecast at appraisal. However, due to the higher consumption estimate,
yearly exports in the same period would be only about 5,000 tons/year higher
than appraisal estimates. Consequently, it is now estimated that Cameroon's
exports of palm oil in 1980-85 would be about 32,000 tons/year, about 28%
of total Cameroon production, or about 1% of world exports at that time.
After 1985 exports would presumably decline.
4.05      Palm kernel production in Cameroon is not expected to increase
since the increase in production from commercial estates will be compensated
by a decline in output from wild palms, see Annex 10, Table 2.  Privately
owned kernel crushing capacity is being enlarged and by 1974 all kernel
production will be processed in the Cameroon into palm kernel oil and
expeller cake. It is likely that by 1985 all palm kernel oil production
will be consumed locally for edible and manufacturing purposes.
4.06      Domestic prices for palm oil, currently CFAF 65,000/ton, are sub-
stantially higher than export prices and it is Government policy to maintain
this situation through import licensing and tariffs.
4.07      The world market price forms the basis for the economic analysis
of the project. The world palm oil price is expected to decline from a pre-
sent level of about US$220/m ton cif Europe to US$160/m ton in terms of 1972
dollars in 1976. The price used in the economie analysis is a weighted
average of the export price (used for exports) and the import substitution
price, used for palm oil consumed locally. The import substitution price
used is the cost to Cameroon of importing palm oil and is based on the world
price. By 1976 it is projected that the import substitution price would be
about CFAF 39,000/ton. Project income estimates based on export and import
substitution prices are in Annex 10, Table 3. For the financial analysis
of the project, a weighted average price of the projected export price and
the domestic price is employed. The latter is projected to decline from
CFAF 60,000/ton in 1972 to CFAF 50,000/ton in 1977. The projected financial
income of the project based on export and domestic prices is in Annex 10,



- 19 -
Table 4. Since the position concerning the domestic consumption of palm
kernel oil and cake is less clear than that of palm oil in both economic and
financial analyses, it is conservatively assumed that all project palm kernels
would be exported as kernels at a price of CFAF 25,700/ton.
4.08       If the proposed developments at Dibombari and EdLea go ahead, pro-
duction at these estates would start in 1975. Without this expansion the
projected exports from Cameroon would be considerably lower and after 1985
exports would have ceased. The country would then have to import in order
to keep per capita consumption at projected levels. Thus in order to main-
tain self-sufficiency in palm oil production, Cameroon will have to continue
expanding its palm oil development. In order to avoid some bunching of ex-
ports during 1977 to 1985 there could be advantages in postponing implementa-
tion of the Dibombari and Edea developments. However, since the quantities
involved are comparatively small and the production trend of smallholders
and private estates over optimistic, there is no adequate justification to
delay developments at Dibombari and Edea.
4.09       Since export prices in future will be lower than prices obtained
on the domestic market, it will be necessary for GovernmerLt to administer
an equitable pricing system between the major producers - SOCAPAL11, CAMDEV
and PALMOL, a private company. Assurances were obtained dluring negotiations
that the Governnment would carry out, or commission, not later than June 30,
1974, a study of the problems of marketing palm oil and palm kernel on the
Cameroon's dual market in order to determine and implement; the most economic
and equitable distribution of market outlets among producers of palm oil and
kernel in the Cameroon.
C. Estate Operating Results
4.10      Projected operating accounts and balance sheets for SOCAPALM are
at Annex 11, Tables 1 and 2. The operating accounts show that first profits,
before corporate tax, but after loan interest charges, would arise in 1976/77
when they would amount to about CFAF 80 million (US$313,000) and gradually
increase to CFAF 500 million (US$ 2 million) annually.  Cumulative losses
of CFAF 348 million (US$1.4 million) would be eliminated by 1979/80 and,
subject to distribution of profits, substantial sums of caLsh would accrue
from 1981 onwards.  The operating accounts have been charged with straight-
line depreciation, using a 25 year life for mills, 3 years for vehicles, 10
years for temporary houses and equipment, and 40 years for permanent houses.
Plantation development costs are amortized over 25 years after deduction of
fifty percent of land clearing costs as representing the value of the land.
Profits and cash avàilability after 1980 would be sufficient to enable pro-
vision to be made for replanting. The financial rate of return from invest-
ment in the project is estimated as 10%. (see Annex 12).

V. I3ENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      About 600 families and 1,000 single workers are being drawn out of
subsistence farming into the cash economy, and are acquiring valuable skills.
Such workers are receiving social services, such as health and education,
far superior to those enjoyed previously.
5.02      The average estate worker earns about CFAF 60,000/year.  This is
almost double the income, includiug subsistence consumption, of the average
rural family. (Annex 12, Table 2).
5.03      The project is contributing to the diversification of Cameroon's
agricultural production and exports. About 80% of the latter comprise two
crops, cocoa and coffee. At maturity, the project would generate about
CFAF 390 million (US$1.5 million) in gross foreign exchange earnings an-
nually and save about CPAF 730 million (US$2.9 million) in foreign exchange
expenditure annuallv on vegetable oil imports.
5.04      The original appraisal report indicated that the project would
have a substantial impact on the agricultural economy of Cameroon. This
remains true. The economic rate of return from investment in the project
is estimated at 12%, see Annex 12, Table 1. Major assumptions include (a)
the palm oil and palm kernel prices discussed in para 4.07 and yields in
para 4.01; (b) exclusion from the cost stream of 50% of labor housing costs
because project housing would be at least 50% superior to the housing, which
the labor force would enjoy without the project, and the benefits of the im-
proved housing are excluded (see Annex 12); (c) a shadow wage rate equivalent
to 50% of the cash wage rate since the alternative employment opportunities
provide an income which is only about half as large as project wages (Annex
12, Table 2); and (d) a shadow rate of exchange of CFAF 320 = US$1 or 25%
above the current official exchange rate (CFNf 256 = US$1).  This is con-
sidered to be the real value of the CFAF in the Cameroon. Sensitivity to
a change in the level of benefits and costs was tested; if, in addition to
a fall in benefits by 10%, costs were ta rise by 10%, the rate of return
would fall to about 3.8%.  If the analysis were based on the current rate
of exchange, full wage rates, and the full costs of labor housing, the eco-
nomic rate of return would be 10%. The economic rate of return estimated at
appraisal assumed lower yields and was based only on the lower export price.
It was calculated without employing shadow costs at 7.6%. Excluding the pro-
duction of the proposed palm oil development at Dibombari and Edea would
reduce exports and consequently raise prices towards the import substitu-
tion price level. The economic rate of return for the project would then
increase by 0.4 percentage points.

VI.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      The revised project would be financially and economically sound
and suitable for a supplemental Bank loan of US$1.7 millioDn.
6.02      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following points:
(a) the additional 1,500 ha for the expansion at MboDngo would
be transferred from Government to SOCAPALM without charge
(para 2.06);
(b) tenders for the Eseka mill equipment would be called for
not later than March 1, 1973 (para 2.21);
(c) the General Manager would move to an estate once the
plantations presently being established are sufficiently
developed to permit such transfer, subject to tlhe results
of a study to be carried out under the supervision of the
Government and according to terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank (para 2.26);
(d) SOCAPALM would engage and pay for a Management Consulting Agency
or Visiting Agents, under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank to carry out regular inspections of its estates, fac-
tories, and services and to report to the Government, the
Colenders, the Bank and SOCAPALM Board of Directors on such
inspections (para. 2.32);
(e) the Government would send to the Bank details of organization
and an organization chart relating to the structure of the new
Ministry of Agriculture and the Government would exchange views
with the Bank on the best way of using and improving the new
structure to meet the organizational and supervision require-
ments of the industrial plantations in which the government
controls a majority of shares (para 2.33)
(f)  the Government would initiate as soon as appropriate and after
consultation with the Bank a study of all the possibilities
for cooperation, coordination of management and integration
on the public estate sector and formulate action proposals which
would take into account the conclusions of such study (para 2.34).
(g)  the Government would make its contribution to financing the
supplementary costs during the period 1972/1975 and would
provide any additional short term funds needed by SOCAPALM
in the project development period (para 3.09); and
(h) the Government would carry out, or commission, not later than
June 30, 1974, a study of the problem of marketing palm oil
and palm kernel on the Cameroon's dual market in order to



- 22 -
determine and implement the most economic and equitable
distribution of market outlets among producers of palm
oil and kernel in the Cameroon.

CAMEROON OIL PALM PROJEGT
Economic and Financial Rate of Return Calculaition
1.        Table 1 shows details for the econoiTic and financial rate of
return analysis. The following assumptions have been usedl in the calcula-
tions:
(a) Project Life
The life of the project including clearing, planting and
exploitation îs 31 years. Production 6tarts in the fourth
year after planting (fifth year after clearing).
(b)  Exchange Rate
For the economic rate of return all foreign costs and
benefits are converted at an exchange rate of CFAF 320
for 1 dollar, which is 25% above the current rate.  This
is considered the margin by which the CFAF is overvalued.
In the sensitivity analysis the official exchange rate of
CFAF 256 = US$1 is also used. For the financiajL rate of
return, the official rate of exchange was used to convert
foreigu exchange costs and benefits.
(c)  Costs
Costs are based on the experience gatned during the first
tlree years of the project.
(i)  Labor:  For the economic rate of return analysis, a
shadow rate of 50% îs assumef( for labor wages. The
alternative employment of project labor is subsistence
farming. Income from this activity in esti!natedl at about
CFAF 39,000/year as Table 2 indicates. This is about half
the wage incomie (CFAF 79,000/year) of project lacbor. For
tlhe financial rate of return, labor is costed at full wage
rates.
(ii) Housing: For the economic rate of return labor housing
is charged only 50% of costs because project housing would be
at least 50% superior to the housing whlch the labor force
would enjoy vithout the project and these addlitional benefits
are also excluded. For staff housing, full construction costs
are charged. For the financial rate of return analysis, labor
housing is charged at full construction cost.
(iii) Road Construction: Road construction costs are charged
fully to the project.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
(d) Benefits
(i) Yiclcds; Yields are based on trials by IlhllO and
e.:nqrieiïcc gained witli sn,,dilar plantin- material in the
Cameroon.
(ii) Prices:  For the economic rate of return analysis, a
weighted averiav- price eoinpose' of ani export price: and
inport substitutior, price for pal1m oil are iIS tt. bath
prices are has-d on a constant 1972 cif Europe price of
lrSSlffG0/m ton.  1,!eightc' are the respective estimated
relative share: of exports and doriestic consuiripti.on on
total productiûn in the Caiierron.  For palw kernels only a
const.3nt 31972 export prica of US$135/m ton clf Europe uas used
since ratonestic deTmanf projections are (difficuJt at tlhis tira.
It is liL-ely, now-le».cr, that paliml hernel oil prices otl the
dornestic market would be igher than th1ose on export riarkets.
Details of price  'aiC  atThns are i_l Tables 3 an,] /i.  For
the finar;ciai rate of returr analysis, a wei,;hted avera,e
price cpnsistint  of an export price and ti1e project:e  <lomestic
price for pail, oil was used.  The donestic price is the pro-
jected price for which palm oil is sold in'the Cameroon.
Table 3 indicates details. Weights are the same as in the
economic rate of return analysis.  For palm kernels, t'le
same irice as in the economic rate of retuirn analysis is tusL`d.
(e)  Contingencies
Economic costs include a 5% per year physical contingency on
all cost excluding factories coats throughout the establishment
period (1968/69-1976/77). In the financial analysis a price
contingency of 5% compounded annuaily on all costs încluding
factories costs for the project period had been used in addition
to the physical contingency of 5% per year during the establish-
ment period.
(f)  Taxes
rne economic rate of return analysis is net of all taxes.
The financial rate of return analysis includes initernal
taxes but éxcludes ir.nrt duties and taxes in the establish-
ment period since this is in line with Coverniment practice te
grarnt tiport tax and duity exeinrption during the establishment
perirnd.
(g) Export Duties
An export duty of CFAF 1,350/n tons is applied on palm oil
e7 norts ind CFA;F 1 759/m  ton on palm kernel exports.  In the
economic rate of return analysis, export duties are treated as
a benefit.  In the financial rate of return analysis export
duti-es ara treatre(  as a cost.
