INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THIE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON, A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL LOAN
TO SOCIETE CAMEROUNAISE DE PALMERAIES (SOCAPALM)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON FOR
THE OIL PALM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
supplemental loan to Societe Camerounaise de Palmeraies (SOCAPALM), to be
guaranteed by the United Republic of Cameroon, for the equivalent of US$1.7
million to help finance a cost overrun of the revised Cameroon Oil Palm
Project, for which the Bank made a loan (No. 593-CM) of US$7.9 million in
1969. The supplemental loan would have a term of 14 years, including five
years of grace, with interest at seven and one-fourth percent per annum.
Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) would make a grant equivalent to US$0.8
million for the project and Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
a loan equivalent to US$1.1 million with a term of 11 years including 5 years
of grace, with interest at 4.5 percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The report "The Recent Economic Development of Cameroon, No. AW-39a,
was distributed to Executive Directors on October 19, 1972. An updating
economic mission and an agricultural sector mission are tentatively scheduled
to visit Cameroon in April/May 1973.
3.        Cameroon is endowed with varied, although not abundant natural
resources. The country has good agricultural potential based on a range of
soils and climatic conditions which permit the cultivation of a number of
export crops. The economy, however, is still vulnerable to fluctuations in
the output and price of its two main exports, cocoa and coffee.
4.        Cameroon's rural areas sustain 80 percent of the population mainly
in agriculture. There is no evidence of serious malnutrition, although a
careful study of the condition of the rural population is needed. However,
there are wide income disparities within rural areas and between the rural
and urban populations--rural incomes are about 50 percent of average per
capita GNTP (US$180). Development strategy, therefore, should concentrate
increasingly on raising rural productivity and developing the smallholders'
sector. The opportunities in agriculture lie in tropical commodities for
export, substitutes for imported agricultural products, and improvements in
output, marketing and processing of traditional foods to meet the needs of a
growing urban population.



- 2 -
5.        Rapid urbanization is taking place and Cameroon's urban population
is expected to rise from 20 percent of total population in 1970 to 38 percent
by 1985. The rapid shift in population from rural to urban areas, particu-
larly to the two main cities, reinforces the need for an effective rural
strategy. Rapid urbanization has also increased the need for a national urban
settlements policy, including measures to cope with rising urban underemploy-
ment and inadequate public services. Industrialization is an essential part
of a balanced rural-urban strategy. Industrial opportunities lie in process-
ing agricultural and forestry products for export, and in producing import
substitutes (particularly intermediate products and consumer goods) needed
for the growing domestic market.
6.        Also fundamental to exploiting Cameroon's development opportunities
are investments to overcome the serious transport bottleneck which has ham-
pered the development of some of Cameroon's more promising regions.
7.        During the first decade of Cameroon's independence (1960-70), the
Government made a successful start in tackling some of these development
problems. Considerable progress was made in the establishment of a basic
transport and communications network. Output of agriculture, industry and
commerce grew rapidly. Real growth during the first decade of independence
reached six percent a year, which was well ahead of population growth. Until
recently, however, economic management was complicated by a top-heavy federal
structure which had three separate administrations (the Federal and two State
Governments) with fragmented responsibility for public services and develop-
ment. Creation of the United Republic of Cameroon in May 1972 opened pros-
pects for better programming of available domestic and foreign financial re-
sources in relation to economic and social development priorities and for
more efficient project preparation and implementation.
8.        Cameroon's third five-year Plan (1971/72-1975/76) was announced at
a time when exports prospects had deteriorated. Since early 1970, Cameroon's
terms of trade have been declining and in spite of some recovery of cocoa
prices the outlook for primary export crop prices and output is now less favor-
able than it has been in the recent past. Furthermore, private investment
based in the past on substitution of imported consumer goods has levelled off
and may not resume until the opportunities for the next, more complicated
phase of industrialization can be exploited. In the light of these develop-
ments, the Plan's investment target of CFAF 280 billion (US$1.1 billion),
70 percent more than in the last Plan, appears ambitious. Total development
spending of CFAF 200 billion, of which half would be public, would appear
more in line with availability of domestic and foreign capital, and absorp-
tive capacity.
9.        With reduced growth rates, public savings are likely to be well
below the estimates of the new Plan. Recently, Cameroon was able to generate
adequate current budgetary surpluses, amounting to 2.2 percent of GDP, to
f'inance an expanded current expenditure and to cover a rising capital budget.
In addition, Treasury resources were increased by the sharp rises in stabili-
zation fund reserves during a period of high export prices. In 1971/72, the



-3-
current budget surplus is forecast at about CFAF 9 billion, the same as in
1970/71; receipts are levelling off because of reduced export values and
current spending is continuing to rise. The current surplus is sufficient
to cover debt service and the regular capital budget. However, in the last
year and a half, some large new investment projects have been authorized
outside the budget and are to be financed directly from stabilization fund
reserves. In 1971/72, the draw down of reserves may have amounted to ScGme
CFAF 10 billion. Although the stabilization funds are no longer supportLng
domestic prices, it is clear that total public investment cannot be continued
at the 1971/72 high level.
10.       While plan priorities are basically correct  and most of the
proposed investments are desirable for Cameroon's development, the pace of
plan execution will have to be reviewed in the light of available resources.
In the past, Cameroon has followed sound fiscal and monetary poxlicies and,
when similar financial problems occurred in the mid-Sixties, the Government
curtailed expenditures and exercised the necessary discipline to 'Live within
its means.
11.       As yet, Bank Group lending accounts for a small proportion of
Cameroon's external debt of about US$230 million as of December 13, 1971.
Due to our relatively recent involvement, only US$31.2 million out of US$79.8
million in commitments has been disbursed so far. Cameroon's ability to make
an effective use of external resources, and the Government's dedication to
development are reasons for increasing Bank Group support.  Although debt
service is still low (currently 4.5 percent of export earnings, about 6.5
percent by 1976/77), the country can support only modest increases in its
hard-term debt. Expected lower growth of export earnings spells years of
slimmer public savings. At the same time, the volume of high priority proj-
ects in the public sector is rising. Under these conditions, a rapid increase
in debt service charges should be avoided and most of external financing
should therefore be on concessionary terms. Given the limited scope for rais-
ing public savings in the next few years, donors,including the Bank Group,
should be prepared to finance a high proportion of projects costs. For proj-
ects with a high local currency component, such as certain agriculture and
education projects, the Government might not be able to finance the total
amount of local expenditures and in these cases the Bank should be willing to
include in its financing also a proportion of local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
12.       Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
as of December 31, 1972, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now total almost US$80 million.
The loans and credits outstanding cover nine projects: three in agricul-
ture, three in transportation, two in education and one in public utilities.
Agriculture, transportation and the other sectors taken together have ab-
sorbed about one-third each of the total amount of our past commitments.
Projects have generally been satisfactorily implemented, although consider-
able delays have occurred in some cases.

13.       The Bank Croup's strategy for the future is to support the Govern-
ment in its efforts to equip the country with infrastructure, to accelerate
rural development and to increase the efficiency of Cameroon's institutions.
14.       When Cameroon became independent its transport infrastructure was
appreciably less developed than in most other West African countries. In
its first Development Plans, the Government gave priority to the improvement
of its transportation system and particularly to the construction of a long
north-south rail and road link which was aimed at helping unify the country,
enabling the benefits of economic development in the South to spread to the
less developed Northern Region and strengthening Cameroon's position as a
regional transit center. This program is nearing its end and the Garoua-
Mora road, which will be included in our next road project to be presented
to the Executive Directors by mid-1973, constitutes the last missing link
in the north-south transport route.
15.       Transport will continue to represent an important proportion of
future public investments and Bank Group lending in Cameroon. lie have under
consideration a possible railway modernization project and, more importantly,
the expansion of Douala's port capacity, which are essential to enable Cameroon
to fully realize the benefits of its agricultural and forestry potential.
Beyond these projects which we hope to present to you during FY 74, we plan
to identify other high priority transport investments in access roads in rural
areas and in the large southeastern forestry zone.
16.       Investments in agriculture have so far been affected by the weakness
of government agencies responsible for project preparation and implermientation.
The Government has recently stepped up its efforts to formulate viable rural
development programs and we have under consideration a cocoa rehabilitation
and planting project (FY 74) in the southern region as well as a livestock
project (FY 74) in the northern central region, which will benefit an as yet
untouched segment of Cameroon's population. We are also exploring with the
Government new ways of raising output and productivity in rural areas; we have
begun to study ongoing integrated agricultural development projects to de-
termine their relevance to the country's agricultural problems and prospects
and an agricultural sector survey is scheduled for April 1973.
17.       Following the recent action to give the country a unitary structure
there are good prospects for improving the effectiveness of agricultural
services with the creation, within either the Planning Department or each main
Technical Ministry, of units responsible for project preparation and supervi-
sion with which we propose to work closely.
1i.       Bank Group assistance to Cameroon is provided in close cooperation
with other donors, France and the EEC representing the major sources of for-
eign assistance to Cameroon. The proposed supplemental loan is a good example
of this collaboration.

PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
19.       As in many other West African countries the agricultural sector is
dominant in the Cameroonian economy, providing a livelihood for 80 percent
of the population and producing over 80 percent of the country's foreign ex-
change earnings.
20.       While two crops, cocoa and coffee still account for 75 percent of
the value of agricultural exports, Cameroon is making good progress in di-
versifying its economy. In addition to the two major cash crops (cocoa and
coffee), bananas, palm oil and kernels and some rubber are produced in the
South and cotton in the North. Among food crops, rice production is increas-
ing. Forest exploitation is also a large source of income and foreign ex-
change.
21.       Agricultural production comes mainly from many family smallholdings,
most of which are between one and three hectares. Food crops are frequently
interplanted with cash crops. In the eastern part of the country, practically
all agricultural produce, other than palm oil and rubber, is derived from
over 600,000 smaltholdings and plantations are scarce: they include SOCAPALM's
oil palm plantations, a private rubber plantation and some small sugar-cane,
banana and coffee plantations. Larger industrial plantations are found
in western Cameroon, where the Cameroon Development Corporation (CANDEV,
a state corporation), has developed, partly with Bank/IDA assistance, about
30,000 ha comprising mainly oil palm and rubber, but also bananas, cocoa,
tea and pepper.
22.       Past Bank Group assistance to Cameroon has helped the country to
diversify its production. Our two first agricultural projects were to pro-
mote cultivation on large government-owned plantations of a variety of cash
crops, other than cocoa and coffee, in western Cameroon (CAMEFV) and of oil
palm in eastern Cameroon (SOCAPALM).  The latter is the project for which
supplemental financing is proposed. Nevertheless, Cameroon has still a
largely untapped agricultural potential and it is expected that current efforts
to develop the rural sector will lead to further diversification of our agri-
cultural operations.
23.       The Semry project approved in January 1972, aimed at developing
irrigated rice cultivation in the North, was our first operation supporting
smallholder agriculture. Two further projects now under active consideration
for cocoa and livestock development will give further support to integrated
rural development and smallholder operations.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
24.       In 1969 the Bank made a US$7.9 million loan (593-CM) to Societe
des Palmeraies de Mbongo et Eseka (SOPAIE) for an oil palm project.  The
project consisted of an oil palm planting program on two estates (Mbongo
and Eseka) totalliag 9,000 hectares and included construction of two oil
mills, roads, buildings and other infrastructure. Total project costs were
estimated at US$14 million equivalent and were financed by the Bank loan,
a US$1.8 million grant from FAC, a US$1.8 million loan from CCCE and a gov-
ernment equity investment of US$2.5 million. SOPAME was established as an
autonomous state-owned corporation. Its name has since been changed twice,
the last one being Societe Camerounaise de Palmeraies (SOCAPALM).
25.       Considerable difficulties were experienced during project execu-
tion. The original plan called for planting of 4,500 ha of oil palms at
Mlbongo and 4,500 ha at Eseka. IThile the Mbongo site proved to be satisfac-
tory, it became apparent, after the start of field operations at Eseka, that
swamps, ravines and numerous small streams made land-clearing more costly
than originally estimated and that the objective of planting 4,500 hectares
at Eseka would not be attainable. The mechanical land-clearing method rec-
ommended by the consulting firm proved to be overly expensive. Overhead
charges largely exceeded appraisal estimates because SOCAPALM had to rent
expensive headquarters in Douala. This location had been selected to
strengthen relations with Government in the initial phase of project
execution. The cost of oil mills and other items increased due to price
inflation. Finally construction of a warehouse in Douala, which was not
contemplated in the original project, was found necessary for economical
storage and distribution of fertilizers, building materials, mechanical
equipment and spare parts.
26.       To offset the reduction in plantings at Eseka, additional areas
were surveyed at Mbongo and found suitable. It was therefore proposed to
expand the Mbongo plantation by 1,500 ha to a total of 6,000 ha, while only
2,500 ha would actually be planted at Eseka. This in turn required expan-
sion of the oil mill capacity at Mbongo to cope with the increased plantings
there as well as the higher yields per hectare wwhich are now expected.
27.       These proposals and the overall problem of the cost overrun on
the project were discussed by the Bank with the Government, FAC and CCCE.
The Bank and the colenders recognized that the Government would find it very
difficult to cover the financing gap, at a time of declining public resources
resulting from a weakening in world cocoa prices. Although the borrower's
management had occasionally proved insufficiently cost conscious its overall
performance had been reasonably good: the planting program had been carried
out promptly and efficiently and the standards of maintenance were high.
Ta addition, the Government was prepared to adopt measures to reduce invest-
ment and operating costs and to improve its supervision of the plantations

sector. Agreement was reached on changes to be made in the project scope
and the revised project was appraised in May-June 1972 1/. Negotiations for
a supplemental loan were held in Washington with a Cameroonian delegation
headed by His Excellency, Mr. Tchoungui, Cameroon's Ambassador to the United
States. FAC and CCCE were also represented.
The Revised Project
28.       'fhe revised project, as now proposed, would consist of:
(a) establishment of about 8,500 ha of oil palm, of which about
6,000 ha at Mbongo estate and about 2,500 ha at Eseka estate;
(b) construction of a palm oil mill on each of the two estates
with capacities of 20 tons/hour at Mbongo and 12 tons/hour
at Eseka, respectively;
(c) building of a warehouse and office at Douala; and
(d) provision on each estate of necessary roads, buildings and
other infrastructure.
In connection with the project, the Government has also undertaken:
(a) to arrange for visiting agents to inspect the SOCAPALM planta-
tions in detail, to report on their findings and to suggest
any necessary improvement to the Board of SOCAPALM, the Gov-
ernment and the Bank;
(b) to exchange views with the Bank with regard to the oil palm
smallholder development programs to be undertaken by SOCAPALM;
(c) to initiate a study of improvements of the palm oil and
kernels marketing system; and
(d) to exchange views with the Bank on the best way of strength-
ening the organization and supervision of its industrial
plantations through the newly created Ministry of Agriculture;
and to make a study of the possibilities for cooperation, co-
ordination and integration in the industrial plantations
sector.
1/   Re-appraisal Report No. 8a - CM dated January 22, 1973 is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. A Loan and Project Summary is
given in Annex III of this report.



29.       In 1969, total project costs had been estimated at US$14 million
equivalent. Following the 1972 reappraisal, total project costs are now
estimated at USS19 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of
US$12.2 million. This represents an increase of US$5.8 million (including
US$0.6 million of taxes) over the present-day dollar equivalent of the 1969
estimate. The following table shows the breakdown of the incremental cost
(in US$'000):
Cost Estimates

Total            13,19  /      19,038            5,840
Financing Plan
30.       As a result of fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate above
the 1969 parity, the total funds available in CFA francs under the original
financing have increased by CFAF 172 million, equivalent to about US$0.6 mil-
lion. After taking into account these extra funds, the amount required to
finance the incremental cost of US$5.8 million is US$5.2 million equivalent.
It is proposed that this would be met as follows: a supplemental Bank loan
of US$1.7 million equivalent; a FAC grant ar.d a CCCE loan of respectively
US$0.8 and 1.1 nillion; and a Government equity contribution of US$1.4 million
and US$159,000 from SOCAPALM's self-generated funds. The supplemental Bank
loan would have an amortization period of 14 years including 5 years of grace.
The CCCE loan would be for 11 years including 5 years of grace and would bear
interest at 4.5 percent. Wlhile the Bank loan would be made to SOCAPALM, the
FAC grant and the CCCE loan would be made to the Government and passed on to
SOCAPALM on the same terms. The revised financing plan assumes that the terms
of the existing Bank and CCCE loans and the FAC grant remain unchanged, that
interest on the proposed supplemental Bank loan would not be capitalized and
that adequate working capital would be available.
31.       In the proposed financing plan, the Bank would finance 33 percent
of the cost overrun, FAC and CCCE 37 percent and Cameroon 30 percent. This
1/   Today equivalent of the 1969 estimate, taking into account that the
exchange rate has altered and that disbursements have been made at rates
higher than the rate anticipated in 1969 (CFAF 247/US$).



- 9 -
would bring total Bank, FAC/CCCE and Cameroon contributions to about 50 per-
cent, 28 percent and 22 percent respectively of total project costs. In
the 1969 financing plan, the Bank was expected to contribute about 57 percent,
FAC and CCCE about 24 percent and Cameroon about 19 percent of project costs.
Economic Justification
32.       As revised the project would contribute to the diversification of
Cameroon's agricultural production. At full development it would generate
about US$1.5 million annually in gross foreign exchange earnings on exports
and save about US$2.9 million annually in foreign exchange expenditure on
imports of vegetable oil. It would also provide fuller and more remunerative
employment to about 600 worker families and 1,000 single workers previously
involved in subsistence farming. The project would also lead to better health
and education services.
33.       The economic benefits to be derived from the project would actually
be appreciably higher than estimated in 1969 since increased costs would be
more than offset by increased benefits:  domestic consumption of palm oil
exceeds the original forecast and the bulk of project production would be
consumed locally and is therefore valued at the import substitution price,
which is higher than the export price originally taken for calculation of
benefits. Thus the economic return on the investment which was estimated
at 7.6 percent in 1969 is now expected to be about 10 percent without shadow
pricing and about 12 percent with appropriate shadow pricing.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       With the exception of the Mbongo oil mill which is financed by
FAC and CCCE, all goods for the project are to be procured by international
competitive bidding. Provisions are made allowing SOCAPAIM to grant a margin
of preference to preferred domestic manufacturers in bid comparisons. Dis-
bursements from the proceeds of the 1969 Loan and the Supplemental Loan would
finance:
-    the c.i.f. cost of imported goods or a percentage of total
expenditures (representing the foreign exchange component
of goods purchased locally);
-    100% of total expenditures for machinery and equipment for and
design, installation and construction of the Eseka oil mill,
ancillary installations and buildings, as had been agreed
under the 1969 Loan;
-    55% of total expenditures for land-clearing and 40% of total
palm planting expenditures.
35.       The consolidated Bank loan would be disbursed over the period
1968/69-1976/77. The FAC supplemental grant and the CCCE supplemental loan
would be disbursed during 1972/73-1976/77, but the FAC funds would be with-
drawn first.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTIIORITY
36.       The draft Supplemental Loan Agreement between the Bank and Societe
Camerounaise de Paimeraies, the draft Supplemental Guarantee Agreement be-
tween the United Republic of Cameroon and the Bank, the Report of the Commit-
tee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) or the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Supplemental Loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
37.       To the extent possible, the Supplemental Loan Agreement incorporates
by reference the substantive provisions of the 1969 Loan Agreement. In addi-
tion, the following features are of particular interest:
(a) provision has been made for the merging into a Consolidated
Loan Account of the proceeds of the 1969 Loan and the Supple-
mental Loan, and for the exhaustion of the proceeds of the
1969 Loan before withdrawals on the Supplemental Loan can
begin (Section 2.02 of, and Schedule 1 to, the Supplemental
Loan Agreement);
(b) to the extent necessary to assure consistency between the
Supplemental Loan Agreement and the 1969 Loan Agreement,
the latter has been amended (Section 10.01 (a),.(b), (c)
of the Supplemental Loan Agreement) and cross remedies have
been provided (Sections 8.02 (a), (b), (c), (d) and (g),
8.03 and 10.01 (e) and (f) of the Supplenmental Loan Agree-
ment);
(c) the effectiveness of the Supplemental French Agreement and
the Supplemental Caisse Centrale Loan Agreement, and the
approval by the Bank and subsequent execution and delivery
of the agreement between the Borrower and the Guarantor
defining the terms and conditions for the transfer of pro-
ceeds of the two aforementioned Agreements are made additional
conditions to the effectiveness of the Supplemental Loan
Agreement (Section 9.01 of the Supplemental Loan Agreement);
(d)  provisions are made for the suspension of disbursements and
acceleration of repayment of the Supplemental Bank Loan in
connection with the suspension of disbursemeAts or accelera-
tion of repayment of the Supplemental French Grant and the
Supplemental Caisse Centrale Loan (Sections 8.02 (a), (b),
(c) and (d) and 8.03 of the Supplemental Loan Agreement).
38.       I am satisfied that the proposed Supplemental Loan will comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

B.   PROJECTS INT EXECUTION
Performance under existing loans and credits has been generally
satisfactorv, though there are some difficulties. CAMDEV Project; UTS$11 mil-
lion Credit No. 100 of March 28, 1967: Closing Date:  June 30, 1972; and
US$7 million Loan No. 490 to CAMDEV of same date; Closigj Date:  December 31,
1974: Project implementation is satisfactory but funds have been seriously
depleted by cost increases due to general inflation, lower than expected
yields, the fall in rubber prices and excessive overheads. Disbursements for
this project are slightly behind schedule. Government has agreed in principle
to economy measures to reduce expenditure. A new contract is being negotiated
for the continuation of the present managing agency arrangements with COMDFV
until December 31, 1974.  Oil Palm Project; US$7.9 million Loan No. 593 to
Sopame of April 15, 1969_CloslLn__ate:  Deceiber 31, 1976:  This is the
project for which supplemental financing is being preposed.  W4ater Supply
Project  US$5 million Loan N1o. 604 to SNEC of June 2, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1972 (Intermediate Closing Dates: May 31, 1972; September 30,
1972): This project was completed ahead of schedule with substatitial savings
which have been approved for investment in further water distriburion works;
however, disbursements have lagged due to the strong working capital position
of the borrower and the closing date has been postponed twice in order to
allow remaining funds to be disbursed.  Nevertheless, there was still an un-
used balance of US$218,000 by December 31, 1972. First Education Project;
US$10.5 million Credit No. 161 of September 23, 1969,; Closing Date: June 30,
1974: This project is about 12 months behind schedule due to delay in ap-
pointing consulting architects and the need to call for new bids for 14 proj-
ect schools in the South after revisions of the proposed design xyhich were
accepted by the Government. Construction of the schools in the North is ex-
pected to be completed in October 1973. The new bids for the schools in the
South were accepted by the Association and the contracts were expected to be
signed in January 1973. All contracts are within appraisal estimates and con-
struction of the schools in the South is expected to be completed early in 1974.
Highway Project; US$7 million Credit No. 130 of March 27, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1973- and US$12 million Loan No. 663 of same date. Closino, Date:
December 31, 1973: :This project had a slow start due primarily to adminis-
trative delays on the part of the implementing mininistries. By December 1971,
however, all construction and consultants contracts had been signed and since
then work has been proceeding satisfactorily.  Railway Project; US$5.2 million
Loan No. 687 to REGIFERCAM of June 9, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974:
Project execution is progressing very satisfactorily as far as delivery of
motive power and rolling stock is concerned. Track renewal work over one
section has been delayed by six months due to a strike of personnel of the
contractor. Unforeseen technical difficulties, such as extremely bad nature
of the subsoil of the river, make a further study necessary before selecting
the optimum design of the railway bridge at Japoma near Douala and it is
likely that new bids will have to be invited which may lead to an extension
of the closing date of June 30. 1974. The dtaft economic study of the pro-
posed realignment of the Douala-Yaounde main line has been discussed with the
Government and RECIFERCAM and will be finalized in February 1973. Douala Port
Proiect; US$1.5 million Credit No. 229 of January94, 1971; Closing Date:



ANNNEX I
Page 3
June 30, 1973: After considerable delay in starting the project, largely
because of institutional changes required and time consuming Government pro-
cedures involved, the project is now proceeding satisfactorily. The revised
estimated date for full credit disbursement is December 1973, 12 months later
than originally planned.  SETRY Rice Project; US$3.7 million Credit No. 302
of April 26, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976: This project was approved
by Executive Directors on January 25, 1972, was signed on April 26 and be-
came effective on July 28, 1972. The project is proceeding satisfactorily.
Second Education Project; US$9 million Credit No. 320 of June 28, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979: This credit was approved by Executive Directors
on June 20, 1972. The date of effectiveness had to be postponed successively
to November 15, December 31, 1972, January 31 and March 30, 1973 from the
original date of October 2, 1972. The latest extension was necessary in order
to allow the Government to arrange for the employment of consultant architects.
