TROPICAL TREE CROP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 1672-PAN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
1.       This document is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the
Tropical Tree Crop Development Project (Loan No. 1672-PAN). The total loan
amount was US$19 million and the loan was approved by the World Bank
Executive Directors on April 25, 1979, becoming effective on the same date.
Disbursements totaled US$10.9 million, US$8.1 million being canceled. The
final disbursement was on December 20, 1986.
2.       The PCR was prepared by an FAOICP mission from Rome which visited
Panama in October 1987. The PCR is based on identification and preparation
reports PAOICP 48177 (December 19, 1977), the IBRD final appraisal report
(2161-PAN, February 28, 1979), and the IRHO appraisal report ('Projet
Palmier de Bar,., January, 1979). Also examined were the records of the
project's presentation to the World Bank Executive Directors, the Bank's
correspondence with the borrower and internal memorandums, the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements, and supervision reports. The borrower (BNP), through
its Project Coordinating Office, prepared a draft completion report
providing statistical and financial data on project investmeni and Impact.
In particular, the draft provided financial, technical and production
information based on data gathered in the field, and these were used to
construct the three models for the financial and economic analyses. This
project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.
3.       The project completion report was sent to the Borrower on
October 20, 1988. Coments were received from the National Bank of Panama
In November 1988, including valuable information on the coffee and cocoa
production techniques presently in use in the country, and are attached
as Annex 4.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PANAMA
TROPICAL TREE CROP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 1672-PAN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.       The Tropical Tree  Crops Development Project wa tl,e fourth
agricultural op-ration to be financed by the Bank In Panama having
been preceded by two fisheries and one livestock operation. The loan
becam  eff-ct$vo in April 1979 and was closed in September 1986 after
a 15-month extension.
Obiectives
ii.      The purpose of the Troplcal Tree Crop Development Project was
to provide loams and technlcal assistance to small-scale farmers in
order to lnerease exports of traditional crops such as cocoa, coffee
and bananas, and to maintain the level of supply to the domestic
market, whille increasing the range of production by developing oil
palm output. The project was to provide loans fort (a) renovation
and establishment of 2,000 indivldual coffee and cocoa plantations;
(b) establishment of 1,000 ha of banana plantattions (e) development
of 3,000 ha of oil palm plantations on 16 asentmientos; (d) construc-
tion of a palm oil procossing  plant.   An additional purpose wms to
provide technical assistance, equipment and vehicles In order to
upgrade the  producers'  techncal skils  and  ncrease the sub-bor-
rowers' productive capaclty.
ImolementatLon Experience
ILL.     Disbursements were spread over eight yers listead of the slx
years planned at appraLsal, for the following reasonas  (1) a slowdown
In disbursements for cocoa and coffee, eaused mainly by the lack of
government counterpart funds; (11) the cancellation of the banana
component, together with delays in the oil palm plantstion, dus to the
bankruptcy of COBAPA (the orgenisatlon originally responsible for
implementlng the banana and oil palm components); (i1i) the govern-
mant' fallure to take decision  on  the construction of the palm oil
processing plant and on tho pattern of organization and anagement for
the plantations and for the plant itself; (iv) delays in hiring expa-
triate consultants because of time  overruns in the negotiations over



- vi -
costs, end problms In coordinating the various Institutions con-
corned.
iv.      The cost of the project wvs  calculated to be US$38 million,
of which the World  Bank was  to  finance  the US$19 million foreign
"echange component (i.e. 50S of total cost). The balance--after three
amendments to the Loan Agreement--was to be provided by BNP (US$6.61
million), the governmentIMIDA (US$5.75 million), the sub-borrowers,
and the possible sources of finance for the palm oil processing plant
(US$6.64 million).   Actual  disbursements  totalled US$10.9 million,
with US$8.1 million being canceled after tuo postponements of the
closing date.
Results
vs       The main  project  objectives were  only partially achieved,
since only 571 of  the  total was  disbursed.   The project benefited
about 2,305 produzers (932 of the projected total), i.e. 1,855 in the
coffee and cocoh components, and 450 In the oil palm component. The
area planted was 94% of that originally planned. As regards actual
i"cremental outputs In the case of cocoa thix exceeded projected
output by 431, bocmat  the  area  planted wa larger than expected and
yields (although delayed) were at the level calculated In the
appraisal (22 qq per ha).  As regards coffee, It is calculated that,
when the project is fully operational, incremental output will be 401
lower than projected, because the area planted was smaller than
originally planned,  and  yields  (35  qq per ha) are  smaller than
projected (41 qq per ha).   Aa  regards  palm  oil production, it is
expected that, even with a smaller area (500 ha), an output equal to
952 of that projected can be achieved once the project is in full
op*ration, because yiolds will be larger than originally calculated
(20 t per ha of fresh fruit instead of 18 t per ha). At 1987 farm-
gate prices, the total Incremental value of output, once the project
is In full operation, Is expected to be about US$6.9 million, compared
vith the projected US$18.8 million. This Is mainly due to declines in
International prices over the 1979-80 period (about 401 in real terms
for cocoa and coffee and 541 for oil palm).
VI.      Pinacial rates of return for the cocoa and coffee plantation
models ha  been calculated to be  41.71 and 20.4Z respectively, com-
pared with the 431 and 231 calculated previously. The financial rate
of return for the oil palm plantation is calculated to be 14.9Z, which
is co parable to the 151 projected at appraisal. However, this rate
will depend on the government's ability to maintain the farm-gate
price at Its current level. The economic rate of return for the proj-
ect was 13Z, compared with the projected 291. The main ressons for
this lower rate aro the inclusion of the unproductive costs of the
banana component and the margial economic rate of return on the oil
palm component, processing costs having been considerably higher than



- vii -
projected because the plant was not constructed. The latter rate for
the oll palm component to 5 51, compared with the appralsal projection
of 131.
vii.     It is clear  that  the  satisfactory agricultural performance
(allowing for delays in achieving objectives) was coupled with some-
times marginal institutional porformances during appraisal and imple-
mentation. The local agencies and the Bank did show flexibility in
their approach to implementation problems, agreeing to transfers of
financing among the project categories, postponements of the closing
dte, and adjustments in activities affecting the execution of certain
components; nevertheless, certain misjudgments are evident in project
organisation and management, and in the financial appraisal of COBAPA
and the efforts of local agencies to identify management formulas for
the plantations and th4 palm oil processing plant.
Suatainabilitv
viii.    The coffee  and  cocoa  components  apper  fully sustainable
given that the investments are in the hands of suallholders who have
been shown to be getting good financial rates of return. The long
term outlook for the oil palm investments is more problematic, in the
absence of a local palm oil processing plant.
lindinas and Lessons
iX.      The following lessons can  be  learned from this project, and
should be applied when future projects are prepared and appraiseds
-    In projects such as this, which involve several participating
agencies, a pattern of organization and management must be
found to ensure that each is properly integrated into the
execution process. For example, BNP acted as a financing and
coordinating agency, but without having any respondibility
for execution.   This  made  its  relationship with the other
ins.itutions difficult.
-    Institutional analysis of the  organizations should always be
rigorous, and be particularly concerned with their financial
capacity. This :l especially true of institutions dealing in
goods subject to international price fluctuations. The case
of COBAPA is instructive.
-    In the case of  organixations  involving  both the public and
private sectors, a strict plan of operations--or at least an
agreement jointly binding the various participating institu-
tions--should be established before project approval. A more
rigorous approach such as  this  would have been fully justi-
fled In the case of the processing plant.



PAINAMA
TROPICAL TREE CROP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 1672-PAN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The macroeconomic indicators from the time of the appraisal show how
important the agricultural sector is to the national economy. In 1978, its
share of GDP was 16S. From 1972 to 1977, Agricultural GDP increased at an
average rate of 2.11 per year, compared with an overall GDP increase of 4.1%.
From 1975 to 1977, about 422 of the total value of agricultural exports
(US$127 million) consisted of tropical crops such as coffee, cocoa and
bananas, and the 1978 trade balance for this sector was positive.
1.2       Perennial crops such as bananas, coffee and cocoa have always been
regarded in Panama as the most suitable types for export. From 1976 to 1978,
the total area devoted to these crops was about 37,500 ha, with bananas
occupying 13,300 ha, coffee 21,500 ha, and cocoa 2,700 ha. Over the same
period, oil palm was introduced, the total area devoted to this crop being
1,000 ha. Nationwide, yields per unit for these crops (i.e. about 35.5 t per
ha for bananas and 4/5 qq per ha for coffee and cocoa on plantations between
10 and 5 years old) left sufficient room for improvement to justify investment
in these activities.
1.3       1978 statistics show a total population of 1.83 million, with 50%
living in rural areas, producing a per capita GDP of B 200 per year, i.e.
about 65: lower than the national average. As regards land tenure, in the
1970s about 72. of farms (442 of cultivable land) were without titles.
1.4       During the same period, the government defined the following
agricultural objectives in the 1976-1980 Development Investment Plan:
-    to maximize the agricultural contribution to the economy through
import substitution and promotion of exports;
-    to increase employment, income and standards of living in the
sector, with particular attention to the poorer farmworkers;
-    to improve the socioeconomic balance between urban and rural areas
in order to counteract the rural exodus;
-    to reclaim and conserve land, organizing marginal farmers and thus
incorporating them into modern production systems.
1.5       Prompted by the socioeconomic developments in the sector and by the
economic trends reflected in the GDP from 1976 to 1980, the government decided
in 1977 to use a World Bank loan for developing those farms and priority crops
which, in previous years, had received less attention and financing. One of
its main concerns was to meet the demand for credit from the banana, coffee
and cocoa subsectors, and to develop oil palm production.

II. FORL4ULATION
A. Identification, Appraisal, ADoroval and Formalization
2.1       Project identification and preparation was by a MIDA working group
that included a representative from the BDA Planning Department.. The group
received assistance from the FAO-World Bank Cooperative Program, with two
missions visiting the country in May 1977 (identification) and in
October/November 1977 (preparation). The.overall project design--as later
approved, with few changes, by an IBRD appraisal mission--is detailed in
Report FAO/CP 48/77 PAN of December 5, 1977.
2.2       Project appraisal was performed by an IBRD mission that visited
Panama in February/March 1978. IBRD appraisal report No. 2161-PAN was
completed in February 1979. Although some of the Bank's Executive Directors
expressed reservations concerning the inclusion in the project of the palm oil
processing plant, the component was retained in the project, which was
approved on March 13, 1979. The Loan and Guarantee Agreements were signed on
April 25. 1979 and formalized on the same date.
B. Project Objectives and Description
2.3       The following were the gain project objectives:
-    promoting regional development and its favorable effects on
migration within the country;
-    increasing exports (bananas, coffee and cocoa) and reducing imports
(oils and fats), thus supplying domestic demand in a manner more
consistent with the country's increasing needs;
-    increasing the range of products and encouraging producers to
develop nontraditional tropical crops, such as oil palm;
-    creating new sources of employment and increasing income levels,
while integrating asentamientos and small-scale producers into
modern production systems.
2.4       According to the Loan Agreement between the Government of Panama and
the World Bank, the Project was to consist of the following components:
Part A: Making of Sub-loans to Sub-borrowers for Investment Plans consisting
of:
(i)    renovation and maintenance of about 1,000 ha (sic) of coffee
plantations of an average size of one to three hectares, including
the survey and titling of land;
(ii)    development, renovation and maintenance of about 1,000 cocoa
plantations of an average size of one to five hectares, including
the acquisition and utilization of inputs, small equipment and
tooLs, and the survey and titling of land;
(iii)    fermenting and drying facilities for cocoa.
Part-B: Making of Sub-loans to Sub-borrowers for Investment Plans consisting
of development of about 1,000 hectares of banana plantations including:



-3-
(i)    construction and maintenance of an irrigation and drainage system;
(ii)    improvement of about 4.5 kilometers of railway tracks on the banana
plantations;
(iii)    construction and equipping of packing sheds and warehouses;
construction of about 30 (sic) houses for Project technicians and
Sub-borrowers;
(iv)    acquisition and utilization of equipment related to items (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv) above, and vehicles for the field technicians.
Part C:   1.  Making of Sub-loans to Sub-borrowers for Investment Plans
consisting of development of about 3,000 hectares of oil palm plantations,
including:
(i)    construction of a drainage system, feeder and collecting roads, a
germinating house, a warehouse, and about 12 houses for technicians;
and
(ii)    acquisition and utilization of agricultural equipment, including
tractors and field work equipment, and vehicles for the field
technicians.
2. Making of a Sub-loan to finance construction of an oil palm
processing plant with a capacity of about 10 metric tons of fresh fruit
bunches per hour, including:
(i)    construction of the plant's building, warehouses and houses for the
technicians and provision of water and electricity;
(ii)    acquisition, ins 3llation and utilization of the processing
equipment and machinery; and -
(iii)    acquisition and utilization of laboratory equipment, field work
equipment including tractors and dump trucks and vehicles for the
plant technicians.
Part D: Technical Services:
(i)    Provision of technical assistance and training, including a
monitoring and evaluation system for Part A of the Project,
demonstrations, short-term courses, seminars, study tours and
on-the-job training of local technicians and Sub-borrowers under
such Part A, and acquisition and utilization of vehicles and
equipment for such extension services.
(ii)    Provision of technical assistance and training to Sub-borrowers
under Part C (l) of the Project.
2.5       According to the Appraisal Report, the project was to benefit 2,000
cocoa and coffee producers, each owning an average of 2.5 ha and 1.3 ha
respectively.  About 640 producers grouped into 16 asentamientos and 410
representatives of four asentamientos were to benefit from the oil palm and



-4 -
banana plantations. These would be agrarian reform beneficiaries currently
having rights only to the use of land. Project beneficiaries for all four
crops totaled 3,050 producers, i.e. about 15,300 pFrsons.
C. Proiect Organization and Management
2.6 -    The Project Agreement established the following principles for
project organization and management:
-    Project financing was channeled through BNP which, as borrower, took
responsibility for overall supervis n and coordination of project
implementation.
-    BDA, as participating bank, took responsibility for implementing the
coffee and cocoa components, including: approval, allocation and
supervision of loans to beneficiaries, which could be discounted
with BNP.
-    COBAPA, as a BNP borrower, took responsibility for establishing,
managing and supervising the banana plantations to be established on
four asentamientos, two of which had already been formed into a
banana anterprise (EMBACH1). Under a management contract, COBAPA
was to provide overall management for EWBACHI, taking responsibility
for production and marketing until the plantations had been
completely developed.
-    In addition to the banana component, COBAPA took responsibility for
implementing the oil palm component in 16 asentamientos under two
different sets of management arrangements. In the first case, the
members of the asentamientos, as BNP borrowers, entered into a
contract to'sell their output to COBAPA in exchange for farming
materials and technical assistance. In the second case, the
interinstitutional arrangements between COBAPA and the members of
the asentamientos were the same as those already described for the
banana component.
-    It was also established that the government, through COBAPA, was to
be responsible for constructing a palm oil processing plant, with
private-sector participation.
-    Implementation of the technical assistance, training, consultancy
and supervision component in the various items was governed by
secondary agreements among BNP, BDA, COBAPA and MIDA.
D. Project Cost and Financing
2.7       Estimated total project cost was US$38 million.  The amount of the
World Bank Loan was US$19 million, corresponding to the foreign exchange cost
(i.e. 50S of the total). Under the Loan Agreement, the other parties
undertook to provide the following financing: BNP, US$11.7 million; the
government, US$5.3 million; the remaining Sub-borrowers, US$2 million.



-5-
tIl.  IMPLEMENTATION
A. Key Aspects
3.1       The Loan Agreement was signed on April 25, 1979 and became effective
on the same date. Nevertheless. because of delays in compliance with the
preliminary conditions for disbursement, the project became effective on
July 30, 1979, i.e. three months later. The causes of these delays were as
follows:
-    the secondary loan agreement between BDA and BNP;
-    the secondary technical assistance agreement between BDA and MIDA;
-    the hiring of field personnel by MIDA;
-    the secondary technical assistance agreement between BNP and COBAPA;
-    the establishment of a specialized Oil Palm Division by COBAPA;
-    the hiring of specialists in palm oil production and processing.
3.2       The cost structure contained in the 1672-PAN Loan Agreement was
amended on four occasions to permit transfers among categories. In May 1982,
because of COBAPA's financial collapse, BNP and the World Bank agreed to
cancel the banana component and redistribute an undisbursed total of
US$1.140,910 among the cocoa component (US$304,340), the coffee component
(US$606,570), and technical assistance (US$230,000). The second amendment
(January 1985) enabled the government to complete an economic and financial
study for the establishment of a palm oil processing plant, by transferring
US$100,000 from the "contingencies" category to the "consultants" category.
In May 1986, the third change authorized additional investment for completing
the palm plantations, and transferred US$400,000 from the "contingencies"
category to the oil palm category. The final change was made in February 1987
because it had proved impossible to find any means of establishing the palm
oil processing plant. Consequently, it was agreed to cancel the undisbursed
portion of the loan (US$8,093,815.42; see IBRD-BNP correspondence of
March 4, 1987), so that World Bank disbursements for the project totaled
US$10.9 million, i.e. 572 of the amount referred to in the Loan Agreement.
3.3       The closing date originally specified in the Loan Agreement was
June 30, 1985. Nevertheless, an initial extension to March 31, 1986 was
granted in order to permit the consultants (MAC) to complete an economic study
of palm oil production in Panama, and ensure that the government had
sufficient time to prepare for the selection of a firm to operate the proposed
palm oil processing plant. In light of the study's findings, an
Interinstitutional Committee was formed which completed the revision of the
economic study and presented an Action Plan to the government in March 1986.
As a result, a second extension (until September 30, 1986) was agreed in order
to enable the government to examine in detail the activities proposed under
the Action Plan. During this period, the government decided to renew its
processing contract with United Brands of Costa Rica, and abandon construction
of the processing plant. Some time later, a third application was submitted
(for an extension until December 31, 1987) but this was not accepted by IBRD.



-6-
Consequently, the official closing date remained September 30, 1986, and the
Bank undertook to reimburse all expenditures made before that date, provided
that applications were submitted by December 31, 1986. Project completion
was, therefore, 16 months behind schedule.
B. Execution of Components
Cocoa Plantations
3.4       The following tdble compares appraisal projections with actual
execution as of the closing date.
Item                               Appraisal               Actual

Average area (in ha)                                2.5                    3.2

Average investment per ha (in US$)              1,840                 1,875
3.5       During project implementation, 3,412 ha were planted, i.e. 1362 of
the appraisal projection (2,500 ha). Loans granted totaled 1,055, i.e. rather
more than the 1,000 planned. In general, these results were satisfactory. In
1983, financing for the cocoa component was increased (as was the case for
coffee) because of the larger size of plantations (3.2 ha compared with the
planned 2.5 ha). Consequently, investment costs were higher. Nevertheless,
investment costs per ha at project completion were approximately equal to the
appraisal mission's estimates (see Annex 2), because labor and fertilizer use
was less than originally planned.
3.6       At appraisal, it was expected that this component would be
implemented in three years. However, disbursements overran by four years, and
about 302 of the loans were made in 1986. The main reason for this delay was
the lack of government counterpart funds. This also affected the coffee
component.
3.7       The appraisal mis-:on had planned for 600 ha to be renovated.
However, this objective waz   t taken into consideration during project
execution, which was concerned only with new plantations, mainly on forest
land that had never previously been cultivated. This had a positive impact on
yields, since these reached the planned level of 22 qq per ha, even though
unsophisticated growing methods and small amounts of fertilizer were used.

Renovation and Maintenance of Coffee Plantations
3.8       The following table compares appraisal projections with actual
execution as of the closing date.
Item                              Appraisal                Actual
Total area (in ha)                             1,300                  1,131

Average area (in ha)                                1.3                   1.4
Total disbursed (in millions of US$)                3.87                  3.32
Average loan amount (in US$)                   3,865                 4,149
Average investment per ha (in US$)             3,420                  3,136
3.9       As mentioned before, a total of 1,131 ha were renovated, i.e. 872 of
the objective established at appraisal. As regards the number of loans, 800
sub-loans were granted (80Z of the appraisal objective). In general, these
results can be regarded as satisfactory. In April 1983, application was made
for increased financing for this component, and the Bank granted this because
of the larger average area per sub-loan (1.4 ha compared with 1.3 ha) and
because the unit value of investment was higher than calculated in 1978. The
figures analyzed by the FAO/CP mission (see Annex 2) show that investment for
the establishment of one ha-at constant 1987 prices-was 82 lower than
projected at 1978 prices, mainly because the activity was less labor-intensive
and consumed fewer fertilizers and chemical inputs than expected.
3.10      The appraisal established an implementation period of three years
for this component, but it overran by four years, the final disbursements
being made in 1986. In practice (see Annex 2, Table 3), about 28% of loans
were granted in 1979/80. This was the result of external factors such as the
increase in international prices from 1984 to 1986, and the breakdown in the
International Coffee Organization's quota system in March 1986. Nevertheless,
the main cause of the delay in execution of the coffee component was the lack
of counterpart funds, a problem referred to on several occasions by
supervision missions. The World Bank was informed by the October 1983 mission
that the government budget did not include a BDA appropriation for the coffee
and cocoa programs.
3.11      Some of the World Bank supervision mission reports indicate that, in
the initial years, BDA issued some loans for new plantations, contrary to
existing agreements. As a result, the scale was very smal; because-at the
Bank's insistence-the process was halted in the first two or three years of
the project.
Banana Plantations
3.12      The banana component was concluded on January 14, 1982, i.e. two and
a half years after effectiveness. As of that date, BNP suspended
disbursements of the sub-loan to COBAPA-EMBACHI, because of management and



8-
financial problems. During the brief implementation period, 57% of the
allocated financing was disbursed (US$1.559 million), and most of the
remainder was transferred to the coffee-cocoa sub-program and to the
"vehicles" category in the technical assistance component, under the April
1983 amendment.
3.13      Of the 1,000 ha planned in the appraisal, only 311 ha were developed
in the EMBACHI area. Actually constructed were 3 km of internal roads,- 7 km
of main drainage canals, 26 km of secondary canals, and 20 km of tertiary
canals, whereas the planned totals were 20 km, 25 km and 210 km respectively.
Improvements were not made to the 4.5 km of railroad tracks, but 28 km of
cable system were constructed for transporting the products to the packing
sheds, which were also installed. The irrigation system was not constructed,
and of the 120 houses planned for the project technicians, inspectors and
workers, about 20 were provided. Three aerial haulers, one grader and two
agricultural tractors were purchased.
3.14      Because of the failure to construct a suitable irrigation system,
the first 180-ha plantation area (brought into production in 1979/80) was so
seriously affected by the drought that the exporter, the Chiriqui Land
Company, refused to purchase the product because of its inferior quality. The
area has now been abandoned, and practically no part of it is being used for
banana growing. Similarly, those items of equipment and building that had
some salvage value were abandoned. Aside from COBAPA's financial problems,
the reason was ttat the farmers continued to regard themselves as hired
laborers (as was the case before the project) and did not develop the outlook
of responsible participants, while the management agency (COBAPA) did not make
sufficient efforts to change their attitudes.
Oil Palm Plantations
3.15      The following table compares appraisal projections with actual
execution as of the closing date.

1/   According to the IRHO feasibility study ("Bari! Oil Palm Project,"
January 30, 1979).
3.16      Of the 3,000 ha originally planned. 2,500 ha (83%) were developed.
This was mainly because of problems encountered in the selection of land
suitable for oil palm. These difficulties resulted from the type of land
tenure (i.e. ownership by individuals and not asentamientos) and soil toxicity
caused by excessive copper. This component was applied to 16 asentamientos,
i.e. all those referred to in the appraisal. Beneficiaries in the
asentamientos totaled 450 producers, i.e. 702 of the number originally
planned. Although the World Bank Appraisal Report for Loan No. 2161-PAN refers
(albeit without giving full details) to land titling for participating



-9-
asentamientos (see 7.03 of the Report), only four titles were granted during
the project period because of problems of coordination between MIDA and the
Agrarian Reform Institute.
3.17      The project appraisal did not provide full details of the planned
investment. Actual investment included construction of 24 km of drainage
systems, 65.5 km of access roads and roads for the transportation of products
(an additional 34.7 km of internal roads were rehabilitated), two facilities
(workshops and warehouses), and seven houses for field technicians, in
addition to the purchase of 20 tractors, agricultural equipment and 12
vehicles for field technicians. About 60 km of drainage works and 45 km of
roads were to complete investment up to 1988.
3.18      Disbursements for Loan No. 1672-PAN (US$8.3 million) continued, as
planned in the appraisal, until June 30, 1985, but without reaching the
projected level. A study by the February/March 1986 World Bank supervision
mission determined that, because implementation costs were higher than
projected in the appraisal, an additional US$1.9 million was required to bring
investment in the establishment of plantations up to the planned level. The
additional financing was provided under the May 1986 amendment, a'lthough it
was not disbursed because of the closure of the project.
3.19      The Appraisal Report projected an average implementation cost of
B 2,639 per ha, but in the IRHO feasibility study submitted on January 30,
1979 implementation costs were calculated to be B 4,600 per ha at 1979
prices. The record of costs submitted by Empresa Productora de Palma
Aceitera-Bara (the enterprise currently managing the palm project) indicated
that in the first seven years of operations a total of B 4,520 per ha was
spent, of which 852 (B 3,840 per ha) was for investment and maintenance, and
15% (B 680 per ha) consisted of administrative costs.
3.20      The Appraisal Report defined the following as the objectives of the
oil palm plantations component:
(i) development of part of the plantations on the asentamientos, with
responsibility for management and implementation being assumed by
COBAPA (later by MIDA);
(ii). development of another part of the plantations, with the
asentamientos themselves responsible for implementation under the
supervision of COBAPA and linked to this agency by an output sales
contract (i.e. an outgrowers scheme).
3.21      The second objective was not achieved, so that after COBAPA's
financial collapse, MIDA assumed total responsibility for execution, with the
representatives of the various participating asentamientos acting as workers
on the plantation. The sub-loan originally granted to COBAPA and assumed by
MIDA (under the April 1983 amendment) was not transferred to the
asentamientos, as provided for    the appraisal, because the investment had
not been completed before the closing date and because no decision was taken
on the percentage of investment to be guaranteed by the government as a means
of making the operation more financ!z*1*_4Atactive to the producers.



- 10 -
3.22      In 1986, thie first 1,000 ha of fresh fruit came into production.
The material used was Deli/Avros, which provides a yield of 18 tons of fresh
fruit bunches per ha, with a 20% extraction rate. These figures exceed boch
projected quantity (15 tons per ha) and quality (an extraction rate of
17.5%). Because the palm oil processing plant component was not executed, a
contract was signed between Lnited Brands of Costa Rica and the government for
processing the output from the project. Nevertheless, this contract will
terminate at the end of 1987, and-at least up to the time of the completion
mission's visit-no alternative plan had been prepared.
The Palm Oil Processing Plant
3.23      The component consisting of construction of a palm oil processing
plant was not executed. It was to have been implemented in two stages, the
first (from 1982 to 1983, i.e. ..e fourth and fifth years of the project)
providing a capacity of 1C metric tons of fresh fruit bunches per hour, and
the second (1985, i.e. the seventh year) providing a capacity of 13 metric
tons of fresh fruit bunches per hour.  The total investment cost was
calculated to be US$7.6 million, with the World Bank providing 50%.
3.24      During the project execution, a number of events occurred that
prevented implementation of this component. All of these have been detailed
in the various supervision reports. Nevertheless, in order to explain the
various reasons and justifications for events, the various actions taken
should be summarized, with respect to the three areas of this discussion:
(i)    economic and financial justification for the component and the
events pertaining to its execution;
(ii)    the action plan proposed for its execution;
(iii)    subsequent action.
3.25      Economic and financial justification was examined on several
occasions, and by various institutions: the World Bank, at the appraisal
stage; IRHO, in its feasibility study relating to the entire plantation
operation and the processing plant component (see the IRHO report of
January 30, 1979); and the Management Analysis Center (see the basic economic
study of December 1985). The various studies agreed on the financially
marginal nature of the operation, the internal rates of return being between
12% ard 15%, which did not ensure a sufficiently attractive level of
profitability for private investors. During negotiations it was agreed that
construction of the processing plant wculd also be financed from private
sector resources, in the expectation that the two existing refineries would
participate along with the small producers' organizations (see supervision
report of April 11, 1986). However, this did not happen, principally because
of the lack of interest in the private sector and because of the legal form of
the producers' associations, which did not allow them to be integrated with
other kinds of companies. The Government therefore proposed on November 29,
1983 to construct the plant through MIDA and transfer ownership gradually to
the cooperatives and settlements. This proposal was not considered
satisfactory by the Bank (see telex of December 16, 1983), which felt that a
publicly owned and operated enterprise could not be financed under the project.



'                                  ~~~~~~~~~~~- 11 -
3.26      Consequently, the Government of Panama established the Bar*u
Interinstitutional Committee on palm oil, that in March 1986 submitted to the
Government an action plan that included a list of measures to be studied
and/or adopted.  Regarding this plan, the World Bank considered (see telex of
February 13, 1986) that the following measures needed to be taken urgently by
the Government:
(i)    policies on fruit and palm oil in relation to the prices of imported
palm oil and other oils.  For example, according to World Bank price
projections, in 1986/87 the prices of imported palm oil were some 52
to 15% lower than the price of local oil, fixed by the Government at
B700/ton;
(ii)    the legal status of the palm producers' organizations with respect
to mortgaging property and assuming responsibility for the subloans
originally made to COBAPA;
(iii)    Government coverage of a minimum of 25% of the investment cost of
the palm plantatioas to keep reimbursements by possible borrowers
within their capacity to pay;
(iv)    establishment of appropriate forms of organization and management
for the plantations.
It was considered essential that these issues be resolved quickly if
the project was to be extended.
3.27      As stated in the supervision report of August 21, 1986 there were no
positive results from the Baru Committee Action Plan, in that, according to
information from the Ministry of Planning, the Government decided to abandon
construction of the processing plant and, as an alternative solution, extend
the contract with United Brands Company for the processing of all production
in Costa Rica. After a number of communications between the Government and
the World Bank it was decided (on September 20, 1986) to close the project.
However, as a result of the transportation of the fruit to Costa Rica and of
the oil back to refineries in Panama, and the dealings with a private company,
processing costs became approximately 100% higher than projected by IRHO in
its 1979 study.
Technical Assistance
3.28      Technical service activities consisted of supplying technical advice
and training for the sub-borrowers through short-term courses, demonstrations
and seminars. To this end, MIDA had--over the seven years up to the closing
date-assigned a total of 38 engineers and extension agents to the project,
the total cost being B 0.57 million, whereas the appraisal report regarded an
expenditure of B 0.27 million, 26 specialists and a period of four years as
sufficient. The technician/sub-borrower ratio was 1:44 for coffee and 1:53
for cocoa, whereas the appraisal report recommended 1:50 for coffee and 1:63
for cocoa. The results obtained in the field indicate that the technical
assistance activities were satisfactory and, if these efforts are continued,
yields are likely to be increased, particularly in the cases of coffee and
cocoa.



- 12 -
Consultants
3.29      Non-Panamanian consultants were hired on three occasions, one for
the coffee and cocoa components, and two to study the agricultural and
processing aspects of the oil palm component. The main responsibility of the
coffee and cocoa consultant was to support MIDA in the technological
development of cocoa production and in upgrading the technology used in coffee
production. As regards oil palm, on the first occasion technical assistance
was provided with respect to all growing activities and the management of
technicians and producers, together with the location and technical
specifications for the palm oil processing plant, and the preparation of the
international competitive bidding documents for the supply of machinery and
equipment. On the second occasion, the task was to determine the economic
feasibility of oil production in Panama.
3.30      For this item, 602 of the amount specified in the Loan Agreement was
disbursed, i.e. US$776,677, equivalent to 213 man-months. The hiring of these
consultants was repeatedly delayed, being four years behind schedule in the
case of the coffee and cocoa components, because of protracted negotiations
over costs and because a number of different institutions were involved.
TraininR
3.31      The Panamanian technicians received training in Panama and abroad
totaling 94.8 man-months, considerably more than the 16 man-months proposed by
the appraisal mission. The coffee and oil palm sub-borrowers also received
training to increase their outputs totaling 39 man-months. The total cost was
US$0.17 million, i.e. about 882 of the appraisal amount.
Monitoring
3.32      Contrary to the preliminary agreements, no monitoring unit to
receive technical assistance was ever formally established, and only a BNP
coordinating unit was set up, the principal function of this being to gather
information on the progress of the sub-projects. Expenditure on monitoring
totaled US$31,927, i.e. 46Z of the appraisal amount.
C. Actual Project Cost and Financing
3.33      The actual total cost of the project at its completion was
US$26.58 million, i.e. 70Z of the original calculation. The following table
summarizes the total cost, details of which are contained in Annex 3, Tables 1
and 2:

I/ In accordance with the Loan Agreement amendments.
3.34      Disbursements took longer than expected (see Basic Data Sheet),
mainly because of the slow start to the lending component and problems
relating to the banana plantation and palm oil processing plant. Overall, the
loan was effective for eight years, compared with the six-year implementation
period proposed in the appraisal. IBRD disbursements totaled US$10.9 million,
i.e. 57Z of the amount originally agreed.
3.35      The BNP cash-flow calculations (see Annex 3, Table 4) for the
1978-86 period show a negative cumulative cash balance of US$5.7 million, and
this trend is expected to continue until 1989. This is explained by the
overrun in disbursements, and by the consequent payments to IBRD of principal
and interest, which totaled US$8.7 million by December 1986, and also because
revenue from loan repayments were not received before 1983 and will not
terminate until 1993, compared with the 1979-89 period specified in the
appraisal.

IV. IMPACT
A. Agricultural Impact
4.1       During project execution, 7,353 ha were developed, of which 7,043 ha
are still in production, banana growing having been discontinued, as
previously mentioned. Overall, 902 of the planned objectives were achieved.
4.2       The following table rompares output increases achieved once the
project was in full operation with the output increases calculated in the
appraisal.

4.3       A comparison of actual incremental output with the appraisal shows
that the projections for cocoa were exceeded by 432 because of the larger area
planted and the yields, which-after a certain delay-will achieve the levels
calculated in the appraisal (22 qq per ha). Incremental output for coffee
(once fully operational) is expected to be 40% lower than projected, because
of the smaller area planted and also because the yields obtained were smaller



- 15 -
than planned (i.e. 35 qq per ha, compared with 41 qq per ha). As regards palm
oil production, although a smaller area has been planted (500 ha), it is
expected that--when fully operational--output will be 95% of the projected
level, because yields are larger (20 tons per ha of fresh fruit, compared with
18 tons per ha).
4.4       Once the project is fully operational, t'ie total incremental value
of output expressed in 1987 farm-gate prices is expected to be US$6.9 million,
compared with the projected US$18.8 million. This is mainly due to declines
in international cocoa and coffee prices that are equivalent to about 40% in
real terms, with 54% in the case of oil palm.
4.5       The project benefited about 2,305 producers, 1,855 in the coffee and
cocoa components and 450 in the oil palm component. Overall (assuming an
average of five persons per family), 11,560 persons benefited, i.e. 75% of the
appraisal projection. As regards employment, once the project is in full
operation, it will generate about 440,200 additional man-days, i.e. about 61%
of the projected total.
B. Financial and Economic Rates of Return
4.6       The financial rates of return for the cocoa and coffee plantation
models have been calculated to be 41.7% and 20.4% respectively, and are
comparable to the 43% and 23% originally projected. The financial rate of
return for the oil palm plantation is 14.9%, which is comparable to the 15%
projected in the appraisal. However, this latter result will depend on
whether the farm-gate price can be maintained at the current level, as
mentioned in Annex 2.
4.7       The project's economic rate of return is 13%, compared with the
projected 29%. The assumptions for this analysis are presented in Annex 2.
The main reasons for the lower economic rate of return are the inclusion of
the unproductive costs of the banana component and the economically marginal
nature of the oil palm component, the rate for which is 5.5% because
processing costs were considerably higher than projected. The table below
summarizes the economic rates of return for each component:
Component                                       Appraisal (7%)    Actual (%)
Cocoa                                                33             29.3
Coffee                                               28             16.9
Oil palm                                             13              5.5

V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFOMIANCE
A. Executing Agencies
5.1       The following factors impaired instituticnal performance:
-    shortcomings in the proposed organizational and management system;
-    circumstances arising during project implementation, and that were
not sufficiently taken into account at the study stage;
-    inadequate appropriations for government counterpart funds;
-    failures to make decisions in a timely manner.
5.2       As already explained, BNP, in addition to being the borrower, took
responsibility for overall supervision and coordination of project
implementation. These functions were governed by secondary agreements between
BNP and BDA, COBAPA and MIDA, and not by any effective line of command.  The
agreements did not produce the expected results, and on several occasions
coordination was lacking among the institutions involved in the project.
5.3       The banana component terminated on January 14, 1982, two and a half
years after the project became effective, when management and financial
problems led to the suspension of disbursements to COBAPA-EMBACHI. The main
problem was COBAPA's financial weakness, which prevented it from overcoming
the financial crisis caused by the refusal of the exporter (the Chiriqui Land
Company) to buy its goods because of their low quality. Nevertheless,
sufficient attention w   not paid to this weakness at the study stage, even
though available data aaowed that the organization's financial position was
not sound. For example, in 1976 and 1977 current assets were never more than
5Of of current liabilities (see Appraisal Report, Annex 3, Table 10).
5.4       The lack of government counterpart funds considerably delayed
disbursement of the coffee and cocoa sub-loans. For example, in 1983 the
government budget included no appropriations for coffee and cocoa, thus
obliging BDA and BNP to use their own resources to continue the project. On
this occasion, the supervision mission also recommended suspending loan
disbursements if the government showed no intention of solving the problem
(see the Supervision Report of December 1983).
5.5       Nevertheless, the most important problem was the government's
failure to make a decision on the construction of the palm oil processing
plant, and on a formula for organizing and managing the plant. Even after the
Barui Interinstitutional Committee submitted its recommendations in March 1986,
and after several urgings from IBRD, the government has still adopted no
definite measures.
B. Procurement
5.6       Materials required for investment in the plantations, such as
fertilizers and plants, were obtained locally. IBRD-approved procedures were
adopted for the procurement of articles such as vehicles, palm seed and other
services.



-17-
C. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.7       As already mentioned, the monitoring unit prov  id for in the
agreements was not established. Consequently, evaluation and monitoring was
based on physical and financial data gathered during project execution by the
BNP Coordination Unit. This Unit,also prepared a draft project completion
report in which the project's impAct is evaluated.
D. Compliance with Agreements
5.8       In general, the terms of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements were
observed. These were amended on three occasions, and other agreements were
formulated with the Bank's supervision missions during project implementation,
in order to enable the basic objectives to be achieved. BNP complied with
most proposals, although its progress reports were generally received behind
schedule. Auditing was performed by the Government Comptroller General to
IBRD's satisfaction, although delays of up to three months occurred.
IV. BANK PERFORMANCE
6.1       The Bank's performance was satisfactory, and it showed flexibility
in dealing with the problems encountered during project implementation. In
particular, it agreed to the following:
_    three amendments that permitted financial transfers among the
categories, and percentage increases in disbursements to the coffee
and cocoa components;
-    two extensions of the closing date.  In addition, supervision
missions agreed to adjustments in activities affecting execution of
certain aspects of project components.
6.2       Nevertheless, a number of misjudgments took place at appraisal, with
respect to the following items:
-    the use of COBAPA as executing agency for the banana component,
without a more thorough study being made of its financial stability;
-    approval of the oil palm component (this being a new crop), without
preparation of a detailed final plan for organization and management
of the plantations and processing infrastructure;
-    during project execution, the Bank's failure to show sufficient
capacity for negotiating with the government over the question of
the industrial processing of fresh palm fruit. As has already been
indicated, upon termination of this project the country has a high
output of fruit bunches, but no processing capacity. This problem
is mortgaging the future of palm development in Panama.

VII.  SUMMARY AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.1       Disbursements being only 58% of the planned total, the basic
objectives were only partially achieved:
-    Overall, the project can be said to have achieved its goals as
regards the cocoa and coffee components, with respect to producers
benefited (932), area (120%), and incremental output (100X),
although these activities were completed four years behind schedule.
-    2,500 ha of oil palm were planted, i.e. 83% of the appraisal
projection, and it is expected that, in the coming years, the
incremental output of oil will be 11,300 tons, i.e. 95% of the
projection.
-    Only 122 of the planned land titles were issued.
-    About 94.82 of the planned man-months of training for Panamanian
technicians was provided, together with 39 man-months for the
sub-borrowers. This will lead to acceptable results in the future.
-    Although certain aspects of the project as executed were different
from the original design, the 13% economic rate of return can be
regarded as adequate.
7.2       Nevertheless, it must be noted that this economic rate of return
could be considerably reduced unless the problem of palm oil processing is
solved. Because of the currently high cost of processing, the economic rate
of return in this case is 5.52.
7.3       The appraisal team was overoptimistic regarding project organization
and management, the financial position of COBAPA, and the capacity of local
institutions to find a management formula for the plantations and the oil
processing plant. The main lessons learned can be summarized as follows: /
-    In projects such as this, involving participation by several
agencies, an organization and management structure must always be
found to ensure that each is integrated into the execution process.
For example, BNP acted as a financing and coordinating agency
without having any real responsibility for execution. This made
coordination with che other organizations difficult.
-    Studies of institutions involved in projects must always be very
rigorous, and pay special attention to the organizations' financial
capacity, particularly in the case of those dealing with products
subject to international price fluctuations. The case of COBAPA is
instructive.
-    In the case of organizations involving both the public and private
sectors, either a strict plan of operations or, at least, an
undertaking jointly binding the various institutions concerned
should be obtained before project approval. The case of the
processing plant provides ample justification for adopting a more
rigorous attitude in this regard.

I. BANANA DEVELOPMENT
1.1       Currently, not one hectare of banana trees has been planted as a
result of the project. Of the 300 ha under cultivation in 1982 (30S of the
area projected), one portion has been replanted with oil palm (150 ha), and
the rest has either been converted to food crops or abandoned. This failure
has been mainly attributed to the disappearance of COBAPA (the Banana
Corporation of the Pacific), the cause of this being management and financial
problems, according to the BNP report (No. 8). The farmers associated with
EMBACEI (the Chiriqui Banana Enterprise), who were responsible for production,
consider that COBAPA managed the enterprise without providing any information,
and they regard this as poor management. The technical staff implied that
COBAPA had adopted an excessively demagogic policy, meeting the workers"
continual demands without considering the economic repercussions on production
costs. Regardless of the source of this information, there are grounds for
believing that the farmers continued to regard themselves as hired laborers
(as was the case before the project) rather than full participants, as would
have been in keeping with the philosophy of the project, while the supervising
agency (COBAPA) did not make sufficient efforts to change their attitudes.



- 22 -
1.2       It has not been possible to verify execution of the works referred
to in the BNP report (No. 8), i.e. roads, canals, the cable system and
housing. The facilities now in existence could have been installed before the
project by the private banana companies.
II. COCOA
2.1       Cocoa is grown only in the northwest of the country, on the Atlantic
coast, apart from some scattered plantations in other regions. The cocoa
component had to be restricted to the same area. In part of the latter
(Changuinola and Almirante) industrial-scale banana growing (by United Brands)
dominates the agricultural economy and occupies, the richest flatlands, cocoa
being a marginal crop confined to the slopes.  'At least 70% of cocoa
plantations are on steeply sloping land, making both access and the work of
cultivation difficult.
A. Areas
2.2       Originally introduced by United Brands, cocoa is now a traditional
crop in this area. It is calculated that, before the project, 40,000 ha had
been planted with Forastero cocoa (of the "Criollo" variety). Because of
uncertainties about selling prices, most of these plantations were neglected,
and even abandoned, by absentee owners. Yields were small (less than three
quintals (45.36kg) per ha), and these plantations would have disappeared once
Moniliosis appeared. Consequently, any comparisons made for the purposes of
project evaluation should assume an initial output of zero.
2.3       From 1979, hybrids began to be planted as part of the project; 1,258
ha in 1979/80, and an average of 359 ha in each of the following years until
1986, providing a total of 3,412 ha by 1987 (see Annex 2, Table 3). Contrary
to the appraisal plan, 600 ha were not renovated, and only new plantations
were developed, mainly on forest land that had not been previously cultivated
and parts of the low-lying plain that were used for growing mixed food and
fruit crops. To this total must be added 550 ha not forming part of the
project, and planted and financed by the farmers themselves. The area
currently contains 3,960 ha of hybrid cocoa cultivated using improved
techniques, with a further 1500 ha of Forastero cocoa, so that cocoa-growing
in the region occupies a total area of 5,462 ha.
2.4       The development of cocoa growing can be summarized as follows:
COCOA (in ha)
Hybrid
Year          With Proiect    Without Proiect            Forastero        Total
1979                  -                                     4,000         4,000
1987              3,412                550                  1,500         5,462
However, the Appraisal (No. 7) had called for financing for 2,500 ha
of hybrids.



- 23 -
2.5       It must be noted that cocoa is a new crop for Panama, the output
from the 1,500 ha cultivated by traditional methods being negligible (much of
it is not even harvested). Consequently, the young plantations are the main
producers, and their yields could normally be expected to increase as they
reach maturity and production techniques improve.
2.6       It should be noted that the area planted at the farmers' own
initiative (as a "side effect" of the project) constitutes 101 of the total.
B. Number of Farmers
2.7       The project provided financing for 1,055 farmers.  The total of
3,412 ha means that average area per farmer is 3.23 ha, which exceeds the
appraisal projection (No. 7) of 2.5 ha per farmer. One of the reasons for
this discrepancy is examined in (2.9) below, but it should be specifically
noted that the farmers were able to reach this level of 3.23 ha because they
had an adequate work force and incentives to do so.
2.8       If it is assumed that, in the region as a whole, the average area of
a cocoa plantation is 3.23 ha, the number of cocoa farmers would be 1,691, of
whom 1,055 have received project financ!ag and 170 have planted hybrids
without project assistance.
2.9       In fact, there are fewer than 1,691 cocoa growers, so that, in
social terms. the project has affected almost all the cocoa-producing
population.
2.10      The present cocoa growers are not those that were operating cocoa
plantations before the project. According to the field technicians, the
former cocoa producers' outlook was that of "harvesters" rather than
"producers"; i.e. they did not believe it necessary to tend the cacao trees,
and rejected improved methods. Consequently, the technicians turned to new
farmers, and this simultaneously facilitated and hindered the assimilation of
new techniques, because, although the newcomers had open minds, they had no
idea of how to deal with cacao trees.
C. Growing Methods
2.11      In fact, only a portion of the proposals contained in the preliminary
studies (Nos. I and 2) was executed.
2.12      As regards the use of the labor force, less effort was put into
certain tasks than had originally been planned. Brush clearing took only 10
working days instead of 20. The natural vegetation was only partially
removed, so that shade control continues to cause many problems.
2.13      Other tasks were not carried out thoroughly, or were performed
sporadically, one example being drainage. It should be noted that, although
such work is necessary in certain parts of the low-lying plain, it is not
necessary on the high slopes that constitute 70Z of plantations.  On the other
hand, theae slopes require antierosion works, and these were neither planned
nor executed.



- 24 -
2.14      The sowing of artificial shade was partially executed.  In many
cases, banana trees were used for temporary shade, and permanent shade was
planted on very few occasions. In several areas that have been cultivated for
years, there are many shade plants that are also cash crops (i.e. essentially
fruit trees). Farmers wish to keep these, although many of them provide
excessive shade.
2.15      In most cases, large forest trees are used for shade, and control is
very difficult and expensive, requiring more than the 12 days per ha referred
to in Report No. 2. Consequently, farmers seldom adopt this technique, the
result being that shade in the plantations is excessive. The two days per ha
indicated in Table 1 is an average for the area.
2.16      Maintenance operations are gradually becoming more widespread.  The
chapia [TN: A form of clearing] is the most common, because farmers realize
its economic advantages. Land clearance is a precondition for continuous
harvesting (each week).
2.17      Pruning is performed by cutting the vertical branches diverging from
the trunk and from the main limbs. Such pruning may be excessive, and may be
the reason (or one of the reasons, together with excessive shade) that the
shape of the plants is apparently not optimal for production.
2.18      Anti-Moniliosis measures require considerable work.  So far, no
economically effective chemicals have been developed, and the following
methods are used:
-    weekly harvesting, with preventive pruning of pods and branches;
-    strict shade control;
-    careful maintenance of the drainage system (when necessary).
2.19      Farmers can respond to Moniliosis in one of the following two ways:
-    They can become discouraged by the lengthy and arduous task of
combating it, since the effects of this are not immediate and
therefore result in lower yields (i.e. these farmers will tend to
abandon the crop).
-    They take on the struggle with all necessary means.  Although these
are costly, satisfactory yields can be achieved after a few years.
The financial results will be very different in the different
cases. The figures in Table 1 are considered to provide an accurate
reflection of the average overall position.
Inputs
2.20      Hybrids were used as plant material, the seeds being obtained from
CATIE (the Tropical Agricultural Research and Training Center, Costa Rica).
The farmers prepared their own nurseries, supervised by MIDA technicians.
Because the plantation program has come to an end, the quality of these



- 25 -
nurseries could not be judged, but the plants under cultivation show certain
defects, although it cannot be ascertained whether these are due to the
quality of the material or other factors (see para. 20).
2.21      Less fertilizer has been used than was proposed in the appraisal
(8 quintals instead of 10), and the farmers are only just beginning to
understand the value of fertilizer. At present, most restrict themselves to
the use of nitrogenous fertilizer (urea), since its effects are more evident.
2.22      Pesticides and herbicides are still very little used.
2.23      This review of agricultural methods shows that the farmers'
technical standards still leave room for improvement, since these activities
are still new to them, as has already been pointed out. The following are the
main conclusions to be drawn:
-    MIDA's extension and technical assistance activities must be
maintained and, if possible, intensified.
-    If these efforts continue, yields are very likely to increase.
D. Output and Yields
2.24      The following table shows the area's annual total output, calculated
on the basis of the amounts deposited at Cooperativa de Cacao Bocatoreiia,
which regularly markets 90% of its total output:
Total Output for the Area
Year                              (in quintals)
1978                                 14,800
197q                                 19,300
19tO                                 12,400
1981                                 10,500
1982                                 10,200
1983                                  6,800
1984                                 14,400
1985                                 26,400
1986                                 18,800
2.25      Field technicians attribute the considerable fluctuations in yield
from one year to another to meteorological conditions, particularly rainfall.
However, they are also likely to have been aggravated by technical
inadequacies. Improved techniques would enable farmers to deal more
adequately with adverse conditions and thus stabilize yields.
2.26      The fluctuations quite clearly reflect the reduction in output due
to Moniliosis (which appeared in 1979), and the increase from 1984 when the
new plantations came into production.



- 26 -
2.27      Because of the lack of precise data on the area under cultivation
each year, it was not possible to calculate account figures for yields.  Those
obtained by the technician& (from surveys of a small number of plantations)
range from 7 to 18 quintals per ha.
2.28      Although these yields are small, it must be noted that farmers were
facing the serious problem of Moniliosis. The appraisal (No. 7) made the
following projections, but this was at a time when the disease was not
expected to reach this region (No. 4):
Years after planting                   1      2     3     4     5      6
Quintals per ha                        -      -     8    12    18    22
2.29      Mlthough these projections were high compared with current yields,
it can be hypothesized that sustained technical assistance could slowly but
steadily improve growing methods, resulting in the following yields:
Years after planting           1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
Quintals per ha                                5   10   15  20   22
The yields projected in the appraisal would therefore be achieved,
but after a two-year delay.
2.30      If this model is applied to the data for areas sown between 1979 and
1986, the results accurately correspond to actual output data for all these
years except 1986. The field technicians have confirmed that this was a
particularly bad year because of excess rainfall. It should therefore be
regarded as exceptional, and does not justify any change in the model:
Year
1983      1984      1985        1986
Actual output (quintals)            6,800      14,400    26,400      18,800



- 27 -
2.31      Output, because of staggered plantation development, could be
projected as follows:
Year
Year                              1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993
Output (in thousands
of quintals)                     40.4  45.5  53.9  60.7  66.7  72.2  74.3
E. Conclusions
2.32      The conclusion can be drawn that the main result of the project's
first stage was not so much to increase output as to replace existing
production (which had been considerably affected by Moniliosis) by occupying
new areas.
2.33      Table 1 uses data provided by "IDA to show estimates of physical
production units, with a weighted averege to take account of plantations with
a greater or lesser degree of technology. The "without project" category has
not been included, because it consists of new plantations generally
established in unproductive forest areas.
III. COFFEE
3.1       The project was executed in the following three regions:  Chiriqui,
(in the districts of Boquete, Sereno and Gualata), Cocle and Veraguas.
A. Area
3.2       Table 2 shows the areas planted with coffee in the various regions,
together with those that were replanted as a result of the project. Project
impact as regards replanted area was greatest in Chiriqui, although the
proportion of renovated plantations to total plantation area varies very
considerably from one district to another within the same province, ranging
from 7.62 in Sereno to 19.31 in Boquete.
3.3       Data obtained by the technicians show that the plantation area in
the various zones totals 912 ha, whereas the BNP report records a total of
1,131 ha. The reason for this discrepancy is that there are some plantations
outside the areas included in Table 2. The BNP data indicate that the project
achieved about 87T of the appraisal objectives.
3.4       According to these data, the average area of land replanted by
farmers was 1.45 ha. This average was significantly higher in Boquete than in
other regions, whereas in Veraguas and Cocle the area replanted was larger
than the average size of coffee plantations. The reason may be that farmers
who sow larger areas received preference for loans, or that in fact they
planted on land that had not previously been used for coffee growing.

B. Number of Farmers (Table 2)
3.5       According to BNP (No. 8) the project provided financing for 800
farmers, the largest number being in Renacimiento (Sereno), the area with the
largest agricultural population. The percentage of farmers involved in the
project is no higher than in Boquete. The province of Chiriqui is in clear
contrast to the others because of the number of coffee growers participating
in the project (about 17% compared with an average of 1.1% for the other
provinces).
3.6       Table 2 illustrates the differences among the provinces as regards
both the structure of coffee production and the iipact of the project.
3.7       The quality of the soil also differs considerably, since it is of
volcanic origin in Chiriqui and is much more fertile than in Veraguas and
Cocle.  Project impact was much greater in Chiriqui, where socioeconomic
circumstances were better. This is evident, even though it cannot be claimed
that there is any cause-and-effect relationship.
C. Growing Methods and Investment and Operating Costs
3.8       An attempt has been made to assess these methods from an economic
viewpoint, taking labor use and input needs separately, and determining what
methods are appropriate for achieving optimum economic performance rather than
maximum yields.
Labor
3.9       There is a quite considerable difference between the labor needs
calculated in the draft report (No. 2) and the actual amount used. The reason
for this discrepancy is that there are two different systems of soil
preparation and shade managemient.
3.10      The system described in the initial documents (No. 2 and No. 7)
entails the complete clearance of the original vegetation, requiring
considerable labor (40 man-days). Artificial shade is then sown (15 days).
Consequently, control of this shade is fairly simple and should not require
the five days per year referred to in Report No. 2.
3.11      The system actually used involves a simpler form of preparation
(35 man-days), so that artificial shade was not planted and shade control was
arduous and dangerous. Consequently, it is not adequately carried out and
often plantations suffer from an excess of shade. The five man-days per ha
for shade control referred to in Table 2 is, therefore, a regional average.
3.12      It should be noted that in the industrial-scale plantations in
Renacimiento there is no shade, this being an approp:iate method for intensive
cultivation with a high degree of technology. In other plantations this would
lead to the premature exhaustion of plants, resulting in cyclic production and
wide fluctuations in yield from one year to another.



- 29 -
3.13      In contrast, total exclusion of shade makes it necessary to provide
lines of wind-break trees, because wind can cause considerable damage when
there are no shade trees.
3.14      Finally, the economic and social advantages of banana trees as
temporary shade must be emphasized, since they also provide a source of food
for workers.
3.15      It has also been possible to examine the quality of work in the
plantations, which, in certain areas, has included antierosion measures,
sometimes performed at the farmers' own initiative. Nevertheless, it does not
seem that this work, however carefully performed, requires the 100 days
originally calculated (No. 2).
3.16      Another apparently overestimated labor cost is weeding.  On average,
three such operations are performed, each taking five working days. Compared
with weeding by hand, substantial savings can be gained by using herbicides,
provided that care is exercised in their use.
3.17      The type of systematic pruning advocated by MIDA has not been
applied. It is psychologically difficult for farmers to bring themselves to
remove one whole line of plants in every four, when those plants are still in
good condition and productive. They prefer to prune "selectively," removing
only exhausted or diseased plants. This system would be acceptable if the
density of 7,500 productive plants per ha were maintained, but this is rarely
the case. The difference in working days between the types of pruning is not
particularly significant (10 for systematic pruning and two for selective
pruning), but it is important for yields, because a lack of pruning, or poor
pruning, results in a sharp fall in output as the plants become exhausted.
3.18      The crop is bar-rested in the traditional manner (bean by bean)
throughout the four-mont'^ ripening period. This approach is generally used
only in the better coffee-growing regions (Boquete and Renacimiento) and iB
beginning to be introduced in Veraguas, where combines have quite extensively
damaged the trees. The operation is expensive, but indispensable if output is
to be of good quality. Some producers process their coffee themselves, thus
increasing value added.
3.19      In conclusion, labor actually used (see Table 3) is considerably
less than planned. For planting, it totals 131 man-days, whereas the draft
report (No. 2) estimated 190 man-days. Maintenance in the first three years
totaled 75 days instead of 212.
Inputs
3.20      It has not been possible to find any technical justification in the
various documents consulted for either the qualitative or quantitative
recommendations regarding inputs. These recommendations seem to have been
made initially on the basis of MIDA norms and, according to information
gathered by field technicians, they were based on studies made in other
countries-particularly Costa Rica-but were not the outcome of any
experiments conducted in Panama itself.

3.28      These data indicate that the general level of productivity using the
Caturra Rojo is quite high, average output per ha for the older Arabica Typica
(No. 2) being less than 15 qq. In the initial project studies (No. 2), yield
per ha was projected to increase up to 60 in the sixth year.  This is a very
high level. These figures have been re-examined in the Bank studies (No. 7),
and an average output of 45 qq per ha for the sixth year has been calculated,
although this still seems unlikely to be achieved. The actual output
achieved, (35 quintals per ha according to ENP data) can be regarded as
satisfactory.
E. Conclusions
Proiect Impact (Coffee Component)
3.29      In general, it can be said that project impact has been positive,
although with some differences among regions, resulting from the following
factors (see Table 2):
-    the number of farmers participating;
-    acceptance of new methods, most farmers being receptive to
innovation as regards varieties, fertilizer use, fungicides and seed
density, but unreceptive with regard to recommendations on pruning
and shade control.
3.30      The financial analysis of the project's coffee component must be
updated, because investment and operating costs especially in the case of
labor-have probably been lower than currently recorded. In addition, yields
have been lower than projected. Table 3 shows new calculations of costs and
benefits.
3.31      Restricting the examination of project impact to those farmers in
receipt of project financing gives an incomplete picture of its influence,
since there are producers outside the project who have totally or partially
adopted the new growing methods. Although the figures presented in Table 2
are only partial, they give some idea of the project's social impact on the
coffee-growing population as a whole.
IV. OIL PALM
4.1       In contrast to coffee and cocoa, oil palm was not planted on small
private plantations, but on land belonging to asentamientos (farmers
associations), each consisting of hundreds of Dia. The result was that
technical responsibility lay not with the farmers themselves, but with MIDA
experts.
A. Areas
4.2       The project covered 2,500 ha of the 3,000 ha initially planned, i.e.
83X. In their initial study (for a 3,000 ha oil palm project in Baru,
Panama), IRHO and the firm Tejada Mora had selected 3,570 ha of land suitable
for oil palm, of which 620 ha were individually owned and 2,950 ha belonged to



- 32 -
asentamientos. Of the asentamientos' land, it was suspected that 500 ha were
toxic because of excess copper. These 500 ha, plus the 600 ha of individually
owned land, were excluded, so that only about 2,500 ha were cultivated.
B. Social Aspects
4.3       The farmers participating in the oil palm project were formerly
workers employed by banana companies. The land formerly belonged to United
Brands, but was recovered by the Government and assigned on a collective basis
(to asentamientos). The farmers used them to grow food crops, but with
negative results because such crops were affected by the copper present, and
could not withstand the encroachment of a particularly vigorous grass weed.
Oil palm growing offered a means of overcoming these problems. Faced with the
prospect of an oil palm project about which they had not been consulted, the
farmers accepted with some reservations because they had had no experience
with this crop. Nevertheless, they embarked upon the project attracted by the
prospect of having a fixed income, but without regarding themselves as genuine
partners in a collective enterprise, even though they were represented on the
Board. Currently, they are having problems with marketing the fruit bunches,
as a result of the delay in the construction of the processing plant.
4.4       The theoretical estimate of labor needs in Bari is one man per
6 ha.  IR0 believes that it can range from 5 ha to 6 ha, depending on local
conditions.  The actual figure in Barui, where there are about 500 farmers, is
one worker per 5 ha. However many have occupations outside the oil palm
plantation, because of a comparative labor surplus.
C. Infrastructure
4.5       The study (see financial section of Annex 2, Table 8) shows that
infrastructure expenditure exceeded the total planned in the initial IRHO
budget. Expenditure on roads and drainage was B 450 per ha instead of B 290
per ha. According to the experts, some problems arising from excess water
have yet to be solved. As regards the system of roads, this is in the worst
possible condition, some of them being unusable. MIDA data indicate that,
from 1983 to 1985, 65 km of roads were made or reconstructed. These should
have been sufficient for the 2,500 ha of plantations, but deteriorated very
rapidly.
4.6       In contrast, expenditure on agricultural machinery and vehicles was
less than planned (B 260 per ha and B 150 per ha respectively, instead of
B 430 and B 150), but the equipment is in poor condition and requires thorough
maintenance.
4.7       MIDA devoted less (B 1,820 per ha) than planned (B 2,420 per ha) to
administrative and maintenance costs, and this amount has proved inadequate
over the last few years.
D. Growin& Methods
4.8       The hybrid seed is provided partly by United Brands (Costa Rica) and
partly by IRW0. The seed delivered on one occasion by IR0 had no germination



- 33 -
power, and it was later discovered that it had been in satisfactory condition
when leaving the point of origin (C8te d'Ivoire), but had certainly been
damaged when in transit through Madrid in the winter.
4.9       The types of plant material provided by IRHO and United Brands have
different characteristics. There are no significant differences in yield, but
they do differ in the length of their economic life. The Deli/Avros material
provided by CBCR (United Brands) grows much more rapidly, and therefore output
has fallen much more quickly, because harvests over recent years have been
problematic.
4.10      As regards fertilizer use, the original IRH0 report had recommended
that only urea be used, in light of soil analyses.   This recommendation
should have been limited to the first four years of the trees' lives, i.e. the
unproductive period, subsequent recommendations being based on experiments and
leaf examinations. However, these experiments were never made, while the leaf
analyses have only just been made, and the results are not yet available. In
any case, leaf analysis data can only provide a basis for making concrete
proposals when they are compared with the levels of elements in leaves taken
from experimental par_els.
4.11      In 1982, United Brands was hired as a consultant to examine this
problem. It recommended using formulas 15-15-15 or 18-5-15-6-2, the amounts
varying according to individual situations and types of soil. However, these
recommendations were based on the experience of United Brands in its own
plantation (in Costa Rica), and not on the characteristics of the target
region itself. In order to determine the most economical fertilizer formula
for each situation, it would be necessary to establish in Barui a thorough and
wide-ranging program with provision for experimental plantations and
systematic leaf analysis. At present, the trend is to reduce the amounts of
fertilizer used (because of a lack of financing), and this could have an
impact on output.
4.12      The problem of palm leaf pruning has been discussed with MIDA
technicians. Currently, the appearance of the trees suggests that they have
been pruned somewhat excessively, even taking into account the differences in
appearance between Deli/Avros and Deli/LaMW. If this is true, it would mean a
reduction in labor costs and an increase in the trees' output.
4.13      Labor costs can also be reduced by developing the use of herbicides
for weed control. IRH0 had advocated three applications of chemical
herbicides per year, and this has been done only experimentally.
4.14      The MIDA technicians are calling for changes in the system of
collecting and transporting fruit bunches in the field. Currently, this is by
tractor, but transportation by mule or ox-drawn cart has been shown in other
Latin American countries to be very economical, and also avoids compact'ng the
soil. The appraisal did not provide for this system.
4.15      It must be emphasized that the projects current financial
difficulties could have a direct impact on plantation maintenance and the
level of output, which would be affected by the shortage of machinery
maintenance, scarcity of fertilizer, the poor condition of roads, and the
shortage of small tools and tires for tractors and vehicles, etc.



- 34 -
4.16      In conclusion, it appears that-in general-the growing methods
employed are appropriate. From the economic point of view, certain practices
might be made more efficient, these having been introduced as a result of
experience in other countries, without proper regard for the specific
characteristics of the area. This would require experimental studies, as in
the particular cases of fertilizer use, weeding and fruit bunch gathering.
E. Production Costs
4.17      It has not been possible to budget the actual production costs per
ha in the plantation, because only overall figures have been obtained, and
these are not bruken down by task. A detailed overall comparison of actual
and planned costs is included in the financial section of the report.
Observations in the field indicate that the technical recommendations made by
1110 (which prepared the feasibility study) have been applied. Consequently,
production costs in constant balboas cannot be higher than planned, because
the calculations had allowed for an adequate safety margin. This is shown in
the financial analysis.
F. Yields and Output
4.18      The first 1,000 ha planted with Deli/Avros came into production in
1986. The yield of this material in 1987 (i.e. the sixth year of the project)
is calculated to have been 18 tons of fresh frv:-t bunches per ha, with an
extraction rate of 20X. This exceeded projections (No. 7) in both quantity
(15 tons per ha) and quality (17.5X). Although partial, these results are
encouraging, and justify the optimistic projections MIDA has made as a
consequence.
4.19      Table 4 suimmarizes yields and output for the initial years.
4.20      From the 12th year (1992), a slow decline in output is expected.
MIDA sees this as a much less severe decline than IRHO, since yields of fresh
fruit bunches per ha fall by two tons over 15 years, whereas IRHO expects a
fall of one ton every nine years. Output has been calculated using IRHO data,
since these seem more realistic (see Table 4).
V. CONCLUSION
5.1       If the banana component is disregarded (since it achieved no
concrete results), specific progress has been accomplished in the other three
components: 3,412 ha of new cocoa plantations, more than 1,000 ha of
renovated coffee plantations, and 2,500 ha of new oil palm plantations, i.e.
136S, 872 and 83% of the appraisal projections.
5.2       The technical quality of the crops is good in the cases of coffee
and oil palm, and reasonable in the case of cocoa, which could be improved
with sustained assistance from MIDA.
5.3       In certain cases, the methods used are somewhat less intensive than
planned, i.e. with respect to soil preparation and shade control (coffee and



- 35 -
cocoa), and fertilizer, pesticide and herbicide use (cocoa). Although savings
in labor (coffee and cocoa) and fertilizer and chemical inputs (cocoa) reduce
production costs, they also have a negative impact on yields.
5.4       It has been possible to draw up encouraging-and very likely-output
projections for oil palm, provided that the problem of the processing plant is
solved.
5.5       As regards coffee, the growers are very likely to be able to
overcome the leaf rust now threatening this crop. If they succeed, output
prospects are good, but production costs will depend on the price of the
necessary chemical products.
5.6       As regards cocoa, the question is whether growers will undertake to
combat Moniliosis. This will require sound technical assistance and resolute
efforts, but output prospects will depend on this.

ANNEX 2
PANAMA
TROPICAL TREE CROP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan No. 1672-PAN)
FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
I. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
1.1       The financial analysis presented in this Annex refers exclusively to
cocoa, coffee and oil palm because, as already mentioned in Annex 1, the
banana component was not executed, for reasons totally unconnected with
financial or economic considerations.
1.2       The data used in this analysis were provided by BNP's Coordinating
Office and by the field technicians in the various agricultural programs
implemented under the project. These data were used for analyzing the farm
models for coffee and cocoa and for examining the results of oil palm
planting. They are analyzed in Tables 3 through 8, and summarized below:
Model        Average Size of Farm
Number            (in ha)                       Characteristics of Models
1                  3.2                       Cocoa/New establishment
2                  1.4                       Coffee/Renovation
3              2,500.00                      Oil palm/New plantation
1.3       In the case of oil palm, the analysis has been applied to the whole
plantation as a single unit, bec&.se so far it has not been subdivided, and in
fact the producers participate only as hired workers, even though they are
represented on the plantation's Board.
1.4       In the interpretation of results, it must be kept in mind that
constant values have been used in the calculations. The main differences
between the models calculated in the World Bank appraisal and actual execution
are summarized below.



44 -
Model 1
1.5       This shows the position of producers in receipt of project credit
who established 3.2 ha of new cocoa plantation. The basic differences
(already mentioned in Annex 1) can be summarized as follows:
(i) The area planted(3.2 ha) is larger than planned (2.5 ha), and the
maximum yields calculated in the appraisal could be achieved, albeit
with a delay of two or thtee years.
(ii) Investment and maintenance costs for the first three years (B 1,875
per ha; see Table 4) would be approximately equivalent to the
appraisal mission's estimate (US$1,840 per ha).
(iii)  The net value of output (see Table 6) calculated in the seventh year
of production, and excluding the cost of family labor, would be
B 1,290 per ha, i.e. approximately equal to the appraisal estimate
,(US$805 per ha) if the latter is adjusted o. 1937 prices.
(iv) The financial rate of return calculated in Table 6 would be 41.72 in
this model, compared with the 43% expected at the time of the
appraisal.
At 1987 prices, disbursements for the component would total B 4.39
million, or B 1,287 per ha (see Table 3), i.e. about 701 of total investment
and maintenance costs, which appears reasonable.
Model 2
1.6       This reofers to coffee growers in receipt of project assistance and
renovating an average of 1.4 ha of coffee plantation (see Table 3). The main
differences between the appraisal estimates and actual execution are as
follows:
(i)    The average area currently renovated is 1.4 ha, which is close to
the appraisal estimate of 1.3 ha, while maximum yields (35 qq per
ha) are 132 smaller than the appraisal level (40 qq per ha).
(ii)    Investment and maintenance costs for the first three years
(including only the labor used for establishing and treating the
crops) would total B 3,136 per ha, about 151 below the appraisal
mission's estimate. The main reason for this discrepancy is that
actual labor use was 212 man-days, compared with the appraisal
estimate of 402 man-days.
(iii)    The net value of output, including only hired labor (see Table 7)
would total 3,493 per ha in the seventh year of production, compared
with the estimate of US$1,895 per ha. Even if the latter estimate
is adjusted to 1987 prices, it is calculated that the net value of
output-because of the lower yields-would be 20% less than
estimated.
(iv)    The rate of return calculated in Table 7 (20.4%) is only slightly
lower than the 232 calculated in the appraisal.



- 45 -
Disbursements for this component total B 3.62 million (see Table 3),
i.e. about B 3,200 per ha, or about 1001 of establishment and maintenance
costs for the first three years. This indicates that the producers used part
of the project financing for activities unconnected with the project's
objectives.
Oil Palm
1.7       The appraisal mission could only draw up estimates for the oil palm
component, because at that time no detailed studies were available. The
Government of Panama later hired IRHO to prepare such studies. The
consultants' final report was received at the time that the Appraisal Report
was published. Consequently, the comparative conclusions presented in this
Annex also make reference to the data contained in the consultants' report.
The main points can be summarized as follows:
(i)    About 2,500 ha of oil palm were planted as part of the project, i.e.
83% of the appraisal estimate.  The yields obtaiaed in the sixth
year of the project (18 tons of fresh fruit bunches per ha) exceed
the projected 15 tons per ha by 20X.  The 201 extraction rate is
higher than projected (17.5X).
(ii)    Investment and maintenance costs for the first seven years o'
planting totaled B 11.9 million, i.e. B 4,760 per ha at 1987 prices,
this being 231 less than the IRHO estimate. The main reason is that
investment costs were about 30% less for nurseries, soil preparation
and maintenance (see Table 8).
(iii)    The value of output in the first three years was B 4.7 million, i.e.
approximately equivalent to both the IRHO and the appraisal estimate;
(iv)    The financial rate of return for a period of 30 years (see Table 8)
is 14.91, i.e. comparable to the appraisal mission's estimate of
151, and only a little lower than the figures quoted by IRHO (15.5%
and 171).
1.8       As regards the future of the oil palm component and its financial
rate of return, the main issues arise from the following:
-    installation of the processing plant;
-    the price policy for crude oil to be agreed between the Government
and the refining companies.
1.9       Construction of a processing plant was originally included in the
project, but it was not executed because of both a lack of interest on the
part of the private sector and the Government's difficulty in finding a
suitable mixed-economy formula. Consequently, fresh fruit has to be
transported to Costa Rica for processing in the United Brands plant there.
This processing arrangement is based on a contract which the plant itself
might not be willing to renew, since its entire capacity could be taken up by
its own fruit. This would jeopardize future production in Panama.



- 46 -
1.10      The introduction of Law No. 61 in July 1986 produced a considerable
change in price policy by replacing an import control system based on quotas
with one based on tariffs. In practice, imports of crude oil are unrestricted
(a tariff of 30 centavos per kg is applied), whereas imports of refined oil
are still governed by quotas, although these will be reduced in the next five
years. During this period, the purchase price for palm oil will have to be
negotiated between the Government and the refining companies, and these
negotiations will determine the necessary financial rate of return for the
palm plantation. Nevertheless (as Table 1 indicates), the expected increase
in international crude oil prices between 1990 and 2000 could make it possible
to maintain the farm-gate price at the current level of B 480 per ton.
II. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Benefits
2.1       The total benefits of the project result from the planting of about
3,412 ha of cocoa, the renovation of 1,131 ha of coffee, and the planting of
2,500 ha of oil palm.  The following summary shows that the pioject impact in
terms of area and expressed in percentages ranges from 832 in the case of oil
palm to 136S for cocoa.

follows:

2.3       Economic rates of return were calculated for the various crops (see
Table 13) and are compared below with the rates calculated in the appraisal.

- 47 -
2.4       The fall in real terms in cocoa and coffee prices (about 402)
affected the economic rate of return for each of these crops. The exceptional
decline in oil palm prices (about 54X), together with increased processing and
transportation costs resulting from cancellation of the processing plant,
produced a marginal economic rate of return for this item.
Economic Rate of Return
2.5       The economic analysis was based on the following premises:
(1)   Agricultural prices:  The economic prices used where calculated on
the basis of January 1988 World Bank price projeceions, calculated
for farm-gate prices after the necessary adjustments for freight,
insurance and handling (see Tables 1 and 12). In,the case of cocoa,
financial prices were used, because these are in line with economic
prices. Costs of agricultural inputs, fertilizers, herbicides and
pesticides were adjusted by a standard conversioni factor of 941 (as
used in project appraisal).
(ii)    Proiect costs:  These costs were converted to constant 1987 prices
by using the inflation rate for the period 1979-87.  Machinery and
equipment costs were adjusted using an average conversion factor of
941.
(iii)    Labor:  Rural unemployment in the project area is very low.  As a
result, the opportunity cost for both hired and family labor was
adjusted by a factor of 90%.
iv)    Lifetime of the proiect:  The useful life of' the project was set at
25 years for coffee and cocoa and 30 years for oil palm.
2.6       Table 13 presents the results of the economic analysis, based on the
above assumptions.
III. CONCLUSIONS
3.1       The following conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in
this Annex and the data provided by BNP's Project Coordinating Office:
-    Disbursement took seven years, practically twice as long as provided
for in the appraisal. This means that the incremental benefits
expected in the twelfth year that the project is in full operation
will be achieved only in the seventeenth year.
-    Some disbursements (e.g. for the banana component) were unproductive
for reasons other than financial or economic factors. In other
cases (e.g. coffee) a marginal amount of fina.-Lng seems to have
been diverted by the producers to other types of investment,
although there is no clear proof of this and the likelihood has been
deduced only from the figures.

-    In the project implementation period, coffee and cocoa prices fell
by about 40%, with palm oil prices declining 54% on international
markets, in constant terms.
3.2       Consequently, the economic and financial performance was not as
outstanding as planned in the case of coffee and cocoa, and the oil palm
component achieved only marginal results in economic terms.

prices by using the inflation rate for the same period. Projections from
1988 to 2000 were calculated by using the January 1988 World Bank price
projections. The financial and economic prices are identical because
almost all cocoa produced is for export.
2/   Financial prices for 1978-87 were calculated by BNP using annual average
farm-gate prices adjusted in accordance with the inflation rate for the
period. Projections from 1988 to 2000 were calculated by using the
January 1988 World Bank projections. Economic prices have been analyzed
in light of World Bank projections, at constant 1987 prices.
3/   Financial prices were calculated at constant farm-gate levels, using -,he
agreed ex-refinery price of B 700 per qq for crude palm oil. The
economic prices were calculated using World Bank price projections. at
constant 1987 levels.

Panama, November 2, 1988
Mr. Graham Donaldson
Operations Evaluation Department
World Bank
Dear Mr. Donaldson:
Tropical Tree Crop Development Proiect
(Loan No. 1672-PAN)
As soon as we received the final report on the Tropical Tree Crop
Development Project we contacted the various ministries, requesting their
opinions or co,ments oa the copies they had received of the report, thereby
providing us with a general consensus on wthich to base the final document to
be sent out over the borrower's signature.
Because of the particular features of this program, and of the fact
that the opinions received represent different approaches, depending on the
activities of each individual mini-try, this letter handles the various topics
separately, rather than presenting an overall analysis.
Points on which we differ from the report relate to the technical,
administrative and financial aspects.
On the technical side, output figures under the coffee-cocoaE/
component do not match our data, nor does the investment cost per hectare
under that heading.
The opinions concerning the use of banana trees as shade for the
cocoa plantations differ from those of MIDA's coffee-cocoa unit staff, as do
the data on the topography of the areas planted to cocoa.
One of the coffee fertilizer formulas given is incorrect, according
to MIDA's technicians.



. .                                               - 72-
The total area planted is given as 70S of that originally planned,
whereas our figure, which includes the banana plantations. is 942. b/
On the administrative side, we must take exception to the fact that
no mention is made of the active way in which MIDA's coffee-cocoa technical
unit participated in project organization and executio4'in keeping with the
terms of the Appraisal Report and the Loan Agreement.
As regards the financial aspect, MIDA recommends a recalculation of
the IRR, since the report bases this on the incorrect output figures.
Moreover, the amount reimbursed in compliance with reimbursement
application #86 was not entirely to the borrower's satisfaction.
Apart from the above comments, the overall text of the report gives
a realistic picture of the progress and results of the project.
We are at your disposal for all future communications relative to
this final stage of our relationship with the Tropical Tree Crop Development
Project.
Very truly yours,
/s/ Eric 0. Cataflo

The following footnotes have been added by Bank staff:
a/ The valuable information provided by the Ministry of Agriculture on the
coffee and cocoa production techniques, commented above, is expected to
have no impact on the overall performance and evaluation of the project.
The financial rates of return for the cocoa and coffee plantation have
been calculated to be 41.7% and 20.4% respectively and are comparable to
the 43% and 23% originally projected.
b/ The total area planted under the project reached 94% of the appraisal
estimates.
c/ Reference to the satisfactory performance of MIDA is included in
para 3.28 in the main text.
