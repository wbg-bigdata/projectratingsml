TROPICAL TREE CROP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
A. The Agricultural Sector
Agriculture in the Economqy
1.01      Over the last five years (1972-77), the total GDP increased at an
average annual rate of 4.1% (1960 prices) whereas the agricultural sector
increased at an annual rate of only 2.1%. Agriculture's share of the GDP was
16%, including 13% from the crop subsector, 2 to 3% from the livestock, and
the balance, less than 1%, from forestry and fisheries. Fifty percent of the
Panamanian population lives in rural areas and 30% of the national labor force
is employed in the agricultural sector.
1.02      During the three-year period 1975-77, 53% of all exports of goods
(US$238 million per annum) and over 85% of non-petroleum merchandise exports
(US$147 million) were of agricultural or marine origin for a total of about
US$127 million. Bananas and sugar alone accounted for, respectively, 34% and
18% of non-petroleum exports, shrimps for 15%, and coffee and beef for about
2% each. In spite of the low overall rate of growth, the agricultural sector
has been able to supply most of the food products required by the domestic
market. Total imports of agricultural products during the 1975-77 period
averaged about US$53 million, equivalent to 8% to 10% of total imports. Apart
from wheat and wheat products, temperate fruits and vegetables, the main
imports, which could be replaced by domestic production, are meat, dairy
products, vegetable fats and oils, feed grains and concentrates, and wood
products.
Performance
1.03      During the 1960s, agricultural GDP increased at an average rate
of 5% per annum. Since 1970, however, overall performance has been more
modest and erratic, with an average annual growth rate of 3.1% between 1970
and 1972; -1.5% in 1974, 4.8% in 1975 0% in 1976 and an estimated 1.1% in
1977. The overall performance of the sector is quite sensitive to fluctua-
tions in banana production, which accounted for 35% of GDP of the crop
subsector in 1972 and 27% in 1976.
1.04      Although the production of rice and sugarcane has been increasing
rapidly, performance of the sector was adversely affected in 1974-76 by a
substantial fall in banana production and exports, which resulted from dis-
agreements between the Government of Panama (GOP) and United Brands Corpora-
tion (UB) 1/ over land tenure and the Level of export taxes on bananas (both
resolved in January 1976 para 2.02). Although banana production subsequently
increased it still has not regained its 1970-72 level. In addition, prices
of beef decreased substantially in 1974 and 1975 and a severe drought in the
1/   United Brands and its subsidiary companies in Panama, Chiriqui Land
Company, Corporacioii de Ia Cruz and Compania Caronas.



-2-
1976/77 crop year affected grain production. In 1977, low sugar prices and
the generally stagnant economic situation were not conducive to substantial
gains in spite of the recovery of livestock production (Annex 3, Table 1).
1.05      Despite the relative smallness of the sector, agriculture continues
to receive much attention from the authorities for three main reasons. First,
there is a serious problem of poverty in rural areas. Second, excluding reve-
nues from the service sector, agriculture is the main source of foreign
exchange earnings. Third, with appropriate policies, the sector could make
a greater contribution to output, the balance of payments and employment than
it does at present.
Land Resources and Uses
1.06      Out of a total land area of 78 million ha (including the Panama
Canal Zone), farmland is estimated at 2.3 million ha. However, the land
resource base of Panama is very limited. There are no class I soils, only
170,000 ha of class II soils and 683,000 ha of class III soils, or a total
of 853,000 ha (1% of total land area) with moderate limitations for agricul-
tural production. In spite of substantial regional differences, the general
land use is rather extensive. It is estimated that only 21% of the potential
crop land and 46% of the potential grazing land are in actual use. This
relative abundance of available land has led to a lack of concern with
formal ownership rights. Overall, 72% of the farms and 44% of the farmland
were untitled in 1970 (Annex 3, Table 2).
Land Tenure
1.07      Almost all rural families in Panama own or occupy a parcel of land,
and virtually all is owner-operated, with only 5% of the land being rented.
According to the last census, there are 34,000 holdings in the 1-ha to 5-ha
category and 51,000 holdings of over 5 ha in size. The distribution of farms
(1970 census) according to size is given below:

B. Agricultural Sector Development Strategies and Policies
Land Reform
1.08      Although a Land Reform Law was passed in 1962, efforts at agrarian
reform started only in 1968. Between 1969 and 1977, the State acquired about
502,000 ha for this purpose and distributed it to 18,260 families. By the end
of 1977, about 87,000 ha were assigned to 215 asentamientos, benefitting 5,000
families and 57 Juntas Agrarias de Produccion 1/ (2,000 families), and the
balance was distributed to small-scale and medium-scale farmers. The tenure
arrangements that will finally emerge from the asentamientos is not yet clear
since so far the members have only informal and collective temporary rights.
While the GOP policies and programs encourage collective management of the
asentamientos land, the actual subdivision of the land is up to each asentamiento.
At present, land management in the asentamientos ranges from primarily indi-
vidual to totally collective.
Institutional Developments
1.09      Given the limited administrative capacity and budgetary constraints
in the public sector, the emphasis appears to be on the consolidation of
holdings and concentration on strategic areas. The institutional set-up of
the sector has been restructured for that purpose. The Ministry of Agriculture
was reorganized in 1973 to become the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
Development (MIDA), and more recently, MIDA has been decentralized, with its
planning and implementation sections being transferred to Santiago (Veraguas
Province). Various departments of the former Ministry with similar functions
were regrouped into two new autonomous agencies: the Agricultural Development
Bank (BDA) in 1973 and the Agricultural Marketing Institute (IMA) in 1975.
Also, the GOP initiated a complete revision of the organization and structure
of the public agricultural research activities and created in 1975 a semi-
autonomous Agricultural Research Institute (IDIAP). All funds and personnel
previously assigned for agricultural research purposes to a number of different
public institutions were transferred to IDIAP with the exception of those
assigned for agricultural research at the National University.
Current Government Strategy
1.10      The Government's basic program includes minimum and support prices,
import and export controls, retail price ceilings and direct market operations.
Current development goals and strategy for the agricultural sector are defined
in the 1976-1980 National Development Plan. The general policy objectives
focus on:
(a) the maximization of agriculture's contribution to the economy
through import substitution and exports;
1/   Juntas Agrarias de Produccion are group farming cooperatives of small-
holders.



- 4 -
(b) raising of employment, income and living levels of the sector,
with special emphasis on the rural poor;
(c) improvement of socio-economic equilibrium between urban and
rural areas in order to reduce rural migration;
(d) recuperation and conservation of natural resources; and
(e) promotion of a land property structure, regrouping marginal
farmers in order to incorporate them into modern production
systems.
1.11      The proposed project would fit closely into these development
objectives by: promoting banana production, the main source of foreign
exchange; diversifying exports by increasing production of coffee and cocoa;
and encouraging import substitution of vegetable oils and fats. At the same
time, it would help to meet the objectives of employment generation, increase
of rural incomes, and the integration of asentamientos and small farmers into
modern production systems.
C. The Banking System and Agricultural Credit
The Banking System
1.12      Panama has a well developed banking system which is unlike that of
other Latin American countries; there is no central bank of issue and the mone-
tary system is linked to the US dollar, which is the only paper currency
in circulation. The absence of foreign exchange controls and Panama's liberal
banking laws have allowed it to develop into a regional financial center
for Latin America. The money supply is determined by Panama's balance of
payments and its ability to attract dollar deposits into its banking system,
which is dominated by large non-Panamanian banks. These banks are active in
the domestic economy but their primary interests are in offshore business.
The banking system consists of 81 privately owned commercial banks, of which
47 are licensed to carry out domestic and offshore operations, 25 are licensed
for offshore business only, and nine are licensed as representative offices.
In addition, there are five Government-owned institutions: the National Bank
of Panama (BNP), primarily a commercial bank; BDA, an agricultural development
bank; the Savings Bank; the National Mortgage Bank; and the National Financial
Corporation (COFINA), a development finance company.
1.13      In the absence of a central bank, BNP, which operates mainly as a
commercial bank, serves also as a depository and a fiscal agent of the Govern-
ment of Panama. The National Banking Commission (CBN), which is chaired by
the Ministry of Planning and Economic Policy, fulfills some of the supervisory
functions normally associated with a central bank. It authorizes new branches,
collects and publishes financial data on the banking sector and participates
in the formulation and execution of monetary policies. In addition, all
public sector operations not covered in the current budget, including public
sector domestic and foreign borrowing, and capital expenditures are regulated
through the National Finance Commission (CFN), which is chaired by the
Minister of Finance.



- 5 -
1.14      Interest rates for domestic lending are based on the Eurodollar rates.
Lending rates for non-government entities range from 2% over LIBOR to a flat
rate of 14% to 15% for smaller, riskier operations. Lending terms are rela-
tively short, and, only recently, because of the wide acceptance of adjustable
interest rates in the domestic market, have commercial banks been willing to
lend for medium terms (five to seven years). Interest rates on time deposits
are set by the market forces and are similarly based on Eurodollar notes.
However, for savings deposits of less than US$14,000, the CBN has set a
maximum rate of 4-1/2% p.a. and a maximum of 5-1/2% p.a. for mortgage bank
time deposits.
Agricultural Credit
1.15      Institutional credit to the agricultural sector is provided mainly
by a limited number of private banks and, to a lesser extent, by the official
banks, BNP and BDA. The most important private banks operating in the agri-
cultural sector are: Bank of America, Chase Manhattan Bank, Banco Fiduciario,
Banco de Colombia and Banco de Bogota. In addition to direct lending, private
banks have indirectly financed the sector through medium-term loans to BDA
(US$13.1 million during the 1974-77 period) to finance MIDA's agricultural
credit programs. BNP and BDA provide lower levels of institutional credit,
but are, nevertheless, the most important sources of medium- and long-term
development credit for the sector and are the only ones accessible to small
farmers and asentamientos (paras 2.19 to 2.31).
1.16      During the 1973-76 period, total institutional credit and new loans
(excluding lending to the public sector) increased by 22%, from US$1,352
million in 1973 to US$1,645 million in 1976. In the same period, total lending
for crops and livestock increased by only 16%, from US$118 million to US$138
million; thus, the proportion of agricultural to total domestic credit decreased
from 9% to 8% during this period (Annex 3, Table 3). Total lending by private
banks rose from US$82 million in 197.3 to US$99 million in 1976, as compared
with an increase from US$36 million to only US$38 million in BNP and BDA.
However, all of the increase in lending by private banks was in the form of
short-term credit for production, processing, and marketing, generally benefit-
ting large producers and agroindustries associated with beef fattening,
sugarcane, rice, coffee and tobacco production.
1.17      BNP's lending to the sector during the 1973-76 period remained
at an annual average of US$14.8 million. The average size of loans in 1976
was about US$11,100 for crops and US$13,500 for livestock, benefitting a
total of 1,380 farmers. Although total lending from BDA represents only 21%
of all credit to the sector, it is the most important source of funds for
small-scale farmers and it is the on:Ly source of credit available to
asentamientos. BDA's average annual lending for the period 1973-76 was
about US$26 million. During 1977, BI)A lent to about 4,710 individual
producers with an average subloan size of US$3,100 and made about 241 loans
to group production schemes with an average subloan size of about US$26,500.
BDA's overall average subloan during 1977 was US$4,200.



- 6 -
1.18      Most interest rates in Panama are determined by the market
(para 1.14). However, the lending interest rates of BDA are set by its
Executive Committee, independently of market considerations, and based mainly
on the socio-economic conditions of its well-defined clientele and on its
relatively low average cost of funds (para 2.26). Special rates apply to
development programs regulated by international contracts such as Bank
operations through BNP under Loan 901-PAN, for which the annual on-lending
interest rate was 10%, 11% under Loan 1397-PAN, and 11.5% under Loan 1398-PAN.
Interest rates charged by private banks for agricultural lending are reported
to be 1% to 3% per annum higher than those currently charged by BNP. The
annual interest rates, fees and commissions for the agricultural lending
operations of BNP and BDA are summarized below:

1.19      Although the general banking law does not specify the kind of
collateral required for agricultural lending, long-term development loans
are generally against first mortgages with additional chattel mortgages,
if these are required. To qualify for long-term loans, it is important
for borrowers to have clear, legal title to land, but the requirement is a
drawback in Panama (para 1.06). However, according to BDA's current oper-
ational procedures, subloans for a period of less than three years can be
granted on the basis of chattel mortgages alone, which, in the absence of
other assets, can be on the investment financed with the proceeds of the
subloan and/or the outputs generated by the investment. Therefore, farmers
without title can obtain long-term credit from BDA, but they are required
to obtain clear title to their land within three years after subloan approval.
On the other hand, asentamientos that have not received title to the land
(para 1.08) obtain long-term funds under a general guarantee of MIDA.

Previous Bank loans for livestock development (901-PAN and 1397-PAN) have
addressed this problem by including, in the farm investment plan, whenever
necessary, resources to finance the cost of land survey and other expenses
required by sub-borrowers to obtain title to the land.
II. THE SUBSECTOR AND THE PROJECT AREAS
A. The Subsector
Bananas
2.01      Historically, bananas have been Panama's most important crop from
the standpoint of both their contribution to the value of production of the
sector (18%) and their share of foreign trade; foreign exchange earnings from
bananas amount to about US$60 million per year, equivalent to 41% of the total
agricultural sector exports. Bananas also provide work for approximately 23%
of the labor force utilized in the crop subsector and provide the national
budget with substantial export tax revenues of about US$10 million per year
(3.5% of all taxes in 1976).
2.02      Until July 1975, about 12,300 ha, or 93% of the total land area under
commercial banana plantations, was owned and operated by UB, accounting for
100% of Panama's banana exports. The balance of the land under bananas (7%)
was owned by 21 independent producers, most of whom are former employees of
UB, selling their production to UB. In January 1976, an agreement was signed
whereby UB sold to the Government all the land owned by the company in Panama
(43,000 ha). In the same contract, the Government leased back to UB 15,700 ha
under bananas or required for the company operation. The lease agreement
has a duration of five years and it is renewable annually. Most of the land
purchased from UB has been converted into asentamientos producing subsistence
crops. Some 1,280 ha in the Pacific area (Chiriqui province) and 450 ha in
the Atlantic area (Bocas del Toro province) have been developed under bananas
by two autonomous state corporations: the Banana Corporation of the Pacific
(COBAPA) and the Banana Corporation of the Atlantic (COBANA). Recently, both
plantations have been placed under the management of COBAPA. Panama's total
commercial banana production (measured on export basis) has been increasing
gradually from 419,000 m tons (23.0 million boxes) in 1974 to 526,000 m tons
(28.9 million boxes) in 1977. Plantations are generally well managed and the
average production per ha of 35.5 m tons (1,950 boxes) is comparable with the
productivity of the rest of the Central American countries. The country's
share of the world market for bananas from 1972 to 1974 was 7.8%.
Oil Palm
2.03      With the exception of small amounts of copra produced in the
San Blas area and mostly directly traded by Indian communities with Colombia,
Panama is currently importing almost all its requirements, some 18,000 m tons



- 8 -
per year of vegetable fats and oils, mostly as unrefined soybean oil, for a
total value of about US$10 million. The country's potential for producing oil
crops in sufficient quantity to satisfy the needs of the local market has not
been determined exactly, but lands suitable for these crops are known to be
scarce. However, a study carried out by the Research Institute for Oils and
Oil-bearing Crops (IRHO)/MIDA in 1976 identified four areas considered to be
suitable for oil palm development. Based on ecological conditions, topography
and available infrastructure (roads, railroad, and power), first priority was
given to the District of Baru in the Chiriqui Province, which is the area
proposed for the subproject.
2.04      There are some 1,000 ha of oil palm in the area of Icacal, Province
of Colon, and a mill capable of processing 5 m tons of fresh fruit bunches
(ffb) per hour, both abandoned by Compania Agricola Amsterdam because of land
tenure and labor problems. This plantation and adjacent land was subsequently
formed into an asentamiento (Cooperativa Agro-Industrial Icacal), which planted
an additional 1,020 ha of oil palm (tenera x melanococca hybrid) that should
start commercial production in 1979. In addition, there is an abandoned
plantation of 400 ha of coconuts in the Province of Veraguas, and COBAPA
planted, on an experimental basis, 26 ha of oil palm in the project area in
September 1976.
Coffee
2.05      Accounting for about 2% of total agricultural production value,
the average coffee production over the period 1972-76 has remained at around
4,800 m tons per year, not enough to fill Panama's indicative export market
allocation of the International Coffee Agreement (para 6.08). Only about
1,360 m tons were exported for a total value of US$4.4 million in 1977.
Coffee growing in Panama is essentially a small farm operation. The national
average size of coffee plantations is 0.7 ha, although in the Chiriqui Province,
which accounts for 52% of the country's production, the average size of a
coffee plantation is 1.1 ha. However, excluding coffee planted in family
gardens, the average size of commercial coffee plantations in Chiriqui is
about 2.2 ha. Density of stand is low, about 1,000 to 1,200 trees per ha,
and yields are about 227 kg/ha (5 quintals) of parchment coffee, which indi-
cates a generally low level of technology and the old age of the plantations.
Cocoa
2.06      From 1972 to 1976, cocoa production has averaged 620 m tons per year
and exports, about 600 m tons. Foreign exchange earnings from cocoa exports
have been usually slightly less than US$1 million per year but have recently
doubled, due to increases of international prices. The project area (Province
of Bocas del Toro) accounts for 85% of total area planted in cocoa and for all
of Panama's cocoa exports. Most of the farms are in the northwestern corner
of the province and are plantations originally established by UB during the
1920s on land from which bananas had been eliminated by the Panama disease.
In addition, a considerable amount of cocoa is grown by small farmers farther
to the east and south along the coast along the banks of rivers and creeks.
Many of these farmers, including members of indigenous communities, are rela-
tively new to the crop and often appear more receptive to technical advice



than the traditional growers. The cocoa produced by Panama is of the
Trinitario population, including the selected material introduced by MIDA from
Costa Rica. It falls within the category of "flavor cocoa," which obtains a
premium price on the international market.
B. Subsector Development, Strategies and Policies
Banana and Oil Palm
2.07      The Government's development strategies and policies for the banana
subsector are the responsibility of the National Banana Council (CONABA)
established in December 1977. CONABA is also responsible for Government
relations with UB and independent producers and represents the Government in
the Union of Banana Exporting Countries (UPEB) as well as other international
agencies concerned with the banana industry. In addition, CONABA is respon-
sible for development policies, supervision and control of the activities of
the two Government autonomous enterprises for banana production and marketing,
COBAPA and COBANA. The executive committee of CONABA is chaired by the
Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Development; other members of the
committee are the Minister of Commerce and Industry, the General Manager of
BNP and members of the executive committees of COBAPA and COBANA. The National
Directorate of Production of MIDA is responsible of oil palm development in
Panama.
Coffee and Cocoa
2.08      In 1973, a special department, the Department of Coffee and Cocoa,
was created within the National Directorate of Production of MIDA. Since
then, national development programs for coffee and cocoa have been formulated
and, because of inadequate funding, only partially implemented. These programs,
in addition to the definition of areas of development and beneficiaries,
include the importation of improved seeds, establishment of nurseries and the
provision of technical assistance and credit to small-scale farmers. The
main aspects of the Government's current development strategies and policies
are given below:
(a)  Coffee.  Government policy for coffee is defined in the framework
of a "Five-Year Plan for Coffee Renovation, 1976-80." The main
objectives of this plan are to improve productivity and to obtain
substantial increases in coffee production to enable Panama to meet
its internal demand and take full advantage of its available share
of the export market. More specifically, the production objective
is to replant or renovate 4,600 ha of old plantations belonging to
some 2,000 small-scale and medium-scale farmers in nine of the
most productive districts of the country.
(b) Cocoa. Implementation of a "Six-Year National Cocoa Program 1974-80"
was started in 1974 by the Department of Coffee and Cocoa in coordi-
nation with BDA for the credit aspects of the program. The goals
during these seven years were to plant or renovate a total of 3,250
ha in the province of Bocas del Toro.

C. The Project Areas
Location, Climate and Soils
2.09      Except for the coffee area, which extends over part of the highlands
of the Veraguas and Cocle provinces, the proposed project activities would be
located in the provinces of Chiriqui and Bocas del Toro. Oil palm and banana
development would take place on the Pacific Coastal Plain of Chiriqui, cocoa
development along the Atlantic Coast of Bocas del Toro, and coffee development
in the Central Cordillera above altitudes of 1,000 m (Map IBRD 13675).
2.10      Banana and oil palm development would take place in the western
part of the Chiriqui province (Baru District), about 40 km west of David,
capital of the province. Annual rainfall is about 2,500 mm, with two or three
months (January-March) having less than 60 mm of precipitation. Temperatures
range from 22 to 30 C and evaporation from 3.8 mm to 7.0 mm per day.  Minimum
direct sunlight per month is 97 hours and the maximum is 247 hours, for an
average of 176.3 hours. Topography is exceptionally uniform, with an average
slope of 0.2% from north to south. The soils of this area have been listed as
class II, adapted, with no major limitations, to a wide range of crops. About
8,300 ha of the district of Baru are under banana plantations, while the rest
is under rice, maize, sugarcane, sorghum, plantain and patches of natural forest.
2.11      The cocoa area in the province of Bocas del Toro lies within the
humid tropics, with a portion along the southeastern edge of the Laguna de
Chiriqui in the very humid premontane tropics. Minimum rainfall is 2,500 mm,
with about 3,500 mm along the western edge of the Laguna de Chiriqui and a
maximum of about 4,000 mm in the area from Miramar to Man Creek. Average
annual temperature is 26 C°and average relative humidity, 84%.  Bocas del
Toro province contains some 157,000 ha of land in classes II, III, and IV,
representing 18% of the area of the province, upon much of which cocoa could
be grown. The soils in use at present are deep and friable, with good aeration.
Because of the heavy rainfall, provision must always be made for drainage and
precautions must also be taken to avoid erosion.
2.12      The climate of the coffee growing areas (highlands of Chiriqui,
Veraguas, and Cocle) is somewhat variable, depending on altitude. Rainfall
ranges from about 2,500 mm to 3,500 mm with a three-to-four-month dry season.
0      0
Mean annual temperatures range from about 18° to 22°C.  Average rainfall can
vary abruptly from one valley to the next, with one having good growing con-
ditions and the next suffering from a moisture shortage.
Resources and Resource Use
2.13      Chiriqui.  In 1970, there were 15,655 farms in the Province with
more than 1 ha, more than half of which had less than 10 ha. Almost all farms
are owner-operated, but more than 80% do not have property titles. Seasonal
internal migrations are pronounced, particularly from the isolated indigenous
communities of the Highlands of Chiriqui and the neighboring province of
Veraguas toward the coffee and sugarcane areas. According to a preliminary



- 1 1 -
study made by the International Labor Organization on the basis of the 1970/71
census, even at the peak agricultural season, there was a 13% excess of labor
force availability over requirements; during the slack season, this excess is
close to 65%. Due to differences in topography within the province, its
agricultural production is quite diversified. The contrast is sharp between
the large modern sector of the Coastal Plain, where 54% of the country's
banana production is grown, together with sugarcane and rice, and medium-size
livestock activities are concentrated, and the traditional sector in the
highlands, where predominantly small farmers grow 50% of the country's tobacco
and coffee production, vegetables, potatoes and grains for subsistence and
maintain a small number of animals.
2.14      The 1,000 ha of the Baru District to be developed with bananas under
the project are held by four asentamientos (para 4.05). A recent (December
1977) socioeconomic study of these asientamientos revealed a very low utiliza-
tion of the land and labor resources. The land is being used only partially
for the production of mechanized rice, corn and sorghum, with low yields and
gross value of production below the direct cost of production. The average
per family income derived from the asentamientos' operation is only about
US$250 per year (equivalent to about 60 days of full employment elsewhere).
Because of the negative results of the farm operation, income to settlers
comes almost exclusively from payments to labor financed through BDA, which
is an integral part of the lines of short-term credit provided to finance
asentamientos.  In addition, these asentamientos have several debts in arrears
with BDA which will amount to a total of about US$1.1 million as of December
31, 1978. The asentamientos currently have about 170 settlers and their
families. The additional labor force required by the banana plantation, about
240 laborers, would be incorporated into the asentamientos with rights and
conditions equal to those of existing settlers (para 4.05). The oil palm
plantations would be developed on about 16 asentamientos, holding a total area
of about 5,000 ha. The current cropping pattern and the results of the
operation of these asentamientos are similar to those of the asentamientos to
benefit from banana development. The main problems affecting the performance
of the asentamientos are: the absence of adequate production-oriented tech-
nical assistance and management training programs; emphasis on capital-intensive
cropping patterns, which limits the employment of available labor; and the
relatively small (5.9 ha) land area available per family. The proposed project
would eliminate the above constraints through the development of bananas and
oil palm, high value and labor-intensive crops, adequate provision of technical
assistance, and management training for the land reform beneficiaries.
2.15      Bocas del Toro.  The total area of farms, including the banana area,
amounted to 49,543 ha in 1970, or 5.5% of the total land area. There were 720
farms of more than 1 ha and almost half were under 10 ha. Seventy-five
percent of all farms and about 85% of those holding less than 10 ha have no
formal titles.  Land use is very extensive, a large proportion of farmland
being unused or in fallow. Agricultural activity is concentrated in the
Almirante-Changuinola banana area, close to the border with Costa Rica, and
further to the south within a few mileEs of the Atlantic Coast. Much of the
farmland along the coast is cultivated by small farmers and indigenous communi-
ties who grow some grains and plantain for subsistence purposes, with cocoa as
their only cash crop. Because of the stable nature of employment on banana



- 12 -
plantations, absence of communications infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent,
employment on cocoa plantations, seasonal internal migration is relatively
small. Manpower surplus has been estimated at 13% at peak season and 16% at
the slack season. However, these data are biased by the relative importance
of the banana sector in total agricultural employment in the area. Under-
employment is likely to be much more substantially cyclical on non-banana
farms.
Infrastructure and Services to the Subsector
2.16      The two provinces are at opposite extremes in terms of communica-
tions infrastructure. The Chiriqui province, with 1,020 km of roads, has the
greatest length of all-weather roads in the country. The coffee growing
areas of Chiriqui are well connected by all-weather roads to the rest of the
country through the Panamerican Highway. The banana areas are connected to
the Port of Armuelles by railroad. On the other hand, Bocas del Toro is
linked to the rest of the country only by air or sea. Its internal permanent
road network is 23 km and more than 90% of its population is outside its area
of influence. Internal transportation of merchandise is, to a large extent,
through an old railroad track between the banana port of Almirante and the
Costa Rican border and by coastal shipping. Almirante is also the port from
which goods are carried in and out of the province from or to Colon.
2.17      No significant Government research has been carried out on the
proposed project products: cocoa, coffee, bananas and oil palm. The cocoa
and coffee development programs currently implemented by MIDA rely on imported
seed material and adaptive research developed by the Center for Research and
Education on Tropical Agriculture (CATIE) in Costa Rica. Technical assistance
to the oil palm plantations of Icacal (para 2.04) is provided by MIDA and by
periodic visits of IRHO technicians from Colombia. Research and extension in
bananas is provided by UB, COBAPA, the Tropical Agricultural Research Service
(SIATSA) in Honduras, and Rohm and Haas Company in Costa Rica; in the near
future, the Multinational Banana Marketing Corporation (COMUNBANA) will also
provide assistance.
2.18      Of considerable importance to the cocoa subsector is the Cooperativa
de Cacao Bocatorena founded in 1956, which now has a total of 600 members and
markets 60% of Panama's cocoa exports. In 1964 it contracted several loans
with BDA which fell in arrears. In 1973, management of the cooperative was
taken over by the state marketing agency (IMA), which operated it as a cocoa
trading post until 1976, when the debt was completely repaid. Since then, the
operations have reverted to the cooperative and its management completely
reorganized with assistance from BDA, IMA, MIDA and specialized cooperative
promotion institutions; in 1977, the accounts of the cooperative showed a net
surplus of US$27,000. Besides marketing its members' output and providing
limited technical assistance, the cooperative has also initiated the sale of
inputs, which it can import free of duties and internal taxation, at prices
sometimes 40% lower than at local stores. Although not participating directly
in the project, the cooperative would purchase the cocoa production generated
by the project and it is expected that a large number of project beneficiaries
would be members, or become members, of the cooperative.

D. Institutions Participating in the Project
National Bank of Panama (BNP)
2.19      BNP is by far the most important Government bank and the country's
largest commercial bank. It serves as fiscal and fiduciary agent for Govern-
ment, performs functions for the Treasury. The general manager of the bank
has an influential role in policy decisions on economic matters, similar to
the one that, in other countries, is played by the heads of the central banks.
He is an ex-officio member of the CBN.
2.20      As of June 30, 1977, BNP had about 30% of total local deposits
of the banking system, of which about 60% were Government or public entity
deposits. The bank competes in the market for time deposits and, in many
cases, it sets the pattern for the rates to be paid by the rest of the banking
system. The large number of branches (62) that the bank has all over the
country also contributes to the obtention of deposits. Lending to the govern-
ment, as a percentage of BNP total portfolio, increased from an average of 17%
in the 1970/71 period to 52% in the 1976/77 period. BNP does not collect
interest from the overdraft facility it grants to the Central Government,
known as "Government Account 215." This facility amounted to US$108.6 million
as of May 8, 1978. For the rest of the loans granted to "public productive
enterprises," interest rates are charged. BNP, however, will in future
capitalize its profits instead of transferring them to the Government as
compensation for the lack of interest accrued on Government loans.
2.21      BNP has taken important steps to improve its financial situation
(Annex 3, Tables 4 and 5). Its debt equity ratio was reduced from 9.1 in 1976
to 7.6 in 1977, and, as a result of iLmproved loan collection procedures, the
percentage of loans in arrears was reduced from 11.6% in 1975 to 5.5% in 1977.
It has also reduced its operating costs through an austerity program and
improvements in cost control. Net profits thus increased from US$0.4 million
in 1975 to US$2.0 million in 1977, equivalent to 0.2% and 0.7% of its total
productive assets (loan portfolio) for the years 1975 and 1977, respectively.
2.22      BNP, through the Development Banking Section, is responsible for the
implementation of three ongoing Bank loans for the agricultural sector (Loan
901-PAN, Loan 1397-PAN and Loan 1398-PAN), and except for a recent increase in
arrears of the livestock portfolio (Loans 901-PAN and 1397-PAN), due mainly to
the 1976/77 drought, overall performaLnce in implementation has been satisfactory.
Agricultural Development Bank (BDA)
2.23      BDA was established as an autonomous Government agency in 1973.  It
is required by law to direct its lending to (a) small farmer associations
and cooperatives; (b) small- and medium-size farms; (c) agroindustrial projects
sponsored by MIDA; (d) national and local Government groups that have agricul-
ture, fishery, livestock, and agro-industry activities; and (e) any person
whose production activity is in accordance with MIDA's policy.



- 14 -
2.24      BDA's Board is chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock
Development and its members are the Minister of Commerce and Industry, the
General Manager of BNP, one representative of individual farmers, and one
representative of organized farmers. The General Manager of BDA is appointed
by the President of Panama.
2.25      BDA, which is organized along functional lines, is divided into nine
departments, six of which report directly to the General Manager: Finance,
Planning, Administrative and Personnel, Legal Adviser, Internal Auditing and
the Fisheries Cooperative Project. The remaining three departments, which are
directly related to lending operations, report to the Deputy General Manager;
these are (a) Projects, responsible for technical assistance, evaluation of
projects, and subloan recoveries; (b) Organized Farmers, responsible for
programs to asentamientos and cooperatives (representing about 50% of the BDA
loan portfolio); and (c) Individual Farmers, responsible for programs for
individual small-scale and medium-scale farmers. BDA has headquarters in
Panama City, with a network of six regional offices and 26 local agencies
distributed throughout the country. Subloan technical supervision and
recoveries are a responsibility of the local agencies. On December 31, 1977,
BDA's agricultural technicians and field inspectors numbered 166, equivalent
to about 27% of its employees (622).
2.26      BDA is an agricultural development fund rather than a full service
bank. Its resources come from: equity; borrowing from multinational and
bilateral agencies and from the capital market; issues of bonds; and Government
grants. Since its inception, the bulk of funds for lending to agriculture
and livestock has come from IDB and USAID. Private banks have also jointly
arranged to provide short-term credit to BDA to finance its activities. On
December 31, 1977, BDA's net worth was US$39.0 million, representing about
60% of its total liabilities, and, due to the resource structure of BDA, its
overall weighted average cost of money was only 2.4% during 1977 and 6.2% for
its external borrowing from USAID, IDB and private banks.
2.27      As of December 1977, the weighted average interest rate of BDA's
total outstanding portfolio was 8.3% per annum. Interest collections, however,
are low, representing only about 80% of total interest due in 1977. Subloan
ceilings are in effect for different sub-borrowers; US$5,000 for small-scale
farmers; US$25,000 for medium-scale farmers; US$100,000 for large-scale
farmers or corporations; and US$250,000 for farmer organizations. Small-
scale farmers are entitled to loans of up to 100% of project costs, while
medium-scale farmers have to contribute 10% of total project costs. Subloans
of less than US$2,500 are authorized by local agency managers, while those
between US$2,500 and US$5,000 require approval by a local loan committee.
Subloans up to US$25,000 can be approved at the regional loan committee level,
and those exceeding US$25,000 require the approval of the central office.
2.28      BDA's loan portfolio increased rapidly from 1973 to 1977.  Total
outstanding portfolio as of the end of each of these years is given below:

Annual rate of growth (%)                 -    48       28        9       12
Arrears and bad debts are the main problems affecting BDA's performance.
Total arrears as of December 1977 represented about 15% of the total outstand-
ing portfolio, but comparison of 1977 arrears with 1976 short-term loans and
current maturities of long-term loans gives a total arrears of about 30%.
This situation, however, reflects the impact of the drought of the 1976/77
crop year and a subsequent moratorium authorized by the Government. Average
age of the arrears increased from 16 months in 1974, to 20 months in 1976,
and to 21 months in 1977. The total amount of arrears written off during the
last four years was about US$1.0 million, and, currently, the legal department
of the BDA is taking measures against beneficiaries of 400 past-due loans
amounting to about US$0.7 million.
2.29      As of December 1977, BDA's loan portfolio represented 81% of total
assets, US$65 million (Annex 3, Table 6). The ratio of current assets to
current liabilities, 2.8:1, is satisfactory, reflecting both the bank's
relatively large equity and the long-term borrowing. Total equity amounted
to US$39 million, while external liabilities accounted for only US$26 million,
of which US$12 million were short term, reflecting a relatively stable finan-
cial situation through continuous Government contribution to its equity (Annex
3, Table 7). BDA has suffered losses every year since it was established.
Those in 1976 and 1977 were about US$2.2 million annually which reflected
relatively high administrative costs (salaries) that were almost equal to BDA's
interest income. BDA annual losses during the 1974-77 period were equivalent
to 5.5% to 8.1% of BDA's equity, or 4.5% to 6.3% of its loan portfolio. The
annual gross income as a percentage of annual average assets was about 5.4%
and reflects the poor financial return. Annual Government subsidies (which
were not charged to the income statement but transferred directly to BDA
equity) helped the bank to maintain its financial structure. Since BDA's
establishment, the Government subsidies and direct contributions to the equity
total US$37.0 million (Annex 3, Table 8). This sizable contribution of
financial resources enabled BDA to cover its accumulated losses (US$9.0 million)
and sustain its large increase in loan portfolio (US$35.0 million). Borrowing
from international agencies and in the domestic and foreign capital market
amounted to US$13 million.
2.30      The Government of Panama is well aware that BDA, although an impor-
tant instrument of MIDA's agricultural development programs for the small-
scale farming sector, has not been efficiently managed. Therefore, a complete
administrative and financial reorganization of BDA, based on a study financed
by IDB, is currently being implemented with the active participation of IDB.
Changes have been made to the administrative structure, the accounting and
management reporting system and the budgeting procedures. More recently
(October 1978), following negotiations between IDB and the Government of



- 16 -
Panama on a US$15.0 million loan for general agricultural credit 1/, the
Government of Panama has agreed to the following changes in BDA's operations
and procedures: to increase lending interest rates and interest rate spreads;
to increase the volume of operations, and assign funds obtained from private
banks would be lent only to medium- and large-scale farmers at commercial
interest rates; to introduce improvements in the arrears collection procedures
and to eliminate non-recoverable debts; to assume the repayment of US$6.0
million of BDA's borrowing from private banks; to make an annual contribution
to BDA equity of at least US$1.3 million during 1978 and 1979 and of US$1.5
million in 1980 and 1981 to cover BDA's projected operating losses during the
adjustment period; and to increase the autonomy and level of decisions of
local and regional agencies. The above changes were initiated during 1978.
2.31      These changes, together with the US$12.0 million increase of BDA's
equity (Government counterpart funds to the IDB loan and the private banks'
debt to be repaid by the Government), would improve substantially BDA's
development capacity and financial situation. Therefore, given that BDA's
participation in the project would be mainly that of a disbursing and
collecting agency and that operations would be centralized in the specific
project areas, no problems are anticipated in BDA's participation in the
proposed project. The assurances obtained by IDB have been reviewed by the
Bank and found to be satisfactory. No further covenants are therefore
considered to be necessary.
Banana Corporation of the Pacific (COBAPA)
2.32      COBAPA started operations in 1974 and was legally established by
Law No. 4 of January 1977 as an autonomous Government institution, subject
to Government policy guidelines exercised through CONABA. COBAPA's principal
functions are to produce and market bananas on Government land, formerly owned
by UB (para 2.02). COBAPA is managed by an Executive Committee with the
participation of its General Manager, one member designated by CONABA and a
delegate of the laborers. The General Manager of COBAPA, appointed by the
Government, is the former's legal representative and is responsible for
administrative and technical management. COBAPA headquarters and plantations
are located in the David District, Province of Chiriqui.
2.33      Currently, COBAPA has a total staff of about 750, about 700 of whom
are laborers. The rest are field supervisors, technicians and office staff
responsible for day-to-day operation of the plantation. In addition to
salaries and social benefits, the workers and employees of the plantation
receive a share of the profits generated by COBAPA. Overall, COBAPA is a
well-managed institution, with a computerized reporting and accounting system,
and it is regularly audited by independent certified public accountants.
Therefore, no specific problems are envisaged in regard to COBAPA's participa-
tion in the proposed project. Tables 9 and 10 of Annex 3 provide details
of COBAPA's financial position.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
3.01      The Government of Panama has requested a Bank loan to help finance
an investment program designed to improve and develop the tree crop subsector
in Panama. The feasibility study for the proposed project was prepared by
the Government with the assistance of an FAO/Bank Cooperative Program mission
(Report No. 48/77 PAN 5) that visited, Panama in October-November 1977. The
study was submitted to the Bank in February 1978.
B. Brief Description
3.02      The proposed project would finance, over a three-year commitment
period, subloans for long-term investment to be disbursed by participating
institutions over a period of six years, with Bank disbursements extending
over six years. The Bank loan would partially finance a lending program to:
(a) renovate about 600 ha and establish new plantations of cocoa on
about 1,900 ha;
(b) renovate about 1,300 ha of coffee plantations;
(c) plant 1,000 ha of bananas; and
(d) finance the development of a 3,000-ha oil palm plantation,
including the first stage of the palm oil processing
facilities.
3.03      The project would provide about 2,000 small commercial coffee and
cocoa farmers with credit, improved planting material and technical assistance
on the basis of technically and financially viable investment plans. All
lending for coffee development (1,300 ha) and about 24% of cocoa development
lending (600 ha) would be for replanting existing but low yielding and un-
profitable plantings. The remainder of the cocoa development would be to
establish new areas (1,900 ha) under this crop. About 410 beneficiaries of
the banana development (1,000 ha) and 640 on the oil palm plantation (3,000
ha) would be mainly agrarian reform beneficiaries, currently having rights
only to the use of land and landless laborers. In addition to the investments
associated with field establishment of bananas and oil palm, the project would
finance machinery, equipment and other infrastructure required for the
operation of those two components, including the first stage of the oil palm
processing plant. Finally, the project would finance technical assistance for
on-farm development and monitoring and evaluation of the cocoa and coffee
components and training of local technicians.



- 18 -
3.04      The proposed loan would be made to BNP, with the guarantee of the
Government of Panama. The banana and oil palm components would be disbursed
directly through BNP, which also would be responsible for overall project
implementation. Funds for cocoa and coffee development would be disbursed
by BNP through BDA, acting as a participating bank. Other participating
agencies would be MIDA and COBAPA.
C. Detailed Features
On-farm Development
3.05      Cocoa Development.  Under this component, about 1,000 subloans would
be made to develop cocoa plantations of I to 5 ha in size, with an estimated
average of 2.5 ha per sub-borrower. Investments for cocoa development would
be made over a three-year period. Cocoa plantings would take place during
the first year, followed by planting temporary shade (plantain), construc-
ting drainage channels and purchasing a hand-operated sprayer. Investments
during Years 2 and 3 would be for the purchase of inputs required for the
maintenance of the new plantation. Average investment has been estimated at
US$1,840 per ha, equivalent to a total investment of US$4,600 per sub-borrower.
3.06      Coffee Development.  The project would finance the renovation of
the old coffee plantations and their maintenance during the first three years.
All the work would be done by hand labor; other investments would include the
purchase of inputs, small tools and a hand-operated sprayer. About 1,000
small-scale farmers are expected to benefit from this component. The size of
the coffee plots to be renovated would range between I and 3 ha in size, with
an estimated average of 1.3 ha per sub-borrower; total investment per sub-
borrower would be about US$4,400, or US$3,415 per ha.
3.07      The cocoa plants would be produced in nurseries established on each
farm. Seed would be imported by MIDA from Costa Rica, and inputs and technical
assistance for the nurseries would be provided by extension staff of the Cocoa
Program of MIDA; the labor required for the establishment and maintenance of
each nursery would be provided by the farmer. The technical staff of the
Cocoa Program would maintain control of the nursery until planting time.
Coffee plants would be produced in central nurseries established in the
project areas, operated by the Coffee Program of MIDA. Cocoa and coffee
plants would be delivered and sold at cost to farmers participating in the
project.
3.08      Banana Development.  A 1,000-ha banana plantation would be developed
over a two-year period. Main investments would be the construction of 20 km
of internal roads, 25 km of main drainage canals, 85 km of secondary canals
and 210 km of tertiary drainage canals. Improvements would be made to 4-1/2
km of the railroad tracks passing the site of the plantation and running to
the shipping port (Puerto Armuelles). Four packing sheds, each with a capacity
to process bananas from 300 ha would be constructed and fully equipped, and
four warehouses would be built to store boxes, tools, and inputs. The project
would also provide 120 houses for technicians, supervisors and laborers.



- 19 -
Investment in irrigation equipment would include the purchase of six 180-hp
pumps and electric motors, pipelines, and sprinklers. Aerial haulers to
transport the banana bunches from the field to the packing sheds also would be
purchased. The total investment in the banana plantation would be about
US$4.5 million equivalent to US$4.490 per ha or US$10,975 per beneficiary.
3.09      Oil Palm Development.  At the time of appraisal, there was no
detailed study for this component, therefore the Bank prepared appropriate
terms of reference (Annex 1) for a study to determine the feasibility and
technical design for the oil palm plantation and to select the land suitable
for oil palms from the area of about 5,000 ha available for the proposed
plantation. The Government selected IRHO as the consultants for the study,
The final report of the consultants was received by the Bank in February
1979.
3.10      Investments for the development of the 3,000 ha of oil palm planta-
tion under the project would take place during a six-year period (1979-84).
Two years would be required to raise planting material and prepare the land.
Field planting of the first 400 ha would be carried out in 1981 (Year 3 of
the project); the remaining area would be phased as follows: 800 ha in 1982;
900 ha in 1983; and 900 ha in 1984. Investments in infrastructure would
include the construction of a drainage system, feeder and collecting roads,
germinating house, warehouse, houses for technicians and the building to house
the processing plant. Main investments in machinery and equipment would
include the purchase of tractors and equipment for field work, dump trucks to
transport the fresh fruit bunches (ffb) to the factory and vehicles for field
technicians. The first stage of the palm oil processing plant (10 m tons of
ffb/hour) would be financed in 1982-83 (Years 4 and 5 of the project). A
second stage, 13 m ton of ffb/hour, would be installed in Year 7 of the
project (1985). The total investment in the plantation and oil mill would be
about US$13.0 million, equivalent to US$4,335 per ha or US$20,300 per
beneficiary. Additional investments in Years 7 and 8 (1985-86) related to
the maintenance and operation of the plantation and to the purchase of the
second phase of the oil palm processing plant would be financed through BNP
(para 3.15).
3.11      The table on page 20 summarizes the phasing of the lending program,
and average investment values expected for the four project components.
Technical Assistance
3.12      The project would include financing for consultant services and
foreign training for local technicians. It is estimated that about 245 man-
months, spread over the six-year implementation period, would be required to
assist and train local technicians working in cocoa and coffee development
and in the implementation and operation phases of the oil palm plantations.
An additional five man-months of consultant services would be financed during
the third and fourth year to assist in establishing and operating an evaluation
system to assess the impact of the cocoa and coffee components (para 4.19).

The total cost of consulting services has been estimated at US$1.2 million,
or an average gross cost per man-month of about US$4,800. Funds would be
provided to finance short study tours and on-the-job training of local tech-
nicians for a total of about 16 man-months. Finally, the project would
finance the vehicles and equipment required by the cocoa and coffee extension
staff. Salaries and other incremental operating expenditures related to cocoa
and coffee technical assistance would be financed by MIDA (para 3.15).
Details of investments in technical assistance are given in Annex 3, Tables 11
and 12).
D.  Project Costs
3.13      Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at US$38
million including US$1.3 million of Local sales tax. The proposed Bank loan
of US$19 million represents the cost of the imported component net of import
duties and taxes. Project baseline costs have been estimated on the basis of
prices of February/March 1978. A physical contingency of 15% for buildings
and other infrastructure, and of 20% for machinery and equipment, has been
included to the base cost of the bananas and oil palm component to allow for
unknown site conditions and final design of these components. Price contin-
gencies are based on the phasing of the investment over a six-year period
(Annex 3, Table 13) and on the assumption that commitments, except for the oil
palm component, would have started in April 1978 (para 3.17). Expected price
increases for the imported component would be 7.0% for 1978, 6.5% for 1979 and
6.0% for 1980 to 1985; for local costs, it was assumed that the domestic price
increases would be 8.0% for 1978, 7.5% for 1979 and 7.0% thereafter. Project
costs by main investment items are summarized in Annex 3, Table 14. Project
costs by component, which are summarized in the table on page 22, do not
include the cost of family labor or investments which would be required in
Year 5 for cocoa and coffee (US$986,000) corresponding to the third year
investment of subloans committed in Year 3 of the project and in Years 7 and 8
for the oil palm component (US$2,755,000). These amounts would be financed by
BNP from the cumulative surplus generated by the project (para 6.17).

financed by the Government and/or the private sector (para 4.08).
3.15      The proposed Bank loan of US$19 million would finance the imported
component of the project, which has been estimated at 50% of the total project
cost. Project beneficiaries would finance US$2.0 million, representing 5% of
the total project cost, and US$11.7 miLllion, or 31%, would be financed by BNP.
An additional US$5.3 million, including US$4.7 million of equity capital for
the oil mill and US$0.6 million for technical assistance, equivalent to 14% of
total project cost, would be financed by the Government. MIDA would finance
from its budget a total of US$600,000 distributed during the implementation
period of the project as follows: Year 1, US$70,000; Year 2, US$120,000;
Year 3, US$200,000; and Year 4, US$210,000. The annual cost to the Government
after completion of the project would continue at about the level of Year 4.
Complementary short-term credit to carry out the investment plans would be
financed by BNP and BDA with resources other than those of the project.
Assurances on the above were obtained during negotiations. Furthermore,
BNP would finance the additional funds required for the cocoa, coffee and oil
palm plantation from the cumulative surplus of the project cash flow (para
6.18).
3.16      A request for retroactive financing, which would allow COBAPA to
plant 500 ha of the 1,000 ha of bananas to be developed under the project
during the 1978 planting season (May to October), was made by the Borrower
to the Bank on March 21, 1978. Later, in September 1978, the request for
retroactive financing was modified to allow planting about 250 ha of bananas
and about 250 ha of cocoa and coffee during the 1978 planting season. Currently,
COBAPA, in order to maintain a technically viable operation and its external

market, has to purchase fruit from UB at an average FOB price 30% higher than
the comparable cost of COBAPA's own production. Therefore, in addition to
seasonal factors and availability of planting material, which had to be
utilized during 1978, substantial financial and other non-quantifiable bene-
fits would accrue to COBAPA and to the Government from the completion of the
investment program in the shortest time possible. Additionally, this would
lead to a reduction of total project cost and, given the relatively short
repayment period of the banana subloan, it would generate a rollover of funds
in later years to finance other components, which would therefore reduce the
total financial requirements for the project (para 6.18). Retroactive finan-
cing for cocoa and coffee would allow BDA to gain time in the implementation
of these components and utilize available planting material.
3.17      Retroactive financing is recommended for expenditures incurred in
cocoa, coffee and bananas from April 1, 1978. BNP and BDA would provide the
loan initially required to finance these components. Once the proposed loan
became effective and provided that procurement procedures had complied with
the Bank requirements (para 3.21), the Bank would reimburse BNP 53% of total
investments for a maximum amount of US$1.5 million.
3.18      The project's lending program would be financed as follows:
(US$ million)
BNP              Bank       Total Lending
Amount    %       Amount    %      Amount    %
On-farm investments                   8.8    47          9.9    53       18.7    100
Oil Mill /a                             -      -        3.0    50        3.0    100
Total baseline                        8.8    41        12.9    59       21.7    100
/a   Excluding US$3.0 million, (US$4.7 million including contingencies) of
equity capital to be financed by the Government and/or the private
sector.
3.19      The Bank loan would be made to BNP at the Bank lending rate prevail-
ing at the time of loan approval, for a term of 15 years, including four years
of grace. The Government of Panama would guarantee the loan and would also
bear the foreign exchange risk. BNP would onlend the proceeds of the Bank
loan and the counterpart funds directly to beneficiaries for banana and oil
palm development and it would disburse through BDA the project's funds for
cocoa and coffee development.



- 2.5 -
F. Procurement
3.20      The purchase of on-farm investment items required for cocoa, coffee,
banana and oil palm development would be procured over a six-year period by
about 2,000 small-scale farmers and 19 land reform settlements. Inputs, small
equipment and tools, valued at US$7.7 million, would be varied or limited for
technological reasons (seeds) and not suitable for procurement through local
or international competitive bidding. Therefore, sub-borrowers would purchase
their requirements through local established commercial channels, including
rural and farmers' cooperatives, representing a broad spectrum of international
suppliers. International comparative shopping, subject to Bank approval, would
be utilized in the procurement of the oil palm seeds (US$0.3 million).
3.21      Contracts for the acquisition of tractors, machinery, equipment and
vehicles (US$7.3 million) required to develop the 19 land reform settlements
to benefit from banana and oil palm, for purchase of the oil mill and for
technical assistance, would be procured over a six-year period. Purchases of
less than US$50,000 equivalent would be made directly through local commercial
channels. Whenever an individual order for goods, work or services (other
than consultant services) to be procured is expected to be the equivalent of
between US$50,000 and US$100,000, price quotations would be obtained from at
least three local suppliers. Orders exceeding US$100,000 equivalent would be
through international competitive bidding, according to Bank procedures.
Civil works for project facilities (US$3.8 million) would be carried out
through force account and/or through locally advertised competitive bidding
procedures, which are acceptable to the Bank. The remaining expenditures for
the technical assistance component of the project (US$1.5 million) are not
suitable for competitive bidding. Consultants and training expenditures would
be financed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. Foreign firms
are adequately represented in Panama and there is a good network of competi-
tive suppliers of agricultural inputs; facilities for maintenance of machinery
and equipment are adequate. All inputs, machinery and equipment for the
proposed investments are exempt from import duties and subject only, if
purchased locally, to a 5% sales tax. Furthermore, there are no import
restrictions which could affect purchases through existing local channels.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the above procurement pro-
cedures would be followed.
G. Disbuirsements
3.22      The Bank would disburse over a period of six years:
(a)  53% of the amounts disbursed for farm development subloans
for a total value of US$11.8 million;
(i) US$4.7 million for cocoEL and coffee development, and;
(ii) US$7.1 million for bananas and oil palm plantations;
(b) 100% of the subloan for the oil palm processing plant for
a total value of US$3.8 million (equivalent to 50% of the
total cost of the component);



- 26 -
(c) 100% of the total cost of consultant services, for a total
value of US$1.2 million;
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures for the training program for a
total value of US$190,000;
(e) 100% of foreign expenditures for vehicles and equipment
related to technical assistance, or 85% of local expenditures,
if locally procured but previously imported, for a total of
US$70,000; and
(f) 100% of the foreign expenditure, or 56% of total expendi-
tures related to monitoring and evaluation, for a total
value of US$40,000.
The above values include US$2.1 million of the US$4.0 million price contin-
gencies; the balance of US$1.9 million would initially be unallocated.
3.23      The Bank would reimburse for farm subloans made for cocoa and
coffee development against statements of expenditures, which would be
certified by BNP and BDA. Supporting documentation for these expenditures
would not be submitted to the Bank, but would be retained by BNP and BDA
for review during the course of Bank supervision missions. Other disburse-
ments for banana and oil palm development would be made against standard
documentation. All other disbursements would be supported by standard docu-
mentation.
3.24      Expenditures for civil works for project facilities (US$2.7 million)
that would be carried out by force account by COBAPA, would be reimbursed
against statements of expenditures, the supporting documentation for which
would be retained by BNP and made available for review by the personnel
of Bank supervision missions. The estimated schedule of Bank disbursements,
assuming that the date of loan signature of the proposed loan would be no
later than April 1979, would be as follows:

IV. PROJECT I]MPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
4.01      The Borrower would be BNP, which would also be responsible for the
overall supervision and coordination of project implementation; its General
Manager would be the Borrower's official representative in dealing with
the Bank in all technical and financ:Lal matters related to the project. Day-
to-day management of the project wouLd be the responsibility of the Manager
of the Development Banking Section of- BNP, assisted by a full-time qualified
professional, acceptable to the Bank. to be appointed by September 30, 1979
(within two months of loan effectiveness) as project coordinator and financed
by BNP. An assurance on this was obtained at negotiations. The project
coordinator would remain in BNP for the implementation period of the project.
The main duties of the project coordiLnator would be to assist in the implemen-
tation of policies and procedures required for project implementation in line
with those followed by BNP in the implementation of the ongoing Bank projects
(Loan 901-PAN, 1397-PAN and 1398-PAN). He would also collaborate and assist
COBAPA's oil palm division, BDA and MIDA in the development and preparation
for presentation to BNP and the Bank of the overseas training program for
local technicians in cocoa, coffee and oil palm; terms of reference for
consultants in cocoa and coffee development; and local training programs to be
carried out by the above consultants. In addition, he would collaborate with
BDA's Projects Department and the MIDA Cocoa and Coffee Programs in the prepara-
tion of the terms of reference for consultants and design of the system to be
utilized in the impact evaluation of the cocoa and coffee components. Finally,
he would be directly responsible for the collation of information and for
preparation of quarterly reports on project progress and performance for
timely submission to BNP, MIDA and the Bank. It would be a condition of
disbursement of the Bank funds for technical assistance to MIDA that an
agreement, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, for the repayment
of the US$0.9 million of Bank funds, had been entered into by BNP and MIDA.
4.02      BDA's Deputy General Manager would have direct responsibility for
the implementation of the cocoa and coffee components and serve as a liaison
officer between BDA and BNP for all activities related to project implementa-
tion and management.
Cocoa and Coffee Development
4.03      BDA's Projects Department, which is directly responsible to the
Deputy General Manager, jointly with MIDA's technicians of the Cocoa and
Coffee Programs, would be responsible for implementation of the cocoa and
coffee components through the regional offices and branches of BDA (Map IBRD
13675). As a participating bank, BDA would be in charge of the financial
evaluation of subloan requests, disbursements and collection of subloans.
Technical assistance, including promotional activities, subloan preparation,
technical evaluation and supervision, would be provided by MIDA's technicians.
BDA and MIDA have been jointly implementing the Cocoa and Coffee Programs for
about three years (para 2.08) and the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock



- 28 -
Development is also the chairman of the Executive Committee of BDA; therefore,
no coordination problems that might affect project implementation are antici-
pated. However, in order to ensure that the lending targets are met and that
adequate technical assistance is provided to sub-borrowers, MIDA would, during
the four-year implementation period of the project, increase the total number
of technicians working in the project areas from six to 16 in cocoa and from
14 to 20 in coffee (Annex 3, Table 15). Assurances on the above were obtained
during negotiations.
4.04      The technicians currently working in cocoa and coffee development in
the project areas, as well as their vehicles and equipment, would be assigned
by MIDA to BDA for the four-year implementation period. These technicians
would be engaged to work full time on project activities; their salaries and
other expenses related to the operation, as well as those of the additional
technicians, would be financed by MIDA. An assurance to this effect was
obtained during negotiations. MIDA would appoint, from the existing staff
working in the project areas in cocoa and coffee development, two field
officers to assume responsibility for implementation of the respective compo-
nents. A condition of disbursement of the funds for cocoa and coffee develop-
ment would be that: (a) a technical assistance agreement, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank, had been signed between MIDA and BDA, and
(b) field implementation officers for the cocoa and coffee components had been
appointed by MIDA.
Banana and Oil Palm
4.05      COBAPA would assume full responsibility for the investment, manage-
ment, production, marketing, and provision of technical assistance and all
other services required for the implementation of the banana and oil palm
components. COBAPA responsibilities in the implementation of these components,
including COBAPA's utilization of the technical assistance funds and other
expenditures related to nurseries establishment and management, and the
acquisition of machinery and equipment required for development of oil palm
plantations, would be reflected in a technical assistance agreement to be
signed between BNP and COBAPA. Main conditions of this agreement, relating to
field implementation of the banana and oil palm components, would be reflected
in each of the farm investment plans. Six hundred of the 1,000 ha of the Baru
District to be developed with bananas under the project is held by two
asentamientos - Unidad Indigena and Grupo de Oriente. The balance of 400 ha
is held by the Chiriqui Banana Enterprise (EMBACHI), an autonomous private
institution made up of the asentamientos Victoria de la Revolucion and Unifi-
cacion del Baru. The asentamientos, through the farm investment plans, would
give COBAPA full rights to develop, manage and market the bananas produced on
the asentamientos lands until full development of the banana plantation. The
plans would also make provision for asentamientso to incorporate the additional
labor required for the plantation; these workers would be incorporated as
permanent members of the asentamientos. The appointment of field managers and
other key plantation personnel would be a joint responsibility of COBAPA and
the asentamientos. The banana production would be purchased by COBAPA at the
packing plant; price and conditions would be specified in the contract between
the asentamientos and COBAPA. From the profits generated by the plantation,
COBAPA would repay (a) to BNP the subloan utilized to develop the asentamientos



- 29 -
lands; and (b) to BDA the asentamientos debt in arrears, which it is estimated
will be about US$1.1 million (December 31, 1978). The full cost of operation
of the plantation, including the resources required for the repayment of the
above obligations, would be discounted by COBAPA from the value of production.
In addition, th- asentamientos would pay COBAPA a fee for each box of banana
of export quality produced by the plantation to cover overhead expenses; for
purposes of the financial analysis, it has been estimated at US$0.05 per box;
however, the final amount would be specified in the farm investment plan to be
signed by the asentamientos and COBAPA. The signing of the technical assis-
tance agreement between BNP and COBAPA acceptable to the Bank, including the
above terms and conditions, would be a condition of disbursement of the funds
required for banana and oil palm development.
4.06      The 3,000 ha of oil palm plantations would be developed on about
16 asentamientos in the project area. Some of these asentamientos would
operate under a system similar to that for banana development; the invest-
ments, and field management would be the responsibility of an oil palm
division created within COBAPA until full development of the oil palm
plantation. In addition, it is expected that some asentamientos would be
developed under an outgrower system, with COBAPA providing the planting
material and technical assistance for the implementation and operation of
the plantation, and supervising the investment financed by the outgrowers.
Both the asentamientos to be managed by COBAPA, and those to be developed
under the outgrower system, would enter into contractual arrangements with
COBAPA. The outgrowers' farm investment plans would commit the beneficiaries
to follow the technical advice of COBAPA in matters related to oil palm
establishment and management. In return, they would receive credit from BNP
under the terms and conditions speciEied in paragraph 4.14. By October 1979,
COBAPA would hire a manager for the oil palm division, one internationally
recruited expert in oil palm production, and two local technicians to act as
counterpart and field supervisors. Two other internationally recruited
experts (plant protection and soils and oil palm fertilization) would be hired
by June 30, 1981, on a part-time basis, to visit the plantation periodically
during the implementation period.  In addition to their technical responsi-
bilities, the internationally recruited experts would train their local
counterparts, laborers, nurseries workers and beneficiaries. A selective
training program for local technicians abroad would also be implemented.  It
would be a condition of disbursement of the funds for the oil palm plantation
that an oil palm division had been established within COBAPA, and that the
experts on oil palm production had been hired by COBAPA. The final feasibil-
ity study (dated January 30, 1979), including the technical design of the oil
palm component and a detailed description of the organization, management, and
timetable for the implementation of the component, was received by the Bank on
February 16, 1979.
4.07      COBAPA with MIDA's assistance, would provide technical and manage-
ment training to prepare the banana and oil palm beneficiaries for the manage-
ment of the plantations in the future. The improved financial situation of
the beneficiari-s would probably result in a request for full title to the
land, which, according to the Agrarian Reform Code of Panama would be granted
by MIDA.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that:  (a) the Government
would provide adequate land rights, satisfactory to the Bank, to beneficiaries



- 30 -
of the banana and oil palm development for a period of not less than 30 years
from the beginning of the execution of each farm investment plan; and
(b) COBAPA would provide technical and management training to the beneficiaries
of the banana and oil palm component.
4.08      The oil mill investment, which should be ready to start operations
by the end of 1984 (Year 4 of the project), would be implemented and managed
by the Government through COBAPA with equity participation of the private
sector, including asentamientos benefitting from the oil palm component. The
Government would be required to prepare, in coordination with BNP, a detailed
study with the final specifications of the oil palm processing facility. The
study would include detailed engineering designs and full particulars of the
legal and financial structure and management of the entity to be responsible
for the operation of the oil mill. Receipt of this study by the Bank would be
a condition of disbursement under the oil mill category. Financial arrangements
for establishing the mill, satisfactory to the Bank, would be made by the
Government to provide equity capital equivalent at least to 50% of the invest-
ment required by the oil mill; the balance would be financed from the proceeds
of the loan. Furthermore, the debt-equity ratio of the entity would not be
allowed to exceed 3:1 without prior Bank approval. Once the palm oil process-
ing entity had been established in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, no
changes in ownership structure would take place without the prior agreement
of the Bank. Assurances to the above were obtained during negotiations.
4.09      Approximately 95% of the cocoa and 5% of the potential coffee
sub-borrowers under the proposed project do not have clear title to the land.
MIDA's office of the National Directorate of the Agrarian Reform, responsible
for the surveys, analyses and issuance of titles in the cocoa project area,
has not been staffed adequately in the past, and therefore it cannot process
land titling requests. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the
Government that it would maintain during the implementation period of the
project an adequately staffed office of the National Directorate of Agrarian
Reform in Bocas del Toro, and, that MIDA would issue titles to beneficiaries
of cocoa and coffee development without clear titles, within one year of
subloan approval. Whenever necessary, the cost of land surveying and titling
of the areas to be developed with cocoa or coffee would be included in the
farm investment plans.
Technical Assistance and Training
4.10      Four internationally recruited experts would assist local technicians
with cocoa and coffee development activities during the four-year implementa-
tion period of the project. Short-term courses and seminars would be held for
the benefit of the extension agents and farmers. The consultants would also
assist MIDA's technicians in the establishment of research and demonstration
plots. In addition, the project includes short-term overseas on-the-job
training and study tours for about eight technicians working on the field
implementation of the cocoa and coffee components. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Cocoa and Coffee Programs of MIDA, jointly with
BDA and in consultation with IDIAP, would (a) prepare by October 31, 1979
(within three months of loan effectiveness) detailed terms of reference and
the schedule for hiring the above consultants for presentation to the Bank,
through BNP, and (b) the consultants would be appointed and the overseas



- 31 -
training programs would be initiated by December 31, 1979 (within five months
of loan effectiveness). Detailed termas of reference for consultants required
for the oil palm development have been included in the final feasibility
study of the component (Annex 4).
B. Lending Policies and Procedures
Cocoa and Coffee Development
4.11      Credit applicants would be assisted in the preparation of their
investment plans by field technicians of MIDA's Cocoa and Coffee Programs.
In line with Government policy toward small-scale farmers, technical assis-
tance would be provided free of charge: to the sub-borrowers. The evaluation
of creditworthiness and the financial analysis of the investments would be
carried out by BDA staff, which would also be responsible for subloan disburse-
ments and collections. BDA and MIDA have been operating for about three
years, on a limited scale, with cocoa and coffee development, and valuable
experience has been acquired. Given the lack of complexity of the lending
program, as only one crop would be financed in each of the project areas and
the area to be developed by any one sub-borrower is small, a very simple
procedure would be used for the preparation and technical and financial
evaluation of the investment plan. Disbursements would be made, based on the
progress of investments as reported by the field staff, directly to the sub-
borrower or to commercial concerns providing inputs to sub-borrowers. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that the above lending procedures
would be utilized and that the Bank would have an opportunity to review for
comment the procedure to be used for the analysis of investment plans.
4.12      The minimum area to be financed for cocoa and coffee development
would be 1 ha; the maximum area would be 5 ha for cocoa and 3 ha for coffee
development.  The maximum subloan value for cocoa development per sub-borrower
would be about US$9,000 and about US$10,000 for coffee development.  At the
Borrower's request, these amounts would be reviewed from time to time to
adjust for price increases during the implementation period of the project.
All subloans would be approved at the closest BDA local branch or regional
office.  Therefore, BDA's subloan approval ceilings would be increased in
order to approve all subloan requests locally. Assurances that these limits
would be applied and enforced were obtained during negotiations.
Banana and Oil Palm Development
4.13      Detailed investment budgets and implementation schedules would be
prepared by COBAPA and submitted to BNE"s Development Banking Section for
approval. The banana and oil palm development on the asentamientos land would
be financed by long term-loan from BNP, through COBAPA for banana development,
and, for oil palm to the organization representing these beneficiaries.
COBAPA would incorporate in each farm investment plan the applicable conditions
specified in paragraphs 4.05 and 4.06, including the system to be utilized in
recovering the investments financed uncLer the project and of any previous debt
of the asentamientos with BDA. AssurarLces that the above approval procedures
and contractual arrangements would be used were obtained during negotiations.



- 32 -
Interest Rate and Repayment Terms
4.14      Subloans would finance not more than 80% of the total value of the
investment plan; the balance, 20%, would be financed by sub-borrowers in the
form of family labor and/or cash. However, given the income situation of
the settlers to benefit from the banana and oil palm development (para. 2.14),
subloans to these beneficiaries would finance up to 100% of the total value
of the investment plan. The repayment terms would reflect the capacity of the
sub-borrowers to repay, as estimated in the cash flow projections of the
investment plans. Subloans for cocoa and coffee would be for a maximum period
of nine years, including a grace period of up to three years. Subloans for
banana development would be for a maximum period of seven years, including a
grace period of up to two years. Subloans for the oil palm plantations would
be for a maximum period of 13 years, including up to six years of grace. The
subloan for the oil palm processing plant would be for a maximum period of 14
years, including a grace period of up to 8 years. Interest on the outstanding
balances would be payable at a rate of not less than 12% per annum. The
proposed lending rate would be positive; the index of wholesale price increases
in Panama dropped from 14% in 1974/75 to 7.8% in 1975/76, and to 7.2% in
1976/77. Wholesale prices are projected to increase at 7.5% per annum in the
period 1977-79, and at 7.0% per annum thereafter. The above rate is consistent
with current interest rates for agricultural lending in Panama (para 1.18).
Interest would be payable annually except for the subloans for oil palm devel-
opment, in which interest amounts would be accumulated during the grace period
of the subloans. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the terms
and conditions specified in this paragraph would be carried out.
4.15      BNP would enter into a subsidiary agreement with BDA, incorporating
the terms and conditions of the lending operations specified in the preceding
paragraphs and would specifically (a) incorporate terms, conditions and
interest rates for rediscounts between BNP and BDA and for lending between BDA
and sub-borrowers; (b) cover the obligation of BNP to provide BDA, in addition
to Bank funds, with all the counterpart funds required for the lending program
of BDA; and (c) include the obligation of BDA to provide sub-borrowers with
complementary short-term credit required to carry out the investment plans
financed under the project. The above subsidiary agreement, satisfactory to
the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement for the cocoa and coffee
components. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the procedures,
terms and conditions of the subsidiary agreement would not be changed or
waived without prior Bank approval. However, the Government, the Bank and
BNP would from time to time, at the request of any one of them, review the
lending terms and conditions with a view to adjust them to the extent neces-
sary to: (a) ensure the continuance of incentives to BDA and COBAPA to lend
for the purposes of the project; and (b) ensure the compatibility of the
interest rates under the project with other interest rates in Panama for
lending for agricultural development, provided that the interest rates under
the project would remain positive in real terms.



- :33 -
C. Accounts and Auditing
4.16      BNP would continue to maintain separate project accounts, as estab-
lished for the ongoing Bank projects (Loans 901-PAN; 1397-PAN and 1398-PAN),
in accordance with sound accounting principles consistently applied. Simi-
larly, BNP, BDA and COBAPA would be required to maintain records and documen-
tation relating to all financial transactions under the project, and these
would be available for inspection by the Bank during the course of supervision
missions. The project accounts and related financial statements would be
audited annually in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. As required by current legis-
lation, the Decentralized Audit Division (DAD) of the Comptroller General
of the Republic is responsible for the external auditing of BNP and BDA.
During 1978, at Bank request, DAD modified its auditing procedures, improving
substantially the scope and quality of DAD audits for projects financed by the
Bank. The existing independent external auditors of COBAPA would be. proposed
by BNP for Bank approval.
4.17      The scope of the audit examination of the project accounts would be
determined, following consultations between the Bank, BNP, BDA, and COBAPA,
and incorporated in BDA's subsidiary loan agreement and in COBAPA's subloan
agreement. Audited comparative financial statements and notes prepared
from the project accounting records of each institution would include the
balance sheet, a statement of income and expenses, and a statement of the
source and application of funds, together with the opinion of the independent
auditor. Supplementary data on operations, financial position and scope
of work carried out by the auditors and such other additional information
as the Bank might from time to time request would also be provided. All
audit reports and statements would be submitted through BNP to the Bank not
later than four months after the end of each fiscal year.
4.18      BDA would also present for Bank consideration no later than July 31,
1980: (a) a report indicating the details of the reforms which are scheduled
to be introduced in the accounting system no later than December 31, 1979 and
additional information required to malce a detailed analysis of its portfolio
and financial results; and (b) a report indicating the results obtained by
implementing a plan to regularize its financial situation and loan portfolio.
The analysis and presentation of these reports would be based on the informa-
tion and presentation used for the audit report on BDA as of December 31, 1977.
Assurances on this point and those in the preceding two paragraphs were
obtained at negotiations.
D. Progress Reporting, Monitoring and Evaluation
4.19      BDA would be responsible for establishing and maintaining a system
for monitoring the progress of the cocoa and coffee components and collecting
and analyzing technical and financial data to evaluate the impact of the invest-
ments and technical assistance. It is envisaged that field staff of the Cocoa
and Coffee Programs, jointly with BDA's regional offices, would collect, on a



- 34 -
continuous basis, during the four-year implementation period of the project,
production, marketing and financial data including credit use and recovery and
extension performance of sub-borrowers. The information would be centralized,
assembled and analyzed by the Project Evaluation Department of BDA and then
transmitted to BNP. This institution would consolidate BDA's information and
that of COBAPA (para 4.20) and would be responsible for submitting to the Bank
the consolidated quarterly reports. In addition, two impact evaluation
surveys (partially financed with Bank funds, para 3.12) of the cocoa and
coffee components would be carried out, one in Year 3 and one in Year 4 of the
project. These surveys would provide an assessment of the overall social and
economic impact of the components with respect to project targets and to the
effectiveness of achieving the basic objectives of these components (Annex 2).
4.20      COBAPA would establish within its Accounting and Computing Department
an adequate monitoring and evaluation system for the banana and oil palm
components. Under this system, adequate records of on-farm investments,
purchases of inputs, sales, inputs and outputs, prices, and employment would
be kept to provide detailed information on operational, administrative and
management costs of the banana and oil palm plantations. It would also make
possible an assessment of progress of activities compared to planned schedules,
including the area in production, yield data, technology utilized and any
natural phenomenon or other external events which might affect yields or
progress of the plantations. These data would be available to COBAPA's
management on a timely basis, and quarterly reports would be submitted to BNP
for presentation to the Bank.
4.21      In addition, BNP would be responsible for preparing and presenting
to the Bank a draft completion report. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that: (a) the above monitoring and evaluation procedures
would carried out; (b) quarterly reports would be sent to the Bank within
two months of the end of each quarter; and (c) a draft project completion
report would be prepared by BNP no later than four months after the proposed
project investments have been completed.
V. ILLUSTRATIVE INVESTMENT MODELS; SPECIFICATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
A. Production Coefficients
5.01      The production coefficients used in the illustrative investment
models are summarized below. Yields of cocoa and coffee are based on those
obtained by comparable farms in the project areas; allowances have been made
for yield fluctuations over time. Banana yields are based on current produc-
tivity of COBAPA plantations. Production coefficients utilized in the oil
palm component are those included in the preliminary report of the feasibility
study (para 3.09), representing a weighted average of the expected yields in
the project area. Yield assumptions utilized in the analysis are as follows:

B. Illustrative Investment Models
Cocoa Development
5.02      The illustrative investment model for cocoa represents a small farm
located near the coast in the Bocas del Toro Province. Rainfall is about
3,000 to 3,500 mm distributed evenly throughout the year. New cocoa plant-
ings would be preceded in the first year by clearing forest trees and under-
brush (new plantations) and old cocoa trees and shade trees (renovation),
followed by planting temporary shade (plantain) and permanent shade (Inga sp.)
and constructing drainage channels. Only hand labor would be utilized in the
establishment and maintenance of the plantation. The cocoa plantations would
be established with high yielding hybrids and open-pollinated selections, with
a total plant population of about 1,300 trees per hectare. Attention would be
given to chemical weed control, in addition to which the canopy of trees would
be encouraged to close so that weeds would be shaded out. Appropriate fertili-
zation would be carried out, and disease and insect control measures would be
taken. At full development, the cocoa plantation would require, in addition
to family labor, 44 man-days of hired labor per ha/year. Yield of plantains
would start in Year I and continue until Year 4, when plantains would be
eliminated. Cocoa production would start at Year 3 and is expected to stabilize
at about 1,000 kg/ha of dry cocoa beans by the fifth year.



- 36 -
Coffee Development
5.03      The coffee renovation illustrative investment model is representative
of a farm located at an altitude of about 1,000 m, having about 3,000 mm of
rainfall, with a dry season of about 3-1/2 months per year. The farm has
1 ha of old coffee "Arabica" trees (variety "Typica") under excessive shade
and planted at a density of about 1,000 trees per ha. After clearing the
area of old coffee trees and shade trees, it would be planted with the "Red
Caturra" variety of coffee and with temporary and permanent shade trees. Some
5,000 trees/ha would be planted along the contours to diminish erosion problems
and to facilitate cultural practices and disease and insect control. All
the work would be done by manual labor. The average yield of coffee is
expected to increase gradually from 450 kg/ha (parchment coffee equivalent) in
the first year of production (Year 2) and stabilize at about 1,860 kg/ha in
Year 6. At full development, in addition to family labor, the coffee planta-
tion would require 140 man-days of hired labor per ha/year.
Banana Development
5.04      A 1,000-ha plantation would be developed by COBAPA over a two-year
period. The first 250 ha were expected to have been planted between May and
October 1978 and the balance of 750 ha from May to September 1979. Plant
population would be 1,500 plants/ha; planting material would be obtained from
COBAPA's existing plantation. Weed control and crowning would be carried out
every three months; fertilizing would be done twice per year; thinning (six
cycles per year) and deflowering would be performed at harvesting time.
Sigatoka (Cercospora musae) would be prevented or controlled with oil.
Insects would be controlled with lannate and diazinon, and nematicides would
be applied locally wherever pathogenic nematodes are detected. Two-week-old
bunches would be bagged in poly-bags. Harvest in the first 250 ha planted
would begin in June 1979, and the entire 1,000 ha would be in full production
by September-October 1980. The average yield of bananas at full development
is expected to be 41 m tons/ha (export quality), or a total production of
41,000 m tons/year. The plantation would provide permanent employment for
410 beneficiaries.
Oil Palm Development
5.05      Some 3,000-ha of oil palm plantations would be developed.  Imported
seeds would arrive in the country during the last quarter of 1979. After
germination, the seedlings would be planted in nurseries and, during the dry
season (January to March) irrigated manually or with COBAPA's existing sprinkler
irrigation equipment. Culling would be done at the end of the nursery stage
when the 12- to 13-month-old plants would be large enough to be planted in the
field.
5.06      Field planting of the first 400 ha would take place in 1981 (April
to August) and the remaining 2,600 ha would be planted during years 1982-84
(para 3.10). Land preparation would include drainage preparation, limited
bush cleaning, and weed control. Aligning and holing would be done during
the last four to five months before planting. About two months before field



- 37 -
planting, Pueraria japonica would be sown between the avenues. Some 143
plants, sited in a triangular pattern, would be planted per hectare. Standard
maintenance procedures would be followed for immature plants. A circle around
the plants about 1 foot in diameter (crown) should be kept clean by manual
weeding, performed every three months; fertilizers would be broadcast around
the crown. Pruning would be limited to the removal of dried leaves when fruit
setting starts. The first inflorescences would be removed when the trees are
three years old. Standard maintenance procedures of mature plants would be
followed during the economic life of the plantation (30 years). Yields would
start at Year 5 and are expected to stabilize at about 18 m tons of ffb per
ha by Year 8. At full development of the component (Year 13) total production
is estimated at about 11,900 m tons of palm oil and 800 m tons of kernel oil.
At this stage, the operation of the plantation and of the oil processing plant
would provide direct permanent employment for about 640 beneficiaries.
VI. PROJECT PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. ProdtLction
6.01      At full development, incremental production from the project would be
approximately as follows:
Incremental Production at Full Development
National
Production               As % of 1976        Year of Full
1976      Total   National Production   Development

b/   Plantains would be produced only during Years 1 to 5 of the project.
At full development and using the 1978 farmgate prices utilized in the finan-
cial analysis, the annual total value of the incremental output generated
by the project would be about US$23.0 million, excluding plantains, which
would be eliminated by Year 5.

B. Markets, Marketing and Prices
Bananas
5.02      COBAPA initiated direct banana exports to Yugoslavia in 1975 under
a one-year contract, renewed annually after price and volume negotiations.
Starting in May 1978, however, COBAPA's production has been exported
through the marketing agency of UPEB, COMUNBANA. The five-year renewable
marketing contract signed by COMUNBANA and COBAPA states that COMUNBANA will
buy all export quality bananas produced in COBAPA plantations for the duration
of the contract. Bananas from Panama as well as from other COMUNBANA's
member countries will be exported to Yugoslavia under a five-year renewable
contract. Prices under the COMUNBANA - Yugoslavia contract are based on the
current world market level to be reviewed annually to adjust for changes of
world market prices.
6.03      Banana exports from Panama in 1977 amounted to about 610,000 m tons,
9% of world exports. Over the five-year period 1972-76, the main markets for
Panama were the Federal Republic of Germany (26%), the United States (23%),
Italy (21%) and the Netherlands (16%). Within the remaining balance 14%, the
share of Yugoslavia, COMUNBANA's first export market, increased from less than
1% in 1972 to 5% in 1976. World imports and consumption of bananas are
expected to increase approximately in line with population growth, at about 2%
per annum. However, according to Bank projections, the share of centrally
planned economies in total imports of bananas is expected to increase from
about 3.5% in 1976 to 11% in 1990, and by about 11% per annum thereafter,
representing an increase of 690,000 m tons over the 1976 import volume.
6.04      By 1981, international banana prices in constant terms are expected
to decrease by about 10% from the 1977 level (US$214 per m ton), then increase
tiO the 1977 level by 1985, and remain stable until 1990. The prices obtained
by COBAPA in 1977 and early 1978 were US$262 per m ton CIF Yugoslavian port
(USS4.76 per box). Under the new contract with COMUNBANA, COBAPA will receive
US$2.80 FOB per box, equivalent to about US$2.60 per box ex-packing plant.
Independent producers who market their output through UB receive an average
price of US$1.45 per box.  This price is equivalent to an FOB price of US$2.60
per box, or US$0.20 less than the equivalent price obtained by COBAPA.
Palm and Kernel Oil
6.05      Incremental oil production of the proposed project would substitute
for an equivalent volume of imports. Total demand for vegetable oil and fats
in the country is estimated at 18,000 to 20,000 m tons per year. Under the
most conservative demand assumption (population increase of 3.1% per annum),
total demand would be about 25,000 m tons in 1985 and 30,000 m tons in 1990
(Annex 3, Table 16). At full development (1990), total production from the
proiect would be 12,700 m tons of unrefined oil per year (11,200 m tons of
refined oil), equivalent to about one-third the total estimated demand and
about equal to the incremental demand from year 1990 onwards (10,000 m tons
per annum).



- 39 -
6.06      There are two oil refineries in Panama City, which, in 1977,
processed 18,400 m tons of imported vegetable oil, equivalent to 70% of
their installed capacity (26,000 m tons per year); processing capacity is
projected to increase to about 33,000 m tons by 1985. Therefore, refining
facilities are adequate to process project production at full development.
6.07      The ex-plant price of unrefined palm oil was estimated at US$535
per m ton and kernel oil at US$305 per in ton, equivalent to the current CIF
price and equal to the farmgate price obtained by the Cooperativa
Agroindustrial de Icacal. InternationaL oil palm prices are projected
by the Bank to remain in constant terms at or above their early 1978 level
until 1982 and subsequently to decrease and become stable by 1990 at about
85% of their present level. Prices of palm kernel oil are projected to
increase until 1982, decrease later on, and to stabilize at about 104% of the
present level by 1990.
Coffee
6.08      Panama has traditionally given priority to satisfying its internal
demand rather than exporting coffee. Internal consumption quotas are deter-
mined every year and exporters are required to sell a specified quantity of
export quality coffee on the internal market for each m ton exported. Panama
has not been able to meet its share of lhe indicative export entitlement
allocated by the International Coffee Agreement. Actual exports have averaged
1,360 m tons since 1970 with no clear trend to either increase or decrease.
Current annual domestic consumption (3,400 m tons) is projected to reach 4,500
to 5,000 m tons by 1986. National production has shown no clear trend to
either increase or decrease since 1970; therefore, it is expected that, without
the project, it would remain at its present level. Including the incremental
production generated by the project, total coffee production of Panama would
be about 6,800 m tons in 1986. Therefore, export availability could amount to
1,800 to 2,300 m tons per year (Annex 3., Table lo), almost twice the present
level of exports, but would still be within Panama's indicative market
allocation (3,420 m tons by 1981/82).
6.09      The present price received by producers is the average of the export
market price and a relatively low domestic price. Retail prices on the
domestic market have been controlled at US$0.90 per lb since 1974, compared
with the international price of US$2.06 per lb FOB Panama in 1977. The
average producers' price for export quality coffee (parchment) in 1977 was
US$0.90 to US$1.00 per lb of parchment coffee, equivalent to about 50% of the
FOB price obtained by Panama exports, as compared with an average ratio of 75%
for the 1970-75 period. The implicit price subsidy to the domestic market of
the current system is a recent event in Panama (1976 to date) and due exclu-
sively to the unusually high world market prices. However, the projected
decline of the world market prices would soon offset this subsidy.
6.10      The system utilized by Panama operates satisfactorily, given the
relatively high current world market prices, but it would run into difficulties
if the Bank's five-year projections materialize. According to these projec-
tions, coffee prices will decrease by more than half between 1977 and 1980 and



- 40 -
then remain at levels more in line with their historical price. Based on the
financial results of the illustrative investment model for coffee, it has been
estimated that producer prices, for export quality coffee, should not be lower
than US$0.65 per lb parchment coffee in constant 1978 currency. This price
level is compatible with projected world prices.
Cocoa
6.11      From 1974 to 1976, Panama exported an average of 600 m tons of dry
cocoa beans per year, mostly to the United States. Almost all the exported
production is handled by two buyers: the Cooperativa de Cacao Bocatorena,
which exports 60% of total production of the project area through IMA, and a
private buyer for the remaining 40%. It is expected that most of the incre-
mental production would be marketed through the cooperative (para 2.18), which
offers to its members substantially higher prices than the private buyer.
6.12      The project is expected to increase by about four times Panama's
cocoa exports by 1986, still representing a negligible share of the projected
world exports (below 0.2%). According to Bank projections, the international
price of cocoa will decrease to about half of 1977 prices and stabilize at
US$0.51 per lb by 1990. Cocoa prices are known to fluctuate sharply and
current Panama cocoa production is too small to support a local industry.
However, total production at full development would support a small factory
which would have a stabilizing effect on prices received by producers and
increase the value added of cocoa exports. Panama imports a wide range of
cocoa products, equivalent to about 2,900 m tons of cocoa beans annually,
which cannot be readily substituted by local production.
Plantains
6.13      Plantains are grown mainly by subsistence farmers in the provinces
of Darien (74%), Chiriqui (4%) and Bocas del Toro (3%). The lack of adequate
transportation infrastructure in and out of producing areas and of price incen-
tives have not encouraged production, which has remained at about 100,000 m
tons per year since 1970. Since 1975, domestic prices have been more than
doubled by the Government to give more incentives to producers, and IMA is
currently buying all the plantain offered at its trading posts in Darien and
Bocas del Toro at a minimum price of US$35 per m ton (US$0.50 per bunch).
6.14      Demand for plantain is substantial and production is limited more
by the accessibility of producing areas than by lack of potential markets.
Demand is projected at 135,000 to 143,000 m tons by 1985, or 35,000 to 43,000 m
tons above 1976 production. In addition, substantial export markets exist in
the rest of Central America; in 1975, Nicaragua alone imported close to 12,000
m tons. Assuming that all planted or renovated cocoa areas use plantains as
shade trees, maximum incremental production of the project during the first
five years would be 35,000 m ton per year, therefore, no marketing problem
is anticipated.

C. Benefits and Financial Rates of Return
6.15      Using the financial assumptions regarding investments, operating
costs and income, the illustrative investment models were analyzed to assess
benefits and rates of return. The principal results are summarized below:

6.16      The financial rates of return indicate that it would be financially
rewarding to undertake the investment envisaged in the illustrative models.
At full development, the income of beneficiaries of cocoa and coffee develop-
ment would increase substantially over their current levels, but per capita
incomes would be quite modest and close to one-third of the national per
capita average, which was US$1,220 in 1977. During the implementation and



- 42 -
repayment period of the subloan for banana and oil palm development, minimum
labor income of settlers would be about $980 per year. Substantial surplus
would be generated by the banana and oil palm plantation after debt repayment.
Income of the banana plantation beneficiaries (410) would increase to about
US$3,900 per year and that of the oil palm beneficiaries (640) to about
US$3,700 per year. Given the poor financial results of the operation of the
asentamientos which would benefit from banana development (para 2.14) and on
the assumption that the same situation exists on the asentamientos which would
benefit from oil palm, all financial benefits from banana and oil palm develop-
ment were assumed to be incremental. Prices utilized in the financial analysis
are given in Annex 3, Table 17. The financial rate of return for the oil palm
plantations has been estimated assuming a producer's price of US$75/m ton of
ffb. Under this assumption, the financial rate of return for the oil mill
would be 16% and the return on equity of 13% p.a. In order to ensure that
the financial rate of return could be achieved, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that: (a) the Government would maintain measures and policies
necessary to enable producers of the crops financed under the project to obtain
a reasonable return on their investment plans; and (b) any new policies or
measures, which may affect adversely the development of the crops financed
under the project, would be presented to the Bank for comments before the
application of such policies.
D.  Financial Projections for Project Entities
Gash Flow of Participating Institutitions
6.17      Given the current average cost of funds for BNP of 8.5% p.a. and the
Bank loan at 7.0% p.a. 1/, the blended average cost of funds under the project
would be about 7.7% p.a. BNP would lend directly to COBAPA for banana and oil
palm development and rediscount at 7.7% the total amount previously disbursed
by BDA for cocoa and coffee development. Minimum lending interest rate to
sub-borrowers would be 12% p.a. (para 4.14), leaving a gross margin on the
on-farm lending of BNP and BDA of 4.3% p.a. Since technical assistance to
cocoa and coffee beneficiaries would be provided by MIDA (para 4.03) and no
technical assistance from BNP would be required by the banana and oil palm
component, it is considered that the 4.3% gross margin would adequately cover
lending risks and overhead costs of the lending program. The cash flow
projections indicate that the 4.3% gross margin to BDA would amount to a
total cumulative surplus of US$1.5 million by Year 11 of the project (Annex 3,
Table 18). BNP's cash flow would generate a cumulative surplus of US$19.3
million; making allowances for the repayment of BNP's contribution of about
US$12.7 million to the project, the net surplus would amount to about
US$6.6 million by Year 17 of the project (Annex 3, Table 19).
6.18      The cash inflow of BDA would be derived from funds rediscounted from
BNP (100% of the lending for cocoa and coffee development) and repayments of
principal and interest by sub-borrowers. The cash outflow would consist of
1/   Rate in effect January-March 1979.



1- 4+ -- 
subloans to project beneficiaries and of repayment of principal and interest
to BNP. The cash inflow of BNP would be made up of its own resources, with-
drawals from the Bank loans and interest and principal repayments from BDA
and COBAPA. Withdrawals from the Bank loan would be made over six years;
withdrawals in the last semester of Year 6 represent a four-month time lag
between rediscounts to BDA and/or lending for banana and oil palm development.
In addition to the project funds, BNP would finance during the first eight
years of the project: (a) US$1.1 million for investments in oil palm to take
place during Years 7 and 8 of the project; (b) US$0.7 million corresponding to
investment of subloans committed for cocoa and coffee development during Year
3 of the project; and (c) a US$1.3 million medium-term loan to finance incre-
mental working capital required in Year I for the banana development. The
total additional requirements, not included in the project costs would be
US$3.1 million. Of this total, US$1.8 million, related to Year 5 investments
in cocoa and coffee, and to Years 7 and 8 investments for oil palm, would be
financed by BNP from the cumulative surplus of the cash flow of the project.
However, the balance, US$1.3 million, incremental working capital for the
banana component, would be financed with resources other than those of the
project.
Fiscal Impact
6.19      Government's financial commitments to the project would amount to
about US$3.5 million (or 5.3 million, with contingencies included) during
the implementation period of the project (para 3.14). This total includes
US$3.3 million of equity capital in the oil palm processing plant, which would
be financed by the government and/or the private sector (para 4.08). The
balance, US$600,000, represents the incremental local operating costs
associated with the technical assistance services to be provided by MIDA to
cocoa and coffee sub-borrowers, and monitoring and evaluation of these com-
ponents. In addition, the Government would repay to BNP about US$1.6 million
(including interest payments of 7.0% p.a.) for Bank resources, US$1.3 million,
to be utilized for the purchase of vehicles and equipment, internationally
recruited consultants and training abroad of local technicians. The Govern-
ment participation would be offset by the incremental Government revenues
from sales and export taxes, which are estimated to be about US$1.3 million
per annum from Year 5 and US$2.1 million from Year 11 onwards.
Project Cost Recovery
6.20      BNP and BDA lending under thei project, amounting to 80% of total
investment, and the additional lending required for investments in Years 5
and 6 and any short-term credit required by sub-borrowers is expected to be
fully recovered. In line with Government policy to the small-scale farming
sector, technical assistance to beneficiaries of cocoa, coffee and oil palm
plantations development would be providled by MIDA and COBAPA free of charge.
Technical assistance costs for the oil mill development are included in the
investment; therefore, they would be r,ecovered with other investment
expenditures through the repayment of the subloan.

VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Economic Benefits
7.01      The main benefits of the proposed project in cocoa and coffee develop-
ment would be to increase productive efficiency, employment and income of small-
scale farmers from currently unsatisfactory levels, which, given their farm
size and environmental constraints and current status of technology, have no
other viable development alternative. The main benefits from banana and oil
palm development would be to increase substantially the productivity of land
and labor and incomes of agrarian reform beneficiaries and landless laborers,
utilizing one of Panama's most important resources - land - to its best alter-
native use. At country level, the proposed project would help the agricultural
sector to continue to play a leading role as one of the main providers of
foreign exchange savings through increases of export earnings (cocoa, coffee
and bananas) and reducing import requirements (oil palm). At full development,
the total value of incremental production generated by the project would be
about US$23.0 million, including US$6.0 million from cocoa, US$4.0 million
from coffee, US$6.0 million from bananas and US$7.0 million from oil palm
(para 6.01), representing from Year 11 onward a net economic benefit to the
country of about US$9.0 million per annum.
7.02      The direct beneficiaries of the project would be about 2,000 small-
scale farmers (cocoa and coffee), with an average farm size to be developed
under the project of less than 5 ha. An additional 1,050 agrarian reform
beneficiaries and landless laborers would benefit from the banana and oil palm
development. All 3,050 direct project beneficiaries, representing a total of
about 15,300 persons, would fall within the Bank's relative poverty target
group for Panama with an average per capita income of less than one-third the
national average. The project contribution to employment would come mainly
from regular job opportunities generated at the farm level. At full develop-
ment, the project would require annually an additional 720,000 man-days of
permanent and part-time labor, equivalent to 2,700 full-time jobs. About 25%
of this total (670 man-years) would be provided by family labor of the cocoa
and coffee farms, thus reducing substantially the underemployment of benefi-
ciaries.
7.03      The proposed project has a large number of non-quantifiable benefits.
In particular, it would further the development of COBAPA so that it would
become a self-sustaining enterprise, with very important implications for
national development strategies and policy decisions for the banana sub-sector.
The project would develop and sustain an industry in asentamientos which would
require an increase in the number of agrarian reform beneficiaries; asentamien-
tos would be strengthened and, through their participation in the project,
become financially viable organizations. The project would require the accelera-
tion of land titling for both the small-scale farmers and asentamientos partici-
pating in the project. BDA and MIDA capabilities for delivering credit and
technical assistance to small farmers would be strengthened, while the ongoing



- 45 --
cocoa and coffee development programs of the Government would greatly benefit
from the foreign technical assistance and the training components included in
the project. Finally, given the price projections for coffee and cocoa and
the almost certain possibility of the coffee leaf rust reaching Panama in the
near future, it is imperative to increase productivity of these two commodi-
ties as soon as possible. Were the project not to take place, cocoa and
coffee production would at best stagnate and, most likely, would decrease
substantially through the abandonment of low yielding plantations. This,
although not important for the economy as a whole, would have a very serious
impact on small-scale farmers in the cocoa and coffee areas of the country.
B. Economic Rate of Return
7.04      The rate of return to the economy has been calculated for each compo-
nent and for the project as a whole on the basis of the illustrative investment
models for each of the project components, including the cost of technical
support, monitoring and evaluation. Key assumptions and adjustments were as
follows:
(a)  All investments and operating costs utilized in the economic
evaluation were calculated at February/March 1978 farmgate prices.
No allowances were made for changes in real costs.
(b) The project incremental output has been valued, utilizing the
world market price adjusted to farmgate or ex-plant equivalent.
In estimating the future price trend, an index based on the
Bank's projections was utilized. All prices have been
expressed in constant 1978 US dollars (Annex 3, Table 17).
(c) Transfer payments have been excluded from costs and benefits.
Main transfer payments affecting the project are given below:
(i) export tax on bananas, US$0.40 per box; and
(ii) sales taxes on local purchases of inputs, machinery and
equipment, 5%.
(d) As in the case of the financial analysis, social benefits payments
to unskilled labor were included in the economic analysis with
the following adjustments:
(i)  bananas and oil palm development, 12% of the base
wage rate; and
(ii) cocoa and coffee development, 6% of the base wage
rate, assuming that only half of the incremental labor
requirements are permanently employed. According to



- 46 -
current labor regulations, social charges payments are
not mandatory for temporary labor, i.e., working less
than 11 consecutive days per month.
(e) Due to the absence of adequate information, shadow wages for
unskilled labor have been estimated using as proxy the estimated
availability and seasonal variations in labor utilization in the
project areas (paras 2.13 and 2.15). Adjustments have been made
to take into account the seasonal patterns of the project
activities; unskilled labor has been shadow-priced as follows:
(i)  banana and oil palm development, 80% of the nominal
wage rate;
(ii)  cocoa development, 90% of the nominal wage rate; and
(iii)  coffee development; 80% of non-harvest labor and 100% of
harvest labor (no shadow price) of the nominal wage rate.
(f) A Standard Conversion Factor for non-tradable goods and services
was calculated based on the average value of taxes and duties
collected on imports and exports during the 1972-76 period.
The Standard Conversion Factors thus obtained is equal to 0.94,
representing a shadow exchange rate about 6% higher than the
nominal exchange rate.
7.05      Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return of the project
over 30 years is estimated at about 30%. The economic rate of return calcula-
tions for each component and for the project as a whole are given on page 47.
The result of the economic analysis of the project components, based on three
sets of assumptions, and the sensitivity analysis are summarized as follows:

C. Project Risks
7.06      Farmers' acceptance of changes in cocoa and coffee varieties and
willingness to adopt improved technology has been satisfactorily tested
through an ongoing program and there is strong demand for long-term funds for
both cocoa and coffee renovation. Assurances would be sought during negotia-
tions to ensure that adequate technical assistance is provided to sub-borrowers
(paras 4.03, 4.04 and 4.07). Similarly, adequate technical assistance and
management would be provided for banana and oil palm development, and no major
risks with either production or marketing of output are envisaged. However,
oil palm is a new crop in the project area and therefore asentamientos may not
change readily into oil palm production. Nevertheless, the risk is reasonable
and it has been taken into account through a slow build-up of the projected
plantation. In addition, the Government has informed the Bank that an initial
area of 2,000 ha, minimum area required to support economic operation of the
oil mill, was available for oil palm development in the project area.
D. Environmental Impact
7.07      No long-term adverse environmental effects are expected as a conse-
quence of the execution of the project. Fertilizers and chemicals to be
utilized under the project are expected to have little effect on the local
ecology, assuming that normal precautions are taken in their application and
considering the relatively small area which would be covered by each farmer
participating in cocoa and coffee development and the experience of handling
chemicals in the banana subsector. Technical specifications and procedures
to be utilized and the use of chemical controls of the oil palm plantation as
well as oil mill effluent treatment and disposal would be detailed in the
ongoing feasibility study and incorporated in the project at a later stage.
VIII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      Assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations
that:
(a) the project would be financed as specified in paragraphs 3.14
and 3.15;

in cocoa and 20 technicians in coffee as well as the vehicle and
equipment required to provide technical assistance in the project
areas; technical assistance costs would be financed by MIDA (paras
4.03 and 4.04);



- 49 -

Agrarian Reform would be maintained in Bocas del Toro during the
implementation period of the project; titles to the land of cocoa
and coffee sub-borrowers would be issued by MIDA within one year
of subloan approval (para 4.09);
(h) MIDA and BDA would prepare by October 31, 1979 terms of reference
for consultants and a schedale for their hiring for presentation
to the Bank, and that the consultants would be appointed and the
overseas training program would be implemented by December 31, 1979
(para 4.10);
(i) lending procedures as outlined in paragraph 4.11 would be used
and the Bank would have an opportunity to review for comment the
procedure to be used for the analysis of investment plans;
(j) lending limits as specified in paragraph 4.12 would be applied
and enforced;
(k) approval procedures and contractual arrangements would be as
specified in paragraph 4.13;
(1) lending terms and conditions specified in paragraph 4.14 would
be implemented by BNP and B])A;
(m)  the subsidiary agreement to be entered into between BNP and BDA
would not be changed or waived without prior Bank approval, however,
a provision would be made for periodic consultations between the
Government, BNP and the Banlc on lending terms and conditions (para
4.15);
(n) accounting and auditing procedures specified in paragraphs
4.16 and 4.17 would be carried out; detailed reports of the
reforms introduced in the accounting system and financial
performance would be present:ed by BDA, for Bank consideration,
no later than July 31, 1980 (para 4.18);
(o)  a project monitoring and evaluation system would be implemented;
quarterly progress reports would be submitted to the Bank within two
months of the end of each quarter; and a draft completion report
would be prepared by BNP wit:hin four months of project completion
(paras 4.19 through 4.21); and



- 50 -
(p) the Government would maintain measures and policies necessary
to enable producers of the crops financed under the project
to obtain a reasonable return on their investment plans;
any new policies or measures, which may affect adversely the
development of the crops financed under the project, would be
presented to the Bank for comments, before the application of
such policies (para 6.16).
8.02      It would be a condition of disbursement of the respective components
that:
(a) an agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, for repayment of the
funds for technical assistance to be utilized in cocoa and coffee
development had been entered into by MIDA and BNP (para 4.01).
(b) a technical assistance agreement, on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank, for the implementation of the cocoa and coffee
components had been signed between BDA and MIDA and field implementa-
tion officers had been appointed by MIDA (para 4.04);
(c) a technical assistance agreement between BNP and COBAPA had been
signed (para 4.05);
(d) a division to implement the oil palm component had been created
within COBAPA, and that the experts on oil palm production had been
hired by COBAPA (para 4.06);
(e) the Bank had received a satisfactory study with the final specifica-
tions of the palm oil processing facility, including detailed
engineering and full particulars of the legal and financial structure
and management of the entity to be responsible for the operation of
the oil mill (para 4.08); and
(f) a subsidiary agreement had been signed between BNP and BDA for the
implementation of the cocoa and coffee components (para 4.15).
8.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would constitute a
suitable basis for a Bank loan to the National Bank of Panama for the equiv-
alent of US$19 million. The loan would have a term of 15 years, including
four years of grace, with interest at the rate prevailing at the time of the
loan approval.

ANNEX I
PANAMA
TROPICAL TREE CROP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Oil Palm Component
Terms of Reference for Production and Palm Oil Extraction Study
1.        In reference to the Agricultural Credit Project proposed by the
Government of Panama, technical assistance for carryig out a feasibility
study for oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) production and palm oil extraction
would be required. The study would cover a 3,000-ha area in the District
of Baru, Province of Chiriqui, Republic of Panama. The oil palm would be
developed under a plantation type of agriculture benefitting a group of
farmers currently organized in asentamientos. The design of the organization
structure should take into account the fact that the plantation, processing
and marketing of palm oil would be managed, for about the duration of the
repayment period of the subloan, by an autonomous Government agency.
2.        The study would be performed by a qualified consulting firm.  The
participating consultants should be senior technicians with no less than
10 years of experience in all matters related to oil palm production and
palm oil extraction, organization and management of oil palm plantations
and palm oil extracting plants, and training of technicians. The consultants
should read and write Spanish and English.
3.        The                   would be responsible for calling bids for
consultants interested in performing the feasibility study for oil palm and
palm oil production. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development
would provide local personnel to work with the consultants and administrative
facilities such as office space, secretarial services, domestic transportation,
and would serve as liaison with other Government agencies.
4.        The consultants should prepare a detailed report with recom-
mendations covering all the aspects of the project for submission to the
Government. The report should include a map of the area to be planted,
showing location of the oil extracting factory, water source, roads, and
drainage canals.
5.        It is estimated that the study would require a total of six man-
months, including the report writing period. The report should be completed
and received by the Government on or about September 1, 1978. The cost of
the study would be borne by the Government of Panama.
6.        A tentative outline of the table of contents of the feasibility
study is attached. The study should provide:



- 52 -
ANNEX 1
(a) a description of the project area, including communication
facilities, availability of labor and other inputs, and an
opinion of the general attractiveness of the project to
potential participating beneficiaries, bringing out the
relative advantages and disadvantages of the site;
(b) a description of the soil and climatic conditions of the
site. The description of the soil should include details
of classification, structure, texture, topography, pH,
fertility, profile, deficiencies, degree of erosion,
drainage, and depth of water table. Description of the
climate of the site should cover the average conditions
of the weather over a period of not less than 15 years
as exhibited by the absolute extremes, means, and
frequencies of given departures from the means of temperature,
wind velocity, precipitation, effective hours of sunlight, and
the history of floods, droughts or other natural phenomena
that could seriously affect oil palm production. The compre-
hensive soil and weather inventory should provide the basis
for the consultants' opinion as to whether conditions in the
project area are favorable for the production of oil palm.
The consultants would prepare guidelines and recommendations
on technical specifications of the plantation. The compre-
hensive soil and weather inventory should provide the basis
for the consultants' opinion as to whether conditions in the
project area are favorable for the production of oil palm.
The consultants would prepare guidelines and recommendations
on technical specifications of the plantation. These guide-
lines should cover at least the period between ordering the
seed and full development of the plantation, including
recommendations on varieties, planting system, cultural
practices and soil management;
(c) an identification of the specific area to be developed with
oil palm, indicating current land tenure arrangement and
ownership, number of families, procedure to be utilized in
incorporating the additional workers required by the
plantation, distribution of benefits among workers, and
organization structure of beneficiaries;
(d) an assessment of the financial and economic viability of
producing oil palm and extracting palm oil as one enterprise
and they should identify the areas in which special attention
would be required to ensure the commercial viability of the
project throughout its economic life. Consultants should also
prepare detailed estimates of investments and costs of
establishment and operation of the 3,000-ha oil palm plantation
and make conservative projections of yields and production of
palm oil and kernels. In relation, thereto, they should
determine the ex-factory (palm oil extracting factory) prices
of project products;

ANNEX I
(e) recommendations and preparation of specifications for
the most efficient and economic type of palm oil extraction
facilities (factory) to be installed for the project, taking
into account the designated capacity of the project; also,
consultants should establish and prepare specifications for
the auxiliary facilities such as water and power generation
needed to support the operation of the oil extraction factory.
Additionally, they should determine the optimum capacity of
the factory under the proposed project, approximate costs of
imported and locally manufactured equipment and buildings
which would house the equipment and the costs for assembling
the equipment. The study should include specifications of
the method and cost of effluent treatment and disposal to be
utilized by the project and an evaluation of the environmental
impact of the oil mill. The consultants should also determine
and recommend the optimum system and capacity of bulk storage
facilities for palm oil to be obtained under the project, the
frequency of production and the capacity of bulk carriers to
Panama City, and the laboraltory testing facilities which would
be required for the project:;
(f) recommendation of a management organizational structure for
carrying out the project economically and efficiently and
assessment of the staffing and the training requirements for
field production of oil palm and oil extraction, including
labor needed for operating t:he oil extracting factory and the
designs and location of buildings to house the oil extracting
equipment, roads, and drainage. The consultants should assess
requirements and prepare terms of reference for the experts
needed to assist in the establishment and development of the
plantation and of the oil mill, and a schedule for training
local technicians;
(g)  project income statements, projected profit/loss statements,
projected cash flow statemerLts, projected balance sheets
for the proposed project for at least the duration of the
repayment period of the investment; the consultants should
also assess the cost of staffing and training and incorporate
this cost in the projected cash flow statement; and
(h) a realistic and detailed implementation schedule for the
project to ensure the coordination of the various activities
and completion of the project in the shortest possible time.
Finally, the consultants should point out any constraints
affecting the marketing of palm oil in Panama.

ANNEX 2
On-farm Investments
4.        Quarterly (from farm investment 1/ plans in MIDA and BDA records).
Information should be collected from investment plans in MIDA and BDA records
and sent to the Bank quarterly:
(a)  Distribution of areas financed by number of subloans, by farm
size and by area financed under the project;
(b)  Distribution of total value of investment plans approved by
type of expenditures (total number of units financed and
number of hectares to which they apply should also be specified):
(i)  labor (hired, family);
(ii)  seeds/plantings - cocoa, coffee, shade trees;
(iii)  inputs by type;
(iv)  equipment and tools by type;
(v)  other; and
(c) Renovated plantations: area and production without project.
Prices
5.        Information should be collected from farm investment plan records
and from regular spot checks by MIDA or BDA officers in each area of the
project. Average prices should be reported for the previous project years
and at quarterly intervals for the current year as follows:
(a) Prices paid by producers inI the project areas for seeds and
plantings (by type) and inputs, including the cost of labor.
Information for inputs would be as follows:
(i) average prices paid by sub-borrowers;
(ii)  average price from commercial channels;
(iii)  average price from the cooperative (cocoa);
(iv)  average price from othLer sources (MIDA, IMA, etc.);
(b) Prices paid to producers in the project areas by geographical
area:
(i) by the cooperative (cocoa);
(ii) by commercial channels;
(iii) by IMA (plantain);
(iv) by others (cooperatives, associations, etc.);
(c)  FOB prices for exports of cocoa and coffee (from IMA); and
(d) Coffee: average retail prices in the country (from the Oficina
Nacinal de Regulacion de Precios).
1/   Formularies utilized in the preparation of farm investment plans would
be submitted for Bank approval.

project funds), number, value, distributions; and
(d) training received by staff: number of courses, seminars,
study tours and the like and description of general contents;
From agents' visit reports: 1/
(a) number of farm visits: total, and total per agent for the
previous year, and during the reporting period;
(b) number of visits per farm per year (past) and during the
reporting period;
(c) main technical recommendations during past reporting period,
reported percent of compliance; and
(d) reported incidence of diseases and other general problems
affecting progress of investments (number of cases, type of
problems, areas).
B. Impact Evaluation
8.        Two surveys would be carried out, one in Year 3 and one in Year 4,
at the time of harvest. Each would involve crop-cutting in sample areas,
plus interviews with the owners. The questionnaire would include requests
for the following information:
I/   Formularies utilized in supervision and technical assistance visits
would be submitted for Bank approval.



ANNEX 2
Farm area:
Total area;
Area in cocoa and coffee: total financed; and
Area in other activities.
Labor:
Permanent family labor on the farm (quantity and wages,
if any);
Hired labor for cocoa and coffee cultivation and
harvesting: (quantity and wages);
Permanent; and
Occasional.
Production and yields:
Number of trees per ha;
From sample (crop-cutting); and
Reported quantities and prices - buyers.
Use of inputs:
Reported quantities by type - source of supply.
Technical assistance:

ANNEX 2
C. Cost of Surveys
9.        The costs of the surveys in the impact evaluation of the cocoa and
coffee components have been calculated on the following basis:
Sample size: 10% of sub-borrowers, or a total of 200 farmers, would be
surveyed in Years 3 and 4. This small sample size is justified by homogeneity
of the groups in each of the two activities.
Field surveys: would require five man-months of field investigators, assuming:
(a) two to three farmers per day per field investigator; and
(b) 20 working days per month.
Data collection could be done in a month at harvest time (crop cutting) by
five trained investigators and a supervisor. Investigators would receive
prior training of about four days.
Transportation of the investigators: would be provided by project management
at cost (fuel), or reimbursed to them or to their institution for costs
incurred.
Processing of the data: would be done mostly by hand. Preliminary data clean-
ing and tabulation would be done with ordinary hand calculators and subsequent
processing with a desk programmable calculator. Manual processing is justi-
fied by the small sample size and the relative simplicity of tabulations (for
each of the two activities, there is only one output and a few inputs).
Technical assistance: project management would need assistance from one or
two consultants in:
(a) design of the questionnaires;
(b) sampling procedures and selection of farmers to be surveyed;
(c) training of the enumerators; and
(d) supervision of processing.
A total of four man-months (over two years) has been budgeted (Annex 3,
Table 10).
