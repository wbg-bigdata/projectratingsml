PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
SOMALIA
CENTRAL RANGELANDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT -
PHASE II - (CRRDP II)
(Cr. 1957-SO)
PREFACE
1.    This is the PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE (PCN) for the Central Rangelands Research
and Development Project - Phase II (CRRDP II) in Somalia, for which Credit 1957-SO in the
amount of SDR14.7 million (US$19.0 million equivalent) was approved on October 18, 1988,
and made effective on September 11, 1989.
2.    The project was never formally closed. Because of the civil war in Somalia, which caused
the termination of project activities in January 1991, disbursements of all IDA credits in Somalia,
including this project, were suspended as of March 15, 1991, and the undisbursed balances of the
credits were cancelled as of June 23. 1995. Under this project, SDR1.52 million, equivalent to
US$1.99 million, was disbursed, and the last disbursements took place on December 27, 1990.
Co-financing was provided from ADF and the total disbursements as of October 31, 1990,
amounted to US$0.42 million, or 15% of the total loan of US$11.0 million.
3.    The PCN was prepared by the staff of the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program (CP)"
on behalf of the Agriculture and Environment Operations Division (AF2AE), Eastern Africa
Region and reviewed by Mr. G. Luhman, Acting Division Chief, AF2AE and Mr. S. Agarwal,
Project Advisor, AF2. In view of the absence of government authority in Somalia, comments on
the PCN could not be sought from the Borrower. Comments from ADF have not been received.
4.    As it was not possible to visit the country, preparation of this PCN was carried out as a
desk review in Washington on the basis of the materials in the project files and discussions with
Bank staff who were involved with the project.

PROJECT COMPLETION NOTE
SOMALIA
CENTRAL RANGELANDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT -
PHASE II - (CRRDP II)
(Cr. 1957-SO)
INTRODUCTION
1.    CRRDP II was a follow-up project to CRRDP I (Cr. 906-SO), which was completed in
December 1987, and its activities were maintained through PPF funding (US$1.3 milliorn) until
CRRDP II became effective on September 11, 1989. The main objectives of CRRDP II were to:
(i) maintain and improve the long term productivity of the Central Rangelands; and (ii) raise the
living standards of pastoralists. This was to be pursued by minimizing degradation of vegetation,
improving understanding of rangelands production systems, and improving the efficiency of
livestock production.
2.    The project components included: Systems Investigation and Monitoring to study
production systems, formulate range management plans and monitor agroecological indicators;
Extension to disseminate improved technology and organize RLA to manage project
infrastructure; Agropastoral Adaptive Trials and Forestry to test improved agropastoral
practices, produce improved seeds, and expand forestry activities in the region; Animal ilealth
and Livestock Production to expand the NAHA program of village level livestock examination
and treatment; Water and Infrastructure Development to construct and provide initial
maintenance for boreholes, dugouts and wells, and to improve roads and air strips; Conservation
to protect key flora and fauna in the project area and the northern rangelands; Training to
provide continued support to the university and short-term and medium-term training
opportunities; and Project management of the NRA activities in the region.
3.    Total project cost was estimated at US$33.3 million. The IDA Credit of SDR14.7 minion
(US$19.0 million equivalent) and ADF Loan of US$1 1.0 million were to finance 57% and 33%
of total project cost respectively. The remaining US$3.3 million (10%) was to be contributed bx
GOS.
4.    Effectiveness was delayed, project activities were hampered by growing civil strife, anu
the project was terminated by the outbreak of civil war in January 1991. Therefore, the e -rective
implementation period was less than a year.
5.    Evaluation of Project Objectives. The objectives of CRRDP II were clear but somewhat
ambitious. Project design took advantage of lessons of experience and progress gained under
CRRDP I. A new strategy for the development of rangelands was adopted under which emphasis
was placed on investigations for a better understanding of range dynamics and on activities
which could increase the incomes of pastoralists and provide them with new management

options. RLAs were to be involved in the planning and implementation of all project activities.
Also, an autonomous project unit was introduced for the management of CRRDP II.
6.    However, the expectation of high adoption rates of the improved pastoral (85%) and
agropastoral (75%) techniques as well as the assumptions on substantial increases (1 9%-27%) in
livestock products and in crop yields appear to be optimistic. The pastoral improvements
assumed that the breeding flock would increase in number through reductions in mortality and
that fertility, disposal weight and milk production increased. Increases in crop yields were
probably overstated given the limited duration of the trials and the variability in rains and soil
types through the project area.
7.    The major risk proved to be political and could not be accurately assessed at appraisal.
Other risks were generally understood and measures taken to minimize them. It is, however, felt
that a more thorough analysis of risks such as the sustainability of range improvements and
increased pressure on the range would have been useful.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS & MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING
PROJECT PERFORMANCE
8.    No field visits have been undertaken during the course of preparing this PCN. Therefore,
project achievements cannot be accurately assessed due to lack of data. Preliminary activities
started after the close of CRRDP I, using the limited resources from PPF from mid-1 988 until the
credit became effective in late 1989. From about mid-1989, activities were hampered by
growing civil strife, and implementation was suspended for six months from early 1990.
Attempts were made by local staff to continue some project activities until late 1990, but with
little effect, and civil war broke out in January 1991. With an effective implementation period of
less than a year, achievement of project objectives was minimal.
9.   Initially, late allocation of funds prevented the hiring of new consultants and the
adjustment of local staff salaries. PPF could finance only some staff and operating costs, small
purchases of equipment, key TA and studies. Subsequently, the veterinary component was
disrupted to a much larger extent than other components because of the withdrawal of GTZ's TA
Finally, disbursements were confined to staff and operating costs to sustain project operations
and the outstanding contractual obligations.
10.   Problems which appeared early on would need to have been resolved in order to allow
reasonable achievement of objectives. Due to the circumstances, it is not possible to determine
whether these problems would have been adequately addressed.
11.   Actual Project Costs and Financing. Because of limited data, the project actual
expenditures can only be estimated. Based on the actual disbursements of IDA Credit and A i)F
Loan, total expenditures of the project as of December 31, 1990 are estimated at US$2.69
million, 8% of the appraisal estimate. The IDA Credit was able to finance only US$1.99 million,
about 74% of total (actual) project expenditures, (but only 10.5% of the appraisal merged
estimate) while ADF Loan provided only US$0.43 million (16%). The remaining US$0.27
million was contributed by GOS.



12.   Project Sustainability. The project was impaired by security conditions during its brief
period of implementation and was terminated by the outbreak of civil war. Further work in range
development can resume only after the establishment of a stable peace and reconstruction of the
economy.
13.   Bank Performance. The Bank's performance throughout the project life was
satisfactory. Advice given on detailed project preparation and during supervision missions was
adequate. Project objectives and design were technically sound but somewhat optimistic.
Supervision missions were effective and instrumental in accelerating and assisting GOS and
CRRDP in complying with the conditions of credit effectiveness, as well as in project
implementation. The mission fielded in November 1989 took prompt action to reduce project
exposure to strife risks. A six-month interim implementation strategy was recommended and
implemented.
14.   Borrower Performance. The Borrower's difficulties in meeting conditions of
effectiveness for the credit as well as for the ADF loan delayed the project implementation, while
late allocation of funds limited project activities. Although interim funding was provided through
PPF, the amount was inadequate to afford larger implementation activities. Moreover, although
the project proposed a more autonomous organizational structure, the Project Management
Committee was weak. However, there appeared to be genuine commitment at Government level
to support the project's objectives and efforts were made to motivate staff at field level to keep
most operations going in spite of the difficult conditions and the absence of TA. Compliance
with major covenants over project life was satisfactory.
FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS, AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
15.   Since the project was disrupted by the war after a brief period, there was no possibility of
achieving planned outcomes. What the results would have been in the absence of war cannot be
determined.
16.   The major lessons learned over the short duration of project implementation are:
(a)   the PPF proved very useful to provide a bridge between CRRDP I and CRRDP II;
and
(b)   a sound understanding of the resource base of the target area and the socio-
economic needs of the target group is an invaluable asset in designing and
implementing a project. Under this project, investigations were leading to, on the
one hand, better understanding of range dynamics and, on the other hand,
activities which could increase the incomes of pastoralists and provide them with
new management options.
