F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
Contribute to reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence in CAR and mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS on
persons living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. This will be achieved through support to public sector
responses, e.g. the Ministry of Health and other public sector organizations, as well as by supporting


                                                       6
civil society responses through civil society organizations (CSOs), e.g. NGOs and private firms, and
communities. The project will also be achieved through coordination, program management and M&E.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The objectives of the project are to assist the recipient to contribute to: (a) urgent needs in the fight
against HIV/AIDS, such as access to prevention, treatment, and impact mitigation services; (b) urgent
social needs, such as prevention of malaria, increased access to water supply and improved primary
education.

  The project consists of the following four components:
  Component 1: Support to the National Program against HIV/AIDS
  Component 2: Support to Emergency Health Needs
  Component 3: Support to Emergency Needs in the Education Sector
  Component 4: Support to Financial Management and Procurement.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context (country background)

1.      The Central African Republic (CAR) has experienced a long period of political instability and
armed conflict, bad governance and poor socio-economic outcomes. At the time of original project
appraisal in 2000, an estimated 67 percent of the population of 3.6 million was living under the poverty
line; CAR can therefore readily be characterized as one of the poorest countries in the world. Recurrent
conflicts have led to a deterioration of all social indicators, making it unlikely that CAR could achieve
most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. In 2000 CAR was ranked 165 out of
173 in the human development index according to the UNDP Human Development Report (2002),
with life expectancy at birth estimated at 44.3 years, well below the average for sub-Saharan African
countries.
2.      The past decade in particular has seen a vicious cycle of periodic mutinies and coup attempts,
all of which have led to the destruction of infrastructure and social services. In February 2002, CAR
fell into non-accrual status due to its accumulated arrears. As a result, most of the donors withdrew
from their support to the country. The World Bank was no exception: it suspended its entire portfolio
from February 2002 until the country cleared its arrears in November 2006. The multisectoral
HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (MHPP) was approved by the Board and signed in December 2001, but
never became effective until suspension was lifted and the project was restructured in 2007.
3.      In March 2003, the country underwent a regime change and the establishment of a transitional
government, which successfully held national elections in 2005, marking an important step towards
stability. Peace talks resulted in a peace agreement with key rebel groups in 2007 and 2008, which led
to the holding of an Inclusive Political Dialogue (IPD) in December 2008. The National Unity
Government, headed by the incumbent president, was formed in January 2009, but the security
situation remains uncertain due to sporadic violence.
4.      The World Bank’s Country Re-Engagement Note (CRN) developed in 2004 marked the re-
establishment of the Bank’s relationship with CAR. The Note proposed that the Bank’s assistance
program focus on two building blocks, with one aimed at improving delivery of basic social services.
The Note explicitly mentioned the focus on HIV/AIDS prevention and control, while also stressing the
need for other emergency social service recovery programs.
5.      The CRN was superseded by an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY2007-2008 which was
jointly prepared by the African Development Bank and the World Bank. The ISN sought to harmonize
support from CAR’s key development partners and to demonstrate their shared resolve to: (i) address
the country’s aggravated arrears problem; (ii) facilitate access to the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI); (iii) support government efforts to
provide basic services; and (iv) reinforce government action to stabilize the social and political
environment. It also highlighted the severely deteriorating social indicators in CAR and proposed to
drastically restructure the suspended MHPP in order to include other social sectors in addition to
HIV/AIDS.
6.     Sector Background. At the time of the original project approval in 2001, UNAIDS estimated
that approximately 10.7 percent of the population aged 15-49 was living with HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS
used a method based on measuring the HIV/AIDS infection rate among pregnant women and
extrapolating the results to the whole population. This placed CAR as the tenth most HIV-infected
country in sub-Saharan Africa. The original PAD further noted that the estimated number of deaths due
to AIDS was between 13,000 and 23,000, with the number of AIDS orphans exceeding 70,000.

                                                   15
7.     In 2006 at the time of project re-appraisal after suspension, a seroprevalence study conducted
nationwide concluded that CAR was in the midst of a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic characterized
by high regional variations and an overall prevalence rate at 6.2 percent for 15-49 years of age. 2 The
study equally concluded that: (i) the prevalence rate was much higher for women (7.8 percent) than
men (4.3 percent); (ii) there were substantial differences between prefectures, ranging from 1 to 15
percent; and (iii) the far highest prevalence rate was among uniformed personnel (military, police) at
21.1 percent, followed by service occupations and unskilled workers at 8.5 percent. The 2006 study
estimated a total number of seropositive people at about 200,000, most of whom are not aware whether
they are seropositive or not.
8.      In addition, more than ten years of civil unrest have reduced both the coverage and quality of
essential social services, including provision of basic health services, primary education and access to
water and sanitation. Available indicators confirm the severity of the health crisis. In 2006 Multiple
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 3), Human development indicators in CAR were well below the sub-
Saharan average, with infant mortality at 106 live births per 1,000 with a large variation between urban
and rural areas, and the percentage of malnourished children under-five at 19 percent. Maternal
mortality stood at 544 per 100,000, a large decrease from 1,355 per 100,000 in 2003, but still very high
and far from the MDG target. In 2006 the prevalence rate of malaria infections among children under-
five was estimated at 20 percent and continues to be one of the most important causes of death in CAR;
at the time of the MICS survey about 36 percent possessed at least one bednet, and only 16 percent
possessed at least one insecticide-treated nets (ITNs).
9.      Similarly, education outcomes in CAR were among the lowest in the subregion and have
experienced further deterioration from the extended period of instability. The education system
suffered a loss of teachers, destruction of infrastructure, and low investment, particularly in rural areas
where education services were virtually nonexistent. The teacher pupil ratio fell from 1/63 in 1987 to
1/87 in 2003 and 1/92 in 2005/2006, reaching as low as 1/160 in certain schools. The results of the
recent Country Status Report (Rapport d'Etat d’un Système Educatif National - RESEN) show that
knowledge of mathematics and French is among the lowest in Francophone African countries. The
repetition rate is high at more than 30 percent of pupils compared with an average of 10 percent in
Africa, and 40 percent of pupils drop out before completing primary school. Almost half of the
teachers in the primary schools are "parent-teachers," poorly paid and living in the poorest villages.
10.     Government priorities for HIV/AIDS. The development of the original project was driven by
the government’s early recognition of the threat posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 2000, the
government, with UNAIDS sponsorship, undertook a thorough strategic planning process to strengthen
the national response to HIV/AIDS, focusing on the involvement of all sectors and civil society. In
January 2001 the President of CAR issued a decree creating the National HIV/AIDS Coordinating
Committee (Comité National de Lutte contre le SIDA, CNLS 3), which had the overall responsibility
of leading the fight against HIV/AIDS. The Committee, directly placed under the authority of the Head
of State (i.e. the President), was supported by a Technical Secretariat (CNLS-TS), which led the
preparation of this MHPP. In the process the government emphasized two strategies: (i) a multisectoral
approach engaging all societal actors in the fight against HIV/AIDS; and (ii) allocation of resources to
both public and private sector partners in light of limited external support.



2
  While the 2001 UNAIDS estimates were based on few antenatal clinics, the 2006 sero-surveillance study was based on 11 samples
(including 5,413 women and 5,179 men from 15 to 49 years of age) from different parts of the country. As observed in neighboring
countries such as Benin and Cameroon, this tends to yield lower estimates.
3
    Created under Government Decree 01.032 of January 26, 2001, modified by Decree 02.274 of November 29, 2002.

                                                                 16
11.     In 2006, the Government of CAR developed an HIV National Strategic Framework 2006-2010
following the earlier version of 2002-2005, alerting the disease’s substantial threat to the economic and
social development of the country. The Framework retained the following four strategic axes:: (i)
strengthen the prevention programs to make the population change their behavior towards HIV/AIDS
and carry out programs focusing on vulnerable population, in particular women and youth; (ii)
strengthen the universal treatment for people infected or affected taking into account all aspects
(psychosocial, opportunistic infections (OI), antiretroviral (ARV) treatment); and (iii) promote
multisectorality in the actions to fight against HIV/AIDS and improve M&E.
12.     Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and Rationale for Bank Involvement. At the time of
original project preparation in 2000, a CAS was not prepared; instead, a Transitional Support Strategy
(TSS) was presented to the Board in December 1999 as part of the World Bank’s framework for post-
conflict countries. The TSS emphasized fiscal consolidation, improved governance, and laying the
foundations for a poverty alleviation program. An updated TSS (2002) focused on consolidating the
progress achieved in public finance management and social sectors, including emergency operations,
such as this MHPP. In addition, the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP), dated
December 2000, defined the HIV/AIDS epidemic as the main priority for assistance, along with health,
education, addressing poor governance and insecurity.
13.    The Bank’s assistance in CAR to the fight against HIV/AIDS was justified by the absence of
mechanisms to conduct HIV/AIDS-related activities involving large social mobilization and the need
to expand existing activities and coverage. CAR met the MAP eligibility criteria in that it had: (i)
provided satisfactory evidence of a strategic approach to HIV/AIDS through the creation of a
government-appointed working group to prepare a HIV/AIDS multisectoral strategy; (ii) established a
high-level HIV/AIDS coordinating body; (iii) the government had demonstrated its willingness to use
appropriate implementation arrangements, e.g. civil society organizations (CSOs) and local
communities; and (iv) the government had agreed to use and fund multiple implementation agencies,
e.g. government ministries, CSOs and local communities.
14.     In 2006, a CAS was still not developed, but in compliance with the recommendations of CRN
(2004) and ISN (2006) to expand the project scope to include other social sectors, the MHPP added
components on health, primary education, and access to water and sanitation. The expansion was
driven by: (i) alarmingly deteriorating human development outcomes in the aftermath of the political
crisis experienced in CAR; and (ii) compelling funding requirements to address immediate needs in
these sectors, particularly in the light of shortages in government revenues and other external support;
and (iii) increased funding in HIV/AIDS as a result of new engagement of other partners, especially
the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). The MHPP was one of the five
projects approved at the time of Bank’s re-engagement in 2006 and the only one that focused on the
social sector. After more than five years of suspension, the project was finally declared effective in
September 2007.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
15.     The original PDO was to contribute to reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence in CAR and to
mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS on persons living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. However, the
project was not made effective under this PDO.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority), Key Indicators and
reasons/justification


                                                   17
16.     The project’s PDO was revised during the 2007 restructuring to assist the recipient to contribute
to: (i) urgent needs in the fight against HIV, such as access to prevention, treatment and impact
mitigation services; and (ii) urgent social needs, such as prevention of malaria, increased access to
water and improved primary education.
17.     The original PDO related to the fight against HIV/AIDS was adjusted in line with the country’s
updated National Strategy against HIV/AIDS (2006-2010). The revised PDO on HIV/AIDS reflects
current thinking that prevalence rates should not be used as impact indicators in MAP projects. The
PDO related to addressing urgent social needs was added to: (i) address deteriorating social outcomes
as a result of long political instability and conflicts; and (ii) the absence of other mechanisms to
improve these poor outcomes. Consequently, the project name was changed from MHPP to
Multisectoral HIV/AIDS, Health and Education Emergency Support Project (Projet multisectoriel
santé, education et SIDA, PSES). Project components were also modified to reflect the revised PDO
(discussed below under 1.5).

1.4. Main Beneficiaries
18.    The original project intended to yield the following benefits. First, the project aimed to curtail
the spread of HIV/AIDS in CAR, and targeted the entire population, especially youth, women and
other high-risk groups, with a more directed community impact. Second, it would extend the
productive life of people living with HIV/AIDS and suffering from opportunistic infections through
the provision of better care, as well as assistance to people affected by HIV/AIDS. Third, it would
increase the capacity of actors at all levels, to deal with the HIV/AIDS crisis.
19.     The 2007 restructuring maintained the expected benefits but drastically reduced the scope in
light of the need to accommodate other social sectors. The geographic coverage for HIV/AIDS
interventions was consequently narrowed down to 31 selected sites located at subprefectural levels in
16 prefectures, while maintaining a focus on youth, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and
women, as well as other high-risk groups such as military. Public, private and community institutions
also benefited from the project. To complement new GFATM interventions in selected prefectural
levels, PSES intervened at decentralized levels in more remote, rural areas. The target sites were
selected on the basis of: (i) HIV prevalence established in the third MICS 3 and sero-surveillance study
conducted in 2006 and 2007 respectively; and (ii) in the case where disaggregated data on HIV
prevalence at subprefecture level was not available, 4 selection depended on the ‘possibility’ of higher
HIV transmission risk based on vulnerability factors that had been identified.
20.     Regional targets and main beneficiary selection of the newly-added social sectors were based
on priorities identified by each sector: (i) the malaria subcomponent’s target prefectures for ITN
distribution were selected based on outstanding gaps following previous mass distribution campaigns,
targeting children under-five and pregnant women 5; (ii) community microprojects selected their target
areas on the basis of the malaria prevalence rate at subprefectural levels in those prefectures where the
project would be implemented, as well as on a predefined set of eligibility criteria; (iii) the education
component (component 3), relied on information provided by the Ministry of Education (MoE) which
included a list of teachers to be supported and areas where school materials were to be distributed



4
  The sero-surveillance survey conducted in 2006 provides data at subprefecture levels, but was not available for all
subprefectures.
5
  The quantity of ITNs was determined based on population growth projections of the 2003 Census in the selected
prefectures, multiplied by percentage of children under-five (on average 17 percent of population) and pregnant women (on
average 4 percent of the population).

                                                           18
based on their national strategy and existing gaps, primarily focusing on the most underserved rural
areas.

1.5 Original Components (as approved in 2001 but never became effective)
    Component 1: Strengthening Public Sector Response (US$3.4 million). This component
    intended to support public sector organizations, e.g. line ministries and public agencies, in
    implementing action plans against HIV/AIDS, in line with the prevention and support objectives of
    the project.
   Component 2: Strengthening Civil Society Responses (US$11.4 million).
   Subcomponent A: Strengthening of Responses by Civil Society Organizations. This component
   intended to support the HIV/AIDS action plans of CSOs and their contracts for the provisioning of
   specific services or purchasing of specific goods deemed necessary to implement their action plans.

   Subcomponent B: Small grants for communities. This was intended to stimulate responses at the
   community level by financing the implementation of community action plans through approved
   community grants.

   Component 3: Coordination, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation (US$2.7
   million). This component intended to support the investment and operational costs of the CNLS-
   TS and the Financial Management Unit (FMU) of the CNLS and the Provincial HIV/AIDS
   Coordination Committee (CPLS) and their technical teams. The component would also support
   related M&E and audit activities.

   Project Preparation Facility (PPF) refinancing (US$0.5 million). The original amount of
   US$0.5 million foreseen for PPF was eventually increased to US$2.0 million in total over four
   PPFs.

1.6. Revised Components (Restructured in 2007 and implemented upon effectiveness)
21.     The HIV/AIDS component, initially covering around 87 percent of total project financing, was
reduced to about 38 percent after restructuring. The remaining 62 percent was allocated to: (i) address
emergency health needs under component 2 (e.g. malaria, community projects to improve water and
sanitation) (38 percent); (ii) education under component 3 (16 percent); and (iii) unallocated. While the
activities still targeted the public sector, they largely focused on interventions to support CSOs and
communities.
   Revised component 1: Support to the National Program against HIV/AIDS (US$6.47 million).
   Subcomponent 1 (a): Civil society responses against HIV/AIDS. Support to youth organizations,
   PLWHA associations and a federation of PLWHA associations. Activities would focus on
   behavioral changes and support for people living with HIV/AIDS and those affected by HIV/AIDS.
   Subcomponent 1 (b): Ministry of Health responses against HIV/AIDS. Support Ministry of
   Health and Population (MoHP) activities by enhancing access to services aimed at prevention, care
   and treatment of HIV/AIDS. Project funding for the programs by the MoHP would supplement the
   financing provided by the GFATM and other donors, focusing on geographic areas not covered by
   these donors. Activities would include: (i) increasing the use of voluntary counseling and testing
   (VCT) services; (ii) increasing access to ARV treatment by PLWHA; and (iii) improving
   compliance with national blood testing guidelines and with a medical waste management plan
   (MWMP).


                                                   19
   Subcomponent 1 (c): Other public-sector responses against HIV/AIDS. The subcomponent
   supports priority activities identified by four priority public sectors (Ministries of Education,
   Defense, Social Affairs, and Public Services) contributing to prevention and support to affected
   and infected people, using annual agreements with outputs and results indicators.
   Subcomponent 1(d): Coordination, supervision and M&E. The project would finance the
   operations of the CNLS-TS and its decentralized prefectural coordinating committees (CPLS). The
   project would also support related M&E studies, namely a national health and HIV/AIDS study
   and a second sero-surveillance study.
   Revised component 2: Support to emergency health needs (US$6.56 million).
   Subcomponent 2 (a): Malaria prevention and improved access to emergency health services.
   This subcomponent would procure and distribute: (i) about 300,000 ITNs for pregnant women and
   children under five to help bridge the gap for government’s effort to achieve universal coverage;
   and (ii) equipment for emergency health services.
   Subcomponent 2 (b): Small emergency community subprojects. The project would finance small
   subprojects prepared by communities and CSOs to address emergency health needs, including: (i)
   small rural water supply systems contributing to improvement of health and reduction of
   transmission of infectious diseases; (ii) drainage of marshlands to reduce reproduction and
   spreading of mosquitos; and (iii) other works, supplies and services of an emergency nature, as
   identified by communities as priorities, such as small medical supplies, limited rehabilitation,
   training of health workers and community workers in basic preventive care.
   Subcomponent 2 (c): Coordination, supervision and M&E. The project would support limited
   financing to assist the MoHP to supervise, monitor and evaluate the project.
   Revised component 3: Support to emergency education needs (US$2.70 million).
   Subcomponent 3 (a): Training of primary schools teachers. The subcomponent aimed to improve
   the quality of teaching at the primary level and respond to urgent needs in providing teaching
   services; this would be achieved by focusing on training teachers and improving the student-to-
   teacher ratio.
   Subcomponent 3 (b): Access to educational materials in primary schools. The project would
   provide textbooks, small furniture, teaching kits and other educational material in primary schools
   in underserved areas.
   Subcomponent 3(c): Coordination, supervision and M&E. The project would support limited
   financing to assist the MoE to supervise, monitor and evaluate the activities above.
   Revised component 4: Support to Financial Management and Procurement (US$ 180,000).
   A small Financial Management and Procurement Unit for the project (FMPU-PSES) would be
   supported under this component whose primary purpose was to channel funds to the three sectors
   through their implementing agencies. The unit would include an international-level financial
   management (FM) specialist and a procurement specialist.
   Unallocated (US$1.09 million)

1.7 Other significant changes
22.    The Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was amended four times during the project period:
   (i)    First amendment (June 2006): A one-year extension (Country Director (CD) approval)of
          the original project’s closing date from June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007, to allow sufficient

                                                 20
             time to prepare the project restructuring following the Bank’s decision to re-engage in CAR.
             At this point the project had not become effective and had kept the minimum operation
             under the PPF as a result of portfolio suspension between February 2002 and June 2007.

    (ii)     Second amendment (June 2007): A Level 1 Restructuring (Board approval) after the
             country’s re-engagement expanded the PDO and project components from an exclusive
             focus on HIV/AIDS to one that includes an emergency response to critical social needs
             resulting from the crisis. The restructuring: (i) modified institutional and implementation
             arrangements to reflect the involvement of new sectors; (ii) extended the project closing
             date for the second time from June 30, 2007 to September 30, 2010, allowing a total of
             three years for project implementation after its effectiveness; and (iii) updated the results
             framework to reflect the revised PDO. The restructuring package was approved on May 30,
             2007 and the amendment to the DCA was signed on June 26, 2007. The project was
             declared effective on September 19, 2007, or three months after the government met all
             effectiveness conditions. 6

    (iii)    Third amendment (September 2010): A Level 2 Restructuring (CD approval) was then
             performed to re-allocate credit proceeds within categories where cost savings were possible
             and others that needed to be increased. As disbursement remained at about 50 percent, a
             third extension of the project closing date from September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2012 was
             required. The restructuring also included updating the project results framework to reflect
             the Bank’s core indicator wording as well as to adjust the targets.

    (iv)     Fourth amendment (November 2011): A Level 2 Restructuring (CD approval) to
             reallocate credit proceeds within categories where cost savings were possible and others
             that needed increase.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry (the restructured project)

23.    Project Preparation and Design. The fact that the original project was never made effective
and project funds remained undisbursed until the 2007 restructuring in some ways facilitated the
reevaluation of project priorities, thereby allowing for a more appropriate urgent response to the crisis.
The restructuring was of particular relevance as it was carried out in the context of: (i) a critical need
for funding in other social sectors; (ii) linking the opportunities and eventual complementarities in
HIV/AIDS provided by other bilateral and multilateral partners, such as the GFATM; (iii)
redeployment of investments in the light of evolving strategic governmental orientations, such as
decentralization and development at community levels; and (iv) integration of other causes of
morbidity, e.g., malaria.



6
  Conditions of project effectiveness were: (i) establishment of the CMO detailing functions, staffing and resources
satisfactory to the Association; (ii) establishment of the FMPU-PSES; (iii) adoption of the amended project implementation
manual, Financial and Accounting Manual, the M&E Manual and the Procurement Plan; (iv) appointment of financial
management staff with satisfactory qualifications in CNLS-TS, MoHP and MoE to manage credit funds; and (v) the
amended and restated DCA duly authorized or ratified by all necessary government action.

                                                           21
24.     In December 2006, a World Bank project identification mission agreed with the government
on: (i) a modified scope of HIV/AIDS interventions to reflect developments since original project
approval; and (ii) priority emergency social needs in the health, education and water sectors to address
new emergencies resulting from civil disturbances. During the restructuring appraisal mission in
January 2007, all sectors concerned gathered around a table and discussed their strategic options.
Budget repartition was determined on the basis of annual plans submitted by each sector, which was
then revisited several times to keep within the overall budget envelope.
25.     Risks. Risks were re-assessed at the project 2007 restructuring and identified the following
critical elements: (i) continued political instability and civil unrest; (ii) shortage of institutional
capacity to carry out the operations of the restructured project; and (iii) limited use or misuse of goods
and services provided under the health and education emergency components by the project
management unit, local elites and/or community members. While political instability remained beyond
the project’s control, it was mitigated through the involvement of NGOs and communities; likewise,
institutional capacity risks were mitigated by the planned institutional arrangements, integrated
supervision missions and by training of potential beneficiaries in the use of goods and services
provided under the project.
26.    Quality at Entry. No Quality Enhancement Review was conducted at project entry 7 or during
the 2007 project restructuring.

2.2Implementation

27.      During the project suspension period, Project Preparation Funds (PPF) was granted on an
exceptional basis. The PPF, totaling US$2 million in four phases, successfully supported: (i) the
establishment and operation of the CNLS-TS and its 16 decentralized functions (CPLS); (ii) pilot
activities for selected CSO and communities; (iii) capacity building of various stakeholders; (iv)
mapping of HIV/AIDS prevalence in at-risk areas. 8 Activities were implemented mostly through
contracts with NGOs and private entities under the leadership of CNLS. Successful implementation of
PPFs led to the effective functioning of an institutional framework to fight against HIV/AIDS at
central levels as well as its decentralized functions. This led to leveraging significant support from
other donors who used the CNLS structures to channel their resources to support government efforts.
Donors included GFATM who provided US$25 million for access to treatment in 2004 and US$16
million for orphans and vulnerable children in 2005, OPEC (US$0.5 million) and CARITAS (US$1.8
million). In addition, the various pilot activities of CSOs and communities, as well as various studies
conducted under PPF, facilitated the re-orientation of the project design of the restructured project.

28.    Implementation arrangements were substantially revised during the 2007 restructuring to reflect
the involvement of concerned sectors, including CNLS (on HIV/AIDS-related issues) and the
Ministries of Health, Education, Mining, Energy and Hydraulics (consulted on water supply and
drainage-related issues). To provide effective support to these sectors, an Implementation Committee
for IDA Credit (Comité de mise en oeuvre, CMO), was created as a formal inter-ministerial committee


7
  The original PAD was reviewed on July 24, 2001 and contained the following recommendations: (i) revise the risk section
of the PAD to fully reflect the continued political and operational risks resulting from the country’s fragility; (ii) confirm
the existence of a strong government commitment and emphasize that a draft HIV/AIDS strategy was in place; (iii) clearly
define the modalities of support to CNLS-TS (whether to support salaries or not); and (iv) specify implementation
arrangements at decentralized levels to ensure quality of subprojects.
8
  Upon exhaustion of PPF, CNLS carried out additional activities using Low-Income Country Under Stress (LICUS) grants
and other donor funds.

                                                             22
to be chaired by a representative from the Ministry of Planning. In addition, a FMPU attached to this
committee which consisted of an FM specialist and procurement specialist was created to: (i) centralize
the procurement of major supplies for the three implementing sectors concerned; (ii) advance funds to
the sectors, CSOs and communities; and (iii) manage the designated account.
29.     As a result of introducing a new mechanism with a wide array of actors, the first six months
after project effectiveness was mainly devoted to fine-tuning the action plans submitted by different
ministries to keep within the overall budget envelope and aligning procedures. The effective launch of
activities in the field occurred with the first disbursement in April 2008, although disbursement
remained somewhat weak with just over 55 percent of funds disbursed in June 2010 (three months
before expected project closure), thus requiring another project extension until March 30, 2012.
30.    Mid-term review. A formal mid-term review was not planned given the urgent nature and the
expected short project implementation period; nonetheless, a supervision mission performed a project
evaluation in March 2009. The evaluation concluded that the: (i) objectives of the project remained
relevant; (ii) the project had a good chance of attaining its indicators and results; (iii) a budget
reallocation should be carried out to ensure all activities would be conducted as planned; (iv) the
closing date should be extended; and (v) an adjustment to the project implementation manual was
needed. These recommendations were implemented at the September 2010 restructuring, including a
revision of the indicator targets.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
31.      M&E Design. Key project indicators were drastically revised during the 2007 restructuring to
reflect the new PDO and were substantially reduced from the original project. The M&E manual was
updated with a clearly defined results framework. The revision for the HIV component was made in
alignment with the MAP umbrella restructuring in which the HIV prevalence rate was removed and
more focus was put on vulnerable groups. Each sector was responsible for establishing the baseline for
their indicators; however, in most cases the baseline was not available as practically no interventions
had been carried out by the Bank or other donors. Some indicators’ wording were further adjusted
during the 2010 restructuring in line with IDA core indicators.
32.     M&E Implementation. The restructured project did not include an M&E component but each
sector received a modest amount for coordination, supervision and M&E under their respective
component. Consequently, each sector was responsible for data collection and reporting on their
project outcomes, and was confined to their target areas. Originally the FMPU was supposed to recruit
an M&E specialist to strengthen the M&E of the project and generally oversee progress, but this was
eventually replaced with an idea to recruit a FMPU project coordinator who would at the same time
oversee M&E, fiduciary issues and assume an overall coordination role.
33.     Given the significant reduction in the M&E budget under the restructured project, the project
could not go as far as to address some of the M&E-related structural problems commonly seen in all
sectors, such as: (i) inefficiency in the data circuit from the execution level in the field to the central
level; and (ii) a general absence of data analysis for decision-making to reflect the indicator progress in
improving project performance. 9 Nevertheless, M&E improved after the arrival of the PSES project
coordinator in 2009 through: (i) the introduction of an incentive payment for timely submission of
reports; (ii) organization of quarterly review meetings presided by the CMO and attended by all sector



9
  The only exception to this was the change that occurred in relation to the VCT strategy under component 1, where low
testing rates triggered a shift to an advanced mobile testing strategy, resulting in significant improvement of results.

                                                            23
focal points, FMPU and CSOs to review the indicator progress and collectively validate the results;
and (iii) revision of the reporting format to ensure consistency across sectors.
34.     M&E Utilization. Health Management Information Systems (HMIS) were available but were
not sufficiently relied upon due to poor data quality and incompleteness. In addition, while attempts
were made at sectoral levels to engage in strategic discussions to improve sector performance, results
monitoring generally focused on assessing the physical and financial achievements of the annual action
plans and translating the results to measure overall sector performance. Nevertheless, the project
supported several important studies, including MICS 4 and a second generation sero-surveillance
survey, as well as a health facility survey which was used to feed into the subsequent Country Health
Status Report (2012), enabling a comparison of data during pre- and post-project effectiveness period
at the national level. There was also a general interest in using data from existing studies and this
remained the case throughout the lifetime of the project. At an operational level, MICS 3 (2006) and
sectoral studies, such as UNGASS reports and the Education Status Report (RESEN), were used to
determine revised targets for the restructured project. Selection of project intervention areas for the
HIV component also relied on MICS 3 data, as well as other available documents. At the policy level,
data were used for the National HIV/AIDS Strategic Framework and other sectoral strategies, as
described in more detail in Section 3.1.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35.    Environment and management of medical waste: The environment category of the original
project at the time of appraisal was B in light of risks related to the handling and disposal of
HIV/AIDS-infected materials. Financed by the PPF, a MWMP was developed and disclosed in March
2002.
36.    The 2007 restructuring maintained the environment category as B as the impact was judged to
be “minimal, site-specific, and manageable.? 10 The MWMP was revised and re-disclosed in November
2007. Implementation of the MWMP was foreseen under the HIV/AIDS component and was generally
well implemented, although activities were somewhat restricted as a result of a reduced budget for
safeguards. This resulted in: (i) interventions being limited to 31 HIV/AIDS sites instead of nationwide
coverage as initially planned in order to serve the health sector at large; and (ii) the focus of activities
was narrowed to areas considered as high priority (e.g. awareness raising, training and provision of
adequate equipment). In addition, the financial sustainability of these activities after project closure
remained under discussion in order to ensure continued technical and financial support to local health
committees (Comité de Gestion, COGES) and health workers.
37.     Implementation of Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). As
component 1a (support to CSO) and component 2b (community microprojects) involved small projects
related to drainage of small marshlands and rural water supply, OP 4.01 and OP 4.04 were triggered
and an ESMF was developed in November 2007. Initially the Directorate General of Hydraulic (DGH)
in the Ministry of Energy and Hydraulic was responsible for the implementation and supervision of the
framework but as their capacity was limited to water, this was taken over by the Ministry of
Environment in 2010. The Ministry of Environment played a key role in: (i) identifying the sites for
community microprojects based on their environmental screening criteria; and (ii) sensitization and
training of health personnel on the MWMP. Transfer of responsibilities should have happened at a
much earlier stage to avoid implementation delays.

38.     Procurement: During the pre-effectiveness phase under PPF, procurement was carried out by
the FM Unit of CNLS-TS but this responsibility was transferred to FMPU-PSES after the 2007
restructuring. Procurement plans were adequately developed and updated and preparation of bidding
documents was carried out in a satisfactory manner. The FMPU centralized inputs acquisition and
contracts for all three sectors contributed to reducing the transaction costs. Nonetheless, some delays at
the start-up phase were seen due to the need for close coordination between the procurement specialist
and technical focal points. One difficulty encountered was a general lack of clarity in the
accountability mechanism as FMPU was responsible for processing contracts, while technical aspects
were entirely under the responsibility of each sector focal points. This lack of coordination resulted in
the second lot of 266,000 ITNs purchased in 2009 and received in 2010, but only upon delivery was it
identified that the nets did not conform to the required technical standards for distribution. Upon
evaluation it was found that the ITNs delivered by the supplier had manufacturing flaws, such as the
size of the mesh weaving too large to prevent mosquitos from entering inside the net. Given this
technical flaw, even the potential solution of providing an additional layer of insecticide treatment was
not an option. Currently there is a stalemate between the supplier and the government, and as a result,
the ITNs are stocked in a warehouse in Bangui until a decision is taken by the government, while
appropriate legal measures are being taken vis-à-vis the supplier.
39.     Financial management and disbursement: Overall, FM did not pose a serious threat to
project implementation with Implementation Status and Results (ISR) ratings consistently scored as
Moderately Satisfactory or Satisfactory, with the exception of: (i) when the country’s suspension was
lifted in March 2007 and no disbursement was made; and (ii) when disbursement was still low two
years after effectiveness in December 2009 but measures to improve FM were not taken into account
(both rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory). No issues with ineligible expenditures or unqualified
external audits were encountered. 11
40.     As was the case with procurement, difficulties in disbursement were seen in the initial years
after effectiveness due to the new implementation arrangement; these difficulties were reflected in: (i)
slow disbursement until the second half of 2009; (ii) delays in updating accounting records; and (iii)
lack of timely submission of financial reports. These were resolved over time and substantially
improved towards the end of project. Recording in accounting systems seems to have been adequate,
although the departure of the FM specialist two weeks before project closure somewhat affected the
consolidation of final results and external audits for 2011.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
41.    To a large extent, investments financed by the project will be maintained through the following
follow-on sector specific projects:
•      For HIV, funding from GFATM will take over the 31 PSES sites to provide treatment to patients
       receiving ARVs by PSES support and to continue expanding efforts on VCT and prevention of
       mother to child transmission (PMTCT), while the government will take over costs for CNLS-TS
       functions (salaries and operational costs) at both central and decentralized levels.
•      CAR obtained access to the Education for All Program under the Fast Track Initiative Catalytic
       Fund (EFA/FTI in 2009, practically taking over all education activities funded under PSES,
       including teacher training, recruitment and deployment of teachers to rural areas. The US$38
       million fund supports implementation of phase the first of the National Education Strategy (2008-

     At the time of ICR, the external audit 2011 had not been submitted to the Bank.

                                                              25
      2011) through: (i) improving access to education through school construction and rehabilitation
      and (ii) enhancing the quality of education through teacher training and education materials
•     A US$28.3 million IDA and Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) co-financed health
      operation was approved by the Board in May 2012, ensuring continued support to increasing the
      utilization and improving the quality of maternal and health services through performance-based
      financing (PBF). The project targets approximately two-thirds of CAR’s population and will
      benefit from existing implementation arrangement, namely: (i) utilization of FMPU; and (ii)
      capitalization of inputs acquired by PSES.

•     A US$24 million IDA-financed Additional Financing for the Emergency Urban Infrastructure
      Rehabilitation Project was approved in September 2010, about US$14 million of which was
      dedicated to water supply and drainage/flood mitigation. The project ensures some level of
      complementarity with the work carried out under PSES, though with emphasis on securing safe
      drinking water in flooding vulnerable areas.

      3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

42.     Alignment with the country’s development strategy and Bank priorities. The objectives of
the project were fully aligned with the country’s long-term objectives and its strategic priorities. The
country’s Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSPII) (2011-2015) continues to highlight the
importance of generating sustainable equitable growth through human capital development, especially
health, education and HIV/AIDS. It also continues to include in its four pillars both human capital
development and access of population to basic social services. The project is fully aligned with the
country’s ongoing effort to achieving the MDGs, particularly Goals 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7.
43.      The project is also aligned with the following different sectoral development strategies:
•     The HIV National Strategic Framework (2012-2016) builds on the preceding framework 2006-
      2010, focusing on: (i) strengthening prevention programs focusing on population at risk, in
      particular youth, commercial sex workers and uniformed personnel; (ii) strengthening PMTCT in
      order to eliminate HIV transmission from mother to child by 2015; and (iii) providing universal
      treatment to people living with HIV/AIDS or affected by HIV/AIDS; and (iv) governance of
      HIV/AIDS, i.e. putting into place a mechanism to efficiently implement the new National
      HIV/AIDS Strategic Framework.
•     The National Health Development Plan (NHDP) 2006-2015 calls for strengthening malaria
      prevention as one of its five strategic axes, through: (i) efforts to increase accessibility and
      utilization of ITNs targeting pregnant women and children under five; and (ii) improve hygiene and
      health environment to reduce the cause of malaria. The Second Malaria Strategic Plan 2007-2011
      is aligned with the NHDP and aims to reduce by 50 percent mortality and morbidity linked to
      malaria by the end of 2011 compared to the results of 2000. 12 Similarly, the NHDP alludes to
      ‘encouraging the creation of decentralization funds to sustain community initiatives at district
      levels with support of implementing partners, targeting provision of drugs, construction and


12
  Future demand remains even larger: the National Malaria Program estimated that 2.3 million bednets are needed for the
next national mass campaign scheduled for 2013. 1.5 million bednets are programmed in the GFATM project, leaving a gap
of 35 percent.

                                                          26
       rehabilitation of health infrastructures, acquisition and maintenance of equipment, financial
       accessibility for treatment, supervision, maintenance of water points, etc.
•      The adoption of the National Education Strategy (2008-2020) constituted a major step forward on
       the policy front as it focused on increased access to education and improvement of the quality of
       education in the country. The strategy aims to achieve universal primary education by 2020
       through: (i) the establishment of a new policy on the training and recruitment of teachers; and (ii)
       the improvement of learning quality through the provisioning of pedagogic materials.
44.     The project remains highly relevant to the Bank’s priorities and development objectives. Axis 2
of the Joint Country Partnership Strategy (2009-2012) aims to rehabilitate and develop socio-
economic infrastructure, focusing on improving basic service delivery and the living conditions of the
population, through water treatment and sanitation, improved community participation, education,
health and HIV/AIDS. 13 Similarly, the World Bank’s Africa Regional Strategy recognizes public
health interventions, including basic health service delivery and water and sanitation, as a way to
“build resilience to address cumulative effects or shocks?. It also highlights the importance of
protecting vulnerable groups, such as people living with disabilities or living with HIV/AIDS.
45.      Objectives. The 2007 restructuring drastically modified the PDO in line with the country’s
updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy and sectoral strategies as previously discussed. The objectives
were clear and the allocation of activity components is justified given the timing of Bank’s re-
engagement and circumstances which demanded crucial support in the overall social sector. The
project’s conceptual and strategic approach was, and remains, highly relevant to the country’s current
priorities. This argument is supported by the fact that successor projects for sector specific operations
were developed as a continuation of or on the basis of lessons learnt from PSES.
46.    Design and Implementation. The project design remained relevant throughout; restructuring
was not due to an inherent design flaw or implementation failure but was conceived as a flexible
response to the priority needs of the social sector as a whole following a long period without external
support. While the need to cover a wide array of areas with limited budget obliged a rather thin spread
of resources, the core design of the revised project was realistic in the country and sector context.
PSES was the only existing mechanism allowing for a rapid response in the absence of other financing
by the Bank, thus serving to bridge the gap until funding for longer-term, sector-specific operations
became available. It also supported the Bank’s continued dialogue with the government and partners.
47.     The institutional set-up was adequate given the diverse technical knowledge required and
responsibilities that lie under different ministries; although involvement of a large number of actors
resulted in coordination difficulties during the initial phase. Improvements were later made to: (i)
harmonize M&E-related activities (e.g. data collection and reporting); (ii) put in place a project
coordinator to oversee the project and facilitate coordination between different entities; and (iii) widely
disseminate the revised implementation manual to better clarify the roles and responsibilities of each
actor.
48.    Even in the context of emergency, the project sought to ensure sustainability whenever possible.
The HIV/AIDS component addressed the immediate needs of the population by increasing access to
prevention and treatment, while contributing to strengthening of the institutional framework. The
health component followed a two-pronged approach, namely by fulfilling urgent needs through the
purchase of commodities and also by building rural community capacity. The community approach is

highlighted in the Joint Country Partnership Strategy as a way to help build social capital, provide
critical services, and regenerate economic activity for future sustainability.
49.     Based on the discussion above, the relevance of the development objectives, components and
specific activities of the project is rated as High.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Revised PDO 1: Contribute to meet urgent needs in the fight against HIV, e.g. access to
prevention, treatment and impact mitigation services.
50.    Overall, the project contributed to improving HIV-related services. The CAR Health Status
Report 2012 14 indicates that availability of almost all the key health services had dropped between
2006 and 2011, with the largest drop in immunizations (19 percentage points) and family planning (14
percentage points), while the availability of HIV-related services such as VCT, PMTCT and ARV
treatment has gone up by over 30 percentage points. Service utilization had also increased largely
because of outreach programs and community efforts, such as VCT activities by youth and PLWHA
associations, as well as PMTCT support groups which all facilitated identification of patients who
were subsequently referred to nearby project-supported health centers for treatment.
51.     Although part of original PDO, the HIV/AIDS prevalence rate was no longer included as a
PDO indicator after the MAP umbrella restructuring in 2007, and was consequently dropped from the
revised PDO. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that there has been a significant drop in the prevalence
rate among key groups in CAR, partly as a result of the project. Recent survey data shows that adults
aged 15-49 years decreased from 6.2 percent in 2006 (MICS 3) to 4.9 percent in 2010 (MICS 4).
UNAIDS estimates for HIV/AIDS prevalence rates among pregnant women at sentinel surveillance
sites reached as high as 10.7 percent in 2006 but dropped to 4.1 percent in 2010. 15 Furthermore, the
prevalence rate decreased at a time when treatment coverage increased substantially; according to
CNLS reports, treatment coverage at national level increased more than five-fold, from 2,860 in 2006
to 15,287 in 2010 (covering about 40 percent of all estimated people needing treatment). This would
imply a larger significance in the drop in the prevalence rate as people are living longer than before.


Outcome 1: Increased adoption of HIV/AIDS prevention measures and increased access to
treatment.
52.     Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT). The project served as a major
source of support for PMTCT services, reaching a total of 10,465 pregnant women who were tested
and who received results in targeted health centers (revised Intermediate Outcome Indicator 1),
against a target of 9,000 (116 percent achievement rate). The project also provided financial support to
the implementation of action plans by the PMTCT support groups. Nationwide, the PMTCT program
was extended from 62 sites in 2006 to 105 operational sites by the end of 2010, representing 19.7
percent of a total 534 health facilities practicing postnatal care and deliveries. Among these were 30
PSES sites, accounting for one third of the total.
53.     According to CNLS, the proportion of pregnant women who received ARV treatment in the
context of PMTCT nationwide was 16.0 percent (318 of 1986 positive mothers) in 2006, 35 percent
(608 of 1748 positive mothers) in 2008, with a large increase to 77.1 percent (2013 of 2604 positive
mothers) in 2010.

54.     Access to ARVs. Adults and children receiving antiretroviral combination therapy in project
target areas reached 1,719 (1,624 adults and 95 children), largely exceeding the initial target of 1,300
(by 132 percent) (revised PDO Indicator 2). CNLS reports that the nationwide ARV coverage
between 2006 and 2011 was at 14,405 in total (13,703 adults and 702 children), with the project
contribution represent about 12 percent of the overall coverage. The CNLS further estimates that the
total number of effective patients needing ARV treatment is about 36,000 nationwide 16, which means
that about 40 percent of people needing treatment were on ARVs. Furthermore, until 2008, ARV
treatment was only provided in Bangui and in some provincial sites. Decentralization in real terms
occurred from 2009 with GFATM intervention, but was still limited to large cities at prefecture levels,
whereas PSES contributed to extending this to subprefecture levels.

55.      Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT). The number of men and women who accepted
VCT and received test results in the target health centers was 118,862 against a final target of 200,000
(partially achieved at 59.4 percent) (revised PDO Indicator 1). The low target achievement could be
explained by delays in the delivery of tests and consumables; the last lot has been distributed after
project closure. This number is therefore projected to increase substantially upon availability of final
results. Still, the CNLS reports the total number of persons tested and received their results nationwide
at 86,149 between 2006 and 2009, 17 meaning that the PSES contribution to the result is significant.
The number of youths who accepted VCT and received their test results through mobilization by youth
associations reached 69,427 persons against a target of 56,824 (122.2 percent achievement rate); this
was made possible as a result of project’s support to 85 HIV action plans submitted by youth
associations focusing on behavioral changes and promotion of VCT among youth (revised
Intermediate Outcome Indicator 5). 18
56.      The social and health benefits created by the project through support to PLWHA associations
cannot be underestimated. PSES financed a total of 35 action plans 19 for PLWHA associations, mainly
to support income-generating activities through construction and management of mini-motels,
restaurants and warehouses by PLWHA. As a result, the number of PLWHA receiving support through
their associations or their national federation of associations reached 14,004, largely surpassing the
initial target of 7,200 (194.5 percent achievement rate) (revised PDO Indicator 3). Although an end-

in the end only reached 35 associations due to the unavailability of competent youth associations.
19
   31 PSES sites and 4 GFATM sites. Four of these sites were not operational for security reasons, bad management,
conflicts between association members, and also because of the absence of follow up.

                                                                     29
project evaluation on behavioral changes was not conducted, the project contributed to reduction of
stigma and discrimination against HIV/AIDS, as observed by the large number of people accepting
VCTs and the frequency of PLWHA-run restaurant and mini-motels in use.
57.     Blood Transfusion. The number of blood transfusion pockets tested for HIV and other blood-
borne infections in targeted health centers reached 27,944 against a target of 32,000 (revised
Intermediate Outcome Indicator 2). As delivery of the final lot of inputs only happened after project
closure, this figure is expected to increase to the target level. The UNGASS report indicates that the
proportion of transfused blood tested for HIV was at 75.6 percent in 2006 but increased to 84.2 percent
in 2009, almost close to a target of 85 percent by the end of 2009. PSES was practically the only
financing source for provision of blood pockets, tests, and consumables for blood transfusion during
the project period, along with a modest contribution by the government. The collection and testing of
37,990 blood pockets for HIV, hepatitis and syphilis at the National Blood Transfusion Center (CNTS)
between 2006 and 2010 is one of the major contributions of PSES; however, actual needs exceed these
figures. 20

Revised PDO 2: Contribute to meet urgent social needs, such as prevention of malaria, increased
access to water supply and improved primary education
Outcome 2: Increased adoption of preventive measures against malaria
58.     The project distributed 100,000 ITNs as part of the national mass distribution campaign,
significantly below the initial target of 300,000 ITNs (revised PDO Indicator 4). The issue of non-
compliance with technical standards of the second lot of 266,000 ITNs (that were purchased but could
not be distributed) affected negatively the outcomes. Nevertheless, considering that the overall needs
of ITNs estimated by the MoPH are one million in CAR, the project contributed approximately 10% of
the total need. In addition, sensitization activities and training of animators and distributors supported
by the project contributed in an indirect way to the government’s effort in universal bednet coverage 21.
Outcome #3: Increased access to water supply
59.     Overall, access to drinking water improved during the project implementation period: 67
percent in 2010 (MICS 4) compared to 52 percent in 2006 (MICS 3). Under the project, a total of 101
improved community water sources were built in various forms as part of community microprojects
(revised Intermediate Outcome Indicator 7). 22 As a result, people with access to improved water
sources in the project target areas increased from 7,200 to 30,300 against a target of 19,800, with a 144
percent achievement rate (revised PDO indicator 5). 23 While number of new water points built was
not significant, the project’s significant contribution was the reduction of broken pumps by 10-15
percent at the country level, substantially contributing to improvements in access to water supply, as
reflected in MICS. Furthermore, all the newly constructed water points were in rural areas and


20
   Average production of CNTS is at 6,000 pockets of secured blood per year, representing only 19.6 percent of the
country’s needs.
21
   Nationwide, recent efforts supported by other partners including GFATM, UNICEF and UNITAID have brought overall
progress to universal bed net coverage in CAR. When we compare the MICS 3 (2006) and MICS 4 (2010), children under-
five sleeping under ITN increased from 16% to 36%. Similarly, households possessing at least one ITN increased from
16% to 47%. The figures are much higher in an impact evaluation study carried out in February 2010 under the context of
Roll Back Malaria, which concluded that 70.5% of children under-five and 91.0% of pregnant women who received PNC
slept under an ITN the night before, and 72.1% of households had at least one ITN.
22
   Initially, an indicator measuring the area drained of standing water and marshlands identified by the population was
included as a way to reduce the cause of malaria transmission at the community level, but it was dropped as water drainage
was not prioritized under the community microprojects due to budget limitations.

Outcome 4: Improved primary education
60.      The project served to maintain some level of educational service at a decentralized level,
particularly in the post-war period when there were practically no schools open in rural areas. The
project recruited, trained and deployed a total of 1,023 apprentice teachers to rural areas, far exceeding
the initial target of 850 teachers (PDO Indicator 6). The project also supplied educational materials in
a short period of time, doubling the distribution of French and math textbooks, from an initially
planned 44,625 to 89,250.
61.      An annual sector review conducted in May 2012 highlighted the remarkable contribution made
by PSES in improving the quality of primary education, particularly at a time when other major
financing was nonexistent. This is proven by: (i) the sharp decline in the pupil-teacher ratio in the
targeted zones; and (ii) the decline in the French textbook to pupil ratio from 7:1 in 2008 to 1.3:1 in
2011, as well as the math textbook to pupils ratio from 6.4:1 in 2008 to 1.4:1 in 2011 (Intermediate
Outcome Indicator 9). The proportion of parent teachers, generally very high for primary schools,
decreased from 56.6 percent in 2008 to 42.8 percent in 2011, reflecting the increased availability of
formally trained teachers. Nationwide primary school attendance for children aged 6 to 11 years old
increased from 51.4 percent in 2006 (MICS 3) to 73.3 percent in 2010 (MICS 4). 24

62.      Summary of Efficacy Rating. Based on the above analysis, the project’s efficacy is rated
Substantial under the revised PDOs, given that: (i) five of the seven revised PDO indicators achieved
their targets, with one of the remaining likely to be achieved upon completion of final inputs delivery;
and (ii) national level data show a progressive improvement in HIV-related service availability and
utilization. In addition to the direct benefits, these achievements paved the way for other partners to
continue and expand the work on HIV/AIDS and health programs. Details on the indicators are
available in Section F of the Data Sheet.




                                                                   31
3.3 Efficiency.
63.       Neither the original PAD nor the Restructuring Paper calculated the net present value (NPV)
or the economic rate of return (ERR) of any of the relevant sectors. The Implementation and
Completion Results (ICR) guidelines indicate that in the absence of NPV or ERR estimate; project
efficiency will be measured using any other appropriate cost-effectiveness criteria to determine
whether the project represented the expected least-cost solution to attain identified and measurable
benefits.
64.      HIV/AIDS component. The Restructuring Paper refer to the economic analysis of HIV/AIDS
in Africa and provide an impact assessment on prevention, access to testing, care and treatment, as
well as a cost-benefit analysis of HIV/AIDS interventions, carried out under the MAP. In summary, the
project: (i) intervened in areas where it was proven to be most cost-effective for sub-Saharan Africa,
namely PMTCT and blood safety (as per a study that measured cost effectiveness of different
HIV/AIDS interventions and their impact) 25; (ii) made a significant contribution in leveraging external
support; and (iii) was built on a good coordination mechanism with other development partners, thus
avoiding duplication, especially since other donor funds for HIV/AIDS were also channeled through
CNLS-TS. In addition, while donor support has steadily increased over the years, this support was
mainly aimed at funding improved access to care and treatment for PLWHA, support to orphans and
prevention (mainly provision of condoms), but only in the country’s capital. The project’s focus on
prevention, especially in rural areas, helped reduce infection rates in these areas.
65.      The target under the restructured phase focused on specific groups in selected sites where a
comprehensive package of interventions encompassing VCT, PMTCT, blood safety programs and
ARV treatment was implemented. Intervention sites were organized around a health facility at
subprefectural levels and each site funded CSO activities through youth associations and PLWHA
associations, accompanied by an NGO to provide technical support. The integrated approach allowed
for: (i) reduction in costs associated with supervision, monitoring and reporting; (ii) synergies among
different interventions by PLWHA and youth associations, NGOs and health facilities, from
sensitization, close monitoring of identified patients and availability of treatment. In addition,
integrated supervision missions which were frequently conducted bringing together all technical
expertise (CNLS-TS, ministry representatives, FMPU-PSES, as well as Central Drug Procurement
Unit or Unité de céssion de médicaments, UCM) had some unforeseen benefits, such as ensuring direct
delivery of drugs and inputs to end beneficiaries, avoiding stock-outs and monitoring patients under
treatment. In addition, these missions served as a platform to enhance technical, financial and
managerial capacity at decentralized levels through coaching and capacity building.
66.      Health component. The project prioritized what is considered to be one of the most cost-
effective interventions for malaria control: prevention via use of ITNs by children under-five and
pregnant women. Evidence from other African countries also suggests that investing in mosquito nets,
if accompanied by adequate distribution and training, provides a high return in terms of reduction in
prevalence. The second lot of ITNs was not distributed as planned for reasons mentioned earlier which
decreases the efficiency of this component. However, considering that: (i) the total amount disbursed
for this acquisition (about US$1 million out of a total US$17 million, at unit cost of US$4 per net) was
relatively modest; and (ii) other activities envisaged under this component, including training of
distributors as well as provision of health equipment to health facilities, were conducted as foreseen to
complement other ITNs procured by different partners, this shortcoming could be considered as
modest.

67.      The project conducted a technical audit for the community microprojects in December 2010.
While this evaluation did not sufficiently address the economic efficiency of intervention, it
highlighted some positive points: (i) the pertinence of the community participatory approach in
enhancing ownership of the beneficiaries and raising their awareness in improving primary health care;
(ii) the progressive extension of intervention zones allowed for a better learning-by-doing experience;
and (iii) involvement of NGOs to accompany the process and provide technical support. In addition,
the repair of the existing water pumps was a highly efficient intervention as it substantially increased
water access to rural population with lower costs than building new points
68.      Education component. The economic analysis of the education sector was underpinned by the
results contained in the RESEN, which concludes that increasing the supply of schooling materials, the
availability of teachers, and reduction in in-class training period in favor of on-the-job training, were
cost-effective interventions. The extent to which the project addressed the most effective and efficient
interventions for the education component can be derived from the significant cost savings made in
2008 to achieve the intended results, which led to a doubling of the number of textbooks purchased and
a significant increase (by approximately 120 percent) of teachers recruited under the project.

69.     Based on the discussions above, efficiency in achieving the PDOs is rated Substantial for the
restructured PDO.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome
70.     Appendix B. of the ICR Guidelines 26 mentions that project outcomes are assessed against both
original and revised project objectives, weighting pre-and post-revision performance by the share of
actual loan disbursements before and after the revision took place. In view of the fact that: (i) the
project became effective only after the 2007 restructuring; and (ii) there was no disbursement prior to
this phase, except for PPF which essentially supported the preparation of the restructured phase,
assessment of project outcomes will focus on the post-restructuring phase under the revised PDO.
Based on the above discussion, the overall outcome rating for the project is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
71.     From the outset, the project included a strong gender and a poverty dimension because: (i) there
is clearly a feminization of the epidemic, as evidenced by studies conducted prior to and during the life
time of the project (e.g. MICS 2006 found that the HIV prevalence rate among young women aged 15-
19 were three times higher than for men in the same age group); and (ii) results of the social
assessment conducted at the project preparation stage concluded that women and girls are more
susceptible to HIV/AIDS and are more likely to be subject to sexual abuse, other forms of violence,
and were vulnerable to stigmas and social exclusion. Prevention and treatment activities therefore
placed a strong focus on PMTCT, encouraging pregnant women’s VCT through support groups.
72.     Addressing the poverty dimension was boosted by the project’s focus on decentralization and
support for rural areas. Studies have proven that rural areas (where historically government support is
much less likely to reach) have a much higher poverty rate. Both the original project, as well as the
restructured one, saw a significant portion of their funds allocated to local initiatives through CSOs and
community groups in order to stimulate responses at community levels. This contributed to developing
the capacity of CSOs and communities, as well as multisectoral activity integration at the decentralized

                                                      33
level. Additionally, income-generating activities appeared to have played a role in supporting poverty
reduction although their real impact is difficult to assess in the absence of any documentation.
73.     The project also demonstrated the importance of focusing on socially marginalized groups and
at-risk populations through its support for militaries and vulnerable groups, including orphans, women
and the handicapped and youth. Similarly, distribution of malaria nets followed the national protocol of
targeting children under-five and pregnant women.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
74.     The project made a significant contribution to institutional change and strengthening
particularly in the following areas:
• The CNLS strengthened its coordinating capacity at the national level, with the TS-CNLS
    managing other donor-funded HIV projects. Prefectural coordination bodies (CPLS) were
    established in 16 prefectures integrating local-level actors. The government will, in principle, take
    over the operational costs for the CNLS and CPLS functions to keep the minimum capacity in
    place until other funding is made available.
• The project, through its implementation committee (CMO) successfully built a platform to work
    with a wide range of public institutions to: (i) promote a multisectoral response to HIV/AIDS and
    other urgent social needs; (ii) decentralize responsibilities to implement activities at each sector
    levels; and (iii) strengthen civil society and community capacities to improve results at regional
    and local levels.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
75.     A beneficiary assessment was not organized prior to the project nor upon completion of the
project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
76.     The risk to the development outcome is considered to be moderate. Politically, the project
created a common platform for an intersectoral dialogue and gained strong support at the highest levels
of government. The implementation strategy remains fully aligned with current national and sectoral
strategies. Institutionally, the project contributed to establishing an institutional mechanism for a
multisectoral response. An oversight function by the CMO, despite its initial challenges, certainly
helped address bottlenecks in project implementation and coordination among different sectors.
77.     Certain potential risks still exist, although efforts have been made to mitigate them. First,
deterioration in the security situation, although a largely exogenous risk, may adversely impact the
continued sustainability of the project’s achievements. Second, capacity constraints on actors at
decentralized levels (NGOs, CSOs and health facilities) have been partially mitigated through
integrated supervision missions and technical assistance, but experience shows that some level of
continued financial support is critical to the viability of appropriate capacity building activities. Third,
suitable financing levels to sustain service delivery poses a risk but significant effort has been made on
this aspect, as seen in the development of various sector-specific successor projects.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
78.      Despite the long period of project suspension due to issues related to the country's arrears, the
Bank continued to support activities through the PPF and Trust Funds, all the while ensuring a constant
dialogue with the client to the extent possible. Such critical support enabled the country to establish
sufficient grounds and strengthen its institutional basis, leading to the mobilization of significant grant
resources from other donors. These are well documented in the aide-memoires and ISRs. The Bank
task team should also be credited for the restructured project preparation in a very limited timeframe as
soon as the suspension was lifted, as seen in the support for the government’s prompt compliance with
all the effectiveness conditions.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
79.      There were a total of five Task Team Leaders (TTLs) throughout the project life. The Bank
team conducted regular supervision missions and generally managed to address project challenges in
proactive manner. Despite the physical absence of TTL in-country on a permanent basis, the
authorities interviewed during the ICR mission expressed their satisfaction with the Bank’s technical
and operational contribution to the project.
80.      The Bank team was notably responsive in adapting to changes in the implementation
environment as evidenced in actions taken during the suspension period, the major restructuring in
2007, and subsequent modifications to the results framework and budget reallocation. In order to
enhance the quality of each component, specific independent reviews were conducted for component 1
(HIV/AIDS), component 2b (community microprojects) and component 4 (project coordination).
81.      Aide-memoires and ISRs in most cases were well documented and provided a thorough
analysis of the challenges and corrective measures to improve project performance. FM and
procurement supervision were conducted on a regular basis conjointly during the project supervision
missions and recommendations delivered on fiduciary points were pertinent. Among the somewhat
weaker points were: (i) the large fluctuation in ISR ratings and in some cases overrated (e.g.
procurement remained Satisfactory after the quality of the second lot of ITNs was known); and (ii) a
strong focus on process and fiduciary issues but a somewhat weak focus on project outcomes, as
measured by indicators until later stage of project implementation.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
82.     Bank performance in supporting the government to address urgent needs in its fight against
HIV/AIDS, as well as other urgent social needs, is rated Moderately Satisfactory given the
Satisfactory rating on one dimension (quality at entry) and a Moderately Satisfactory rating on the
other dimension (quality of supervision).

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
83.    Overall, when considering the post-crisis environment and a weakly functioning government,
the borrower’s strong commitment to achieving the project’s development objectives should be
acknowledged. The government is particularly commended for: (i) operating in a concerted manner to
bring together all concerned actors and enhancing collaboration between different sectors; (ii) its

                                                    35
promptness in establishing the necessary institutional structures, as seen in the creation of CMO, 27
FMPU and prefectural bodies of CNLS and their technical team; and (iii) CMO’s eventual leadership
in its oversight functions and commitment to achieving results. 28
84.      Less emphasis was put on the follow-up of initial strategic orientations adopted in the PAD or
Restructuring Paper. For example, the strengthened capacity of the UCM to provide pharmaceutical
products was an important result expected by CNLS to enhance integration and complementarity of all
partners financing HIV/AIDS activities, but this was limited to informal collaboration between UCM
and CNLS without any systematic follow-up. Similarly, the government’s initial commitment to
establishing an autonomous CSO financing agency within the government to manage different partner
contributions for community projects failed to result in any material action.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
85.      The implementation challenges encountered early on included: (i) a measure of confusion in
the division of responsibilities between certain entities given the large number of actors involved; (ii)
weak ownership of M&E prior to the arrival of the PSES project coordinator; and (iii) delays in
disbursement. A large number (some more than others) of these challenges were later addressed during
the project implementation stage. A summary assessment of the various implementing agencies
involved can be found below.
• CNLS-TS. Throughout the project, the CNLS-TS functioned autonomously with strong technical
     capacity of key personnel, 29 which facilitated its management of different HIV/AIDS programs.
     Regular integrated supervision missions comprising CNLS-TS, UCM, and sectoral ministries
     allowed for immediate response to addressing implementation bottlenecks, as well as close
     monitoring of inputs reaching the end-beneficiaries. Some challenges to future sustainability
     include: (i) ensuring patients under treatment be absorbed by GFATM or other programs; (ii)
     continuation of income-generating activities at local levels in order to ensure some profitability and
     durability; and (iii) maintaining key personnel and operational functions of CNLS and CPLS.
• FMPU-PSES. In the beginning FMPU experienced an absence of leadership, which hampered the
     coordination of the different sectors involved. To a large extent the arrival of the PSES project
     coordinator addressed these bottlenecks and performance improved significantly towards the end
     of the project. This also led to enhanced learning from lessons and better coordination among the
     fiduciary staff and sector focal points, resulting in the government’s decision to keep the core
     FMPU-PSES team for implementation of the successor IDA/HRITF co-financed health project.
• Cellule Provisoire de Financement aux Organisations de la Societé Civile (CPFOSC). A Unit
     to manage CSO activities was created under direct supervision of the CMO with the purpose of
     channeling funds to community initiatives and providing them with technical support. Overall,
     while the subcomponent absorbed a large portion of project funds, CPFOSC managed to keep a
     small team with: (i) one technical staff responsible for reviewing, approving and ensuring quality
     of the proposals submitted, overseeing implementation and monitoring results; and (ii) FM staff
     responsible for FM and disbursement of the component, while benefiting from technical expertise
     of Directorates and ministries. The main challenge was that there was no civil engineer on the team


27
   The CMO was created by a government decree in February 2007 and was presided by the Ministry of Planning and
Economy.
28
   While development of action plans and budget and their submission for Bank approval was the responsibility of CMO,
the DCA in its Annex 2 1A1(c) and 1A2 (implementation arrangement) stipulated that this responsibility was assumed by
CNLS. This inconsistency was never corrected.
29
   The original team was replaced with a stronger team with adequate technical expertise after a negative assessment by the
GFATM led to the suspension of funds in 2009.

                                                            36
    despite the amount of civil works involved, contributing in some cases to the modest quality of
    these works. The CPFOSC later recruited a civil engineer and also enhanced collaboration with the
    DGH and Ministry of Environment for their technical support.
• Ministry of Health. The initial confusion in the leadership role in coordinating the health
    component stemmed from the dual responsibilities of the MoHP Planning Department Director as
    member of the CMO and at the same time play the role as a focal point coordinating the health
    component. This was later resolved when the Chief of Malaria Services was brought in to
    coordinate the health component and the Director of the Planning Department continued to assume
    his role as member of the CMO.
• Sectoral ministries. Sectoral ministries receiving support on the HIV/AIDS component generally
    operated autonomously and were able to produce results exceeding their initial plans despite
    modest financing. One shortcoming, however, was in regards to accountability, as public sector
    responses under the HIV/AIDS component relied on budget transfers by the CNLS-TS, which in
    some cases saw delays and consequently affected their implementation.
(c) Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
86.     The rating for Overall Borrower Performance is Moderately Satisfactory given the same
Moderately Satisfactory rating for both government performance and implementing agency or
agencies performance.

6. Lessons Learned
87.     Strong ownership and the commitment of key actors could leverage significant funding and
ensure continuity in the government and partner efforts even under circumstances that do not allow
for normal operation. The case of CAR demonstrated this in two ways. First, the project faced more
than five years of suspension before effectiveness but the government was still able to make full use of
project advances and Trust Funds that were exceptionally granted to strengthen its institutional
capacity, and as a result, leveraged large amount of resources from different partners. Second, once the
decision on re-engagement was made, the World Bank team and the government moved swiftly with
the project preparation capitalizing on what had been built in the preceding years, while adjusting the
design and implementation mechanism to meet the actual needs.
88.     A strategy shift in 2007 from a single HIV/AIDS operation to a multifaceted one
encompassing broader social sectors promoted a higher response to needs in diverse areas. In
addition, synergies were created to ensure efficient use of resources. Combining different sectors in
one project helped the government tackle immediate needs; and allowed to use this opportunity to gain
some time until subsequent sector-specific projects with larger development impact could be
developed. This approach could potentially be used in similar fragile and complex situation.
89.     A clear, well-defined institutional arrangement from the outset is crucial to achieving
optimal results in a multisectoral operation. Stakeholders agreed that part of the initial
implementation delays were caused by ambiguity in their division of roles and responsibilities, given
the complexity of the project set-up and the numerous parties involved. This was addressed later by a
clearer separation of functions between strategic direction (CMO) and operations (FMPU) and
ensuring leadership on either side. In addition, this experience is a reminder that the clarity of
accountability mechanisms needs to be guaranteed in order to set a firm results-oriented focus. For
example, centralization of fiduciary responsibilities helped to reduce transaction costs related to
procurement of key inputs, but this was achieved at the cost of accountability challenges between the
technical actors and fiduciary colleagues. The economy of scale argument therefore needs to be
carefully examined in this particular context.


                                                  37
90.      Some of project’s creative approaches for fiduciary arrangements could provide important
lessons in a context of political instability and post-conflict situations. For example, the fiduciary
system was organized in such a way as to ensure that money could be channeled to areas that are
remote and difficult to access, through use of intermediaries in semi-informal sectors. In addition, the
project used the regular integrated supervision missions for the HIV/AIDS component as a way to
deliver inputs directly to the end-beneficiaries (rather than using a transporter), while at the same time
ensuring close monitoring of stocks and patients on treatment, and coaching health personnel. These
approaches helped address some of the logistic challenges in post-conflict situations.
91.      Use of CSOs needs to be accompanied by a realistic capacity assessment and support for
capacity strengthening. The project underscored the great benefits of civil society involvement and
empowerment of communities in responding to their own needs and reaching out to the most remote
areas; however, adequate technical capacity of these organizations needs to be ensured. The project
initially envisioned ‘competitive’ contracting for associations and community groups but the shortage
of competent organizations resulted in large variations in their performance. As the technical level of
local supporting NGOs is a determining factor to ensure an effective implementation of community
activities in a low capacity context, it is important to identify champions, as well as involve partners in
the design and implementation. The experience also exemplified the critical need to link payment with
performance, based on a predefined set of indicators, in order to hold the parties accountable for their
results.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
92.     A debriefing meeting was held on the final day of the ICR mission; the Task team, Borrower,
and other parties involved in project implementation participated in this meeting and agreed on the
results of the indicators reported in the data sheet. In cases where some of the key inputs had not been
fully distributed, 30 the Borrower agreed to provide updated data on the key indicators upon final
completion of these deliveries. A summary of the Borrower’s final evaluation report is presented in
Annex 7. The report takes into account the views of other partners and stakeholders (e.g. NGOs and
civil society) through extensive discussions and field visits that were carried out.




30
  The Bank had earlier reached an agreement with the Borrower to exceptionally allow for completion of the final
distribution by June 30, 2012.

Ministry of National Defense
   • Sensitization campaigns for military camps in Bouar and Bangui (flyers, condoms, animators).
   • Organization of VCT campaigns in military camps at Moungomba, Bambari and Bossangoa.
  • Provision of treatment for OIs and psychosocial support.
  • Support to PLWHA association ‘PLWHA in uniform’ (income-generating activity).
   • Support for the implementation of action plans and supervision by the ministry.
   • Training of 28 pair trainers.
     •   In total, the project reached a total of 6,845 military personnel and their families in the targeted
         military camps; 580 of whom were found to be HIV positive, reflecting an alarmingly high
         rate of infection (approximately 12 percent). Similarly, a total of 1,144 people working in non-
         military jobs within the ministry were tested. About 8 percent of those tested were found to be
         HIV positive. The primary project contribution in this particular context was the creation of a
         PLWHA association of military personnel to support income-generating activity.




31
 Some of the possible reasons for low achievement including: (i) locating PSES sites in small remote towns, whereas most
most teachers live in large cities; and (ii) frequent stock-out of inputs.

Ministry of Public Services
   • Organization of a 7-week VCT campaign in Bangui.
   • Support to VCT campaigns in nine decentralized structures.
   • Distribution of condoms (male and females).
   • Creation of six selling points for condoms in ministerial departments.
   • Provision of treatment for OIs and psychosocial support.
   • Organization of strategic meetings with different ministry focal points.
   • Support for the implementation of action plans and supervision by the ministry.
   • A total of 9,633 people were sensitized; 8,516 of whom were tested. Of those tested, 18 men
      and 12 women received treatment.
   • While data for 2008 was not available, a high rate of testing (sensitization campaigns reached
      88 percent of the population) was probably due to a strategic shift after the first year from the
      distribution of vouchers to on-site testing where results could be obtained on the spot. However,
      treatment coverage remains low (14 percent of those were found to be seropositive) as a result
      of insufficient inputs and the fear of stigma, especially among high-level officials. 32

HIV/AIDS component.

The economic analysis of HIV/AIDS in Africa carried out under the MAP provides an assessment of
the impact of prevention, access to testing, care and treatment, as well as a cost-benefit analysis of
HIV/AIDS interventions in general. It concludes that: (i) reduction of AIDS-related deaths would
increase the growth of GDP, and (ii) HIV/AIDS reduces the value of physical, human and social
capital. However, in the absence of a project-specific analysis, project efficiency before/after, and
with/without comparisons could not be measured.
A study that measured the cost-effectiveness of different interventions and their impact 33 (by
measuring the cost per infection averted) concluded that PMTCT and blood safety are among the most
cost-effective interventions for sub-Saharan Africa, whereas VCT is relatively less cost effective.
However, as this project exemplifies, the study alludes to greatly enhanced cost-efficiency when
utilizing a package of mutually supportive and complementary interventions, given the cost savings
associated with supervision, delivery of inputs and training of personnel.

IEG suggests other criteria for assessing the benefits of MAPs, including: (i) enhanced political commitment to
controlling the epidemic; (ii) expanded and strengthened national and subnational AIDS institutions to address
the long-run response; (iii) mobilization of NGOs in the national response and reinforcement of their capacity to
provide access to prevention and care among the high-risk groups most likely to contract and spread the
infection; and (iv) enhanced the efficiency of national AIDS programs. The analysis provided in this report
demonstrates that PSES has contributed to all these criteria, although the scale of this contribution remains
modest.

Malaria: The economic analysis on malaria has been made in the context of regional and sub-regional
studies. Macroeconomic projections 34 show that the impact of malaria on productivity of workers and
on external investments into endemic countries i s major and has a deleterious impact on growth and
poverty reduction strategies. It is estimated that malaria reduces GDP growth by approximately one
full percentage point per year. The poor are affected most as they have less access to medical services,
information and protective measures, and less opportunity to avoid living or working in malaria-
affected areas. In fact, poor populations are at greatest risk; 58 percent of the cases occur in the poorest
20 percent of the world's population, and these patients receive the worst care and have catastrophic
economic consequences from their illness.
Emergency community-based microprojects: An independent evaluation of the community
microproject conducted in December 2010, while not sufficiently addressing the economic efficiency
of interventions, acknowledges the important contribution and strategic relevance of this
subcomponent, especially with regard to: (i) the design and strategies adopted in this component
address the nature of the problems, i.e. improving the health situation of the population and addressing
urgent needs through a participatory process benefiting from support by NGOs; (ii) the project
successfully stimulated the interest of the rural population as well as community awareness of the need
to improve primary health care; (iii) access to basic health needs and water supply were significantly
improved under the project; and (iv) a positive collaboration was maintained between the PSES,
supporting NGOs and relevant ministries (MoHP, DGH and DSC).

Education Component
The economic analysis of the education sector draws on the economic analysis conducted under the
Country Status Report in Education (RESEN), which concludes that in CAR increasing the supply of
schooling materials along with the availability of teachers and of their services, as well as a reduction
in their in-class training period in favor of on-the-job training, were cost-effective interventions.

Annex 5. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

Evaluation Context. The Borrower’s final report on the Multisectoral HIV/AIDS, Health and
Education Project (PSES) submitted in June 2012 has three main parts: (i) project design and
preparation; (ii) project implementation; and (iii) lessons learned and recommendations. The report
was based on extensive consultation with all actors involved, focusing on achievement of project
objectives, performance evaluation of the parties concerned and main factors affecting the project
results. The evaluation also intended to reflect the lessons learnt from the project to inform future
operations in CAR.

Project design and preparation.
The report confirms that project development objective (PDO) ensures a multisectoral dimension to
address the urgent needs in social sectors and to support implementation of the government’s Political,
Economic and Social Framework (2006-2008). It further builds on directions of the Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (2008-2010) and the National HIV/AIDS Framework 2006-2010. The report also
stresses the collaborative aspect of project preparation, i.e. that the activities to be supported were
identified through a common agreement between the Bank and different ministry authorities.
The report highlights a weak focus on results in the project design, as lack of data availability and
inexistence of a baseline study resulted in poor monitoring of project performance. However, the
strategies retained to achieve projected results are in conformity with the following ongoing sectoral
policies and strategies: (i) three of the main elements of the HIV component are aligned with the
National HIV/AIDS Framework 2006-2010; (ii) strategic orientations for the health component
(support to fight against malaria through ITN distribution, improvement of urgent service equipment at
health facility level; and community microprojects through improved access to water and rehabilitation
of health posts and health facilities) are aligned with the Second Generation Strategic Plan to fight
against malaria (2007-2010). Similarly, the National Health Development Plan (2006-2015) envisages
strengthening of the country’s institutional framework; and (iii) education component activities to
improve school material provision and increase number of teachers reflect the national education
sector strategy (2008-2020).
The four separate components, each focusing on a specific sector, allowed for a clear separation of
expected results and clear lines of accountability. However, the institutional set-up (with many actors
involved in a multisectoral undertaking) was complex for an emergency project being implemented
under weak institutional capacity.

Implementation
Performance during the start-up phase was judged to be satisfactory given that effectiveness conditions
were quickly met and activities on the ground started four months after effectiveness. However, there
were some shortcomings in the quality of certain processes, notably in: (i) the absence of a formal text
for the creation of FMPU-PSES and CPFOSC resulting in lack of clarity in the manner they were
organized and their respective roles ; (ii) the nomination of CMO members did not respect the
responsibilities as defined in the execution manual, as seen in the case of MoHP Planning Department
and Resource Management Directorate of Ministry of Education who acted as both a CMO member
and technical focal point for the component ; these roles should have been separated and assumed by
different individuals or entities.

Performance by component
Component 1. The component’s modest disbursement rate of 73 percent is explained by the fact that,
until 2009, the component suffered from : (i) reselection of intervention zones to accommodate new
partner interventions (GFATM); and (ii) procurement delays of key inputs (drugs, test and
consumables) that hampered activities on the ground. However, the PSES experience proved its
efficacy with regard to the VCT approach, notably contributing to mitigation of stigma through
advanced mobile strategies. Integrated supervision missions conducted under this component also
contributed to strengthening of local level capacities and performance improvement.
Component 2. This component initially suffered from a lack of clarity in its institutional set-up. The
DEP Director was nominated as a member of the CMO (responsible for strategic coordination and
oversight) but also had to assume a role as a focal point for the health component (supervision,
technical coordination and M&E), resulting in a conflict of interest. The Head of Services for Malaria
eventually took over the role of health focal point but did not have the capacity to oversee the activities
related to other activities under this component (e.g. community microprojects, strengthening health
facility capacities). This lack of leadership resulted in a conflict of responsibilities between some
entities. As regards disbursement, this component had the largest financing with 106 percent of
realization, with stable disbursement from 2008 to 2011. However, procurement suffered from
deficiencies particularly with regard to non-conformity of ITNs, which meant that it was not possible
to distribute two-thirds of total purchases of ITNs.
Component 3. The institutional arrangement for the education component did not respect the
execution manual, notably with respect to the establishment of a small FM Unit within the Ministry of
Education. Accordingly, FM for this component relied on PSES PIU. Budget execution rate was 96
percent, with almost the entire amount disbursed in the first two years, thereby allowing for a smooth
transition to the successor education project in the third year of the project. The component also
contributed to a significant increase in the number of teachers.
Component 4. The recruitment of a Project Manager in late 2009 led to an improvement in project
performance and addressed the issue of leadership. Budget disbursement was 100 percent at project
closure but the initial allocation constituted a mere 8 percent of total effective disbursement, and 89
percent of total disbursement came from non-allocated budgetary resources. Some activities foreseen
under this project were not carried out, e.g. an impact evaluation to inform the total number of project
beneficiaries.
Principal Findings.
• Project design should reflect an appropriate institutional framework with necessary functions for
   project implementation and allow for interaction between in order to create optimal conditions for
   project execution.
• Strategic monitoring should be separated from operational monitoring. It should also ensure that
   ownership of those involved in providing strategic orientations.
• VCT strategy proved effective and should be continued with GFATM support. Similarly, effective
   supervision through integrated supervision missions bringing together various competencies in
   intervention zones proved to be successful in enhancing project efficiency.
• Strategies for maintaining project gains should be considered during the project appraisal/
   implementation stage. Addressing these issues at project closure is problematic as time constraints
   make it difficult to develop an action plan, or there may be insufficient financial resources, or that
   actors may not be sufficiently motivated as they were not involved in project execution.


                                                    51
•   The PSES experience confirmed that insufficient knowledge on procurement processes negatively
    impacted project performance.

Recommendations.
• Consolidation of project gains requires certain measures at the level of ministries and services
   concerned, notably : (i) survey on the efficacy of ITN utilization ; (ii) final evaluation of
   community microprojects ; (iii) effective integration of contracted teachers in the public services;
   (iv) technical support to ensure sustainability of water points and other works conducted under
   PSES; (v) evaluation on the profitability and sustainability of income-generating activities
   (PLWHA ); and (vi) reinforcing integrated supervision missions.
• The Ministry of Planning will prepare guidelines that will help capitalize on and disseminate
   lessons learnt during the implementation of different public lending projects. For that, it is crucial
   that the ICRs of various projects are systematically made available and experiences are widely
   shared. This will bring additional value to improving the efficacy of international aid.
• The World Bank is requested to support the MoHP Community Health Directorate (DSC) in their
   consolidation of community microproject activities and also support the Ministry of Planning in the
   establishment of a mechanism to promote and capitalize the lessons learnt.
