                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project was approved on December 14, 2001. Soon after the approval (February 2002), CAR went into arrears which were cleared in November 2006. After the Bank’s re-
                         engagement, the closing date was extended in two stages: (i) for one year (from June 30, 2006 to June 30, 2007) to allow for a restructuring of the project, and (ii) for three years
                         (from June 30, 2007 to September 30, 2010) once the project was restructured and the PDO was revised in June 2007. The project only became effective in September 2007 and the
                         closing date was set to September 30, 2010. The restructuring changed the project’s exclusive focus on HIV/AIDS to enable it to also respond to new emergencies resulting from civil
                         disturbances and other developments since the original project was designed and approved. Between 2007 and 2010, project implementation improved and the closing date was
                         extended a third time from September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2012 in order to allow for: (i) the health component activities to be completed, (ii) the extension of HIV/AIDS activities to
                         rural areas, and (iii) the identification and implementation of community sub-projects, which were proved to be more complex and time-consuming than planned. Between 2007 and
                         2012, disbursement increased from close to 0% to almost 95%, and the majority of indicators that remain (many have been dropped during the two restructurings) are close to, or
                         have even surpassed, 100% of their target objectives. Despite the specific context of CAR and its status as a fragile state, the project has made substantial progress.

                         Contributions to positive impacts in education and health: The project has contributed to strengthening primary education in rural areas through increasing the number and quality of
                         school teachers, as well as improving access to school textbooks. Within the health sector, the project has contributing substantially to mitigating the impact of HIV/AIDS through
                         providing support to 7,513 people living with HIV/AIDS, improving access and utilization of voluntary counseling and testing (118,862 pregnant women), expanding coverage of
                         antiretroviral combination therapy to 3,616 persons, and significantly expanding coverage for prevention of mother to child transmission in the last 12 months at targeted health
                         centers (27,355). The project has also contributed to increasing coverage of insecticide treated bed nets (100,000 bed nets distributed) and access to potable water to 28,500
                         individuals. Finally, the project has contributed to additional technical assistance through support to the production of the Health Sector Country Status Report and two large-scale
                         health facility surveys.

                         Most of the project’s objectives were achieved efficiently and were responsive to the country’s urgent needs within the health (in particular HIV/AIDS) and education sectors. After
                         restructuring in 2007, disbursement increased substantially and even surpassed the revised disbursement estimates. The project remains particularly relevant to the country’s
                         development priorities and the Bank’s HNP Africa strategy as it has significantly contributed to expanding coverage and utilization of high impact health services through pro-poor
                         policies, as well as supporting multi-sectoral approaches that contribute to health outcomes. By improving access to and quality of primary education in CAR, the project has also
                         contributed to preserving the potential of rural children for future competitiveness and employment.
