                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project closing date was extended from September 30, 2010 to March 31, 2012 to allow (i) the health component activities to be completed, (ii) the extension of HIV/AIDS
                         activities to the rural areas and (iii) the identification and implementation of communitysub projects which were proved to be more complex and time-consuming than planned. This is
                         the second extension of the project.
