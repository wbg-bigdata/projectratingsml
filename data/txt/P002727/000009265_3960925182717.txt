PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TANZANIA - PYRETHRUM PROJECT
(CREDIT 1007-TA)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Pyrethrum
Project in Tanzania, for which Credit 1007-TA in the amount of US$10.0
million was approved on April 17, 1980. The Credit was closed as scheduled
on December 31, 1985; an unused balance of US$5.1 million was cancelled.
The date of final disbursement was September 9, 1986.
The PCR was prepared by the Tanganyika Pyrethrum Board in
cooperation with Uyole Agricultural Center, Ministry of Agricultural and
Livestock Development and Ministry of Communications and Works. The
Project Performance Overview Memorandum attached to the PCR was prepared by
the Bank's Regional Mission, Eastern and Southe-n Africa.  The PCR and
Overview Memorandum are based in part on a review of the Staff Appraisal
Report (No. 2749b-TA) dated March 20, 1980, the President's Report (No.
P-2754-TA) dated March 31, 1980, the Credit Agreement of October 24, 1980;
correspondence and information as contained in files at the Tanganyika
Pyrechrum Board offices in Iringa, Njombe and Mbeya, Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock Development, Road Improvement and Maintenance
Unit (Mbeya), Uyole Agricultural Center (Mbeya) and Ministry of
Communications and Works; correspondence with the Borrower; internal Bank
memoranda on project issues as contained in relevant Bank files; as well as
interviews with officials both in the Bank and in Tanzania who have been
associated with the project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Bo.rower on July 22,
1987 for comments. The Borrower's Ministry of Agriculture and the
Pyrethrum Board have Indicated that they have no comment. The Ministry of
Communication and Works has made comments regarding the factors that
affected the progress on road works; these comments have been incorporated
in the PCR and attached thereto as Annex 14.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORI
TANZANIA - PYRETHRVM PROJECT
(CREDIT 1007-TA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
Pyrethrum ranks as the eight foreign exchange earner In
Tanzania. It is a smailholder industry based in the Southern Highlands,
where it provides a source of income for about 26,000 families. Pyrethrum
production In Tanzania rose from the late 1950s through the 1960s with
production peaking at 6,000 tons In 1966/67. Thereafter, a period of
decline followed. However, by 1976 when the project was identified, it was
thought that pyrethrum production could be a mechanism for increasing the
incomes of growers in the Southern Highlands under NADP I.
On the world scene, world production of pyrethrum flowers rose in
the early 1970s peaking at 22,500 tons in 1974/75. Thereafter, production
declined, reaching a trough in 1979/80 by which time production was about
11,000 ton, due to adverse climate and increased competition from other
crops In producing countries. This led to unsatisfied world demand and
price rise.
Objectives
The project was the first World Bank Group supported project for
the Tanzania pyrethrum Industry, including support for the Tanganyika
Pyrethrum Board. The project aimed at raising the cash incomes of
smallholder pyrethrum growers in the highlands of Iringa and Mbeya regions,
by assisting these farmers to expand their output of dried pyrethrum
flowers, through the provision of planting materials and improved research,
extension, marketing and road transport services. Technical assistance was
also provided to strengthen TPB and UAC. Preparation of the project was
completed during February 1979, appraisal took place in April/May 1979 and
negotiations were held in February 1980.  The Credit Agreement was signed
in October 1980.
Implementation Experience and Results
At the time of project preparation, appraisal and negotiation
(1979-1980), optimism abounded, regarding the prospects of the industry.
Even without project investments, it was expected that with the new higher
farmgate prices announced for 1979/80 season, production would start
recovering through new plantings and higher average yields, from the then
prevailing low levels. Through stimulating farmer interest and coupled
with EEC support of a pyrethrum development program, it was expected that
the area under the crop woulld expand from its 1978/79 - 1979/80 level of
about 8,400 ha to 13,400 ha by 1983/84 onwards (60% increase).  Yields

Imp'ementatIon of the Project started Ir. 1980 and continued till
the cr-edit c'osirng date in Decemher 1985.  Several of the project
corqpon,ents star-ted 'ate, some were dIscontinued whIle some components were
cancelled. Reinforcing the effect of these negative factors is the fact
that ch(e ntewly commissioned Mafinga plant (January 1982) performed
con5qIdernblv below the expected standard of efficiency.
Although real producer prices increased yearly from 1979/80
thro,ugh 1984/85, dried flower productioa declined steadily from 2,050 tons
n 1P79/80 to 1,439 tons In 1984/85, as pyrethrum failed to compete with
other crops on the basis of relative profitability.  The 1985/86 crop is
Tnot expected to exceed 1,500 tons.  The area under the crop dwindled and
was ahout 7,40() ha in 1983/84 compared with the expected appraisal figure
o  15,100 lha with-the-project.  Average yields were also slightly depressed
below the then prevaIlIng level of 200 Kg/ha, while the pyrethrum content
of the fclowers bas4ca''y rernained utnaffected.
M.eunwl a, h , steady technological improvements were taking place 4n
the prodo-uctI4on of syntthetlc pvrethrolds and these were gradually making
In-roalds in Ohe nvrethrum market on cost effectiveness.  This was fuelled
bY pyretl:ruijn supply shortages and assisted by the easing of restrictions on
tlhe syvthetics In. many countries.  By the time the Project became effective
(Apr11 1981), the competition from the synthetics had become very
signifIcant aAnd qrew fiercer during the period of project implementation.
As a result, the demand for pyrethrum contracted.  A 1984 report on
lpvrethrtum market trends put the current (1983) world demand at 8,000 -
1t.,000 ton:s of dried flowers 1/.  The same report noted, however, that

1982/83 was close to the peaks of the 1970s (20,000 tons). As a result of
these developments, unsold stocks began to build up by 1983, which gave
rise to cash-flow problems for crop authorities in producing countries
including Tanzania.
With declining world market prices for crude extract, h.gh
production costs and inadequate shilling revenues, the financial situation
of TPB became more precarious year after year and the economic viability of
Tanzania pyrethrum industry became very doubtful.  l'ider all these
circumstances, the benefits expected through the implementation of the
Project did not materialize.
As doubt about the financial and economic viability of the
industry increased, steps were taken to control further investments in the
industry (under the Project). This led to cutting down on the size of some
project components while eliminating others altogether. In the end, when
the credit closed in December 1985, only 4.9 million out of $10 million had
been disbursed.
Sustainability
Sustainability of the project activities will depend on the
extent to which solutions are found on the factors that have constrained
the performance of the project. The factors which hindered successful
project implementation and the attainment of project objectives were:
-    adverse developments in the world pyrethrum market;
-    GOT policies relating to prices and the external value of the
Tanzania shilling;
-    implementation of civil works were adversely affected by the lack
of construction materials; road works were particularly affected
by delays in release of budgetary funds, inadequate technical and
engineering designs, and maintenance problems;
-    severe Institutional weaknesses and excessive administrative
bureaucracy adversely affected the implementation of the roads
and research components; and
-    the Mafinga plant which failed to perform as expected.
Measures are underway towards better agricultural price policy
and appropriate foreign exchange rate regime. A proposed rationalization
of agricultural research services will improve the prospects of pyrethrum
production, among other crops. On the other hand, budgetary constraints
and organizational problems are likely to continue to adversely affect the
maintenance of roads and various civil works. But the most critical factor
being on sustainability of the initiatives taken under the project is the
future world demand for pyrethrum products. An outlook report issued in
1984 on the pyrethrum market concludes with the observation that existing
producers cannot expect a major recovery in the fortunes of the industry in
the near future, and that on balance the main need is for both retrenchment

and improved efficiency.2/ It warns that the present production base is
too large In relation to the world demand and wlll need to contract
appreciably. This remains valid today. The Government of Tanzania is
aware of this need, and at the tinie of closing of the credit was actively
seeking ways to bring about the retrenchment and improved efficiency called
for.
Findings and Lessons
The Tanzania pyrethrum industry could do little to influence
world demand for pyrethrum products. However, adjustment of the industry
to the reduction in demand and to the fall of world price could have been
more rapid and effective. This did not occur in part because the
administrative framework in which the industry operates, and the constant
need to consult with Government on important decisions have been
impediments to quick and decisive actior. kn important contributing factor
has also been the lack of two essential prerequisites for successful
economic decision making: (a) a reliable information system, and (b) a
suitable incentive structure.
The information system was flawed by price distortions in the
economy, particularly the overvalued exchange rate. This together with
differing perceptions of the extent of Shilling overvaluation impeded early
recognition that pyrethrum had become an uneconomic crop. Also,
information on demand and marketing aspects has been inadequate, and TPB's
efforts to collect detailed market information and to analyze narketing
signals - such as difficulties in marketing crude extract and the drop in
world prices - appear to have been haphazard.
The existing incentive structure for decision makers has not been
conducive to reaching economic decisions. There has been little incentive
to reduce TPB's costs so that they are in line with operational
requirements and meet appropriate efficiency standards. Decisions to close
or reduce staff in offices of marginal usefulness, or to eliminate flower
procurement in insignificant production areas have been difficult, as
percieved political risks associated with such decisions have outweighed
potential henefift for the decision makers. Similarly, there has been no
incentive for TPB to charge farmers for costly planting material and
thereby reduce wastage of such material.  Furthermore, the introduction of
charges would have introdtuced certain risks for TPB including: (i)
complaints by producers through their political representatives and (ii) a
possible reduction in production which would have reflected badly on TPB
management.

PYRETHRUM PROJECT (CR. 1007-TA)
Project Completion Report
Project Performance Overview Memorandum
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       The Borrower lhas provided a comprehensive Project Completion
Report (PCR) prepared In a collaborative effort between the Tanganyika
Pyrethrum Board (TPB), Uyole Agricultural Centre (UAC), the Ministry of
Works (MOW) and the Project Preparation and Monitoring Bureau (PPMB) of
the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development (MALD). The report
is generally fair and objective covering most of the major problems and
disappointments experienced during the unsuccessful implementation of
this project.  Following are some specific comments on the PCR sections
discussing the project's road component:
(i)   witl regard to para 2.04 it should be noted that in
December 1978 consultants financed under the National
Maize Project (Credit 606-TA) carried out a study on high
priority feeder roads in the pyrethrum growing areas an4
recommended a program fof roads improvement and
mainLainance, which provided a suitable basis for this
component;
(ii)  cu::cerning the reference to base camp location in para
3.47, the camp had to be established at a site with
relatively good communications and access to regional
authorities, supplies, local agents of equipment and
workshops. The project envisaged the establishment of
temporary camps nearer the project roads and provided for
the procurement of a mobile workshop and a trailer caravan
for the engineer.  These were not procured and muclh
against IDA's recommendation, the road construction and
maintenance units were supplied and directed from Mbeya;
and
(iii) witlh regard to equipment procurement discussed in para
3.50, the reference to graders is not correct. Graders
are light equipment! The D8 referes to the crawler
tractor. The project, as appraised, provided for one
crawl1er tractor with a 180-220 h.p. capacity, compared to
the V)S (300 h.p.) which is-about 60% heavier. There is
genoeral agreement the D8 should not have been procured.
2.       This nmenmoraindum is intended to supplement the Borrower's PCR.
It elaborates oti the causes of project failure and focusses on some
additrional aspect:; wi,tch have led to the project's unsatisfactory
resl'fr s.  It furthermore reviews some lcssons that might be leartied from
tLiis project.  \- ached to thits inemor;andtlm is a revised Basic DAta Sheet

II.  REASONS FOR PROJECT FAILURE
3.       The USt 13.2 million project was to be implemented over a five
year period using an IDA Credit of US3 10 million which was declared
effective in April 1981. The project had the primary objective of
raising incomes of smallholder farmers. To achieve this objective, the
project allocated (i) US$ 7.6 million to TPB for strengthening its
operations and expand smallholder pyrethrumn production; (ii) US$ 2.2
million to UAC for strengthening pyrethrom research; and (iii) USt 3.4
million to MOW for the improvement and maintenance of feeder roads. Tile
proposed investments were expected to expand the pyrethrum growing area,
increase yields and improve the pyrethrin content of the pyrethrum
flowers, and thereby raise the income of smallholder growers. This did
not occur. For the last full financial year for which actual results are
available, FY 1984/85, expectations at appraisal and actual achievements
are as follows:

results: net income for FY1984/85 was forecast during appraisal at 3% of

revenues of only about TSh 39 million.
4.       There are two sets of factors which have been mainly responslble
for the project's failure. The first set concerns issues affecting the
production objectives of the project, while the second set relates to the
viability of the Tanzanian pyrethrum industry as a whole. The production
objectives were not achieved because:
(i)  project implementation did not proceed as planned.  Ihere
were numerous delays resulting from (a) the general
deterioration of Tanzania's economic enviroAment and
associated shortages of materials and services during the
project period, and (b) from problems with contractors,
inefficiencies in the impleneenting agencies, slow
recruitment of key personnel, and frequent executive staff
changes in the roads units. Also, there was a curtailment
of project investmenits especially in the later project
years when the justification of planned expenditures became
increasingly doubtful. At the time of project completion,
only " fraction of the proposed project activities had been
completed. (Details on implementation problems and
accomplishmeats are in the PCR); and
(ii) there was little incentive for farmers to produce. Farmers
coul2., earn colisiderably higher incomes from crops competing
with pyrethrum for-land and scarce labor. An analysis
carried out in mid-1984 indicated that for maize and
potaitoes farmers' net returns on labor were about 50% and
240'5 Ihigher than for pyrethrum.  In this context the
consistent overvaluation of the Shilling was of majdr
importance, as it resulted in low export earnings and
consequently low producer prices for expert crops. Another
disincentive to pyrethirum production, and to thle production
of cash crops in general, has been the lack of consumer
goo(s especially in the rural areas. Thlere was not much
puirpose in producing to generate cash income as long as
there was little that could be bought for cash,
Furthermore, funds availabtle to TPB were not always
sufficient to buy all flowers, as continuous financial
losses led to shortages of cash. Similarly, numerous
techlical problems at TPB's extraction plant made it
someoimes difficult for TPB to accept all flowers offered
for ssaIle by farmers. As a result, pyretlhrum farlmers could
not always be certain that-they could sell their produce.

the appraisal mission had estimated the future size of the pyrethrum
market at 20,000 to 22,000 tons of dried flowers per year, a 1984 study
on pyrethrum market trends and prospects reported that by 1983 the market
had shrunk to between 9,000 and 10,000 tons of dried flowers and was
likely to remain at this level at least for the short term.L/
Moreover, the study concluded that "producers cannot expect a major
recovery in the fortunes of pyrethrum in the near future, and on balance
the main need is for both retrenchment and improved efficiency. The
present production base is too large in relation to the world market, and
will need to contract appreciably".2/
6.       The st idy attributed the decline in demand for pyrethrum
products to competition from synthetically produced pyrethroids and to
the unreliability of pyrethrum supplies, due to erratic weather patterns
In many producing countries, and competiti.ve local pressure from crops
suclh as maize, tea and coffee. Contributing to periodic production
shortfalls were also reductions in producer prices introduced to meet the
challenge from the pyretlhroids, and thie absence of a suitable stock
policy for pyrethrum products in the producing areas to smoothen out
irregular supplies. The pyrethrurn shortage was particularly severe from
1978 to 1980 with the result that prices soared and many buyers switched
to synLhetics. Buyers' confidence in pyrethrum was further undermined
wtth the temporary entry in the market of new traders who saw an
c:.ceptiunal opportunity for quick financial gains, and in some cases did
iot honor thleir contractual commitments.  The preparation and appraisal
nissions recognized the threat posed by pyrethroids to the pyrethrum
ir d(stry. fiowever, information available at the Lime of project
preparat-lon and appraisal did not sufficiently highlight the permanent
natu.e ot thle shift away from pyretlhrum to pyrethroids which was taking
pl ce,
The contracting market affected TPB in two ways:
(i) in 1981 and 1982 TPB experienced difficulties in marketing
its crude extract although production was only between 30%
and 40% of appraisal estimates; and

prices which had reached US$ 63.20 per kg of crude extract
(25XZpyretlhrin-content) in-1980 fell-cont7inually, -levelling
off at USt 33.50 in FY1983/84 and FY1984/85 before recovering
somewhat to US$ 35 in FY1985/86.!/ As a result, actual
prices during the three years from FY1983/84 to FY1985/86 have
on average been about 20% lower than estimated at appraisal.
8.    While production volume and sales prices where lower than projected
by the appraisal team, TPB's costs were considerably higher. Only two
montlhs after Credit effectiveness a supervision mission nolnted already
out that TPB's administrative and operating costs had "sky-rocketed"
since appraisal and needed to be corrected. The need for cost reductions
to bring rhen in line with operational requirements remained, however, a
Maior !ssue throughout the project period.  The problem of high costs was
aggravated by continuous technical problems'at TPB's extraction plant at
Nlafinga.  The plant, which did not constitute part of the project, was
commissioned in early 1982, but the equipment has never reached specified
efficiency levels.
9.    By 1984, with TPB's ever increasing financial losses, it was clear
that the production, processing and markcting of pyrethrum in Tanzania
would remain financially unviable.  At the same time there was increasing
-evidence that it had become uneconomical. An economic analysis which IDA
pirepared in ,niid-1982 on the basis of incremental project costs and
1c;eefits, had still concluded that the project's economic rate of return
(EHI) zwould range between -1.5% and 7% with the likely ERR near the
hi,Lher figurc.  However, a wider analysis on the economic viability of
the entire industry carried out by IDA in mid-1984, came to tite result
that pyretlLrum was an unecot,omical crop for 17,hzania.  Even under the
assumption that TrB would resolve the major technical problems at Mafinga
artl in addition reduce its fixed and variable costs by 20% and 10%
rnspectiveiy, it was estimated that the exchange rate for the Shilling
iNc'uid haire to be almost 100 per UStl.OO for the industry to break even in
economic terms.-/
1J..   IDA's economic review and a similar analysis carried out by MALD's
'!al:ketiuig ix2velopment Bureau underlined the need for developing a new
st:ratcgv for the industry.  Some of the project investments lhad already
beeo curt.itlcd in 1982 wlhen it had become apparent that the pyretlirum

investmcnt or in fact with the industry. Under the circumstances, IDA
found it difficult to support new project expenditures, particolar-l-y in
the absence of a suitable strategy for future pyrethrum development.
While Covcrnment and TFB agreed that the industry was, at least for the
time beinig, financially and economically unviable, there has been
reluctance by TPB manaigement and Government to take drastic actions, and
the preparation of an adjustmecnt program has been slow.  A first attempt
to deal with the industry's struictural problems was made in early 1985.
At that time Government informed IDA that it considered it premature to
take a finatl decision on the Industry, and proposed a short-term strategy
which consisted essentially of:
(i)  targetting annual pyrethrum flower production at 1,600 tons; and
(ii) Improving the industry's efficiency including the reduction of
osts.

imprcoceIlents and on cost reduction measures.  An IDA supervision mission

sector involvement in the industry. Without substantial improvements in
efficiency, considerable reduction in costs and innovative management, it
is most doubtful that pyrethrum will again become a viable crop in
Tanzania. To achieve this and to enable timely response to changing
market conditions, it would be crucial to move the industry out of the
present parastatal sphere into a more private sector oriented commercial
environmcnt.
III. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
12, The Tanzania pyrethrum industry could do-little to influence world
demand for pyrethrum products. However, adjustment of the industry to
the reduction in demand and to the fall of world price could have been
more rapid and effective. This did not occur in part because the
administrative framework in which the industry operates, and the constant
need to consult with Government on important decisions have been
impediments to qptick and decisive action. An important contributing
factor has al-6 been the lack of two essential prerequisites for
succeqcf t economic decision making: (a) a reliable information system,
4b) a suitable incentive structure.
1J.  The information systom was flawed by price distortions in the
,economy, pnrticularly the overvalued exchange rate.  This together with
differin,; perceptions of the extent of thilling overvaluation impeded
7-rly recognition that pyrethrum had become an uneconomic crop.  Also,
an.t)rozaL1ori on domai;d and marketing aspects has been inadequate, and
S effrLts to ccllect detailcd market information and to analyze
-arketTin)" csignals - such as difficulties in marlceting crude extract and
-1i drolp Ln world prices - appear to have been haphazard.
14.       The existing incentive structure for decision makers has not been
conducive to reaching economic decisions. There has been little incentive
to reduce TPB's costs so that they are in line with operational require-
ments and meet appropriate efficiency standards. Decisions to close or
reduce statt in offices of marginal usefulness, or to eliminate flower
procurement in insignificant production areas have been difficult, as risks
associated with such decisions have outweighed potential benefits for the
decision makers. Similarly, there has been no incentive for TPB to charge
farmers for costly planting material and thereby reduce wastage of such
material since the Government is financing the production of planting
material. Furthermore, the introduction of charges would have introduced
certain risks for TPB including: (i) complaints by producers through their
political representatives and (ii) a possible reduction in productir which
would have reflected badly on TPB management. In the case of invest..ents
too, TPB management has not felt compelled to economize. An example is the
pyrethrum powder plant. In 1984, TPB requested IDA financing for a mill
costing almost US$1million (Tsh 12 million); only after IDA refused to
finance this investment, was a more modest design developed and included in
the Short Term Action Program (para 9), with an estimated cost of about
US$230,000 (TSh 3.9 million).

PYRETHRUM PROJECT (CR. 1007-TA)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01   Agriculture contributes eighty five percent of Tanzania's exports,
provides ninety percent of the employment, and contributes forty percent
of GDP. Within this context, pyrethrum has played a small but
significant role - ranking eight in terms of foreign exchange earnings.
In good years such as 1975/76 and 1982/83 the foreign exchange earnings
exceeded TSh 30 million annually, at the then prevailing exchange rates.
Pyrethrum also constitutes a regular source o' cash income for some
26,000 farm families mostly in the southern highlands of Iringa and Mbeya.
1.02   Pyrethrum production in Tanzania dates back to the early
thirties.  From a plantation  'r    t has become a peasant crop, its
production reaching 6,000 tort   ; ried flowers in 1966/67 (Annex Table
1).  This level of production    t<onsidered far beyond the absorptive
capacity of the market and to a - jurage production, producer prices were
reduced by half (Annex Table 2). Since then the trend in production has
been downwards, even when later attempts were made to increase production
through producer price increases.
1.03   The Project was identified in 1976 in connection with NADP I.  it
was considered at the time that pyrethrum production could be a feasible
mechanism for increasing the incomes of pyrethrum growers in the southern
highlands under NADP I.
1.04   The Project provided for the elimination of the factors that were
by the time considered to be draw-back for increasing pyrethrum
production -- support for inputs, extension and research, improvement of
feeder roads, and strengthening of TPB to provide better services to the
industry.
1.05   Overall physical execution of the Project (i.e. in terms of
installing the Project) was not satisfactory. Although planting
materials supplied to farmers under the unimproved planting material
programme exceeded appraisal estimates, the improved planting material
programme did not come off as planned, as the existing superior clone
(59/347) failed to perform to expectations, in addition to remaining in
short supply throughout the project period (par 3.04-3.09). The research
at UAC could supply improved clones only towards the terminal stages of
the credit (par 3.42). The roads in the pyrethrum producing areas
remained substantially unimproved (par 3.43-3.54), while the provision
for technical assistance was only partially utilized. Civil works
remained almost all uncompleted, except the Njombe office block and a few
marketing centres (par 3.18-3.21).
1.06   The expected impact of the Project did not materialise: production
of dried flowers fell from 2,000 tons to an average of about 1,500 tons
during the Implementation of the Project (1980/81-1985/86); crude extract
production level was 30 - 40 tons in this period except for 1982/83 when
it was higher -- this level of output was only about a third of the
levels reached in the five year period (1975/76 - 1979/80) immediately
proceding project implementation period, and nowhere near appraisal
levels of 100 - 140 tons expected, even in the without - Project
situation; foreign exchange earnings fell, the provision of



vehicles, incremental local staff and technlcal assistance did to some
extent strengthen TPB which was able to raise/distribute planting
materials, procure/transport flowers and Improve its accounting and
management information system, but these did not translate into increased
flower production. Viewed, however, from the point of view of what would
have happened had certain project investments not been made (vehicles,
spares for Mafinga, technical assistance), there were probably some
positive results.
1.07    Iin the course of the implementation of the Project, there were
important institutional changes. In 1983/84 all extension services
reverted to the Ministry of Agriculture, while the cooperatives were
re-introduced in 1984/85. None of these changes, however, had began to
sake any noticeable change on tha industry when the credit closed in
December, 1985.
1.08    The pyrethrum industry in Iringa has benefited from EEC support
through IRADEP, especially in the areas of planting material supply and
flo'pr drying.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.01    The Project was identified under the National Agricultural
Development Programme Phase I (NADP I) during 1976 and was originally
prepared by GOT with assistance from the World Bank's Regional Mission in
Eastern Africa (RMEA). The Project was envisaged as the Pyrethrum Areas
Development Company (PYRAD) of NADP I. PYRAD was to cover the Iringa
Region only. (1) NADP I was appraised by IDA in June 1977. However,
it was not possible to complete appraisal of the pyrethrum component at
the time, because the road programme had not been adequately prepared and
there was insufficient data available on TPB financial status and on the
costs of pyrethrum marketing and processing. Detailed reviews of these
aspects were undertaken by consultants in 1978 and early 1979, and the
preparation of the Project was completed in February 1979 by GOT with
further RMEA assistance.
2.02    At the time of the initial preparation of the Project, production
although declining from the 1966/67 peak of 6,015 tonnes, appeared to be
able to recover.  A section of the statistics on dry flower production
then available to the preparation team showed:(2)

Production figures for 1975/76 were then not available -- only estimates
were available which were put at 4,500 tons.
2.03     It was rightly noted that, although at the time, the position of
pyrethrum on the world market appeared stable, tthe perennial threat of
substitute synthetic products, enhanced by high pyrethrum prices, should
not be ignored. It was, therefore, concluded that the survival of the
inidustry would largely depend on the maintenance of regular supplies of
high quality pyrethrum products at competitive prices. It was further
concluded that PYRAD would be part of the national endeavour to meet this
challenge by providing financial support to the Project's immediate
objectives which were:
(a)   Raise the level of pyrethrum production from an estimated
2,300 tons (1975/76) to 4,300 tonnes or more as part of
the overall national target of producing 12,000 - 13,000
tons of flowers by 1980 through:
- expansion of area from 8,000 ha to 12,000 ha (1)
- increasing average yield through the use of improved
cultivars, fertilizer and better husbandry from the
yleld of 270kg/ha to about 500 kg/ha;
-  disease control through use of insecticides;
(b)   Increase the average pyrethrins content from 1.1% through
research and agronomy; and
(c)   Reduce additional production constraints by providing
better crop drying facilities, improvement of feeder
roads, provision of adequate transport lorries and
construction of adequate storage facilities.
2.04     Accordingly, "to help overcome the constraints in pyrethrum
production, marketing and processing PYRAD, would:
(a)   increase the supply of improved planting material,
fertilizer and insecticides and knapsack sprayers;
(b)   intensify efforts of extension and other support services
to improve crop husbandry;
(c)   provide additional storage facilities;
(d)   construct and improve crucial road links between
production areas and buying centres to facilitate easier
and timely haulage of flowers; and
(e)   institute a comprehensive and coordinate research program
for developing better cultivars and other agronomic and
technological innovations".
(1) Figures refer to Iringa Region



-4-
-      Input Supplies
Planting material of cultivars of proven yield were limited and
this constraint to higher production was to be tackled through purchase
of splits from UAC for subsequent multiplication and distribution to
farmers at some cost. Fertilizers and insecticides would also be
procured by TPB and sold to farmers. To control insects, knapsack
sprayers would also be purchased by TPB and loaned to farmers free of
charge.
-      Improvement of Extension Services
Lack of knowledgeable advice to farmers on 'latest technological
innovations" was considered to be one of the contributory factors for
poor crop husbandry. This was traced to inadequately trained extension
staff, aggravated by lack of transport and campaign funds. These were to
be rectified under PYRAD through support for training and enhancing
mobility for the regional extension staff.
-      Roads
Roads in the main pyrethrum growing areas were known to be very
poor.  Cases were known where farmers had to walk up to 25 km to reach
the nearest buying centre accessible by lorry to sell their flowers.
Miany instances were also known when, even after the flowers have been
purchased, they could not be taken out of the buying centre because of
inaccessibility or refusal by transporters to hire out their lorries, due
to the poor state of the roads. It was proposed under PYRAD to fund the
construction and improvement of certain high priority roads in the
pyrethrum growing areas through the office of the RDD. The following
roads were earmarked for improvement:
District            Road                                 Distance (Km)
Njombe              Mfumbi - Ikowo                            32
Ikowo - Nkinja                            10
Ndulamo - Magoma - Kitulo                 40
Kipengere - Lupila                        48
Mangoto - Ibaga                           15
Ludewa              Lasitu - Madilu                           25
Mlangali - Mapongoro                      20
Iringa              Kidabaga - Bom                            64
Ilula - Ludekwa                           64
Total     318
PYRAD funds to support road improvement would be used for the employment
of labour, running of existing construction equipment and for the
purchase of construction materials such as cement and timber, etc.

-       Research
The important role of research was recognised. It was noted that
basic facilities were already available at UAC and Igeri. However,
opportunity for te.iiag improved cultivars developed at these stations in
different ecological situacions were limited by the small number of
outstations. PYRAD would, therefore, fund the establishment of 4 new
substations for this purpose at Kikondo, Kinyika, Igeri and Ujuni.
Provision was also made to retain the services of an expatriate plan
breeder/agronomist at UAC.
2.05    The total cost of PYRAD was calculated to be approximately Tshs
25.2 million over a 3-year period. Foreign exchange costs were estimated
to amount to Tshs 14.9 million (59%) of total costs. Implementation of
PYRAD was to be mainly by the Iringa Regional Authorities, with close
cooperation with TPB.
2.06    The preparation of the Project as described above was considered
incomplete. During 1978 and early 1979 further work was undertaken and
the preparation work was completed in February 1979.
Appraisal
2.07    A mission consisting of J. Mullan, P. Santons, G. Onaba and K.
Nathan (IDA) and R. Faun (consultant) appraised the Project in April/May
1979. The Project as appraised and presented for negotiation, although
remaining basically the same in spirit as the one originally prepared,
differed considerably in scope from it. The Project was now to cover
both Iringa and Mbeya Regions instead of the former region only. The
development period was to be five years instead of three. TPB was now
given a direct executing role instead of merely "cooperating" with Iringa
Region.
Negotiations
2.08    Negotiations took place in Washington during 12-16 February,
1980. The issues that were raised and discussed centred around pyrethrum
producer prices, production and distribution of improved planting
materials for farmers; extension services for the project area;
appointment of consultants; credit scheme for TPB staff; support for
research; establishment of RIMU and road maintenance in the project area;
and, TPB accounts. Assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a)     Government would continue to review and adjust pyrethrum
producer prices annually, taking into account export prices, TPB
operating costs and the producer prices of other export crops;
(b)     TPB would continue to produce and distribute improved
planting material to farmers after the completion of IDA disbursements;
(c)     Kilimo, TPB and the Iringa and Mbeya Regional Authorities
would, not later than June 30, 1982, review and discuss with IDA the
adequacy of extension services for the Project Area (including the number
of extension staff and arrangements for supervision of village level
staff, and, if necessary, proposals for improvement of such services);



-6 -
(d)     Consultants employed under the Project would be recruited
in accordance with IDA guidelines and that their terms of reference and
conditions of employment would be acceptable to IDA;
(e)     TPB would establish a credit scheme to enable its staff
to purchase the motorcycles provided under the Project, and would pay
staff monthly operating allowances for these vehicles;
(f)     After the period of IDA disbursements, GOT would continue
to allocate adequate funds for the continuation of the pyrethrum research
program expanded under the Project;
(g)     GOT would assist TPB, UAC and MOW as necessary to acquire
the sites for offices and housing to be constructed under the Project;
(h)     The RIMU would be established under the control of the
Dlrector of Roads and Aerodromes in MOW not later than March 31, 1981;
(i)     Not later than March 31, 1984, GOT would review the
capacity of the regional works divisions in Mbeya and Iringa to take over
maintenance of the roads improved under the project, and would furnish to
IDA proposals regarding the responsibility for continued maintenance of
the roads improved under the Project and that RIMU equipment would, after
completion of the Project's road component, be used for the maintenance
of roads improved under the project in Mbeya and Iringa Regions;
(j)     Throughout the Project period adequate funds would be
budgeted by GOT for the maintenance of all main and local roads used for
the transportation of pyrethrum in the Project areas, and that adequate
funds would be budgeted after the construction period for the maintenance
of roads improved under the Project;
(k)     TPB, UAC and RIMU would carry out the Project in
accordance with detailed annual work plans. In the case of TPB and UAC,
the first of these plans (relating to 1980/81) would be sent to IDA for
review not later than May 31 1980. Subsequent plans would be sent to IDA
for review by March 31 preceeding the GOT fiscal year to which they
relate. In case of RIMU, the first work plan (stating to 1981/82)
would be sent to IDA for review by March 31 1980. Subsequent plans would
be sent for IDA review by March 31 preceeding the GOT fiscal year to
which the work program relates.
(1)     IDA would be consulted, prior to appointment, on
suitability, in terms of qualifications and experience, of candidates for
the posts of Fianancial Controller, Planning and Production Agronomist,
Field Agronomist, Research Officer, Roads Engineer, Construction
Supervisor and Mechanical Supervisor; that IDA would be consulted pr'or
to the appointment of successor staff to these positions; that
internationally-recruited staff would be employed under terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA, that the Research Officer, Field
Agronomist and Planning and Production Agronomist would be appointed no
later than September 30, 1980 and the Road Engineer, Mechanical
Superintendent and Construction Supervisor no later than March 31, 1981;
and that the posts of Planning and Production Manager, Iringa Regional
Manager and Mbeya Regional Manager would continue, during the Project
peroid, to be filled by suitably qualified staff;



-7-
(in)    By August 31, 1981, TPB would have updated its accounts,
and begun the implementation of improved financial systems.
IDA Board Approval and Signing of the Credit Agreement
2.09    The Project was prerented to the World Bank/IDA Board of
Directors which approved funding for the Project on April 17, 1980.
2.10    The Credit and Project Agreements were signed on October 24,
1980. This coincided with the signing of Credit and Project Agreements
for a number of other project:- Tanzania Rural development Bank ($10.0
million); Second Technical Assistance (SDR 8.4 million); Coconut Pilot
Project (SDR 5.2 million). The credit became effective in April 1981.
Project Description
2.11    As approved, the Project would over a five year period assist
farmers to expand their output of dried pyrethrum flowers through the
provision of planting material and improved research, extension,
marketing and road transport services. The major quantifiable benefits
were expected to be: the increase in family cash incomes of the order of
17% (from TShs 2,550 to Tsh 3,000) which at full development would accrue
to 37,000 families containing some 200,000 individuals; the increased
foreign exchange earnings; and, also the improvements in TPB profit and
loss position.
2.12    Specifically, the Project would provide for:
(a)     the expansion of smallholder production through: the
production and distribution of improved planting material and, on an
interim basis, unimproved planting material; the improvement of pest
control, the expansion of TPB's field staff; the improvement of flower
drying techniques; the construction of additional TPB market
centres/stores; and the expansion of TPB's transport fleet ($2.4 million);
(b)     the strengthening of the existing research programme of
the Uyole Agricultural Center (UAC) through: the construction and
equipping of additional laboratory facilities; the funding of additional
research staff and staff training; the establishment of three new
off-stations; and the financing of research operations ($1.6 million);
(c)     the strengthening of TPB's operations through: the
provision of both long-term and short-term technical assistance and staff
training; the construction of new office accommodation for TPB; and the
provision of vehicles for TPB headquarters staff ($ 3.1 million);
(d)     the improvement and maintenance of feeder roads through:
the establishment of a fully staffed and equipped Road Improvement and
Maintenance Unit (RIMU); and,the financing of the costs of operations of
the RIMU ($2.5 million).
2.13    Adding contingencies ($3.6 million) gave a total project cost
without taxes of $12.7 million of which IDA lent *10.0 million equivalent



- 8 -
to 79 percent of the total project cost.(l) Responsibility for
implementation of the smallholder production component would rest with
TPB as strengthened under the Project. UAC would implement the expanded
research programme, and RL4U administered by and receiving technical
support from MOW, would carry-out the roads programme.
Smallholder Production Programme
2.14    The original concept of inputs, supporting extension, pest
control, and improving drying and storage facilities was preserved. The
need to supply farmers with improved planting materials was still felt.
The then existing six bulking centres would be expanded to 10 centres
under the Project and would be used to multiply selected improved
planting material. Initially the best existing clones would be bulked.
It was expected that by the end of the Project period, the bulking
centres would have access to improved clonal materials from UAC.
However, as substantial improved planting material would be available
only as from PY3, support would now also be given through the Project for
the production and distribution of unimproved planting material grown
from seeds.
Pest Control
2.15    Infestation by insects "thrips" were known to occur sporadically
in lower, warmer areas. The incidence was not particularly widespread
but it needed to be controlled before becoming serious. The Project
would purchase one hundred knapsack sprayers and a supply of
insecticides. The insecticides would be sold to farmers but the
sprayers, as before, would be loaned free of charge as required.
Incremental TPB Field Staff
2.16    TPB's extension services to farmers was considered to be very
weak and was to be supported. This would be done by posting additional
field staff. The Board already had 4 Assistant Production Officers. A
further 18 officers were to be posted so as to strengthen the supervision
of planting material production and distribution.
Flower Drying
2.17    Whilst sun-drying had problems, the other existing methods of
drying flowers also had their attendant problems. The whole question of
flower drying needed attention. The Project would, therefore, make
provision for consulting services for the review of needs of various
parts of the project area, to asses the economic viability of alternative
drying methods, given the limited availability of fuels in the project
area, and to draw up proposals for implementation of improvLd drying
methods where necessary.
(1) S13.2 million with taxes and duties.



- 9-
Buying Centres/Stores
2.18    Existing TPB's buying centres/stores were considered Inadequate
in terms of number, capacity and state of maintenance for safe storage of
dried flowers and various inputs during the rains when truck collections
can be delayed. Provision would, therefore, be made for the construction
of stores in 12 locations where existing facilities were judged
inadequate and in two new locations.
Transport
2.19    The need for transport was still felt.  Provision was made for
the purchase of: (a) twelve 7-ton trucks to transport dried flowers from
buying centres to TPB main stores; (b) five 4-wheel drive station-wagons
to be used in reaching pyrethrum growing villages Inaccessible to trucks
and to transport buying clerks and other administrative officials; (c) 22
motorcycles for the use of TPB field staff.
Pyrethrum Research
2.20    The research component included in the Project that was appraised
went beyond the establishment of new outstations for testing improved
planting material. The appraisal team noted that the research programme
was understaffed, the period between initial collection of planting
material and recommendations of improved material was relatively long
(seven years); the programme was short of equipment and operating funds.
It was also recognised that then existing number of off-stations did not
adequately ref7 2ct the ecological range of pyrethrum growing areas.
Towards addressing these, a full tissue culture unit was now proposed to
be established at UAC, complete with civil works provision of necessary
equipment and specialist personnel. Also, in addition to supporting the
activities of the then existing offstations, three new ones were to be
established.
Strengthening of TPB
2.21    By contrast with the original project write-up, TPB was to play a
key role in the Project aimed at the development of the pyrethrum
industry. Accordingly, to assist TPB manage its responsibilities, a
series of institution building measures were to be financed under the
Project. These included:
2.22    Incremental Staff:  A Financial Controller with overall
responsibility within TPB for accounting and financial administration; a
Production and Agronomist would have overall responsibility for the
planning and management of the Project's smallholder production
cimponent: a Field Agronomist who would work with the Iringa and Mbeya
Regional Production Managers. Other incremental staff included: a
Transport Officer, a Cost Acciuntant, an Internal Auditor, a Planning
Officer, a Statistician/Evaluation Officer and a Procurement Off4cer.
2.23    Short-Term Technical Assistance:  Six man-months of short-term
consultancy for a study of TPB's transport management systems and the
formulation of improvements.



- 10 -
2.24    Staff Training:  Funds were to be provided for the training of
Tanzanian TPB staff both locally and overseas.
2.25    Offices and Houses:  TPB's head office was to be relocated to
Iringa (closer to TPB's field operations) while the Iringa Regional
Office was to move to Njombe. New office blocks and houses were to be
constructed in Iringa, Mbeya, Njombe and Makete.
2.26    Vehicles:  The Project would finance the purchase of five 4-wheel
drive vehicles for the use of of key TPB officers - the Chief Executive
Officer, Planning and Production Manager, two Agronomists and linincial
Controller, and as necessary by others involved in the implmentat on of
the Project.
Road Improvement and Maintenance
2.27    The constraint posed by poor roads was still recognised an'  e
component retained in the Project. Mbeya Region was now tn be incl i.ed
and new priorities were established. A total of 18 roads would be
improved instead of the original nine. However, the total lengtlh wis
reduced from 318 Km to 204 Km (112 Km of these in Iringa Region). A new
Unit (RDIU) was proposed to be set up for the execution of this
component. RIMU would be based in Mbeya and the Project would finapce
the construction of three houses for senior RIMU personnel, and a sm-ll
office and workshop, as well as operating costs. A Roads Engineer, :
(onstruction Supervisor and a Mechanical Supervisor would be
internationally recruited to manage the operations of RIMU.
Mafinga Extract Plant
2.28    Early in 1981 GOT requested IDA finance under the Credit (CR
1007-TA) for the fianancing of two technical assistance personnel to be
provided by Dalgety-Kenny Associates who were consulting engineers for
the Mafinga Extract Plant that was then under construction. Assistance
was also sought for the procurement of basic spares for the plant. In a
letter dated February 8, 1982 IDA agreed to finance Mafinga (TA and
spares and Powder-mill).
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Effectiveness and Start-up
3.01    Conditions of credit effectiveness agreed upon at negotiations,
were: (i) completion of an on-lending agreement satisfactory to IDA
between GOT and TPB, and (ii) appointment of a Financial Controller for
TPB.
3.02    Project start-up was slightly delayed given that the Terminal
Date for effectiveness was January 23, 1981.  The Financial Controller
was appointed in August 1980 and the Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) was
signed in February 1981. In a letter dated February 28, 1981 the TPB
Chief Executive wrote to the Justice Department to report that the SLA
had been signed and requested early action on furnishing the Legal
Opinion which was delaying credit effectiveness. This was eventually
completed and the credit was declared effective in April 1981.



- 11 -
3.03    The first supervision mission after the credit had become
effective was in June 1981. The mission's report lamented the poor
financial condition of TPB. The report observed that TPB was having
difficulties selling its crude extract which, it concluded, was the main
cause of the poor financial performance of TPB. It further observed,
however, that failure to close TECO, due to slowness in coming on stream
of the Mafinga Plant, and increases in TPB administrative expenses were
also contributory factors. The report also urged speedy action in the
recruitment of the tissue culture specialist for UAC. These two problem
areas were to become recurrent themes in supervision mission reports.
Implementation Schedule
A. Smallholder Production Programme
Improved Planting Material
3.04    Under this subcomponent, 10 bulking centres were to be set up to
bulk improved plant materials in the first instance. The output is to be
further multiplied in village clornal nurseries before final supply to
farmers, The end result of this activity is to enable farmers to expand
their areas under pyrethrum with improved plants as follows: PY1 (160
ha); PY2 (610 ha); PY3 (1,080 ha); PY4 and succeeding years (1,650 ha).
In PY(1) and PY(2) some of the output from the bulking centres (20 ha and
30 ha respectively) would be distributed directly to farmers.
Schematically, the plan and targets may be represented as in Table 3.1(a).
3.05    The actual achievements are given in Table 3.1(b).  As can be
seen, the targets in establishing the bulking centres were met and even
exceeded, except for 1980/81. However, due to the high demand for
planting materials by farmers and the shortage in supply of the bulking
material, TPB could not operate the village clonal nurseries as planned.
After establishing 62 ha in 1981/82 the decision was taken to eliminate
the village clonal nurseries from the programme, and to supply splits to
farmers directly from the bulking centres.
3.06    The supply of splits to farmers fell considerably below what was
planned: 1980/81 - 0 ha instead of 20 ha; 1981/82 - 37 ha instead of 75
ha; 1982/83 - 81 ha instead of 135 ha; 1983/84 - 79 ha instead of 200 ha;
1984/85 - 110 ha instead of 200 ha. It was expected that the plants from
the village nurseries could be multiplied 8-fold on farmers fields. In
practice TPB achieved a factor of 10.
Unimproved Planting Material
3.07    Under this subcomponent two of TPB's pyrethrum farms (Ilinde and
Mahenye) would be supported to produce seeds. The seeds which would be
produced - 1000 Kg in PY(l), 1250 Kg in PY(2), 1000 Kg in PY(3) - would
be used to establish seedling nurseries which would produce seedlings for
distribution to farmers. The plan and targets envisaged are shown
schematically in 'lable 3.2.

3.08      Compared with these targets, records mairtained in TPB offices show
that they were exceeded in actual performance. For example, during 1980/81
6,536 Kg of seeds were produced instead of the target figure of 1,000 Kg.
Again for 1980/81 45 ha of seedling nurseries were established instead of the
target of 40 ha. The majority of the seeds were distributed to farmers for
raising their own seedlings. In addition to this effort, a number of splits
were distributed to farmers from the EEC supported pyrethrum nurseries in the
Irtnga Region (90 ha).
3.09     A featture that was later introduced into th'Is subcomponent was the
establishment of secondary seedling nurseries by which plants raised from
seedling would be observed for at least a little while before distributing
promising ones to farmers. TPB, however, abandoned the idea after 1981/82 (for
financial reasons).
Planting by Farmers
3.10      it Is not known with certainty how much of the activity of raising and
distributing planting material in the form of seeds, seedlings and splits by
TPB and the EEC Programme were actually translated into pyrethrum plants on
farmers fields eachl year. Table 3.1 and 3.2 give theoretical mutliplication.
On this basis, for example, new plantings resulting from the
seed/seedling/split propagation and distribution effort of TPB in 1980/81 would
be 3,084 ha. For 1981/82, the figure would be 1,798 ha (370 ha from the
improved programme plus 1,428 from the unimproved programme). Corresponding
figures for 1982/83, 1983/184 and 1984/85 would be 1,314 ha, 1,330 ha and 1,940
ha respectively. To arrive at area actually planted by farmers, consideration
has to be given to the fact that some farmers also gathered their own seeds to
raise seedlings and also prepared splits from their own pyrethlrum fields.
Table 3,3 compares the expected trend in planted area with figures maintained
by TPB on what is considered to be the planted area.

3.11    The figures In Table 3.3. seem to indicate that the area under the crop
has declined by nearly 45 percent between 1980/81 and 1984/85.  This would seem
to be consistent with the fact that production has also declined (23 percent)
over that period. If the area remained constant (at 11,328 ha) between 1981/82
and 1983/84 then this would seem to imply that either there was practically no
new planting being done or else much uprooting af old plants was

breakdown into "new" and "old" planting is available after 1982/83 in these

taking place. However, TPB cautions against the accuracy of the figures
for 1980/81 which the Authority believes is considerably over-estimated.
3.12    Whatever the correct acreage figures might be there is no doubt
that much of the effort of the production and supply of planting
materials to farmers might have been in vain as the materials supplied
were wasted for a variety of reasons.
Pest Control
3.13    All 100 Knapsack sprayers that were to be bought were purchased
in 1982/83 and distributed to the marketing centres.
Incremental TPB Field Staff
3.14    During 1980/81 TPB recruited 12 certificate holders (APOs) who,
however, proceeded on National Service. In addition the Ministry
assigned to TPB two (2) Production Officers and two (2) PASs the
remaining two (2) certificate holders were assigned to the TPB during
1981/82.
Flower Drying
3.15    The consultants to be recruited to undertake the drying study
were never recruited and the study was not done.  During 1980/81 IRADEP
planned to set up large scale drying facilities in some (five) locations
in Iringa Region and were already proceeding with the necessary civil
works. Subsequently, IRADEP decided to complete only one drier (at
Lugenge) as a pilot operation before extending to the other areas. TPB,
therefore, took the decision not to proceed with the study till the
results of the EEC supported pilot study were known. If the results were
favourable then 'TPB intends to utilize this technology to cm'rstruct the
drying facilities elsewhere".(l)
3.16    Drying machinery was imported and installed at Lugenge during
October-December 1982 and after trial runs a series of drying experiments
were undertaken between December 1983 and April 1984 by the IRADEP. The
results indicated that central drying was possible. However, although
the pyrethrin content of the dried flowers which results (1.37 - 1.99%
with an average of 1.6%) was considerably higher than what was being
obtained by traditional methods, it was felt by TP3 that the drying costs
(TSh 5 49/Kg excluding depreciation) were high and needed to biiught
down.( ) It was felt that fuel consumption, transportation costs of
(1) Tanganyika Pyrethrum Board, Planning and Production Department,
Annual Progress Report for 1980/81 p. 16
(2) The value added by central drying (the extra value of the higher
quality product) should at least cover the costs of central
drying.



- 16 -
wet flowers and supervision of drying were areas that promised cost
reductions/payoffs. During 1985 TPB carried out a further series (22) of
studies at Legenge but the results were inconclusive. A final series of
studies at Lugenge were undertaken by the IRA3EP Agronomist in 1986 which
succeeded in reducing fuel consumption (diesel, firewood and coal) per Kg
of flowers dried.
3.17    Official TPB position on central dryers of the Lugenge type
appear to have shifted. In February 1982, the position was one of
skpeticism. By 1985 TPB was ready to establish similar dryers in other
areas such as Bulongwa, Kipengere, Matamba and Makete "subject only to
the availability of funds". There are, however, two outstanding issues
relating to the question of central drying. Firstly, although the
Lugenge type dryers appears to hold good promise for financial and
economic viability, the desirability to review alternative dryer designs
(including making modifications to traditional equipment) still remains.
Secondly, if the decision is made to undertake central drying would
second payments be paid and also what would be appropriate prices for wet
flowers. In retrospect, therefore, the drying study ought to have been
commissioned.
The Civil Works - TPB Components
3.18    The Civil works in the TPB executed components are:
(a) 7 Grade A Houses, 6 Grade B Houses (Iringa)
(b) 2 Grade B Houses, 1 Regional Block (Njombe)
(c) 2 Grade B Houses, 1 Regional Block (Mbeya)
(d) 1 Grade B House,  1 Grade C, 1 District Block (Makete)
(e) 1 Buying Centre 175 m.sq., 13 Buying Centres 90 m.sq.
(Various locations)
(f) Head office Block 1150 m.sq. tx-ringa)
The locations for the Buying Centres were to be: Uwemba, Ndulamo, Ujuni,
Matamba, Ipelele, Kilolo, Lupila, Kipanga, Santilya, Ilembo, Simbabwe,
Ileji, Igoma anc Lufilyo.
Implementation
3.19    Contract for the construction of civil works (a) - (e) was
awarded to Bains Construction Ltd., Mbeya on August 27, 1981 for the
contract sum of Tsh. 24,296 million. The date of possession by the
Contractor was September 7, 1981 and the following completion programme
was agreed upon: Houses in Iringa (65 weeks); Regional Office/houses in
Njombe (34 weeks); Regional Office/Houses in Mbeya (34 weeks); District
Office/Houses in Makete (26 weeks); Buying Centres (26 weeks). The firm
of MIS Covell Mathews and Patnership was engaged as Consultants to
supervise construction.
Cancellations
3.20    During the June 1982 Supervision Mission, it was suggested by IDA
Mission and GOT agreed that the building programme be scaled down. This
decision was made on the basis of concern expressed over then rapidly



-  17  -
deteriorating financial positior of TPB and general concern over the
viability of the Tanzania pyrethrum industry.  It was felt that a
cautious approach to investments in the industry was required.
Accordingly it was agreed to cancel the following civil works: the Head
Office building; the Regional Office in Mbeya and seven Buying Centres.
Achievements
3.21    The construction of the houses, offices and buying centres is a
catalogue of shortages of fuel, cement and other building requisites. By
May 1986 none of the houses had been fully completed or handed over,
though those in Iringa and Mbeya only required final fittings. The
office block in Njombe was completed in the Third Quarter 1983/84 and is
now in use. Of the seven buying centres on which work was to proceed -
Ndulamo, Matamba, Kilolo, Lupila, Ilembo, Simambwe and Igoma - only four
had been completed and in use (Igoma, Simambwe, Ilembo, Matamba).
Transport/Vehicles (TPB and UAC Components)
3.22    All vehicles were purchased.  The vehicles for UAC were bulked
with those for TPB. The schedule of delivery into Tanzania was as
follows:

was a condition for credit effectiveness. The appointment was made in
August 1980 and the incumbent remained in post throughout the period of
project implementation.
3.24   Production and Planning Agronomist.  The first incumbent (Dr. B.R.
Singh) appointed in July 1980 by TPB did not receive IDA's approval.
However, he remained in post till the expiry of his contract in June
1981. Meanwhile a candidate who met with IDA's approval (Mr. R. Polhill)
was appointed in January 1982 who remained in post till his contract
expired in July 1985. His assignment was taken by the Field Agronomist
(Mr. G.A. Mpina).
3.25   Field Agronomist.  Though this post was originally planned to be
filled by international recruitment, both IDA and GOT reached agreement
to fill the post with a Tanzanian. Mr. G.A. Mpina, a Tanzanian
Agronomist was appointed to the post in 1981 and has remained with TPB
throughout the implementation of the Project, assuming the responsibility
of Planning and Production Agronomist since the departure of the
expatriate incumbent in 1985.



- 18 -
3.26   Other Local Staff.  All local staff positions were filled at
various times. After the departure for further studies in 1981 of the
incumbent planning officer (Mkongwa), Mr. Ngolo who in the meantime had
been appointed to the post of Statistical/Evaluation Officer, assumed
both positions, Mr. Ngolo departed in 1983 and was replaced by Mr.
Mafole. All staff positions remain filled except the Cost Accountant who
resigned in 1985.
3.27   Short-term Technical Assistance.  At the time of appraisal, it was
observed that the procurement/transportation of dried flowers was also
seriously constrained by poor management organisation of the TPB
transport fleet, which in any case was insufficient. The Project was to
address these by augmenting the transport fleet, the appointment of a
Transport Officer and by the provision of short-term consultancy for a
study of TPB's transport management systems and the formulation of
improvements. It was suggested that the study would be done by NIP. It
was also suggested that completion of the study and agreement between TPB
and IDA on implementation of its recommendations would be a condition of
disbursement for trucks, 4-WDV and motorcycle purchased by TPB.(1)
3.28   Contract for undertaking the transport study was given to NIP in
1980/81. The resulting report was found to be unsatisfactory by TPB
which therefore engaged a new contractor (NIT) in August 1981 to
undertake a fresh study.(2)  NIT presented a report in July 1982 which
TPB found acceptable. The NIT report contained some fleet
position/disposition, fleet control and transport operations.
Achievements (Staff Training)
3.30   The two-week training course for the extension staff was organised
in 1980/81 (PY1) at Uyole but this was not followed by any further
courses tillfthe end of the 2roject.  Other TPB s?aff, ho&ever, attended
various courses as follows. )

Pyrethrum Research
3.31    The Project made provision for:
(a)    international recruitment of Research Officer vith
expertise in tissue culture;
(b)    establishment of tissue culture unit;
(c)    incremental local staff (2 laboratory technicians for the
tissue culture unit, a field officer, and five field
assistants, driver)
(d)    purchase of equipment;
(e)    purchase of vehicles (one 4-WDV, 6 motorcycles)
(f)    Construction of houses (6 houses of which 3 at UAC and 3
outstation)
(g)    training and consultancy;
(h)    establishment of three additional offstations; and
(1)    operating costs of the research programme.
C.      Implementation
3.32    Recruitment of Research Officer.  The recruitment of the Research
Officer was crucial for the success of the research programme. This was
realised and steps were to be taken for early recruitment. As early as
1979/80 advertisements had been placed. It took a little while to
arrange interviews (January 1982). As a result of bureaucratic delays,
however, the successful candidate could not take up the position until
July 1983. Therefore, considering the fact that the credit was effective
in April 1981, the recruitment of the key research person was late by
more than two years.
3.33    Establishment of Tissue Culture Unit.  It was expected that the
tissue culture specialist when recruited would establish the unit. He
would initiate and supervise work on design construction of the relevant
. civil works and 4lso select and place orders for the Unit's equipnant
needs. It can be expected, therefore, that the establishment of the
tissue culture unit was automatically delayed also by more than two
years. Because of this long delay, and considering the further time
required to have a full new tissue culture unit completed, agreement was
reached between GOT and IDA in December 1983 to quickly set up a pilot
laboratory, so that some preliminary tissue culture work could start,
while arrangements to set up the full unit were proceeding. Tender for
the supply of the full equipment list would proceed but that needed for
the pilot laboratory would be separately parcelled out and dispatched
ahead to Tanzania by air.
3.34    Because of delays connected with procurement of equipment the
pilot laboratory had not been set up by June 1984, although the necessary
space had been set aside at UAC for it. As at June 1984 all other
documents for the tissue culture unit were ready, the full set of
documents including that meant for the pilot laboratory were sent to IDA
for review/approval. This coincided with the period when IDA, concerned
over the financial and economic viability of the Tanzania Pyrethrum
industry, had decided against further investments in the industry, while
awaiting GOT decisions/actions to improve the grave situation facing the
industry.(l) In the event, the deferrement lasted till December 1985
when the credit closed.

3.35    Incremental Local Staff.  Incremental staff recruited included: a
field officer; 6 field assistants; a driver; and an accounts clerk.
3.36    Purchase of Vehicles.  One Landrover and six motorcycles were
purchased in 1982/83. The order for these was bulked with the order to
TPB (section 3.22).
3.37    Construction of Houses.  Although by July 1981 civil works plans
for staff houses were ready and had been forwarded to IDA, actual
construction never took place till the closing date of the Project. By
April 1982 the UAC consultants for civil works (Covell Mathews
Partnership Ltd) had floated tender for the civil works and had
recommended that the contract be awarded to M/s Ruaha Concrete Company.
This recommendation was communicated to IDA in May 1982. However, during
the IDA supervision mission in June 1982 it was decided that the
construction of 3 houses at UAC coulu be considered as "non-priority" and
should be postponed until the research programme showed definite signs of
improvement. In the event, no actual construction activity took place,
either at Uyole or outstation.
3.38    Training and Consultancy.  Under this component, provision was
made for: research support on a contract basis from an overseas
Institution/university specialising in tissue culture; short-term
consultancy (4 months) to design suitable facilities and draw up a list
of equipment required; study tours in 1980/81 and 1982/83 to pyrethrum
producing countries and countries using tissue culture techniques and for
attendance by laboratory personnel in 1981/82 and 1983/84 at courses in
tissue culture techniques; and M.Sc. course for a Tanzanian research
worker.
3.39    The UAC Senior Pyrethrum Research Officer (Mr. Manang) in the
period 4th December 1981 to 7th January 1982, visited institutions with
specialisation in tissue culture in the United Kingdom and the
Netherlands. Mr. Manang's back to office report in March 1982
recommended that consultant(s) be recruited to undertake some activities
connected with the establishment of a tissue culture unit at Uyole,
namely: identification/selection, drawing up of equipment
list/identification of possible suppliers; drawing up schedules
of operations for the laboratory; and, to make other recommendations for
consideration. Although the recommendations were acceptable in principle
no follow-up action was taken on them. In the meantime, following the
change in project supervision responsibilities within RMEA, the position
was taken (by RMEA) that all issues relating to the tissue culture should
await the recruitment and arrival in post of the Research Officer. In
-he event, nothing further transpired, although the Research Officer had
prepared and forwarded training proposals to RMEA in June 1984. IDA in a
telex message dated November 2, 1982 to the Principal Secretary of Kilimo
had affirmed its belief that proper and timely execution of research
could have a favourable impact on total production and long-term
viability of the pyrethrum industry. With hindsight, timely
implementation of the recommendations of the back to office report by Mr.
Manang would have laid all necessary groundwork for the tissue culture
Unit to take off upon the arrival of the Research Officer. As it turned
out, however, no groundwork had been prepared when he (Research Officer)
assumed duty and he had to begin from scratch when much time had already
been lost through late recruitment.

3.40    Establishment of Additional Offstations.  One new substation was
established at Ujuni. Those proposed for Santilya and Kitowo never
materialised.
3.41    Research Activities.  Pyrethrum research activity at UAC has
suffered from lack of continuity until 1981 when a fulltime research
officer (Mr. Manang) was recruited. Druing the period of implementation
of the Project the long train of research activities that eventually
leads to releases of planting material for bulking to farmers continued,
namely: selections from farmers fields, screening, yield trials and
adaptability trials. In addition to these, agronomic trials (response to
fertilizers, time of planting etc) and nematode control activities were
also undertaken. Research reports were also compiled, including those in
the period ante-dating project effectiveness.
3.42    Until late in the period of project implementation, the only
improved planting material that was available from UAC was of the clone
59/347 which was selected over twenty years ago. It became evident in
the course of the implementation of the Project that the clone did not
possess the superiority over the other planting material. In the Second
Quarter of 1984/85, however, UAC supplied three promising clones 60/70,
65/166 and 65/194 to TPB for bulking.(1)
D.      Road Improvement and Maintenance (RIMU)
3.43    This component, like the research programme, ancountered very
serious implementation difficulties with consequent slow progress.
Start-up was slow and funding for this sub-component was initially left
out of the GOT development budget for 1980/81, because it did not seem
clear to MOW as to which agency should budget for funds and make the
necessary requests and follow-ups. This was eventually resolved for some
activities to get started in 1980/81: MOW posted two staff (a roads
engineer and a construction supervisor) to Mbeya to prepare grounds for
take-off; in August 1980, funds (TSh 200,000) were released from the GOT
development budget to RIMU; tender documents were prepared and sent to
Nairobi for approval; and, work started on the setting up of the base
camp (land acquisition, fencing, purchase of office equipment, etc).
3.44    GOT subsequently decided against international recruitment and
informed IDA of its intention to hire the roads engineer, the
construction supervisor and the mechanical supervisor, locally. IDA
concurrence for this came in January 1982. This in effect meant a
continuation in post of the then roads engineer and the construction
supervisor and required one more senior person (mechanical supervisor) to
be recruited.
3.45    As the construction equipment did not arrive in Mtbeya till
end-Au,gust 1982, no actual construction/maintenance work took place
before then. The Supervision Mission report of June 1982 noted tne fact
(1) Release of planting material to farmers follows an established
official channel. The material supplied to TPB is still within the
trial stages and not at the stage of release. Even so, TPB has as
yet not managed to start multiplying them.



- 22 -
that equipment had not arrived but lamented the fact that important
preliminary activities such as engineering survey of the roads,
identification of quantities and source of road building materials, had
not even been started.
3.46    Actual work (outside the construction of the Base Camp) started
with the arrival of the equipment in Mbeya in August 1982 on the
Kitulo-Bulongwa road. The original work schedule showed that this
sub-component would take three years to complete (1981/82 - 1983/84).
However, a Consultant Engineer who visited RIMU in November 1984 assessed
the physical achievements then as follows: grading - 65Z; gravelling -
30%; and, drainage in (terms of excavation of ditches, bridge repairs and
new pipe culverts construction) - 10%. The Project's progress report as
contained in RDIU's files for February 1986 updates the progress in
implementation as follows:
1.      Grading is 100% completed on all roads except
-   access to Mbagala         4 Km, (0Z achieved)
-   access to Ivilikingi       8 Km, (0%          )
-   Mangoto - Ibaga          14 Km, (0%    "    )
2.      Gravelling is only 100% completed on
-   access to Lugoda road;
-   Kitulo - Ibaba road;
and more than 20% completed for only
-   access to Mlondwe;
-   Kitulo - Bulongwa road
and up to 5% completed for
-   Kikondo/Kinyika/Matamba road
3.      Ditches are 100% completed for all roads, except:
-   access to Izumbwe
-   access to Mbagala
-   access to Mbawi
-   access to Ivilikingi
-   Mangoto - Ibaga road
4.      Bridges and Culverts.  Work outstanding in this regard include 10
bridges and 150 culverts.  Details of achievements to February 1986 and
work outstanding are given in Annex Table 3.
Constraints
3.47    Base Camp Location.  It was considered by some MOW technical                     U
staff that the remoteness of the Mbeya Base Camp from the main areas of
activity was a negative factor in the progress of the roads programme.
It was felt, therefore, that tho pace of the work would have quickened,
had the Base Camp been sited somewhere in Makete District where most of
the road-works are concentrated. It is now suggested with hindsight that
the project ought to have been phased into two stages. During Phase 1,



- 23 -
Base Camp is set up at Makete to work on the roads in Iringa Region.
After completion of the work in Iringa Region, a new Base Camp would be
set up in Mbeya Region (Ileje, say) for the work in that region, while
the Makete Base Camp is retained (of course with a lower equipment
component) for purposes of maintaining the roads as improved.
3.48    Shortages of Building/Construction Requisites.  The severe
shortages of essential commodities facing Tanzania meant that at one time
or the other, some items such as cement, steel rods, roofing iron sheets,
fuel, etc. were not obtainable in the market. Part of the slow progress
in the implementation of this sub-component has been blamed on these
shortages.
3.49    Lack of Funds.  In the course of implementation of this component
work was frequently brought to a standstill for lack of operating funds.
Such work-stoppages have often run into several months.
3.50    Lumpy equipment.  The graders that were ordered for the Project
(equivalent to D8) were of excessive capacity, compared with the work it
was to be used for. Its movement from place to place created problems,
as it required a low-loader which could not be easily obtained and this
delayed work. Its movement sometimes even brought about some destruction
in its path (broken bridges etc).(l) With hindsight, it is considered
that smaller units, at least two, should have been procured in place of
any one gPant unit.
3.51    Inadequate Equipment Set.  Slow progress was also blamed on the
fact that the equipment set was inadequate, given the amount of work to
be done. In particular, it was stated that given the far location of
materials (gravel pits, fuel) vehicles were in short supply. This was
recognised and MOW topped up the equipment set ordered under the Project
for RIMU with five more vehicles (including a caravan), a Simesa Steel
roller and a Ford Tractor.
3.52    Political Interference.  In spite of the fact that the equipment
set was inadequate in terms of numbers, regional authorities insisted
that roadworks should proceed at the same time in both regions. The
regiodnal authorities, therefore, manoeuvred and succeeded in splitting up
the equipment to make this possible. MOW, however, later stamped its
authority and deployed the equipment according to its planned programme,
but not after some time had been wasted.
3.53    Weak Management.  Each of the above factors could slow down the
pace of progress. However, the most serious constraint RIMU faced was
the inadequate project management. Had project management been
satisfactory, ways could have been found quickly around some of the
constraints above. For example, there was practically no "forward
(1) For example, during movement of equipment on the Kitulo-Bulongwa
road, two bridges were destroyed which raised protests from the
District and Regional Authorities.



planning" which, therefore, affected the availability of materials
including fuel and spare parts and, therefore, effective use of road
building equipment .(1)
3.54    The Issue of Lack of Finance was not a real constraint.
According to the established routine of fund releases under the GOT
Development Budget, project funds are released quarterly on submission of
quarterly progress reports. Without these project reports, Devplan would
not release any project funds. It is therefore, up to project managers
to submit their progress reports and to make all necessary follow-ups
till funds are eventually released. The fact that in each of the fiscal
years 1980/81 - 1985/86 there were sizeable unspent balances is evidence
that funds were not a serious constraint (See Annex Table 4) and
suggests, perhaps, that the routine of progress reporting and necessary
follow up was inadequate and reflects on inadequate management. A
manifestation of the constraint which RIMU faced, was the frequent
changes in the position of Resident Engineer which were necessitated by
the desire of MOW to improve RIMU management and thus the implementation
of the roads programme.(2)
E.      Mafinga Extract Plant
3.55    At the round-up meeting on June 19, 1981 chaired by the PS Kilimo
at which TPB was also present, it was hinted by IDA representatives that
the request for financing TA personnel and basic spares for Mafinga could
be accommodated under the credit. However, before final consideration
would be given IDA required the following information:
-   copy of the Consultant's Reports on which the requests were
based;
-   list of spaTes,with quotations/proforma invoice;
-   draft contract between TPB and DK-A together with DVs of the
TA personnel;
-   a commitment from GOT that the Arusha Extract Plant (TECO)
will be decommissioned once the Mafinga Plant became
operational.
3.56    While the first three of the above requests were readily dealt
with, the question of TECO dragged on for sometime with GOT unable to
provide a firm commitment. In correspondence that went on between GOT
and IDA, GOT made it clear that the extract operations at TECO would be
closed once Mafinga became operational, however, complete closure of TECO
would require that a powder-mill be installed at Mafinga and requested
IDA financial support in this regard. IDA indicated willingness to
accommodate this item also under the credit. In a letter dated
(1) An IDA Consultant to this component of the Project, in November
1984, cited the lack of forward-planning as a serious constraint.
(2) The Resident Engineers who managed RIMU from its inception were: Dr.
D. Nyaki (Sept, 1980 - Feb. 1983); P. Chambulikazi (Feb. 1983 - May
1984); Mwaipaja (May, 1984 - August 1984); N. Louis (Aug. 1984 - todate)



- 25 -
February 1, 1982 the PS, Killmo informed IDA that Mafinga was
commissioned on January 20, 1982 and subsequently provided the commitment
to close down TECO, whereupon IDA agreed (See IDA letter dated February
8, 1982) to finance Mafinga for basic spares, TA (chemical engineer and
mechanical engineer) and a powder-mill.(l)
3.57    The technical assistance personnel were recruited and remained at
Mafinga until the expiry of their initial contracts, with subsequent
extension till early 1985. The basic spares were also procured.
However, the powder-mill was never installed, in spite of the fact that
estimated quotations(2) had been obtained for the mill and building and
IDA was by January 1982 waiting for a "fully supported request" from
TPB. In August 1982, TPB reported in a letter to IDA that it was working
on quotations and designs for the mill. Perhaps this activity took a
little too long, as in September 1984, in a letter addressed to GOT, IDA
stated that in view of the doubtful economic viability of the pyrethrum
industry in Tanzania, further investment in the industry, including the
proposed powder-mill, should be deferred, until the industry's viability
can be reasonably demonstrated.  Subsequently in May 1985, during its
supervision mission, IDA was taking the position (backed by economic
analysis) that it would be financially and economically more profitable
if (a) flowers transported to Arusha for powder production were processed
in Mafinga into crude extract; (b) the additional crude extract were
exported to Kenya or sold to MGK(3); and (c) the required quantities of
pyrethrum powder and any marc powder were imported from the Kenya
i         Pyrethrum Board.(4)  In a Short Term Action Programme for the industry,
MALD/TPB saw merit in this recommendation but only as a short term
measure, as it was considered unacceptable to become dependent on Kenya
for any longer periods for supply of the local market.(5) No further
actions took place until the credit closed.
Procurement
3.58    Generally all executing entities (TPB, UAC and MOW) followed
World Bank/IDA guidelines for procurement and where appropriate, existing
local guidelines.  The most significant problems encountered were
connected with recruitment of technical assistance personnel. In one
case there were disagreements over recruitment in respect of a certain
post (Planning and Production Agronomist) while in the other case
recruitment encountered severe local bureaucratic constraints. However,
both of these situations were eventually resolved.
(1) Work on Mafinga started in 1975 and was supposed to be completed in
September 1978. Subsequently, due to problems and subsequent delays
commissioning of the Plant was put at July 1980. However,
continuing financial problems further delayed completion and
commissioning.
(2) $50,000 and TShs 190,000, respectively, for mill and building.

Disbursement
3.59   By the end of the first year only one percent of the IDA funds had
been disbursed. This quickened somehow to 30% (instead of the planned
56Z) by the end of the 'hird year. By April 1986, when the credit
closed, less than 50% of the IDA funds had been disbursed (Annex Table
5). This low disbursement figure resulted mostly from the non
implementation/cancellation of certain components. The dlbursements
against RIMU and Mafinga were disbursed only to the extent of 30% each.
Civil works and vehicles categories were disbursed to a much greater
extent. Disbursements of IDA funds were to some extent adversely
affected by slow applications for reimbursement (RIMU). Disbursement of
GOT funds from the development budget were also negatively affected to
the extent that quarterly progress reports were late in submission and
inadequately followed-up upon submission (Annex Table 6).
Project Costs
3.60   Although complete cost figures are yet to be worked out,
indications are that overall project costs were about the level estimated
at appraisal (Annex Table 7). The total foreign exchange expenditure was
much less than the appraisal estimate. This is explained by the
non-implementation of some components. However, expenditure in the case
of the TPB executed Smallholder Production Programme were at least double
the appraisal costs. Partly, this resulted from prolongation of the
duration of the unimproved planting material programme. Civil works
costs were also much higher than anticipated.
Contingencies
3.61   The Project cost included physical and price contingencies
amounting to TSh 30.07 million (about 38 percent of the Project base cost
of TSh 79.29 million). In the IDA cost sharing component USS2.25 million
was put into the unallocated category. This was later reduced to US$ 1.8
million when some part of these funds was hived off to accommodate
Mafinga. To the extent that all categories of project expenditures were
within the IDA allocations (Annex Table 5), the allowances for
contingencies proved to be more than adequate.
Monitorring/Evaluation and Reporting
3.62   The SAR (Section 6.09) notes that:
"progress of Project implementation would be monitored closely by
the Planning and Production Agronomist in TPB who would submit
detailed quarterly reports of physical implementation and the use
of funds to the Planning and Production Manager and the Executive
Officer of TPB, the Director of Roads and Aerodromes (MOW), the
Director of UAC and the Principal Secretary of Kilimo and to IDA.
Input on the progress of the research and roads components would
be made available to TPB by the Research Officer and the Roads
Engineer, respectively". (1)
(1) SAR No. 2749b-TA p. 35.



2 27
Throughout the period of the implementatln of the Project TPB did put out
quarterly progress reports on the implementation on the Project along
lines indicated in the SAR. However, the inputs expected from UAC
(Research Officer) and RIMU (Road Engineer) were not always provided and
in sufficiert detail. Consequently, the Implementation of the research
and roads components were not adequately covered by these monitoring
reports.
3.63   In addition to the monitoring arrangement specified in the SAR,
the TPB and UAC executed components were monitored by MALD within the
framework of the MALnVPPMB monitoring system for development projects.
This calls for progress reports on both physical and financial
implementation of "projects". Both TPB and UAC are also monitored with
respect to the financial/accounting situation/performance of these
institutions by PPMB. This did not apply to RIMU which was outside the
supervision of MALD. Though some actions were taken on issues that
surfaced in these monitoring reports, the decisiveness, promptness and
follow-up actions could have been better.
3.64   A section on monitoring (section 6.10) in the SAR refers to
on-going evaluation of the project and specifies the role of the
Statistician/Evaluation Officer financed under the Project. His
assignments included, among others: undertaking field studies and data
analyses to evaluate the effects of project Investments; carrying out
baseline and ad hoc surveys in areas in which improved planting material
had been distributed to determine the effects of this on yields; carrying
out sample field surveys to estimate the area under pyrethrum
cultivation; and, to monitor changing cropping patterns in the various
zones.(l) On-going evaluation did not proceed as designed. The
Officer appointed was assigned other duties. In any case, he did not
remain in post for long. Neither the field studies, the ad hoc surveys,
nor the sample surveys owa estimate area under pyrethrum were undertaken.
However, in 1983/84 PPMB collaborated with TPB in undertaking a pyrethrum
production survey, to examine trends and moods as well as contraints in
pyrethrum farming.(2) Because no field surveys were undertaken to
estimate area under the crops knowledge regarding the area under the crop
remained largely uncertain.
Compliance with Convenants
3.65   Although TPB and UAC did their best to observe the convenants
governing the credit, there were a few instances of non-compliance with
the convenants or where compliance was not timely. This is particularly
so with the question of audited accounts of UAC and RIMU.
IV. OPERATING PERFORM(ANCE
4.01   Generally, the performance of the Project was very much below
expectations. Civil works contractors, quite apart from the perennial
problem of shortages, performed rather unsatisfactorily. The roads
programme did not result in Improved roads well maintained. The research

component failed to take-off as planned and made no significant contribution
to the fortunes of the industry. The substantive primary objective of the
Project -- higher yields, increased flower production with higher content of
pyrethrin -- was not obtained.
Yields
4.02   By using the clone 59/3,#7 which was supposed to be fully tested, yields
were expected to rise from their without-project levels of 125 Kg/ha in the
first year and 290 Kg in each of the next two years giving an average of 235
Kg to 160 Kg, 370 Kg and 300 Kg, respectively. The unimproved planting
material was expected to produce average yields of 235 Kg/ha. It was expected
that by the last year of disbursements 1985/86 (then 1984/85) average yields
would have risen to 260 Kg/ha (see Table 4.1).

4.03  8  As no reliable yield data series consistently maintained exists,
it is difficult to make precise statements on trends in yields. Figures
available from TPB on annual dried flower production (purchases) and
estimated areas under the crop would seem to indicate that yields/ha
actually fell, even in comparison with the without-Project situation. It
is important, however, to exercise caution in making conclusions from
these yield figures because the acreage figures are inaccurate (probably
over-estimated). Moreover, a good proportion of flowers are typically
lost through not being harvested by farmers. Perhaps it would be correct
to expect that yields were maintained at their pre-project levels of
235Kg/ha in the major pyrethrum growing areas.
Dried Flower Production
4.04     Table 4.2 shows how dried flower production was seen to develop
at the time of appraisal. Figures of actual dried flower production are
shown in comparison in the Table. As can be seen, actual production
declined and remained at levels less than 50 percent of the expected
targets since 1982/83. TPB in a paper put up in 1985 ascribed the
decline to the following factors:

-   low producer price relative to competing crops;
-   poor drying facilities;
-   shortage of planting materials;
-   poor crop husbandry;
-   pests and diseases;
-   shortage of labour;
-   delays of second payment to farmers;
-   poor t:ansport facilities and poor roads.(1)
4.05     Although producer prices for pyrethrum have increased both in
current and real terms at least since 1979/80 (see Annex Table 8) this
still compares unfavourably with other competing crops such as maize and
irish potatoes in terms of returns per manday. For example, at the
1985/86 producer price the average return to smallholder labour over the
three year productive life of the pyrethrum plant is estimated to be
TSh29.26 per manday.  The comparable figures per manday are TSh46.52 for
maize and TSh240.00 for irish potatoes.(2)
4.06     Each of the other factors can by themselves lower the output of
pyrethrum. However, with the possible exception of the problem of labour
shortage, each of the other problem areas was very clearly recognised and
was to be addressed by the Project, but they persisted during the period
of the implementation of the Project. While some progress was made in
tackling some of them (shortage of planting materials, provision of
transport facilities), very little was achieved in some cases (poor
roads, poor crop husbandry), while in other cases there was virtually no
impact on production (poor drying facilities, pests and diseases).(3)
Perhaps it would be correct to say that though the negative effect of the
low relative profitability of the crop is a serious factor in the decline
in production, successful attempts are yet to be made to tackle the
constraints posed by the other factors.
Production of Crude Extract and Marc
4.07     Table 4.2 also shows how the main processed products - crude
extract and marc production - were seen to develop at the time of
appraisal. As is clear from the Table, crude extract production was
never near the projected levels, even by comparison with the
without-Project figures. The quantity of crude extract produced in any
one year depends not only on the amount of dried flowers available for
processing, but also depends on the recovery rate. The recovery rate
achieved at the Mafinga Extract Plant are shown in Annex Table 9. As can
be seen from the Table, the recovery rate for 1982/83 and 1983/84 has
varied between 19-33 Kg/ton with an average of 29.4 Kg/ton. During
1984/85 and 1985/86 (up to December 1985) it varied between 33.8
and 39.9 Kg/ton averaging 35.2 Kg/ton for that period.  These figures are

(3)  The problem of disease was only very marginally addressed - provision
of Knapsack sprayers and some chemicals. The problem of nematodes is
very serious and practically no effective countermeasures were
devised or have been found. It is estimated that at least 30% of
flower production is lost due to nematodes.

to be compared with 40 Kg/ton given by the consultant for Mafinga.(l)
Factors responsible for the discrepancy between the actual performance
and the design specification are:
-   flowers received in the factory have a lower pyrethrin
content (1.13%) than assumed (Project: minimum 1.30%);
-   loss of pyrethrin In flowers during storage in the flower
silo; and
-   shortcomings in the plant layout (number of extractors) and
lack of continuity in processing (inadequate supply of
extraction solvent).(2)
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     Part of the proceeds of the IDA credit were to be passed on to
TPB under a subsidiary loan agreement between TPB and GOT for the
implementaion of the TPB executed components. The other part of the
credit proceeds were to be passed on to UAC for the implementation of the
research programme and to MOW for the roads improvement and maintenance
programme. Whether the provisions of the subsidiary loan agreement were
kept to the letter or not, TPB has become a beneficiary of the loan
proceeds disbursed by IDA and has also received various funds from GOT
through the government development budget and other funds (subsidies)
from Treasury. UAC and MOW were also beneficiaries of the credit
proceeds and, in addition received funds at various times for the
implementation of respective project components.
5.02     Before the project investments, TPB's profit and loss position
was negative. With the Project, the projected income statements showed
that TPB would continue to make losses - TSh6.3 million in 1980/81,
TSh8.4 million in 1981/82 and Tsh4.7 million in 1982/83. Thereafter, the
result would be positive (Annex Table 10). As can be seen from Annex
Table 11, however, the net results remained negative throughout the
period of project implementaion. As a result of these negative trading
results TPB received subsidies in each of the years from 1981/82 -
1984/85. In 1983/84, the subsidy amounted to over Tsh33 million. With
respect to the balance sheets, it was projected that the long term
debt/net worth ratio would reach a peak of 1.2 in 1981/82 and 1982/83 and
decline thereafter, as TPB repays all its long term debt: TPB's overdraft
was expected to dwindle over time and be eliminated by FY 90, while TPB's
liquidity position would remain tight to FY 83 and improve thereafter
(Annex Table 12). As can be seen from the Table, these projections did
not materialise, as a result of the continued sizeable losses.
(1) The Staff Appraisal Report is based on a figure of 19.7 Kg/ton.
(2) The Mafinga Extraction Plant has also encountered serious problems
in the use of N-Hexane. For example whereas the Consultant's
estimate for the use of N-Hexane per ton is only 30, the actual
usage varied between 48.9 litres/ton and 196.7 litres/ton in the
period 1982/83 - 1983/84 and between 82.9 litres/ton and 166.0
litres/ton 1984/85 - 1985/86. The Factory also encountered regular
shortages of N-Hexane and for which the factory had to stop work.
(Annex Table 9).

5.03     TPBs financial problems derive from factors both within the
control of TPB and those outside the control of the Authority. Taken
together, these can be itemised as:
-   high production and processing costs (fixed and variable).
Overhead costs alone as a percentage of sales have ranged
between 104-216 percent between 1982/82 and 1984/85. This
is now projected to be 60.3 percent for 1985/86 (Annex Table
11);
-   low utilization (excess capacity) of the Mafinga Extract
Plant (although installed capacity at Mafinga is 4,500 tons,
capacity utilization has since 1981/82 ranged between 22-31
percent);
-   low T.Shilling revenue accruals to TPB as a result of low
availability/production of dried flowers by farmers,
disappointing efficiency levels achieved by the Mafinga
Plant, declining export prices of crude extract, and the low
rate of exchange of the T.Shilling to the dollar.(1)
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01     UAC and Ujenzi underwent no re-organisational changes during the
period of implementation of the Project. TPB, similarly experienced no
sweeping organizational changes, except that with the decision in 1983 to
centralise extension services under Kilimo, TPB relinquished that
function to the Ministry of Agric'ilture and Livestock Development. In
practice, although the extension staff so released were on the pay-roll
of the Ministry under the administrative supervision of the RADO, the
staff were re-assigned to work according to the wishes of TPB. The
remaining functions of TPB included crop procurement. Here again, witn
the re-introduction of the cooperatives, it was expected that this
function would be passed on to the respective societies and Unions.
However, by the time the credit closed (December 1985) this activity was
still being undertaken by TPB.
6.02     The degree of success or otherwise, in terms of the physical
progress made in the implementation of the Project, has been discussed in
section III, which more or less assesses the performance of the
institutions concerned. The success in the implementation of the
research component depended on the recruitment of the tissue culture
expert and the inability to recruit such personnel until towards the
closing stages of the credit spelt the failure of the research
component. The recruitment encountered heavy administrative bureaucracy
in Dar es Salaam, and the fact that UAC is located at a considerable
distance from Dar es Salaam was not favourable for follow-up on the issue
of recruitment at short intervals. Shortage of the improved planting
material to be bulked remained a problem throughout the implementation of
(1)   Annex Table 13 shows that although crude extract prices rose from
t19.1/Kg in 1975/76 to $63.2 Kg in 1980/81, prices actually fell
both in current and real terms during the period of implementation
of the Project. The price levels attained were below the projected
levels in the SAR.



- 33 -
the Project. Perhaps the fact that no improved planting material became
available for release to farmers beyond the clone 59/347 (released over
20 years ago) is an indication of the fact that the pyrethrum research
programme at UAC had not been very active.
6.03     Progress in the implementation of the feeder roads programme was
very slow and without maintenance, even the ones which have been worked
upon very soon lose their improvements. The majority of the roads are
still impassable during the rainy season. The slow pace in the
implementation of this component caused some anxiety to TPB, reflecting
the fact that perhaps the needed attention from MOW was not forthcoming
as was expected. Although yearly audits of RIMU accounts were mandatory,
only one audited account could be managed - and this after the closing
date of the credit.
6.04     Progress with civil works in the TPB executed components was not
satisfactory and it is no credit to either TPB or the Authority's
consultants, that only a handful of the work was completed and handed
over to TPB at the time the Credit closed and this is even inspite of the
issue of shortages. Some amount of pressure should have been exerted by
TPB on the contractors.
6.05     At the time the Project was being prepared, it was observed that
TPB's staffing was not commensurate with its responsibilities, which had
increased markedly since 1974. Weaknesses were particularly evident
within the Finance Department which lacked sufficient qualified personnel
and effective accounting systems and controls, and within the Planning
and Production Department, which had insufficient qualified technical
staff.(l) TPB's staffing, particularly within these two departments,
were therefore to be strengthened under the Project.
6.06     The financial expert was recruited early (September 1980) and he
managed, within a short period to bring about the needed reforms in the
finance department-- TPB's accounts were always up-to-date and audits
have been completed (with clean reports) within the time stipulated in
the DCA -- thus it is now possible to know the current financial status
of TPB.(2) Improved systems and procedures have been introduced and
the accounting staff's capabilities improved through on-the-job
training. Other sections of TPB were also strengthened through staff
recruitment and training. However, some gains were lost through staff
attrition.
Performance Relating to Decling Pyrethrum Production
6.07     The decline in pyrethrum production has been observed since
1966/67, when production started to go down from its peak of about 6,000
tons. In the early years, the decline was actually engineered through
reduction in producer prices (1966/67 - 1972/73). Under the Project,
however, it was hoped that with the project investments, dried flower
(1)   SAR p.15.
(2)   The accounts of TPB for 1984/85 were audited before December,
1985. Moreover, separate accounts maintained under the Project
have also been audited along with the main accounts every year.



- 34 -
production would increase. The hope for production increase has not
materialised and various factors have been cited as responsib'le for the
continued decline (par 4.04). However, as has been noted by MDB:
"probably the most important determinant of production level is
the net cash return per manday of labour input. This depended
upon not only the producer price paid but also the amount of
cash costs incurred and unpaid labour required. The
attractiveness of this net return to labour will depend upon the
alternatives offered by the production of other crops or
different cash earning opportunities."(|)
6.08     It has been shown that pyrethrum does not compete well against
maize and potatoes in this regard (para 4.05). As producer prices are
set by GOT, it does not appear proper to put the blame on TPB for not
setting prices high enough. Indeed, TPB has on occasions felt that
producer prices were not high enough to motivate farmers to produce more
pyrethrum. Yet, increases in producer prices for flowers only result in
higher losses to TPB.
6.09     Producer prices for flowers are not only closely linked with
prices of other competitive crops, but also with the rate of exchange of
the T.Shilling to the dollar, availability of subsidy funds, TPB
capability to increase its flower processing capacity and to reduce
overall production costs. The last two avenues for making it possible
for higher flower prices to be paid to farmers are within the control of
TFB, while the others lie outside TPB's control. The Authority can also
influence incentives to growers in such areas as prompt
payment/collection of flowers, flower drying and provision of other
services to farmers, such as input supply. These are areas where the
performance of TPB can be examined, in so far as they affect production.
Cost Reduction
6.10     Cost reduction was a recurrent theme in almost all supervision
mission reports. TPB was advised repeatedly to reduce its overhead
expenses, especia'.ly, administrative expenses which was considered
inordinately high. The way overheads vis-a-vis sales was to develop at
the time of appraisal can be seen from Annex Table 10. As a percentage
of sales, this was to decline from 61.7% in 1980/81 to about 38% by
1984/85. Although TPB managed to effect'some cost reductions, the
proportion of overheads to sales revenue remained very high, as can be
seen in Annex Table 11. The efforts made so far by TPB to reduce its
total costs of production per unit of output are commendable. However,
several areas remain where costs can be reduced.
Efforts to Improve Incentives                                                I
6.11     Flower Drying.  If TPB could assist farmers to dry flowers
through the establishment of central drying facilities, this would go a
long way to encourage farmers to produce more flowers through removing                 I
some of the drudgery involved in the production of pyrethrum, and also

through improvements in pyrethrum content (if this was passed onto the
growers). Progress made in this direction in the implementation of the
Project was discussed in para 3.15 - 3.17. It is felt that whilst TPB
was awaiting the results of Lugenge trials, perhaps the Authority should
have gone ahead to commission the study on alternative approaches, as
specified in the SAR and re-iterated by supervision missions.
6.12    Provision of Inputs and Other Supplies.  The Pyrethrum growing
areas are not adequately provisioned with inputs and other essential
items farmers might wish to spend their incomes on, and this can be a
powerful disincentive to production. During 1983/84, TPB established a
Farm Service Centre (FSC) at Matamba to attempt to ease this constraint.
Although the FSC has not been very well stocked, there is evidence
already that it is reviving farmers interest in pyrethrum production.
This can be inferred from Table 5.1. As can be seen, whereas pyrethrum
productton is going down in every district, production has increased in
the Matamba area, and in the absence of any other evidence, this has been
attributed to the establishment of the FSC.

VII.  FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01     The financial rate of return on'TPB's investments was estimated
in the SAR to be 8 percent and the pre-tax rate of return on equity at 9
percent. The IERR calculated for the Project was 17 percent over a 20
year period from 1980/81 - 1999/2000. These figures, however, were
derived on the basis of assumptions regarding a number of variables
including: incremental production of dried flowers, crude extract, marc
and powder production; capital costs and replacements; incremental
recurrent costs; projected prices, including export prices for crude
extract and marc; rents; various shadow prices.
(1) Matamba production is included in Makete District for
1980/81 - 1982/83



- 36 -
7.02     In August 1982, the IERR was recalculated, because a clearer
picture had in the meantime, emerged regarding export prices for
pyrethrum.(') The SAR had assumed a slow decline in real (1980) terms
from US$47 to US$36 per Kg, for 1983/85 and finally US$ 33 per Kg,
thereafter. On this basis, all other assumptions in the SAR remaining
the same, the IERR was re-estimated to be 12.5 percent.
7.03     Subsequently, in July 1984, a further re-evaluation was
undertaken. Rather than calculating the EIRR over a 20 year period, as
in the previous calculations, annual financial and economic net
benefits/losses were derived.(2) The re-calculation involved
assumptions concerning several parameters/factors:- likely output levels
and prices of flowers, crude extract, marc and powder; economic rents, as
well as TPB's overheads and total costs. The re-calculation resulted in
an estimated annual net loss for TPB amounting to Tsh47.756 million, and
an annual economic loss of Tsh45.118 million.
7.04     At about the same time (1984), GOT through MDB and PPMB in
collaboration with TPB, examined various scenarios in a "Strategy for the
Pyrethrum Industry in Tanzania (Financial Analysis)", and reached
conclusions similar to the IDA study -- net annual loses of between Tsh44
million and Tsh5O million for levels of production between 1,200 - 1,800
tons.(3)
7.05     GOT is aware of the plight of the Tanzania pyrethrum industry -
an industry in permanent decline since the mid-sixties, neither
financially nor economically viable and with little hope of significant
improvement in its fortunes in the world market in the near future. A
draft short term action programme has been proposed which among others
calls for the localisation of the industry and a drastic reduction in
TPB's costs.(4) TPB has indicated its commitment to achieving this
objective. Meanwhile the Cooperative Unions are poised to take over the
procurement of crop. Recently also, the T.Shilling has been re-aligned
with the US dollar. It is obvious that these important developments will
affect the fortunes of the industry at home. A further re-calculation of
the financial and economic costs/benefits is no doubt necessary, however,
this can be delayed till the new changes become clearer, and the Short
Term Action Programme sharpened.
VIII. WORLD BANK/IDA PERFORMANCE
8.01     The World Bank/IDA reacted promptly and favourably to GOT
application to get the Project started and throughout the preparation and
subsequent implementation of the Project was very cooperative with GOT
(including TPB and UAC), in spite of several instances of non compliance
with credit convenants.

Representative in Tanzania, dated 23 March, 1985.

Action Programme, February, 1986.

8.02     The World Bank/IDA identification of key issues needing
attention and subsequent follow-ups served to focus GOT attention on the
plight of the industry. Whilst the cancellations of some project
components were in order, however, it is to be regretted that the credit
closing date could not be extended to enable the key activities of
research, drying and the implementation of the roads programme to be
completed.  Completion of these components would have benefited pyrethrum
productlon and the general development of the pyrethrum growing areas.
IX.  CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The issue of the pyrethrum industry is clear - in theface of
not-too-favourable world outlook for pyrethrum, how to improve the
financial and economic viability of the home industry, given GOT
unwillingness to abandon the industry at this time!
9.02     The Short Term Action Programme for the industry is in this
spirit.  Its objectives are:(l)
(a) Consolidation of the industry;
(b) Reduction of costs; and,
(c) Improvements of efficiency.
However, as has already been commented upon,(2) the need now
is for a decisive programme for the consolidation exercise, arriving at
specific decisions on where to cut costs and how to cut these costs and
also, how to bring about the needed efficiency -- all these, in the new
economic environment of the cooperatives taking over crop procurement,
devaluation of the Tshilling and increasing private sector involvement.

1.0    Obseri,ations:
The DRAF  hoII  coveredi t he P I1UIJ pL IT1 1   q; te sat  fart ory , but

const rut ion and ma i rt '-nance phases.
2.0    Comments:
2.1    Iiming and Release of  -ijods:
Whereas from records the budgets provided to RIMU were adecquate
tas substantiated by balances at the end of financial years) the
fact remains that Development Funds were issued to site not accord-
inghl to the working programme. For instance, 1st quarter release
was hetween mid August to end o' September.  Thus, a loss of not
less that 50 days each Year (during dry weathef) was apparent. The
late submiission of progress rep;orts to Devplan is riot an isolated
reasofn for the project since all other projects suffered the same
fate. Tt is a national budgetary problem to road construction
industr\ r- n today. The subsequent release of 2nd, 3rd and 4th
quaiters' funds also did not fall In line with project programme as
alrrad' mentioned in thr DRAFT.
2.2    Technical and Erqineering rnalysis:
At the initial (feasibilitv) stage, adequate analysis of resourcee
ieed be made to quantifv arid specify the needed equipment and
materials.   Taking into consideration the 204 km, the soil conditions
the availabilit\ of gravel materials (haulage distance, the maximum
fi,e months favourable weather annually and the project duration, it
was obvious that the fleet of project equipment to undertake the
workload per specified time schedrule needed tc be increased.  Such
analysis w,as not made.  Thus the pitrjramme was too ambitious.  No
alternatives like contracting of gravelling works were made.  Contract-
ing could have necessitated higher annual budgets but could have
reduced the construction time. The purchase of metal pipes abroad
for culvertinrg could have accelerated the drainage works tremendously.
2.3    Construction and Maintenance:
RIMU, essontially meant to constrLct and maintain the project
network of roads scattered in three districts. As per (2.2) above,
th- equipment could not cope up with both operations at one time.
It could have been more practical to phase the project into
constructioi; 00u rnaii Itt u ll       :_          , lp\qnft rePonJrces
for each.
Some of the roads under the programme were to be graded and
provided with drainage on:\.  But due to lack of 2.2 above, it was
found lut later that without gra,elling i.e. providing a durable
road wearing surface, the roads could not withstand both the traffic
and run off, thus increasing the maintenance costs.
