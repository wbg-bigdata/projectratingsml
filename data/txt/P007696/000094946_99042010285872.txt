IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
HOUSING MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3497-ME)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Housing Market
Development Project in Mexico for which Loan 3497-ME in the amount of US$ 450.0
million equivalent was approved on June 25, 1992 and made effective on November 23,
1992. The Loan was closed on December 31, 1997. It was fully disbursed and the last
disbursement took place on May 20, 1997.
The ICR was prepared by Mr. Howard A. Jones, consultant and reviewed by
Richard Clifford, Task Manager and Country Sector Leader, Mexico Country
Management Unit and by Maria Victoria Lister, Quality Assurance Officer (LCSFP).
The borrower and cofinanciers provided comments that are included as appendixes to the
ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank"s final supervision/completion
mission, October 23, 1998. It is based on material in the project file. The borrower
contributed to preparation of the ICR by contributing to the views expressed in the ICR
and by preparing its own evaluation of project execution, which is attached.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETICON REPORT
MEXICO
(Loan 3497-ME)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
1.    The project was the fifth in a series of projects supported by the Bank in the
housing sector. The cost of the Housing Market Development Project was estimated to be
US$1,594.3 million with a Bank loan of US$450 million equivalent. Final project costs
were US$2,527.8 million, with US$450 million disbursed from the Bank loan.
PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.    According to the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) and the Loan Agreement (LA),
project objectives were to:
(i) expand the supply of funding for low-cost housing in Mexico;
(ii) induce commercial banks to increase lending to creditworthy lower-income
home buyers;
(iii) support the removal of unnecessary regulatory barriers to promote the
participation of financiers and the private developers in the low-cost housing sector of
Mexico;
(iv) improve the publicly-available information regarding the housing finance and
housing production market in Mexico;
(v) improve the wage index on which the Fondo de Operaci6n y Financiamiento
Bancario a la Vivienda (FOVI) subloan repayment adjustments are based;
(vi) to achieve the aims of the Program which, in addition to the project objectives
set forth above would expand and liberalize the urban land market; improve the cost
recovery and operational perfornance of the quasi-public pension funds' housing
programs, increase the integration of the housing finance market with the overall
financial system and promote investment in rental housing.
3.    Through the achievement of these objectives, the project would increase the
supply of affordable housing to lower income households. Improvements in the
efficiency of the housing finance system and deregulation measures should be reflected in



vi
a reduction in the relative price of housing and an increase in the housing production. The
project studies would provide the analytical basis for important future government action
to improve both public and private sector participation in the housing market and for the
integration of the housing finance system with the overall financial market which should
lead to enhanced liquidity and resource mobilization for mortgage lenders. The financing
for low-and moderate-income households would help avoid the environmental problems
derived from substandard housing.
IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
4.    FOVI's low-income housing program includes four different types of housing
units: (a) Type A, with maximum property value of 100 monthly minimum wages
(mmw); (b) Type Bi, with maximum property value of 130 mmw; (c) Type B2, with
maximum property value of 160 mmw; and (d) Type B3, with maximum property value
of 190 mmw. Middle-income housing is considered to be housing units costing more
than 190 mmw.
5.    Because of a shift in demand to higher cost housing as housing costs rose relative
to family income, the number of housing units costing up to 130 mmw, and financed by
the Bank, totaled only 73,204 compared with 99,142 estimated at appraisal. The number
of housing units costing over 130 mmw but less than 160 mmw financed by FOVI totaled
90,487 compared with 29,934 estimated at appraisal. Accordingly, the total project cost
was significantly higher than the SAR estimate (US$2.5 billion compared with US$1.6
billion). In any event, neither FOVI nor the Bank financed middle-income housing units
using the Loan funds.
6.    Efforts to remove regulatory barriers and regulatory costs to promote the
participation of financiers and developers and to reduce housing costs in the low-cost
housing sector were highly successful and fell from an average of 11.7% of housing costs
in 1992 to 4.7% in 1997. Publicly-available infonnation on housing finance and
production was improved and made available on a monthly basis to subscribers. An
improved wage index to adjust housing loan repayments was developed and tested but
has not been put into use for fear of its market impact. A study of the secondary
mortgage market was carried out and produced useful conclusions which have been
taken into account in designing the new FOVI Restructuring Project (LN 4443-ME).
7.    Although the Constitution of Mexico was amended in 1992 to permit the transfer
of ejido land, the increase in land made available for housing has been much less than
expected due to difficulties in establishing ownership rights to occupied land. However,
the Secretaria de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL) has been working with state and local
governments to accelerate these land transfers. While organizational reformns have been
made to both the Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores
(INFONAVIT) and the Fondo de la Vivienda del Sistema de Seguridad Social del los



vii
Trabajadores del Estado (FOVISSSTE) and their operations are more market based and
more efficient, both institutions continue to provide large housing subsidies. The Fondo
de Habitaciones Populares (FONHAPO) was also fundarmentally restructured and now
operates more effectively through state housing institutes rather than social groups which
were unable to account for and manage housing loans. Rent controls have now been
largely eliminated but efforts to promote rental housing have had limited results as credit
auctions favor blocks of new owner-occupied housing rather than isolated units.
8.    Despite the effects of the 1994 and subsequent (levaluations, FOVI assets grew
somewhat more than SAR estimates as a significantly higher number of houses were
financed during project execution. Income was higher than appraisal estimates due to
higher interest rates and financial spreads on a larger number of operations. Also FOVI's
debt to equity ratio was slightly better than the SAR estimate. Although FOVI now
guarantees 50% of subloans made by financial intermedLiaries, its financial condition is
sound.
9.    The two major factors affecting project execution were: (i) a significant increase
in housing costs relative to increases in the minimum wage; and (ii) the impact of the
economic crisis in 1994-1995 which seriously and adversely affected affordability and
the availability of resources for housing finance. FOV][ reacted imaginatively to these
problems by offering a partial guarantee on subloans, lowering repayment levels and
extending repayment terms from 20 years to 25 and then 30 years and increasing bank
commissions.
10.   Bank performance in project identification, preparation, appraisal and supervision
was satisfactory throughout. Performance of the borrower was highly satisfactory during
project preparation and appraisal. FOVI and the government provided a great deal of
useful information in preparing the project and worked closely with Bank staff in the
preparation of the project and in a detailed sector policy statement with was incorporated
into the project. Borrower performance during project imaplementation was satisfactory.
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATION, AND KEY
LESSONS LEARNED
11.   Project implementation was satisfactory for most of the project's duration and
project objectives were either fully or partially achieved. No internal rate of return on the
investments was calculated. It was concluded that housing investments financed under
the project were provided at the least cost taking into account FOVI's well-designed and
competitive auction system for housing credits, its afforcdability criteria and the generally
high level of competition amongst developers for financing.
12.   Future operations depend upon plans to continue to expand and improve the
operational efficiency and influence of FOVI in channeling finance for low-cost housing
through the private sector in Mexico. For such housing, financial institutions will



viii
continue to be heavily dependent on FOVI financing until the development of a
secondary mortgage market is realized. The FOVI Restructuring Project will provide for
(i) an increase of the flow of funds to the housing sector; (ii) a restructuring program that
will strengthen FOVI's products and services for the primary and secondary markets, its
finances and management; and (iii) the implementation of a new subsidy policy.
13.    Despite the factors affecting the project described above, FOVI has continued to
lend through the banks and has rapidly expanded its lending through the Sociedades
Financieras de Objeto Limitado (SOFOLES). As described above, FOVI reacted
imaginatively to adverse developments to sustain affordability and lending levels and has
maintained a relatively strong financial condition with government support. FOVI is
now in the process of expanding its staff and modernizing its systems in preparation for
the next stage of its development with Bank support.
14.   The key lessons learned relate to the importance of a close relationship between
project design, ownership and the macro-economic climate. While there was a relatively
large number of project objectives, they reflected a coherent whole contained in the
policy statement of the government. Project ownership by the implementing agency
(FOVI) and the government was essential as many of the objectives of the project
depended not only on government support but on direct government action. The
government was closely involved with the implementing agency in project preparation
and in the development of a policy statement for the sector which strengthened
ownership. It not only approved the plans for achieving regulatory and sector reforms
but was actively involved in promoting reforms at the state and municipal levels. The
macroeconomic climate was also important for project success. Rising housing costs
relative to household income and the significant reduction in the availability of credit and
its increased cost due to the 1995 economic crisis had serious adverse effects on the
credit component. These risks were not foreseen during appraisal. Creative action by
FOVI and the government ameliorated their effects.
15.   Overall the project was successful. The problems encountered  during
implementation and the studies undertaken under the project led to a clearer
understanding of the need for greater private sources of long-term finance for social
housing.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO
HOUSING MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3497-ME)
PART I: IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   Introduction
1.    The project was the fifth in a series of projects supported by the Bank in the
housing sector. The cost of the Housing Market Development Project was estimated to be
US$1,594.3 million with a Bank loan of US$450 million equivalent. Final project costs
were US$2,527.8 million, with US$450 million disbursed from the Bank loan.
B.   Project Objectives
2.    The objectives of the project were:
(i) to expand the supply of mortgage finance for low-cost housing;
(ii) to induce commercial banks to increase lending to creditworthy lower-income
home buyers;
(iii) to support the removal of unnecessary regulatory barriers to promote the
participation of financiers and private developers in the low cost housing sector;
(iv) to improve publicly-available information regarding the housing finance and
housing production market in Mexico;
(v) to improve the wage index on which FOVI subloan repayment adjustments are
based;
(vi) to achieve the aims of the Program which, in aLddition to the project objectives
set forth above would expand and liberalize the urban land market; improve the cost
recovery and operation performance of the quasi-public pension funds' housing
programs, increase the integration of the housing finance market with the overall
financial system and promote investment in rental housing.
3.   In order to achieve these objectives, the project had four components: (i) a
regulatory reform component; (ii) a housing sector policy component; (iii) a FOVI credit
line component; and (iv) a studies component. Bank financing was provided only for the
credit line component; the cost of the studies, which was expected to be small, was borne
by FOVI and the Bank of Mexico. The SAR reflected an expectation that achievement of
project objectives would assist the government in creating a more supportive
environmnent in which the private sector would play an expanded role in solving the
country's housing problems by: establishing a supportive legal and regulatory



2
environment; rationalizing public sector intervention in housing activities to facilitate the
operation of market-based housing finance institutions; ensuring that key inputs for
housing production are supplied, particularly land, infrastructure and financing; and
providing adequate information so that policy makers and market participants can make
sound decisions.
4.    The regulatory reform component was designed to achieve objective (iii) of the
project; the housing sector policy component to achieve objectives (ii) and (vi); the FOVI
credit line to achieve objective (i) and the studies component to achieve objectives (iv),
(v) and (vi). The policy component comprised the implementation of policies to: induce
commercial banks to actively participate in financing housing for the middle-and low-
income population with their own resources and those of FOVI; liberate the urban land
market; modernize the housing funds supported by the compulsory savings system,
integrate their operations with the rest of the financial markets and improve their cost
recovery; improve the cost recovery of mortgages financed by FONHAPO; deregulate
housing development, construction and titling at the state and municipal level; promote
higher investment in rental housing; and improve the reliability and congruity of
information on the housing market under a self-financing scheme.
5.    The objectives of the project were clear and consistent with the project
components. They were important for the country and its housing and financial sectors
and for the Bank's country assistance strategy.  Project objectives were generally
realistic. However, policy goals to liberate the urban land market and integrate the
housing funds with the operations of the rest of the financial system were ambitious and
only partly achieved during project implementation. Project objectives were numerous
and required the active support of the Bank of Mexico and the federal and state and local
governments. The Bank of Mexico and the government provided the support to
implement its policy statement and the project and to engage support at the state and local
levels.
6.   In order to minimize risks, the project included limits on loan disbursements to
ensure adequate time for deregulation to be implemented and produce results. However,
the main project risks were not that deregulation would not occur but that a crisis in
financial markets would interfere with the achievement of housing finance goals.
C.   Achievement of Objectives
7.    FOVI's low-income housing program includes four different types of housing
units: (a) Type A, with maximum property value of 100 mmw; (b) Type B 1, with
maximum property value of 130 mmw; (c) Type B2, with maximum property value of
160 mmw; and (d) Type B3, with maximum property value of 190 mmw. Middle-
income housing is considered to be housing units costing more than 190 mmw.
8.    The number of housing units financed by FOVI during the project totaled 163,691
compared to the 129,076 estimated in the SAR. However, units costing up to 130



3
monthly minimumn wages (mmw) and financed by the Bank, totaled only 73,204
compared with 99,142 estimated at appraisal. Because of the shift in demand to higher
cost housing as housing costs rose significantly relative to family income, the number of
housing units costing more than 130 mmw but less than 160 mmw totaled 90,487 during
project implementation compared with 29,934 estimated at appraisal (the closing date for
the loan was extended by a year until December 31, 1997 to complete the project
although the final loan disbursement was made May 20, 1997). Accordingly, the total
project cost was significantly higher than the SAR estinmate (US$2.5 billion compared
with US$1.6 billion) and the Bank financed only 17.8% of project cost compared with
28% estimated at appraisal. Nevertheless, despite the economic crisis of 1995, FOVI's
total housing financed significantly exceeded its lending targets for the project period.
9.    Because of the shift in demand for finance to higher cost housing, the distribution
of final credits costing up to 130 mmw fell short of the 70% target except for the year
1992 (Table 5A). The distribution of auction financing, however, achieved the target of
80% of credits for housing costing up to 130mnmw except in the years 1993 and 1994
when they were well short of that target (39% and 42% respectively). In order to
maintain lending for lower cost housing in particular and maintain bank lending for
housing in general, FOVI implemented a number of changes in its lending policies in
1993 and 1994. It established a partial guarantee system for credits (initially 55% or 60%
of outstanding loan amounts, subsequently reduced to 50%), allowed banks to stop
repaying FOVI for subloans which were more than four months overdue, reduced
repayment factors on subloans and increased maximum repayment periods from 20 years
to 25 years and then to 30 years to increase affordability, and increased commission's
paid to banks and reduced bank capital backing for housing subloans by 50% to improve
profitability. FOVI also changed the interest rates on subloans from the average cost of
banks funds to a rate which was 5% in real terms.
10.   Commercial bank lending for housing with their own and FOVI funds increased
from some US$3.2 billion in 1991 to over US$5 billion annually in the years 1992
through 1994. However, lending with their own funds collapsed in 1995 when the
economic crisis caused their non-performing loans to increase greatly and real interest
rates to rise to very high levels. Housing credits financed with FOVI resources auctioned
earlier were basically the only bank lending for housing during 1995 and 1996. To an
increasing extent bank lending for housing has been taken over by SOFOLES
(specialized financing institutions) which began to participate in FOVI housing programs
in 1995. In 1997 SOFOLES accounted for 47% of FOVI lending up from 1% in 1995
and 18% in 1996. In the early 1990's independent companies, which had financed
automobiles since the 1970's, began to form groups to finance houses
(autofinanciamientos). Members of the groups make monthly payments to a fund and
lotteries are held periodically to finance home purchases. They grew significantly after
1995 with the drop-off in commercial bank financing.
11.   Efforts to remove unnecessary regulatory barriers to promote the participation of
financiers and developers in the low-cost housing sector were highly successful. A
project objective was for 22 states to sign deregulation agreements with FOVI during
project implementation. By agreement, in October 1992 governors of all 31 states and
the DDF (Federal District) signed agreements to deregulate and reduce taxes in the



4
housing sector and agreements were signed with the National Association of Notaries to
reduce their fees to 1% of transaction value. As a result of these agreements, regulatory
costs fell from an average of 11.7% of housing costs in 1992 to 4.7% in 1997 (Table 5B).
States with lower regulatory costs also fared better in the FOVI auction process, as lower
cost housing gave promoters a significant advantage in the bidding process. In 1993
cities with high regulatory costs (over 12%) received only 0.4% of credit rights; cities
with costs between 8% and 12% received 33.6% and cities with costs less than 8%
received 66%.
12.   Efforts to improve the publicly-available information on housing finance and
production were successful. SEDESOL now collects data from official and private
sources and makes them available to subscribers on a monthly basis. It also issues annual
reports with complete housing sector data.
13.   A study to develop an improved wage index to adjust housing loan repayments
was carried out by the Bank of Mexico and the Social Security Administration. The
index developed for the manufacturing sector was subjected to a number of tests over the
years and was found useful for measuring affordability; however, the index has not been
used for fear of the negative effect its application could have on the demand for housing
credit.
14.  In 1992, the constitution was amended to allow transfers of ejido land (communal
holdings) to individuals. It was expected that this would result in a rapid increase in the
supply of urban land. However, the issuance of land ownership certificates has been very
slow as it has been difficult to establish legal ownership rights to occupied land. A large
amount of land has been made available for housing during project implementation .
SEDESOL continues to work with state and federal authorities to accelerate the transfer
of ejido land for housing developments.
15.   During project implementation steps were taken to improve the operational
performance of INFONAVIT and FOVISSTE, the quasi-public pension fund housing
programs.  INFONAVIT reformed its procedures for authorizing housing credits
including taking into account the savings record of potential beneficiaries as a
qualification for making a housing loan. FOVISSTE is also reorganizing its operations.
Despite these reforms, however, both institutions continue to provide large housing
subsidies, FOVISSTE through fixed nominal interest rates and INFONAVIT through
subsidized rates, poor credit standards and weak loan servicing.
16.   FONHAPO was also fundamentally restructured during project implementation.
It closed all of its regional delegations, reduced its staff by some 60%, and now works
exclusively through state housing institutions which are responsible for the promotion,
control and recovery of housing credits made with FONHAPO resources. Previously,
FONHAPO had made loans to social groups which were n1ot capable of accounting for
and managing housing loans.
17.   Also, and in order to increase competition for housing finance, the Secretary of
Finance and Public Credit authorized the new financial institutions, the SOFOLES, to
have access to FOVI credits for housing finance.

18.   Efforts to promote investmnent in rental housing have had limited results.
Although rent controls, which were a serious obstacle to investment in rental housing,
have been eliminated in most areas, developers continue to perceive risks in the legal
system, especially regarding tenant rights .
19.  In order to prepare for further integration of the housing finance system into the
rest of the financial market when long-term sources of savings become substantial, a
study of the potential development of a secondary mortgage market was carried out under
the project by the Bank of Mexico. The study was completed after a series of visits to
other countries with secondary mortgage markets.  The study produced useful
conclusions for the development of such a market in Mexico, including the need to make
any subsidy transparent and fully front-loaded and the interest rates on housing loans
market based.
20.   Financial Performance. FOVI assets grew faster than SAR forecasts (in US
dollar equivalents) until 1995, as the number and value of houses financed was greater
than estimated. With the large devaluation at the end of 1994 and further devaluation in
1995 assets declined but grew subsequently and by 1997 exceeded SAR estimates (Table
6A). Income was much higher than estimated at appraisal due to higher interest rates and
spreads and a larger number of houses financed than estimated. Administrative expenses
were close to SAR estimates. Also, FOVI's debt equity ratio was slightly better than the
SAR estimate (16.1% compared to 13.9% ) at the end of 1996.
21.   Capitalized interest (negative amortization) is now close to 50% of total mortgage
loans outstanding compared with 24% at appraisal. This is due to the very high interest
rates in 1995 and 1996. However, maximum loan terms are now 30 years rather than 20
years at appraisal. FOVI has carried out a number of simulations of loan repayment
scenarios and concluded that any unpaid balances at the end of the 30 year term would be
very small (if any) unless the macroeconomic imbalances which occurred in 1995 were
repeated. Although FOVI guarantees up to 50% of subloans, no commercial bank has
exercised its guarantee rights. In 1995 rather than foreclosing loans delinquent housing
loans were largely refinanced with government support. Due to the high demand for
housing even in weak economic periods, losses on the exercise of any guarantees are
expected to be relatively small and the losses manageable by FOVI.
D.   Major Factors Affecting the Project
22.   The two major factors affecting the execution of the project were: (i) a significant
increase in housing costs relative to increases in the minirmum wage; and (ii) the impact
of the economic crisis of 1995 which seriously and adversely affected affordability and
the availability of financial resources for housing finance. In the first case FOVI took a
number of measures as set out in para. 9 to sustain lending and maintain affordability. In
the second case, rising unemployment, declining real wages, and very high real interest
rates led to a serious deterioration in the commercial banks' loan portfolios in general and
their housing loan portfolios in particular. This resulted in a virtual cessation of new



6
bank lending for housing and FOVI suspended its housing for eight months at the
beginning of 1995. The government assisted the banks in restructuring their loans to help
strengthen the financial system generally.
E.   Project Sustainability
23.   Despite the factors affecting the project described above, FOVI has continued to
lend through the banks and has rapidly expanded its lending through the SOFOLES. As
described above FOVI reacted imaginatively to adverse developments to sustain
affordability and lending levels and has maintained a relatively strong financial condition
with government support. FOVI is now in the process of expanding its staff and
modernizing its systems in preparation for the next stage of its development with Bank
support. The objectives of a new Bank loan for which FOVI will be executing agency
will be to provide a renewal of the flow of funds to the sector, implementation of a new
housing subsidy policy and a strengthening of FOVI's products and services for the
primary and secondary markets.
F.    Bank Performance
24.   Project Identification and Preparation:   Satisfactory.   The project was
identified in early 1991, appraised in early 1992, approved by the Board in June 1992 and
became effective in November 1992 (Table 3). From identification to appraisal, project
issues were progressively defined through a series of three preparation missions in April,
September and November 1991. The project had a high priority with the government and
grew out of extensive Bank experience with Mexico's housing sector. It was consistent
with the Bank's strategy for Mexico to increase private sector participation in housing
finance while continuing to liberalize and integrate financial markets.
25.   A Bank team with expertise in the range of areas dealt with in the project (urban,
financial, secondary mortgage markets, environmental) worked closely with FOVI staff
in project preparation and received important inputs from FOVI and other government
staff. During project preparation a revision of the government's housing sector policy
was carried out based on the National Housing Program for 1990-1994. The project was
developed within this policy context and government plans to reform the financial sector,
including privatization, deregulation, and strengthening of the quasi-public housing
funds.
26.   Project Appraisal:  Satisfactory.  The commitment of the government and
FOVI were confirmed during appraisal and the government's housing policy statement
reviewed. The loan amount was reviewed and considered adequate for the items to be
financed with Bank support during the project implementation period.   The
implementation plan and performance indicators were sound for FOVI operations, but the
quality of data on commercial bank and public sector lending for housing and
information on the urban land market proved to be poor. Macroeconomic risks to the



7
project were not recognized. The Bank relied upon the imanagement capacity of FOVI
with which it had had considerable experience, and FOVI, with strong support from Bank
of Mexico specialized staff, responded well to problems as they emerged during project
implementation.
27.   Supervision:  Satisfactory. The continuity of essential Bank staff involved in
project preparation and appraisal was maintained for the first two years of project
implementation. The Task Manager for the project was changed in 1994 when the mid-
term review was carried out and subsequently project supervision was assumed
increasingly by the Bank's Resident Mission staff. Two supervision missions were
scheduled in each of the years 1992 and 1993. Close cooperation was maintained
between the Bank and FOVI which provided detailed annual reports on project
implementation along lines which had been agreed with the Bank. The Bank provided
important assistance to the government in arranging visits to a number of foreign
countries to discuss their housing programs for the poorest and their secondary mortgage
markets. The participation of specialized Bank staff was arranged to assist FOVI to
evaluate the impact of its new loan guarantee program. Subsequent supervision missions
in 1995 and 1996 identified with FOVI the need for a new housing loan and a grant to
finance its preparation. Based upon a request by FOVI, Bank staff also supported the
extension of the closing date for the loan by a year in view of the hiatus in FOVI lending
in 1995 following the crisis.
G.   Borrower Performance
28.   Preparation and Appraisal: Highly Satisfactory. The Bank had worked with
FOVI since the mid-1980s and the preparation, appraisal and implementation of the
Housing Finance Project which was successfully carried out and fully disbursed in 1992
nearly two full years ahead of the appraisal estimate. In the preparation and appraisal of
the Housing Market Development Project, FOVI worked closely with the Bank team and
supplied it detailed data on low-cost housing credit demand, financing by FOVI and the
quasi-public housing agencies, financial sector issues, land issues, regulatory issues, other
sector issues and policies, the costs and terms of new housing products to be delivered,
proposed studies, etc. FOVI also carried out a number of simulations of loan recovery
rates under various economic scenarios. Work with the Bank team was close and fruitful
and project preparation and appraisal were efficient and expeditious. Government
commitment to the project goals was well coordinated amongst FOVI, the Bank of
Mexico, SEDESOL and the private sector.
29.   Implementation:  Satisfactory.  Despite the economic crisis in 1995 and its
serious adverse effects on the supply of credit for low-income housing, FOVI managed to
maintain fairly high levels of lending throughout project implementation. Initially, as the
demand for housing shifted to higher cost units as housing price increases continued to
outpace increases in family income, FOVI took a number of steps to address the problem
as spelled out in para. 9 above. It also took a series of measures in 1996 to make housing
more affordable to beneficiaries and more profitable to financial institutions. FOVI has
been quite imaginative in its efforts to maintain lending to the sector. Efforts of the
federal government to promote the reduction in regulatory costs at the state and local



8
level were highly successful as were efforts to improve information available to the
private sector on housing production and finance. Project studies were completed and
have been useful in defining the aforementioned information requirements but also in
understanding the modifications in lending design needed to develop a secondary
mortgage market. While significant improvements were made to FONHIAPO operations
and institutional arrangements, and some improvement were made in the lending of
INFONAVIT and FOVISSTE subsidies provided through these two institutions continue
to be quite high. Also, despite the significant step taken to allow the sale of ejido land,
progress in increasing available land for housing has been slow. Nevertheless, overall,
considering the range of issues addressed in the project, project implementation was
judged to be satisfactory.
30.   Compliance with Loan Covenants: Satisfactory. The status of implementation
of the major legal covenants is given in Table 10. Compliance was generally good except
for a continuing problem in obtaining complete audited information on project costs and
sources of finance.
H.   Assessment of Outcome
31.   Overall Rating: Satisfactory. Implementation was satisfactory for most of the
project's duration and the project objectives were either fully or partially achieved. No
internal rate of return on the investments was calculated. It was concluded that housing
investments financed under the project were provided at the least cost taking into account
FOVI's well-designed and competitive auction system for housing credits, its
affordability criteria and a generally high level of competition amongst developers for
financing. Efforts to reduce regulatory barriers and costs also provided incentives to lend
in least cost states and municipalities.
I.    Future Operation
32.   Future operations depend upon plans to continue to expand and improve the
operational efficiency and influence of FOVI in channeling finance for low-cost (social
interest) housing through the private sector in Mexico. When the project was completed,
FOVI was financially sound and lending through a number of financial agents. Lending
through the commercial banks is recovering and lending through the SOFOLES
expanding. However, for social interest housing, financial institutions will continue to be
heavily dependent on FOVI financing until the development of a secondary mortgage
market is realized. Until this occurs the supply of credit for social housing will probably
continue to fall well short of need and the deficit for such housing will continue to grow.
Accordingly, the FOVI Restructuring Project will provide for (i) a renewal of the flow of
funds to the housing sector; (ii) a restructuring program that will strengthen FOVI's
products and services for the primary and secondary markets, its finances and
management; and (iii) the implementation of a new subsidy policy that will remove
subsidies from the mortgage instrument.

J.    Key Lessons Learned
33.   The lessons learned and discussed below underscore the importance of close
linkages between project design, ownership and the macro--economic climate.
34.   Project Design.   While there was a relatively large number of project
objectives, they reflected a coherent whole contained in the sector policy statement of the
government. The project had four components, and while the credit component was an
important one, implementation of the regulatory reform and housing sector policy
components was essential to the long-term success of FOVI's credit operations. The
studies were also important to the success of FOVI's operations and the future shift of
low-cost housing finance from public institutions to private long-term sources of funding.
Project design also took into account the Bank's positive experience with FOVI, and the
strong support FOVI had received from the Bank of Mexico and the overall experience
the Bank had in housing operations in Mexico.
35.   Project Ownership.  Project ownership by the implementing agency FOVI and
the government was essential as many of the objectives of the project depended not only
on government support but on direct government involvement. The government was
involved with FOVI in project preparation and in the development of a policy statement
for the sector which strengthened ownership. The govermnent not only approved the
plans for achieving regulatory and sector reforms but was actively involved in promoting
reforms at the state and municipal levels.
36.   Macroeconomic Climate.   This was also very important for project success.
The shortfalls in the credit component were largely due to the inflation of housing costs
which adversely affected affordability, and the crisis of 1995 which significantly reduced
the availability of credit for housing and greatly increased its cost. These risks were not
foreseen at appraisal. However, the actions of FOVI and the government to a significant
degree ameliorated their effects on FOVI operations.
37.   Despite the important achievement of revising the Constitution to remove
restrictions on the sale of ejido land, the amount of land made available for housing
development from this source during project execution was less than expected at
appraisal. The Bank underestimated the obstacles in the way of privatizing this land and
making it available for housing.
38.   Overall the project was successful although there were some shortfalls in the
implementation of the credit line, in the availability of land for housing and in the
institutional strengthening of the quasi-public housing agencies. However the problems
encountered in the implementation of the credit component and the problems which
emerged in relying so heavily on the banking system, led to a clearer understanding of the
need for other private sources of finance for social housing. This understanding was
advanced by the study included in the project on the secondary mortgage market and on
further sector work carried out in preparation of a follow-up project with FOVI. FOVI's
experience and the studies pointed to a clear need for redesigning the housing credit
instrument in order to be able to tap pension funds and contractual savings through
secondary market operations.

Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits
The project's characteristics do not readily permit the determination of an
economic rate of return.
However, the benefits of the project are reflected iin a larger supply of affordable
housing for low-income households; an improvement in the efficiency of the housing
finance system; and the extension of banking services to lower-income families currently
excluded from the banking system through the SOFOLES.

Borrower's Contribution to the ICR        Appendix B
The Borrower and FOVI prepared a 92-page report as its contribution to this ICR,
including a 40-page main document and 52 pages of different tables as annexes. The
complete report can be found in the Project Files.
The following pages present a translation of FOVI's conclusions (Section VII of
their Report) concerning the Project.
CONCLUSIONS
The Mexican Government and the Institutions that participated in the Housing
Market Development Project carried out their assignment, in accordance with the signed
legal agreements (n.b. Compliance with objectives is described in detail in the FOVI
Report). During project implementation, FOVI resources channeled to financial
intermediaries, were substantially higher than those considered during the pre-project
period.
The loan resources, equivalent to four hundred and fifty million dollars, were
disbursed and on-lent for the financing of the acquisition of low-income housing by
people earning 4.5 times the monthly minimum wage as follows:
Type A, costing up to 100 times the monthly minimum wage and,
Type B, costing not more than 130 times the monthly minimum wage.
To determine the value of such housing units at the moment of sale, FOVI
implemented the mechanism of "substitute values", in which it recognizes the increase in
property value due to inflation, from the moment the credit rights are assigned to the
winners at the auction of FOVI rights, until the moment that the sale is formalized
(titling).
The objectives of the project were accomplished, in spite of an economic crisis,
which affected housing demand by decreasing customers' borrowing capacity, as well as
housing supply, through the crisis impact on developers and financial institutions.
The use of the loan funds was important for the following:
* The funds permitted the financing of 66,477 houses with an average cost equivalent
to US$13,451.49 dollars. An estimated population of 370,000 was benefited.
* Taking into consideration the different steps taken by FOVI to promote the
construction of low-income housing, 44% of the housing units financed by FOVI



were Type A housing units, even though commercial banks and developers preferred
to participate in programns where property value was higher, within low-income
housing value ranges.
The funds supported the government plans to promote housing construction and assist
the low income population.
During implementation, the financial products that FOVI offered to the banking
system were modified to make these products more profitable, aiding the target
population by extending the re-payment period and giving warranties to financial
intermediaries for payment defaults.  It should be necessary emphasized that the
mortgage instrument that FOVI offered had more resistance to de accepted by the
borrowers during the economic crisis. Proof of this is that the default in mortgage
portfolios in commercial banks is larger in middle income housing than what it is in low-
income housing.
Other significant accomplishments included:
*  The inclusion of new financial intermediaries (Sofoles) complemented the participation
of the commercial banks in the FOVI programs. The Sofoles were required to have a
capitalization of 3 times higher than the commercial Banks' capitalization, and a
specific regulation that controls and avoids risk concentration.
*  Additionally, the State Governments signed support agreements with FOVI to
deregulate the construction activity and the acquisition of housing, achieving with this
the decrease of the regulatory costs and, in 19 cases civil codes were modified to allow
the securitization of mortgage portfolios and to establish straight and convenient
procedures in order to face mortgage portfolios in dafaLult.
Based on the results of every chapter of this document, we conclude that the
objectives and purposes of the Housing Market Development Project, Loan 3497-ME were
accomplished and that the Federal Government and the 'Bank of Mexico fulfilled their
obligations derived from the contract of reference.
