NENORANDUTM AND RECOMMOENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPNENT
TO TUE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE tEPUBLIC OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
FOR AN EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR YOUTH EMPLOYMEhT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for US$20.7 million equivalent is submitted
for your approval. The loan would be repayable over a period of 15 years,
including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
It would help finance a project covering selected investments in educating and
training youth for wage and self-employment, within the framework of the
Government's strategy for alleviating the social costs of economic adjustment.
2.       Background.  Trinidad and Tobago's long recession which began in 1982
has significantly lowered standards of living. The recession has also exacted
a high social cost and unemployment, especially youth unemployment, and is now
perceived as the most critical social issue. While the labor force has grown
by almost 43,000 from 1982 to 1989, the economy has lost 23,000 jobs over the
same period. Average unemployment in 1989 was a.most 23 percent compared to
9.5 percent in 1982. In the 15-24 age group, over 40 percent were unemployed
in the third quarter of 1989, many of them having left the education system
ill-prepared for the world of work. Since another 15,000 school leavers are
added to the labor force annually and further contraction of employment is
expected in the public sector, the situation is not expected to improve in the
short term in t.e formal labor market.  The informal sector, on the other
hand, does provide some hope for income earning activities if youth can be
motivated and trained.
3.       The Government is undertaking a major adjustment effort with
assistance from the International Monetary Fund, the Bank, and the Inter-
American Development B.-k to restructure the economy and restore economic
growth. The main objec :ves are tot (a) diversify the economy by
strengthening non-oil production activities (i.e., agriculture, manufacturing,
and tourism) so as to introduce greater resilience to the economic base; (b)
achieve viability in the fiscal and balance of payment accounts; (c) improve
resource allocation and the conditions for growth in private investment and
exports; and (d) reduce the demands of the public sector on the economy's
resources by rationalizing the state enterprise sector. .educing unemployment
rests heavily on the Government's success in restoring economic growth.
However, in the short- to medium-term, action is required to mitigate the
social costs of the seven-year economic decline by improving the targeting and
overall cost-effectiveness of social sector programs, especially for
unemployed youth. Government's strategy for dealing with youth unemployment
consists of helping youth improve their preparedness for employment. This
involves providing pre-service education to achieve increases in the levels of
literacy and numeracy, introducing youth to basic job skills, fostering self-
reliance and positive attitudes towards work, and encouraging entrepreneurship
and self-employment.
4.       Prior to 1987, public and privately-sponsored programs for youth
operated on a small scale. Under both the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the



3
high priority aince unemployment is the most critical social issue facing the
Government and youth employment is particularly acute. This project would be
the first Bank operation in the social sector since the renewal of Bank
lending activities in the country in 1989. The Bank's involvement in the
proposed project will support the Government's efforts to moderate the social
cost of adjustment, particularly on the youth population by providing training
to enhance their employability and self-employment prospects over the short-
and medium-term. Future Bank operations would focus on improving education,
agriculture, private sector development, infrastructure and environment
through investments designed to achieve efficiency and sustainability of
economic growth and social development.
7.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would assist the Government
of Trinidad and Tobago to improve the design, delivery, and effectiveness of
YTEPP by pursuing four key objectives: (a) improving the relevance of
education and training for employment and self-employment provided by YTEPP
through the development of curriculum, training of instructors and provision
of equipment for training facilities and various training programs; (b)
implementing a work experience program, jointly financed by private firms and
public companies, for trainees in order to facilitate their first entry into
the labor market; (c) promoting self-employment initiatives of youth through
self-employment training, with the assistance of the private vector, and the
linking of a network of credit institutions capable of providing loans to
youth for small businesses at market rates; and (d) strengthening the
management and budgetary processes of the YTEPP program to enhance the
effectiveness of its training activities and capacity to program, monitor and
evaluate operations.
8.       Project Description.  The objectives of the project would be achieved
through three components: education and training, post-training assistance,
and program management strengthening. (a) Education and Training Component (60
percent of project costs). This component aims to improve the overall design
of courses which consists of career counseling and training, basic literacy
and numeracy, social, financial and communication and job skills along with
attitudinal development, the development of curriculum and teaching materials,
and the quality of instruction. It would oleo introduce alternative training
pathways through the YTEPP program which would enable it to respond to the
diverse background and experience of trainees. An estimated 50,000 youth
would be provided education and training under the project over five years.
For career enhancement training, technical assistance would be provided for
curriculum development and the pre-testing and production of instruction
manuals for tutors and learning materials for trainees. Pre-service and in-
service training would be upgraded and doubled in length for 500 tutors, 250
Supervisors, 50 Assistant Trainers, and 150 Counselors. A monitoring and
evaluation system would be instituted and audio visual equipment would be
provided to 44 training centers. In addition, participant training would be
expanded from 140 hours to 210 hours. For job skills training, the project
would: Ci) provide 20 months of technical assistance to help develop curricula
and course syllabi on individual subjects and clusters; (ii) help design and
implement short term training courses on the new curricula for an estimated
800 tutors; (iii) introduce a system for certifying the skill competencies of
trainees; (iv) provide equipment and materials to improve 44 training



assistance to YESS and SIDC; and (c) the final draft of the YTEPP
Administrative Manual.
11.      At negotiations the Governments (a) confirmed that MOE would make
availaole to YTEPP, Ltd. the school facilities and equipment, including the
new equipment financed out of the proceeds of the loan, as shall be necessary,
to carry out the training activities undet the project; (b) gave its assurance
of continued financial support for the staff and administrative costs of the
LMIS for the project's duration; (c) gave its assurance that YTEPP, Ltd. will
implement and closely monitor the proposed training pathways in the next
training cycle which begins in August 1991; td) confirmed its agreement to
finance YTEPP from the national budget for the duration of the project at
levels agreed upon with the Bank; (e) agreed to consult the Bank before making
any senior staff appointment in YTEPP, Ltd.; and agreed to require YTEPP, Ltd.
to maintain at all times, throughout the esecution of the project, an
organizational structure satisfactory to the Bank; (f) agreed to prepare
according to criteria acceptable to the Bank and to furnish by December 1 of
each year, starting in 1991: (i) annual reviews of project implementation for
the past year; and (ii) schedules of project implementation for the next year,
Including budgetary allocations. The first annual progress review with the
Government and YTEPP, Ltd. would be held by December 1, 1991, and subsequent
reviews would be conducted every year not later than December 1 during project
execution; (g) agreed to submit to the Bank semi-annual reports prior to
annual reviews, and a final report on implementation experience and project
outcome (Project Completion Report) within six months of the closing date of
the proposed project; (h) agreed that after three years from the date of loan
effectiveness, if YTEPP is unable to achieve satisfactory results in terms of
absorption of its trainees into the labor market or self-employment according
to criteria agreed at negotiations, that the Bank will be entitled to suspend
disbursements.
12.      As a condition of effectiveness, evidence will be provided that: (a)
contractual arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, have been worked out with
the procurement agent; and that (b) the Government has entered into an
agreement with YTEPP, Ltd., on a grant basis, for the transfer of the proceeds
of the loan to YTEPP, Ltd. on terms satisfactory to the Bank.
13.      As conditions of disbursements (a) for the work experience sub-
component, the Government will provide evidence of a signed agreement
satisfactory to the Bank between YTEPP, Ltd. and the HOE, and (b) for the
self-employment sub-component the Government will provide evidence of a signed
agreement, also satisfactory to the Bank, between YTEPP, Ltd. and the SBDC.
14.      Benefits and Risks.  The project would help moderate the social
consequences of adjustment by providing opportunities for as many as 10,000
youth annually over five years to acquire remedial education and marketable
skills for employment or self-employment. Of these, an estimated 1,500 youth
each year would acquire, in addition, work experience in private enterprises
and public sector agencies in preparation for wage and self-employment.
Finally, the project would also foster self-employment by providing practical
business training to about 2,000 youth annually ead by strengthening a network
