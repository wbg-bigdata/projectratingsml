MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATICN OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD T^ THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR AN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of US$85.0
million to help finance an Engineering and Science Education Project. The loan
would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years,
including five years of grace.
2.        Background.  Advancea in technological capability are essential to sustain
trade competitiveness in the internationa'l market. They also help to raise
productivity, profits and real earnings of the labor force, and to counter
environmental problems arising from industrialization and urbanization. Although
the Philippines recognizes the crucial importance of technology, its technological
capabilities are well below those of neighboring countries. A key contributing
factor to this state of technology is the scarcity of well-qualified engineers and
scientists because of weaknesses in its system of engineering and science education.
These weaknesses are indicated by the 60-70% dropout rate from undergraduate degree
programs as students fail math and science tests, a low 50% pass rate in
professional board examinations in scientific and technical (S&T) fields, and the
need for prolonged on-the-job training of graduates to compensate for their
inadequate university training.
3.        Problems with engineering and science education in the Philippines reflect
problems affecting the overall system of higher education. Paradoxically, the
strengths of the system--a high enrollment ratio and dominance of the private
sector--are linked to its main weaknesses--its poor quality and unbalanced
enrollment structure. The attractive private rate of return on higher education in
the Philippines, combined with the limited number of places in public tertiary
institutions, has led to an excess demand for higher education and the proliferation
of private sector institutions to meet that demand. However, the heavy reliance on
private funding, combined with students' interest in higher education primarily to
obtain educational credentials in a short period of time, has led to a proliferation
of low cost, low quality, job-oriented undergraduate programs in fields like
accountancy, engineering, and teaching. The reliance on private funding has also
led to the neglect of programs that are more expensive and important for their
externalities, such as science education, graduate training and research. In
addition to the system-wide weaknesses, engineering and science education programs
suffer from internal inefficiency, over-regulation and inadequate incentives and
monitoring. As a result, S&T manpower in the Philippines consists mainly of
bachelor's degree or non-degree holders, who are weak in practical skills and
untrained in independent research and the new technologies needed by nontraditional
export-criented industries.
4.        Recognizing that the country's competitiveness and industrialization
depend on increasing the technological capabilities of industry, the Government in
1989 established an inter-ministerial Science and Technology Coordinating Council,
chaired by the Secretary of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), with a
mandate to formulate and ensure implementation of strategies for a ten-year
technology development plan. The plan focusses on upgrading technology in 15
economic sectors with major potential for increased productivity and value added.



- 2 -
Under the plan, the Council has prepared a S&T manpower development program aimed at
improving university education and research by strengthening curricula, faculty and
facilities, and linking the universities with industry as well as research and
de'Qlopment institutes.
5.        Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would improve technological
capabilities for industrialization in the Philippines by supporting implementation
of the Government's S&T manpower development program and thus increasing the supply
of well-trained S&T manpower. The project would specifically aim to: (a) improve
institutional mechanisms and criteria for funding and monitoring engineering and
science education, including strengthening the monitoring roles of the Technical
Panels for Engineering Education (TPEE) and for Science (TPS) under the Department
of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS); (b) strengthen colleges of engineering and
science which have met eligibility criteria by increasing their financial and
resource management capacities, adjusting enrollment patterns to respond to S&T
manpower needs, introducing new courses and programs concerned with management of
the environment and technology, and improving the quality of instruction and
laboratory practices in priority engineering and science fields; (c) improve science
and math instruction in secondary schools to better prepare students for engineering
and sci,tce colleges; and (d) increase institutional capacities to plan and
coordinate S&T manpower development programs.
6.        Prolect Descrintion.  The project would have a policy action plan and six
investment components. The Policy Action Plan would cover: (a) the preparation and
application of criterie and directives to improve the institutional framework for
funding and monitoring the quality of engineering and science education, aimed in
part at phasing out over-expanded substandard undergraduate engineering programs;
and (b) the establishment and monitoring of targets to improve the enrollment
structure as well as the financial and resource management of institutions selected
to participate in the project. The Investment ComDonents would support: (a) the
development of programs, faculty and laboratories for (i) engineering education at
five state and 14 private institutions, (ii) science education at four state and six
private institutions, with environmental programs strengthened at three of these
institutions, and (iii) management of technology at one state and two private
institutions; (b) expanded reference book and journal collections, staff
development, and networking arrangements for libraries at three engineering and
seven science colleges; (c) in-service teacher training, library books, laboratory
equipment and facilities for improved science and math education in 110 high schools
and 22 teacher training institutions; and (d) the development of S&T manpower
planning and monitoring capacity within DOST. Institutions to be funded under the
project were selected on the basis of eligibility criteria found satisfactory by the
Bank.
7.        The project cost is estimated at US$130.7 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$69.9 million equivalent (54%) and taxes and duties
estimated at US$13.8 million equivalent. The proposed IBRD loan of US$85.0 million
equivalent would finance 73% of the total project cost, net of taxes and duties,
covering 100% of the foreign costs and 30% of the local costs net of taxes and
duties (US$56.1 million). The Government would finance US$29.8 million equivalent
(23% of total project cost including taxes and duties) through budgetary
appropriations. Private universities would finance US$15.9 million equivalent (12%
of total project costs including taxes and duties) to cover the cost of minimum



standard equipment, incremental teacher salaries, and laboratory operation and
maintenance (O&M). The Social Security System agreed with DOST to make funds
available for minimum equipment to interested project univArsities under its
prevailinC terms and conditions. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 9907-PH, dated December 20, 1991, is being distributed
separately.
8.        Implementation.  The project would be implemented over a five-year period
by DOST, in coordination with DECS, which is responsible for overall education
policy and school supervision in the Philippines. DOST and DECS have signed a
Memorandum of Agreement confirming their respective project roles. To facilitate
project implementation and coordination, DOST would establish a decision-making
Steering Committee chaired by the DOST Secretary and co-chaired by the DECS
Secretary and the representative of private universities; a Project Advisory Group
(PAG) consisting of five experienced engineers and scientists selected from both
within and outside the country; technical Working Groups composed of DOST's
engineering and science planning and coordinating offices; and a day-to-day Project
Implementation and Coordinating Office (PICO). The status of project preparation is
advanced with key PICO officers already designated and drafts of bid documents and
equipment specifications prepared with technical assistance funded under the Japan
Grant Facility.
9.        Sustainability.  The project design comprises measures to sustain its
financial and technical impact. The relaxation of currently regulated tuition fees
by allowing project universities to charge special laboratory fees would increase
their ability to finance incremental recurrent expenditures. The income from the
special fees would be used to create a revolving Science and Engineering Laboratory
Fund (SELF) in each project university. Measures to improve the project technical
sustainability would include instituting appropriate funding criteria and procedures
for engineering and science education, strengthening standard-setting and monitoring
roles of TPEE and TPS under DECS, and developing DOST's capacity to coordinate and
monitor S&T manpower programs.
10.       Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations.  Since 1965, the Bank has
financed US$432 million for nine education projects in the Philippines, seven of
which have been completed. Lessons particularly relevant to the proposed project
are from the Agricultural Education (Ln. 1374-PH) and Fishery Training (Ln. 1785-PH)
Projects which helped improve tertiary education in their respective fields.
Experience with these projects points to the need for: firm linkages between
training institutions and industry; development of rational criteria for selection
of institutions for funding; close involvement of end-users in identifying equipment
needs and testing delivered equipment; and follow-up actions to recommendations made
by the Technical Panels to DECS on training standards. Additional lessons are also
learned from the experience of the Engineering Education Project (Ln. 306-PH, 1977)
assisted by the Asian Development Bank. Lessons include the need for: reviews of
qualitative standards and man-rement commitment in selecting participating
universities; linkages of equipment lists to the curricula offered; and if onlending
is involved, structuring of subloans extended in the local currency to avoid the



effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on university cash flow requirements.
11.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  In support of its technology development
plan, the Philippine Government requested Bank assistance in improving the
technological capabilities of local industries and in increasing the supply of S&T
manpower for both industry and academe. The Government goal in upgrading
technology, i.e., to increase economic efficiency ard productivity, is also the
chief objective of the Bank's country assistan'_ s.crategy. The Bank is therefore
responding to the Government request through the proposed S&T manpower development
project as well as an industrial technology development project now being prepared.
The proposed project would also allow the Banke to continue its dialogue with the
Government on major policy issues in higher education, which were identified in the
Bank's 1988 education sector report, and to assist the Government in selecting the
appropriate measures to address those issues.
12.       Actions Agreed.  Agreements have been reached between the Government and
the Bank that: (a) by August 31, 1992, DOST would install a system to monitor
progress and outcome of the scholarship programs; (b) by December 31, 1992, project
state universities would obtain approval from the respective Boards of Regents to
charge a special laboratory development fee and special laboratory tuition fee; (c)
by December 31, 1992, each project university would create a SELF; (d) by May 31,
1993, all project universities, state and private, would meet minimum laboratory
equipment standards. It has also been agreed with the Government that conditions of
loan effectiveness would be the appointment of all PAG members and all full-time
PICO staff, and issuance of the DECS order authorizing project private universities
to charge special laboratory fees.
13.       Environmental AsRects.  The environmental impact of the proposed project
would be long-term, remedial and preventive. By increasing the focus of
environmental studies on the urban and industrial environment and scientific
collection of quality baseline data, and by improving training and research
capacities in fields such as hydraulic engineering and earth sciences, the project
would contribute to improved management of environmental problems related to air and
water and solid-waste disposal as a result of increasing urbanization and
industrialization.
14.       Proiect Benefits.  Quality and efficiency improvements expected at the
institutions participating in the project would permit an annual output of about
5,000 and 2,000 better trained engineers and scientists, respectively. Outputs from
project institutions would account for about 20% and 40% of the total annual
graduates with bachelor's degrees in the priority engineering and science fields,
respectively, and about 25% and 100% increases in engineering and science graduates
with advanced degrees, respectively. These engineers and scientists would possess
the appropriate new technology skills and research capability needed for technology
transfer and assimilation, and for efficient operations of industrial plants. The
project would also produce scientists and engineers trained to focus on protective
measures for the urban and industrial environment and assure the collection of
quality baseline oata which are essential for environmental management.
15.       The project would also further expand access to improved high school
science and math instruction to better prepare youth for higher education as well as
for employment in S&T fields. The number of high schools with special emphasis on



- 5 -
science and math would increase from the few currently available in major cities to
110 schools spread over 13 regions. Institutionally, the project would improve
DOST's capacity to plan, coordinate and finance manpower development, strengthen the
Technical Panels' monitoring and advisory roles, and develop a sciance and
engineering library management system among the participating universities. With
all these improvements combined, the project should impr i the likelihood of the
Government's success in achieving its goals of increasing industrial productivity
and c ..npetitiveness.
16.       Risks.  There are several risks.  First, the social pressure to further
expand underfunded and low quality programs may persist, resulting in a continued
mismatch between supply and demand. To minimize this risk, the monitoring roles of
TPEE and TPS would be expanded, and agreement would be reached with the Government
on phasing out the substandard programs. Second, recurrent cost funding may be
inadequate for O&M and pericdic upgrading of laboratories due to the lack of trained
staff and funds. The project would therefore provide incentives for improvement of
laboratory classes and faculty, would create funds for O&M and upgrading of
laboratories, and would include a study on mechanisms for financing long-term
recurrent technical and financial needs. Third, a potential brain drain of faculty
granted foreign scholarships is another concern. However, faculty would be bound by
the conditions of such awards that include a penalty to repay scholarship costs if
they decide not to return to the country and, for those who return, an obligation to
work at their institutions for a duration of twice the scholarship period. The
effort to link the fields of scholarships to the equipping of specialized
laboratories under the project would also minimize a loss of faculty as it would
allow returning scholars to continue research and conduct effective teaching.
Further, the project would install a scholarship monitoring system to provide a
timely feedback on the progress and make appropriate corrective actions, if needed.
Finally, this is the first time DOST would be managing a World Bank-assisted
project. However, the risk would be minimized by structuring management functions
around existing line offices already engaged in similar activities, developing the
MIS for improved program monitoring, pro-riding technical assistance for project
management, and conducting intensive Bank supervision in the early years of project
implementation.
17.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.
