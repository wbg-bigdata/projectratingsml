MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA
FOR A PRIMARY EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed Development Credit to the
Republic of Equatorial Guinea for SDR 4.1 million (US$5.1 million equiva-
lent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on standard
IDA terms and would assist in financing the reorganization and expansion of
primary schools and strengthening of the Ministry of Education (MOE).
2.        Background.  The education sector, which ceased to operate during
the Macias regime (1968-1979), is beginning to recover, but the backlog of
educational needs that has accumulated is very large. Although the current
.Government has, in the last six years, been able to reopen primary schools,
develop a new curriculum and provide in-service training for teachers, the
primary school system is still characterized by overcrowding, high student/
teacher ratios, and low quality and efficiency. Average class size is 80
children with one teacher and in rural areas as many as 200 children aged 4
to 18 attend the same class with one teacher. Rural schools function in
dark, poorly ventilated huts without furniture, paper, pencils, or any
supplies.  Under these circumstances, children in rural areas spend about 5
years in school before they are promoted from grade 1 to grade 2. More-
over, rural children fail to go beyond the second grade unless they can
live with relatives in a town with a fully developed school. As a result,
rural children drop out of school before they become literate in Spanish.
The secondary school level as well as university education courses have
been re-established with assistance from the Spanish Government, and
basically follow Spanish curricula and textbooks. Enrollment in secondary
school is about 25% of the age cohort, a high rate in Sub-Saharan Africa.
With Spanish assistance there is now a secondary school in each province in
the Country and all urban youngsters who finish primary school can go on to
secondary school. Vocational and agricultural schools have been financed
by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and about 300 university level
students have scholarships abroad. Further progress is difficult due to
the financial and managerial shortcomings which exist throughout the
system. The Government's annual allocation to the sector is small (about
US$865,000 or about 3.8% of the total budget), and, although Spain
contributes twice this amount, per-pupil expenditures are lower than in any
other African country. Administrative weaknesses are due to the lack of
trained staff. Only 2 of the approximately 20 MOE officials have had any
university training, thereby limiting the Ministry's capacity to plan and
manage the system.
3.        A long term sectoral reform law, passed in 1981, gives first
priority to restructuring the basic education cycle, which is to be free
and compulsory for all children between the ages of 6 and 14. To achieve
the 90% primary school enrollment rate and quality standards which existed



before independence, investments of about US$15 million will be needed,
and the MOE budget would have to be doubled in real terms. To meet the
investment requirements, the Government has requested assistance from the
AfDB to rebuild urban primary schools and from IDA and UNDP to finance
construction of rural schools, and to provide assistance in curriculum
development and in teacher training. Additionally, it has requested that
Spain continue financing secondary schools and university courses. This is
a good strategy, provided the effort is accompanied by provision of the
necessary recurrent funds for primary schools.  About 450 new teachers will
be required between 1987 and 1995. The increased salary bill, together
with allocations required for school maintenance and supplies, represent an
increase in the education budget of abo'tt 12% per year, in real terms.
Since higher education is provided through the Spanish university system,
mainly at the expense of the Spanish Government, it is not possible to
envisage transfers of Government resources from higher levels to lower
levels. Increases in the primary school budget must be made available by
allocating a greater share of the total Government budget to MOE. Educa-
tion's share would need to grow from its present level of 3.8% to about 6%
by 1992, and to 8% by 1995.
4.        Project Objective.  The project aims at assisting the MOE in its
efforts to restructure basic education by implementing the new curricula,
increasing the availability and use of teaching materials, improving class-
room management practices, creating new teaching positions, training
managers and teachers and expanding physical facilities in rural areas.
Emphasis would be given to developing MOE's capacity to plan, implement and
evaluate their investments.  The project would also assist the Government
in its efforts to address the financial constraints faced by the education
sector by gradually increasing the allocations for teacher salaries and the
availability of operating funds. This would be the first large-scale
operation to be carried out by MOE and the first major Government invest-
ment in social services for the rural communities.
5.        Project Description.  Recognizing the managerial shortcomings of
MOE, the project design has been kept simple, building upon the ongoing
curriculum development and teacher training project financed by UNESCO and,
to the extent possible, it has been designed to be implemented by national
staff. It includes the following components: (a) revision, printing and
distribution of mathematics, language, social studies and natural science
textbooks for all primary school children and training of teachers in the
use of these books; (b) Improvements in classroom management practices
through the implementation of double shifts, multigrade teaching and a
pilot program for pre-school children; (c) appointment of 250 new teachers;
(d) assistance to rural communities for the construction and furnishing of
about 100 classrooms; and (e) strengthening the planning and implementation
capacity within MOE. As part of this last component, the project would
finance studies needed to prepare the 1990-1995 development plan and the
corresponding financial plan. The studies would include, among others, an
analysis of Government policies for secondary and higher education,
targeted levels of expenditures, alternative ways of providing higher
level/university education and proposals for the use of foreign assistance
to education.



-3-
6.        The total cost of the project is estimated at US$6.4 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$4.3 million or 67Z. The
Government would contribute about US$0.3 million and US$1.0 million is
expected to be provided through cofinancing arrangements with UNDP and
UNESCO. IDA would finance the equivalent of US$5.1 million. A breakdown
of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Equatorial Guinea are given in
Schedule C and D respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 6611-EG dated April 24, 1987 is being distributed
separately.
7.        Rationale For IDA Involvement.  The Bank Group's assistance
strategy recognizes the urgent need to: (a) support the Government's
rehabilitation program through intensive policy dialogue and technical
advice; (b) support the reform of the civil service; (c) revitalize the
productive sectors and increase exports; (d) alleviate the critical short-
age of skilled people; and (e) restore badly dilapidated iufrastructure.
Four projects are being implemented: a technical assistance project for
Improved economic and sectoral planning (Cr. 1489-EG); a rehabilitation
import credit (RIC) (Cr. 1690-EG); a cocoa rehabilitation project
(Cr. 1548-EG) and a petroleum project (Cr. 1304-EG). The proposed primary
education project would be the Bank Group's first education project and
first social sector project in Equatorial Guinea. It is recognized that
the lack of basic education is hampering development in other areas and
that a viable medium-tenm development strategy requires a more literate
work force. The project would assist the Government in its efforts to
rehabilitate the education system by increasing access to and quality and
efficiency of primary education. Over the long term, children who become
literate would be better prepared to adopt the new technologies, skills and
attitudes needed for improved productivity and improved health standards.
Through its involvement IDA would make other aid efforts more efficient,
primarily through improvements in the sector's planning process, a main
goal of the project, and the training of national staff in the preparation
and implementation of investment programs. As part of this planning effort
the Bank would assist the Government in coordinating aid to the sector by
holding an annual meeting of major donors (AfDB, Spain, UNDP, UNESCO, and
IDA). So far IDA's assistance has been instrumental in focusing the
Government's attention on the need to strengthen sector planning and
implementation capacities, define expenditure levels for education and
define future investment priorities. Continuation of this involvement
throLgh policy advice is important for ensuring a balanced development of
the sector under major budgetary constraints.
8.        Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, agreements were reached
with the Government on the following: (a) creation of 250 new teaching
positions (50 per year) and appointment of teachers to rural schools;
(b) increases in the allocations to the education sector (by about 12% per
year) to cover the incremental teacher salaries and to make allowances for
school maintenance and supplies ($100 per school); (c) completion of a
study on future needs of the education sector by March 31, 1989;
(d) preparation of an educational development plan for 1990-95 with its
corresponding investment plan to be discussed with IDA and other donors not



-4-
later than December 31, 1989; (e) the organization of a meeting with IDA
and other donors, not later than October 30 of each year to review project
implementation, progress made in the sector and investments to be made in
the following year; and (f) not later than March 30, 1988, signature of a
contract with an auditing firm for auditing project accounts under terms
and conditions acceptable to IDA. Additionally, as conditions of effect-
iveness the Government would: (i) establish and staff a Project Imple-
mentation Unit (PIU); and (ii) employ the two key advisors for the project
(architect and financial advisor).
9.        Justification and Risks.  The project would increasc the effi-
ciency cud quality of primary education and it would increase access to
schools in rural communities. It would also assist tha Government in its
efforts to strengthen planning and management capabilities of the Ministry
of Education and to address the financial constraints faced by the sector.
In about six years Equatorial Guinea should attain school enrollment rates
that were in existence prior to independence. In addition, the project
should benefit the rural population by providing a more equitable distri-
bution of social services, making small communities better organized to
participate in development projects and the communities and the Government
more experienced in community participation schemes. Two major risks are
envisaged: (a) the weak management capacity of MOE; and (b) the lack of
resources needed to cover the recurrent costs of an expanded and more
equitable education system. These risks are being addressed through
appropriate technical assistance and staff training and through the
agreements described in paragraph 8 above.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
