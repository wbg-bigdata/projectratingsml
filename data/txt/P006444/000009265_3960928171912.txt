MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A HIGHWAYS MANAGEMENT AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Federal Republic of Brazil for US$310 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 15 years, including five
years of grace, and interest at the Bank's standard variable rate and would
help finance a highway managemetut and rehabilitation project.
2.       Backaround.  Federal highways in Brazil are the responsibility of
DNER which in the past emphasized new road construction. After two decades
of heavy investments to expand its road netw^rk, the Federal Government is
changing its focus and giving more emphasis to rehabilitation and
maintenance, and priority to dealing with institutional, operational and
policy-related issues. The principal reasons for this are: the
deteriorated state of roads, the high accidents rate and fiscal
constraints. Policy changes required to eope with the above, includes
(a) redefining the federal highway network and gradually transferring sene
roads in the federal network to the states, in line with the shift in
resources to the states established by the new constitution;
(b) transforming DNER from the road-construction agency of the 1960s and
1970s into a highway authority to plan and formulate policy for the
subsector, to coordinate the development of the entire road network, to
develop and transfer technology to the state road agencies and to assist in
their institutional development, in addition to maintaining the core
federal road network; (c) strengthening the operational and maintenance
capabilities of the states and municipal agencies; (d) ensuring appropriate
cost recovery and an adequate and consistent level of highway funding (on
average about US$430 million for mairtenance and rehabiitation and about
US$330 million for new construction and upgrading each year); and
(e) strengthening the subsector agencies' capacities to develop and monitor
compliance with environmental standards. This charge in priorities will
require better project selection and planning by DNER, and provision of
adequate resources to do so.
3.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's assistance strategy
for Brazil is to support policies and investments that will encourage
economic growth and social development in the context of macroeconomic
stability. Our emphasis is on efficient resource allocation and natural
resource management, increased efficiency in the public sector and the
appropriate targeting and delivery of support systems to the poor.  The
project would support these objectives by further improving the quality of
planning and resource allocation in the roads subsector. Through its
participation, the Bank would support:  (a) reorganization of the highway
subsector administration and the strengthening of its agencies;
(b) improved strategic planning and coordination for the entire transport
sector; and (c) continued redirection of road subsector priorities and
scarce resources away from new construction to the rehabilitation of
existing high-trafficked roads and to selected increases in road capacity
along saturated major transport corridors. The Bank has had a long-
standing involvement in the roads sector in Brazll, having made nine loans



. 2 .
for hlghways and three for feeder roads. Through this long assoclation,
the Bank has establshed a leadershlp role and is well placed to offer
assistance and guidance in moderniLing road subsector management. Also,
through its partieLpation, the lank would ensure that the varlous
initiatives to address road sector issues started under the ongolng Federal
Highway Sector Project (Loan 2446-BR), partlcularly provision of adequate
funding for rehabilitation and maintenance, would be addressed properly.
4.       Proisat ObjectLves.  The project is one in a serles of Bank loans
to the road sector designed to aseLit In modernlzlng the road subsector's
organization and management and in strengthening its agencies. its main
objectlves are. (a) to help in redefining the federal hlghway network and
the responsLbilitLes of the federal and state agencLes therein; (b) to
assist in restructurin; and strengthening the DNER for Lts leadership and
coordinating role in the roads subsector; (c) to contrlbute to the
maintenance, rehabilitation and improvement of roads ln the major transport
corridors; (d) to improve polLcy formulation, strategic plannlng and
coordination for the entlre sectors and (e) to develop and improve
compliance wLth envlroamental standards ln the transport sector. A
proposed follow-up State Hlghways and Feeder Roads Project (tY91) would
help strengthen the management and maintenance capacity of the state
highway agencles.
5.       Pro1ect DescriDtion. The proposed project would consist oft
(A) an LnstLtutional-strengthening and policy actlon plan (3Z of total
project costs)t and (B) an investment component (97S). Part A would
supports (i) the strengthening of sector planning, coordination, and
policy formulation; (LL) LmplementatLon of the reorganization of the
management of the hlghways subsector and the strengthening of DNER;
(lii) continuation of adjustments in highways cost recovery and the revLew
of road transport regulatlonst and (iv) formulation of appropriate
envLronmental guidelines for the sector and strengthening of their
enforcement. Part B would comptLse financing a sllce of DiEt's five-year
(1990-1994) road investment and rehabilitation programs specifically,
ti) about 4000 km of road rehabllitatlon; (iL) the widening of sections
totalling about 159 km of the Sao Paulo-CurLtiba road which are operating
close to capacity; and (lii) removal of hlgh accident spots on the federal
network. Detailed engineering and bidding documents have been completed
for the roads to be included in the first year rehabilitation program
(about 800 km). The project would be implemented over a five-year period.
Its institutional-strengthening and polLcy-action component would b.
implemented by MT and DNER and the investment component by DNER, a
competent agency. The total cost of the project, including 201 of
identifiable taxes and duties, is estimated at US$759.0 milllon equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$299.0 million (391). The Bank
would finance about 41 of the project costs. A breakdown of the costs and
financing plan is given in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule of the Bank loan are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Brazil are given in Schedules C and D. A map
of the federal road network and Staff Appraisal Report No. 8308-BR dated
December 29, 1989 are attached.



6.       Issues and Actions.  The Government and the Bank have agreed, as a
condition of loan effectiveness, on the inclusion of the counterpart funds
for the first year project activities in the 1990 budget of the DNER. The
Government and the Bank also agreed that: (a) the Government would
complete negotiations with the state governments by June 1, 1991 on the
transfer of some federal roads to the states, submit legislations to its
congress for the reorganization of subsector administration and of the DNER
by June 30, 1991 and, promptly upon Congress' decision, furnish the Bank,
for its comments, an action program to implement the decision; (b)(i) the
Government will have the DNER prepare its annual and pluriannual highways
programs in accordance with policies and economic criteria satisfactory to
the Bank; in this regard, understanding has been reached that the prcjected
balance between budget allocations for construction, rehabilitation and
maintenance would be within levels agreed between the Government and the
Bank and that, in the event of cuts to the DNER's budgets, priority would
be given to rehabilitation and maintenance; and (ii) all highways
investments and rehabilitation included in DNER's FY1990-94 investment
program would be economically justified, with an economic rate of return of
at least 122 estimated in accordance with methodology satisfactory to the
Bank, before they are implemented; (c) for the widening of the portion of
Sao Paulo-Curitiba road currently designed to run through the Atlantic
forest, the Government would conduct an engineering, economic and
environmental assessment (RIMA) of alternative road alignments, prepare an
environmental impact study directly based on the recommendations of the
above assessment and not to proceed with the tendering of works on that
road section before a final decision has been taken on the RIMA by the
relevant environmental agencies; (d) (i) by December 31, 1990, a transport
environmental unit would be established within MT headed by a full-time
Coordinator of Environmental Affairs and supported, as necessary, by
GEIPOT's environmental staff, (ii) by June 30, 1990, the road environmental
unit within DNER would be strengthened to a level of seven full-time
higher-level staff to coordinate the development of environmental
guidelines for roads and to monitor compliance with them; and (iii) by June
30, 1990, the training of DNER and the state highways staff in
environmental control activities would be initiated; (e) the Government and
the Bank would jointly conduct, by July 1, each year during project
implementation a review oft (i) DNER's annual and pluriannual highway
programs, funding proposals for the program and a budget proposal for the
following calendar year; and (ii) the progress on the reorganization of
road subsector management including legislative action on the transfer of
some of DNER's roads to the states, the implementation of the transfer and
the internal reorganization of the DNER; and (f) GEIPOT would carry out a
highway cost recovery study by December 30, 1990 and the DNER would carry
out a study of the road transport industry by June 30, 1992 and the
Government would exchange views on the studies' recommendations with the
Bank and, promptly after the Government's decisions on the recommendations,
submit to the Bank for its comments, action plans to implement the
recommendations.
7.       Benefits.  The project would (a) by improving the efficiency of
highway sector management and operations and of transport planning and
coordination, help to increase the benefits from future investments by
directing them to high priority areas, (b) help reduce transport costs on
the most trafficked roads in support of agricultural and industrial
development and exports, (c) improve mitigatory measures that will reduce
future environmental costs, and (d) by improving road safety, help to
reduce losses of lives and property from road accidents. All the project's
physical components would have economic rates of return ranging between 16?
and over 1002.



-4-
8.       Risks.  The project's risks would be possible lack of timely
counterpart funding and delays in implementing the project's institutional
and management reforms. Following the constitutional decision on the
redistribution of revenues between the federal government and the states,
DNER has been authorized and is now c llecting a fee on all vehicles for
the right to use the federal highway system.  The successful implementatton
of this user fee to date and the proposed annual review of DNER's funding
needs, as a basis for budget preparation, and the adoption by the
Government of a system to have the Treasury (STN) advance counterpart funds
regularly to the DNER, should greatly improve DNER's financial position and
availability of project counterpart funds. There is a risk of delays in
management reform and institutional improvements, especially in the
decentralization of road subsector respeasibilities and the reorganization
of DNER in view of the sheer size of the road subsector and the large
number of agencies involved, the inherent difficulties in getting an
established institution such as DWER to give up traditional roles and the
states and municipios to receive new responsibilities and the protracted
negotiations that might entail and possible delays on congressional action
necessary for the reorganization. The reform process would therefore be a
long-term one. To lessen delays in launching the reforms, Government
confirmed its proposals to .itiate the most critical steps at
negotiations. The project would provide for technical assistance to help
In implementing the reforms, and for an annual review of progress.
9.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the loan.
