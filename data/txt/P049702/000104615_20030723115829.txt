I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
To stimulate private sector demand for skills training by piloting a demand-driven and
competitively-based financing mechanism to provide training and one-stop shopping for employers.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
1.      The project has three components.

    Component 1. Awareness, Promotion and Outreach Program, and Monitoring and Evaluation
    (US$1.7 million)

    The purpose of this component will be to stimulate private sector demand for training and
    competitively-based responses of training providers to private sector demand. It will also evaluate
    project outcomes. The project will target three sectors of the economy--manufacturing, construction,
    and tourism--and the small and, especially, medium-sized private sector firms (SMEs) and employer
    federations and business associations in these sectors. The selection of these three sectors was based
    on labor market surveys carried out in 2001 under the PHRD grant for the project. As Annex 2
    shows, SMEs dominate each of the three sectors.

    1.A. Awareness, Promotion, and Outreach.            Training demand--particularly informed training
    demand--is poorly developed in small and medium-sized firms and business associations. This
    component supports an awareness campaign and other promotional activities to acquaint firms and
    associations in the selected sectors with the training opportunities available under the SDP. The
    campaign will clarify the criteria that: i) the project will use to select training proposals for funding,
    and ii) intermediary organizations will use in deciding whether to include a particular firm's proposal
    in their aggregate training proposal.        This component also finances technical assistance to
    intermediary organizations to develop their training proposals; and includes help in conducting skill
    needs surveys, training needs assessments, costing of the training needed, and surveys of qualified
    local providers. It also includes technical assistance to training providers, as public sector providers
    especially, are inexperienced in competitive tendering processes and in writing realistic proposals.
    The implementation of this component will be guided by a communications strategy developed for
    the project.

    1.B. Monitoring and Evaluation. Systematic measurement of outputs and outcomes is an essential

                                                                                                    ISDS



element of a pilot project that is designed to test policies. The key performance indicators for the
project are described in Section A2. This sub-component will finance consulting services and
technical assistance to carry out the instrument design (such as surveys of employers and business
associations, tracer surveys), and data collection needed to track these project outcomes and
contingencies. This component focuses on project outcomes and is in addition to the standard
project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) that the Project Management Unit (PMU) will undertake
as part of component 3.

Component 2. Cost-Shared Financing Mechanism (US$16 million)

Under this component, the project will finance training services on a cost sharing basis with
beneficiary firms. This will be done through selected Project Intermediaries (PI) in the tourism,
manufacturing and construction sectors for short term (less than six months) production related
training. Targeted geographical areas are those with large clusters of firms in the selected sectors,
and with business associations that are active in these areas and have some experience delivering
training to member firms.         These criteria may be modified during the course of project
implementation. Training funds may be used to support the following activities:( i) in-service
training; and (ii) training for newly recruited employees.

PIs will submit proposals for training funds to the PMU, and the PMU will evaluate these proposals
according to specified and advertised criteria. These criteria are specified in the Operational Manual
for the SDP. One key criterion is that firms will contribute a share (10-40 percent) to the total costs
of the training. A second will be that PIs must allow non-member firms to be included in their
training proposals. Except for winning PIs that propose to provide training in-house, the PI will
conduct simplified competitive bidding for public or private training providers. Training will be
based on the competency standards already developed and in use by business associations and
federations for these sectors. The PI or sector-relevant business association or federation will award
training certificates to graduates who meet the competency standards.

PIs vary in their capacities to deliver training services to their member firms. Some, such as the 14
investors' associations and the Tourism and the Construction Federations, have developed expertise
in delivering training services. Others are at a less advanced stage of development. However, even
the most advanced lack the capacity to absorb an additional training program like the SDP. Thus this
component will also finance the incremental operating cost (staff, equipment, materials, supplies,
transport, and consultants) that PIs selected for inclusion in the project incur. This will give them the
capacity to deliver the training services envisaged under the project as well as provide capacity
building of a longer term nature.

Component 3. Project management and M&E (US$0.6 million).

This component will finance the establishment cost and operating budget for the Project
Management Unit (PMU). It includes all staffing costs, equipment, materials, supplies and office
space, as well as consultant assistance to ensure effective operation and monitoring and evaluation.
To discriminate between design and implementation problems with the SDP and to maximize
learning from this pilot, M&E will focus on the measurement of key inputs, processes, and outputs.
This includes: a) evaluations of the training provided by contracted providers relative to the training
specifications listed in provision contracts; and b) analyses of data from components 1B and 2 to
establish benchmarks for demand-driven training, such as benchmarks for the costs of different types
of training.
