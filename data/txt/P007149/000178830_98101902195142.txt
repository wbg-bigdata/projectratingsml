INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEEMPA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR
FOR A POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Comision Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa (CEL) with the
guarantee of the Republic of El Salvador for the equivalent of $27.3
million to help finance a power project. The loan would have a term of
25 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent
per annum. The Inter-American Development Bank would be a co-lender.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled '"Current Economic Position and Prospects of
El Salvador" (CA-12a) was distributed to the Executive Directors in
October 1971; and an updating economic report is now under preparation.
The report focusses on the need for a continuing effort to diversify
and strengthen the economy and on the strategic role which the Govern-
ment intends to play, especially by improving planning and public admin-
istration, in order to raise public development expenditure and domestic
resource mobilization well above the present low levels. The memorandum
also stresses the need for spreading the benefits of economic growth
more widely, especially through projects and public services in rural
areas. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        A serious imbalance between a rapidly growing population and
meager natural resources makes the solution of development problems in
El Salvador both urgent and difficult. In recent years population has
been growing at about 3.6 percent annually (excluding the return of
refugees from Honduras); the 1971 population of 3.6 million is expected
to double by 1990 and exceed 10 million by the end of this century if
no action is taken to change past trends. The present low per capita
availability of cultivable land for the rural population (about 0.3
hectare) will decrease further, even assuming substantial migration
from rural to urban areas. Known mineral resources are scant, and
fishing on the Pacific is limited to the narrow continental shelf.
4.        On the other hand, the country's principal asset, a group of
dynamic entrepreneurs and a labor force with a demonstrated ability to
acquire skills rapidly, have enabled the economy to expand rapidly be-
tween 1960 and 1967 -- averaging almost 7 percent annually -- as a re-
sult of a surge in production of cotton and of manufactures for the Cen-
tral American Common Market (CACM). This human asset and a satisfac-
tory transport network and electric power gave El Salvador's industry
a head-start within the Central American Common Market. The contribu-
tion of manufacturing to the gross domestic product increased from 15
percent to almost 20 percent during the sixties.



- 2 -
5.        Nevertheless, the economy continued to depend heavily on coffee
and cotton as the major sources of domestic production and export earn-
ings. When in 1967 cotton prices fell and volume produced was reduced
to half its 1965 peak level, as a result of disease and abandonment of
marginal lands, economic growth slowed down markedly. The cotton crisis
and the weakness of the international coffee market held back the growth
of export earnings to only about 1-2 percent annually from 1966 to 1969.
The conflict with Honduras in 1969 represented another setback for the
economy. Exports to the Common Market declined as the border with Honduras
was shut off and expensive arrangements had to be undertaken for shipments
to Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The end of the export boom of the early six-
ties and the Common Market's problems led to sharp declined in domestic
saving and private investment. As a result of these adverse factors, the
growth rate of the economy fell to about 4.0 percent annually during
1968-1972. In the face of the normal population growth, plus the return
in 1969-1970 of about 70,000 Salvadoran migrants from Honduras, this
amounted to little more than stagnation of the real per capita income
which was at $300 in 1970. L
6.        So far, most of the benefits of economic growth have been
unevenly distributed, and social problems are serious. Estimates for
1965-67 indicate that the top 10 percent of income recipients received
42 percent of total income; 2 percent of land-owners hold almost two-
thirds of agricultural land; and, at the other extreme of the scale,
about 90 percent of farms are smaller than 2 ha. Large-size coffee
and cotton farms provide employment to peasants only for about 150 days
per year, and the abundant labor supply has kept agricultural wages at
a bare subsistence level over a long period. Less than half of the labor
potential in the peasant sector -- which accounts for 60 percent of the
population -- is estimated to be employed for a reasonable proportion of
the year, and most rural incomes are below $50 per capita per annum.
Very poor health, nutrition and housing conditions further accentuate
the difficult situation in the peasant sector. According to data pre-
pared by the FAO, the average per capita nutritional supply in El Salvador
in 1966 was 1,8h0 calories per day - the lowest level in Latin America,
except for Haiti - and the average daily per capita protein intake was
44 grams, compared to a mean for Latin America of about 57 grams.   About
one-half of the population over ten years of age is illiterate. Poverty
and pressure on land are driving growing numbers to urban areas, where
living conditions are marginally better.
7.        The medium-term growth outlook has recently improved as a re-
sult of higher international prices of coffee and cotton -- the major
products exported outside the CACM -- the development by commercial
producers of meat exports to the United States, and the beginning of
negotiations of a new Common Market treaty which has reopened the door
for full economic integration of the five Central American countries.
The growth rate, however, is likely to remain modest, around 5.5 per-
cent yearly in the medium term. There has been a chronic and worsening
1/ Calculated on the basis of the World Bank Atlas methodology.



problem of large coffee stocks - presently under 60 percent of the aver-
age yearly crop. In 1972, when world market prices rose, the overhang
of stocks was temporarily relieved by a waiver of El Salvador's coffee
quota in the International Coffee Agreement and special quota increases.
The breakdown of the agreement on quotas in December ].972 offers El
Salvador the possibility of reducing its high level of coffee inventor-
ies. If a new agreement on quotas is negotiated in 1973, El Salvador
intends to request a substantial increase in its quota.
b.        In the longer term, scarcity of land and absence of other
natural resources limit the growth potential, while prices for the major
agricultural exports are expected to be somewhat less favorable. None-
theless, there is scope for considerable strengthening of the economy by
developing industry and non-traditional agriculture aimed at the world
rnarkets.  Govern-ment action is needed to support these initial efforts.
The regulations to implement the existing export promotion law of Novem-
ber 1970, granting special incentives to new labor intensive export in-
dustries, facilitating the availability of credits and insurance, are
now under consideration by the Government. The long-term viability of
the econory will also depend on well-designed population policies, a
more equitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and
better health, nutritional and living standards for most of the population.
'J.       The Government's policies through the sixties were geared al-
most exclusively to maintaining price stability and avoiding foreign ex-
change difficulties, without sufficient emphasis on economic development
and diversification. Fiscal and financial stability permitted the pri-
vate sector to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the crea-
tion of the Common Market and the cotton boom. But a low level of tax
revenues, at about 10 percent of GDP, and weak project preparation lim-
ited severely the use of long-term foreign finanoing, and public invest-
ment remained lo-.. However, during the last three years the Government
has shown an increasing awareness of the gravity of development problems,
and has introduced a number of reforms, including an increase in the tax
on commercial transactions (the first step in a long-studied plan of tax
reforms), incentives for exports outside Central America, an irrigation
law, a banking law and a new commercial code. The Government has also
encouraged family planning and provided advisory services in its clinics.
10.       The outlook for progress in solving the social and economic
problems of El Salvador has improved under the Acministration which took
office in July 1972 and is showing dynamism and determination. The Gov-
ernment party can count on more than two-thirds of the votes in Congress,
and this has already resulted in a rapid approval of important legisla-
tion and equally rapid approval of foreign loans. Congress' past reluc-
tance to approve loans had been a major obstacle facing the Bank and
other development lenders. The President has demonstrated his support
for economic and social reforms through the preparation of a Develop-
ment Plan for 1973-77, which has been thoroughly discussed with all agenc-
ies concerned, and approved by the Cabinet.



11.       The Development Plan calls for the doubling of the share of
public investment expenditures in GDP from 2.5 percent in 1967-70 to about
5 percent in the late seventies to support progress towards expanding and
diversifying the economy arid, at the same time, providing a more even
distribution of the benefit;s of economic growth. Agriculture - including
irrigation schemes, credit programs, and better extension services aimed at
small and medium farmers - accounts for 13 percent of the investment program.
Transport, power and telecommunications would absorb about one-third of the
investment program. In the recent past, the Government has been receptive
towards economic policy recommendations made in Bank reports, and the 1973-77
Plan reflects many of the Biank's recommendations. We intend to maintain an
intensive dialogue with the new Administration, stressing the specific mea-
sures needed to implement the Plan, such as fiscal and agrarian reforms, and
accelerated project preparation.
12.       To finance such a program Central Government current revenues
would have to increase at about 9.5 percent annually in 1973-77 to a level
of 13 percent of GDP in 1977, compared to less than 11 percent in 1970-71.
A variety of new fiscal measures have already been studied and offer a wide
choice of means to achieve the necessary increase, especially in the area of
capital gains, real estate, property transfers, export taxes, better tax
administration, particularly of sales, income and property taxes, and pricing
of public services, especially water and sewerage rates.
13.           El Salvador's public external debt at the end of 1971 totalled
$134 million (including undisbursed loans of $42 million). Apart from the
Bank, external financing has been principally provided by USAID, the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB) and the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration (CABEI). These funds were usually obtained at very soft terms.
The IDB has made loans for housing, water and sewerage, ports, highways,
agricultural credit, industry, higher education and municipal markets. USAID
has financed health centers, primary education, housing, and industry. CABEI
has financed industry and also highway and telecommunications projects of
importance for the Central American network. The past lending of these
agencies is summarized below.

l)1.     JUSAID and the Bank Group, which each held roughly one-third
of the debt repayable in foreign currency at the end of 1972, are El
Salvador's largest external creditors. USAID now plans to reduce its
lending and focus mainly on technical assistance while IDB intends to
expand its operations and drop past limitations on the sectors eligible
for loans from its Fund for Special Operations. Most of the external
financing of the development plan will need to be provided on soft terms,
in view of El Salvador's poverty and low per capita income, the serious
imbalance between natural resources and population, and the uncertain
long-term prospects of its main exports. However, El Salvador's tradi-
tionally low debt service ratio gives the Government some margin for
borrowing abroad on conventional terms. Assuming that the bulk of ex-
ternal borrowing is on concessionary terms the debt service ratio would
be only about 5 percent in 1977 compared with 6.2 percent in 1971.
15.       A $250,000 claim of British bondholders in respect to debt
owed by the Salvador Railway Company arose when the Company's assets
were transferred to the Republic of El Salvador in 1962. About two
years ago a mutually acceptable settlement of the claim was agreed
upon, under which payments were to be made in public bonds to the
British bondholders. The Government has assured us that the transac-
tiorl will be completed shortly.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
16.       El Salvador has to date received ten Bank loans and two IDA
credits, totalling $51.0 million net of cancellations. The last opera-
tion, a loan for telecommunications, amounting to $9.5 million, was
signed in April 1972. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of February 28, 1973, and
notes on the execution of on-going projects.
17-       In the past, the Bank Group assisted El Salvador in those areas
where it had special competence or where finance on softer terms from
other development agencies was unavailable. Thus, the Bank Group financed
infrastructure investment such as power, roads and telecommunications
and, to a lesser extent, education. Together with IDB and CABEI the Bank
assisted the development of El Salvador's arterial highway system. A
close relationship between the Bank and El Salvador's public power agency
(CEL) helped the latter to develop into one of the most efficient power
companies in Central America. The Bank's effort in instii;ution building
is also beginning to show results with respect to the national telecom-
munications agency, ANTEL.
ld.       Prospective Bank Group assistance to El Salvador is in high
priority fields in which other agencies are not equipped or willing to
operate such as education, sites and services for very low income hous-
ing, family planning and possibly, nutrition. Projects in all of these
fields are now under preparation. In addition, the Bank Group would
help in meeting the,growing resource requirements in power and telecommu-
nications, possibly in joint operations with other agencies, and in
strengthening institutions, particularly ANTEL.



19.        IFC has made two investments in El Salvador.   The first, a
$140,000 loan in 1959 to Industrial Textiles, S.A., has been completely
repaid. The second, a $233,000 equity investment and a $600,000 loan
to Hoteles de Centro America, S.A., in 1969, was for a hotel project
that was completed in September 1972. No other investments are under
consideration at present.
P;AT III -     P2 O pC,r3t Sd'GTiUR
20.     An adequate and reliable supply o. power has played a key role
in the industrial growth of the 19SO's in El Salvador.   During the last
ten years, energy consumption has shown an average annual growth rate
of 11.5 percent, reflec-ting continuing industrial expansion, rapid urbani-
zation and a sustained effort at rural electrification.   Nevertheless,
only about 25 percent of all households have electric power.    In the sarne
decade electric energy production increased by ab,ut 168 percent, reach-
ing a level of 711.8 GlTh in 1971 and the total number of custormiers irn-
creased by 92 percent to 178,000.   Generating c-apacity reached about 186 ,r.
in i1971;  the per capita enlergy consumption of 1 93 k;;'h in 1 971 is about
the average for Central America.
21.    i,,bout 92 rercen-t of electric power is generated by CEL, an
autonomous public agency which was established in 1 945 to develop the
country's power resources.   The remaiIning o percent was provided by:
a) the Compania de Allumbrado Electrico de San Salvador (C;ESS) -- a
subsidiary of the Canadian International Powqer Conp,any of Liontreal --
(3 percent) and, b) by eight smaller utilities (5 parcent).   T7ith the
assistance of the Bank, CEL has been able to provide practically all
generating and transmission facilities since 1954, and has intercormected
all the private companies serving El Salvador.   Retail distribution is
done almost entirely by private cornpanies which provide an adequate serv-
ice.  The most important one is C.A SS which accounts for more than three-
quarters of the retail sndes of energy.
22.     In 1961, CEL started a village electrification prograrm to pro-
vide electricity to rural zones not served by the private companies.
Practically all villages of 100 inhabitants or more are now connected
to the main network. UTnder this program, CEL has built more than 1,000 km
of 13 kV lines and practically all the distribution facilities in the
villages to which service has been extended. Because the majority of
potential rural customers still do not have electricity in their homes,
CEL will provide more distribution works, will coordinate its promo-
tion efforts under a centralized rural electrification office, and
will study a program to assist low-income homeowners in installing basic
interior wiring.  The expanded program will be funded by an annual con-
tribution of $520,000 from the Government, which derives this amount from
the difference between the service payments it receives from CEL on the
funds relent under Credit No. 227 of January 1971 and the service due the
Association. The Bank has made available about $80,000 in research funds
for a pilot study of the social costs and benefits of the village elec-
trification program. The pilot study is being carried out by the Univ-
ersidad Jose Simeon Canias in San Salvador. The study started in 1972
and is scheduled for completion by the end of 1973.

23.        Power demand in El Salvador is projected to grow by 11 per-
cent annually through 1984, following past trends and in anticipation
of further industrialization. To continue to meet the country's demand
for electricity, CEL intends to carry out an expansion program through
1984 which,in addition to the completion of the Soyapango Gas Turbine
(Fifth Power) Project and the proposed Sixth Power Project,includes the
purchase of additional gas turbine capacity for emergency conditions,
the completion of the current program of drilling geothermal wells, two
additional geothermal units of 30-40 MW each at Ahuachapan in 1981, two
additional hydro units of 67.5 MW at Cerron Grande, one in 1979 and the
other in 198h, and the expansion of distribution facilities, including
village electrification.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.      A report entitled "Appraisal of Sixth Power Project" (No. 69a-ES
dated April    11, 1973) is being distributed separately.   The main fea-
tures of the project which consist mainly of the construction of a hydro-
power plant at Cerron Grande and a geothermal power plant at Ahuachapan,
are summarized in Annex III. The project is based on a feasibility study
of the Ahuachapan geothermal plant prepared by Electroconsult of Italy,
and a UNDP-financed study of both the geothermal field and plant done by
Kingston Reynolds Thom and Allerdice of New Zealand and Kennedy and Donkin
of the United Kingdom in association with New Zealand government agencies.
A feasibility study of the Cerron Grande hydroelectric plant was pre-
pared by Harza Engineering Company International of the United States
and Atilio Garcia Prieto y Cia of El Salvador. The proposed project was
appraised in the field in September 1972, and negotiations were held in
iashington in March 1973. The Government was represented by Jose Guillermo
Pantoja Espinal, of the National Economic Planning Council (CONAPLAN).
CEL was represented by Ing. Miguel Sandoval and Ing. Antonio Reyes.
25.       In addition to the two power plants the proposed project would
include construction of transmission lines, construction of a telemetering
center, engineering design work on the third unit of Cerron Grande and
pre-feasibility or feasibility studies of other projects to be agreed be-
tween CEL and the Bank, and training of CEL's professional staff.
26.       The project's effects on the environment have been carefully
studied and agreement on necessary measures has been reached with CEL
and the Government. Construction of the Cerron Grande dam will require
flooding of about 13,500 ha. of land, of which about 4,400 ha. are pre-
sently under intense cultivation. The principal problem resulting from
the proposed reservoir involves the relocation and employment of about
10,000 people living in the area to be flooded. The costs of the reset-
tlement ($13.3 million) are included in the total costs of the project.
For the most part, the affected population consists of small landholders



- 8 -
and landless farm workers and their families. The Bank has received and
approved the outline of a program for the resettlement and employment of
the population displaced by the Cerron Grande reservoir.    This popula-
tion will be resettled in a similar surrounding close to the Cerron Grande
area. While resettlement is not a normal function of a power agency, CEL
has the financial and managerial capability to implement such a program,
either directly or in association with other entities. Accordingly, CEL
has agreed to prepare and submit for Bank approval by the end of 1973
detailed plans for the resettlement/employment program and to implement
those plans satisfactorily, and the Government has agreed to provide all
necessary assistance to CEL to assure successful execution of this program.
27.       CEL has adequate technical and administrative capacity to carry
out the project. Engineering design and supervision of construction of
the project would be done by consultants acceptable to the Bank.
Project Financing
28.       The project is estimated to cost $97.9 million including a
$59.9 million foreign exchange component. Because of the large size of
the project, arrangements have been worked out for IDB to join with the
Bank in its financing. The foreign exchange component will be financed
by the Bank ($27.3 million), by the IDB ($32.1 million), and by CEL
($0.5 million). In addit-ion to its financing of the foreign exchange
component, IDB will provide $6.0 million equivalent in Salvadorean
Colones to finance local currency costs; the remainder of the financing
of local currency costs will come from CEL ($25.h million) and from the
Government ($6.4 million) which will raise its contribution through dom-
estic borrowing. The allocation of financing for the major components
of the projects would be as follows (in millions of dollars):
Total Cost     IDB        IBRD         Local
Cerron Grande                  75.6        36.5        13.1         25.6
Ahuachapan                      13.6         -          7.9          5.7
Telemetering Center             O.6          -          0.5          0.1
Studies                          1.1         -          1.0          0.1
Training                         0.2         -          0.2           -
Interest during construction
and fees              6.6        1.2          4.6          0.8
TOTAL                97.7        38.1        27.3         32.3
29.        The Inter-American Development Bank loan would help to finance
the civil works, the turbo-generator units and installation of all equip-
ment for the Cerron Grande hydro station. The proposed Bank loan would
finance the foreign exchange cost of equipment other than turbo-generators
for the Cerron Grande project as well as its engineering and diversion
works, the Ahuachapan geothermal power station, all transmission lines
for both plants, the telemetering center, studies, training, and interest
during construction on the Bank loan.



- 9 -
30.       Because of IDB's heavy involvement in the Cerron Grande part of
the project and because IDB has capability in Washington and will have
resident staff in El Salvador to supervise this project, the Bank would
leave to IDB the primary responsibility for supervision of construction
of the hydro project. IDB would leave to the Bank primary responsibility
for supervision of CEL's operations. Moreover, the Bank would supervise
procurement of all items which it finances and would be solely responsible
for supervising the construction of those portions of the project which
it finances and which are not integral parts of the Cerron Grande hydro
plant. The two institutions have agreed on the text of a Memorandum of
Agreement which will contain, among other things, these provisions on
project supervision.
31.       CEL's financial position is sound and is expected to remain so.
Since 1962 it has maintained a relatively high rate of return which will
enable it to self-finance about 33 percent of the project from its inter-
nal cash generation. CEL plans to maintain the present average level of
tariffs until completion of the project, and has undertaken to earn a
rate of return of not less than 9 percent on average net fixed assets
during the term of the loan, except for the years 1976 through 1976.
The rate of return is projected to reach only about 6.3 percent in 1976
and 1977 when the Cerron Grande part of the project will be completed,
and about 7.6 percent in 1978 when the total project is expected to be
completed; these lower returns are due to sharp increases in the book
value of net fixed assets as a result of the commissioning of new faci-
lities that will not immediately operate at full capacity. Since CEL's
rate of return is expected to increase to 9 percent shortly after the
project period, the Bank would be prepared to waive its rate of return
requirements for the years 1976-78.
32.        CEL's debt service coverage is projected to be satisfactory, vary-
ing between 2.0 and 2.5 times during 1972-77. CEL has agreed not to
incur any debt without the Bank's prior approval, unless its most recent
12-month internal cash generation is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt
service requirement for any succeeding fiscal year.
Procurement
33.       Goods and services financed by the Bank would be procured
under the Bank's guidelines. No suppliers in El Salvador or other Cen-
tral American Common Market countries are expected to bid for the supply
of equipment; accordingly, the Government has not requested, and no pro-
vision has been made for, domestic or regional preferences in the evalua-
tion of bids. Contracts have already been awarded for the engineering
consulting, the Cerron Grande River diversion works, the turbo-generator
at Ahuachapan and related transmission lines and substation equipment.
Disbursement
34.        The loan would be disbursed during FY73-78 in the following
proportions:



- 10 -
a. 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs of civil works
of the project;
b. 100 percent of the C&F cost of the equipment;
c. 92 percent of the cost of consultants' services related
to the Cerron Grande project, representing the estimated foreign ex-
change component;
d. 95 percent of the costs of engineering of the Ahuachapan
project, representing the estimated foreign exchange component; and
e. 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of studies of
future projects and staff training.
It is proposed that the loan finance retroactively up to $1.8 million
expenditures for engineering consultants' services ($0.7 million),
river diversion works and power transmission lines to the Cerron Grande
construction site ($0.2 million), and for geothermal equipment ($0.9
million) incurred since June 1972.
Economic Justification
35.      CEL's expansion program has been demonstrated by comparison
with alternative programs to be the least-cost solution for meeting El
Salvador's incremental electricity needs through 1984. The rate of re-
turn on the investment in the program, of which the project is an essen-
tial part, is estimated to be at least 17 percent. The project is tech-
nically sound and economically justified.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUNENTS AND AUTHORITY
36.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and CEL, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of El Salvador and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section ldiii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors sepa-
rately. The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern of loans
for public utilities projects. Of special interest are the provisions
concerning resettlement of people displaced from the reservoir area
(Section 3.05, Loan Agreement and Section 3.03, Guarantee Agreement) and
seismic and environmental aspects (Section 3.04, Loan Agreement).
37.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan/Credit No.
in. 609   Education Project: US$4.9 million of June 11, 1969.   Closing
Date: July 31, 197h. -
This project had a very slow start because of institutional
difficulties within the education sector, inexperience with
international bidding procedures, and budgetary pressures
in the immediate post-war period. Meanwhile, the Government
restructured the country's education system, and this re-
quired some changes in the project. The project is now pro-
gressing well. The closing date has been postponed by six
months.
Cr. 227   Fifth Power Project:  US$5.6 million of January 13, 1971.
Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
This credit only became effective in October 1971 due to
delays in obtaining congressional ratification. The gas
turbines were installed in December 1972.   The transmis-
sion line to Eastern LE Salvador has been delayed by
about three months due to strikes in the suppliers' plants.
Ln. 811   Second Telecommunications Project:   US$9.5 million of April 17,
1972.      Closing Date:   December 31, 1976.
This loan became effective in August 1972; the project is pro-
gressing satisfactorily.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.
