APPRAISAL OF SIXTH POWER PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Sixth Power Project of
the Comision Ejecutiva Hidroel ti-del-eL Rio Lempi&CpQ) of El Salvador
which has requ i6ted assistance from  the Bank and the Tnterijan
Development Bank (IDB) in financing the Project, the estimated total cost
of~twhnEis.US~$97TThilhion.
ii.       Since 1949 the Bank/IDA has provided major financial assistance to
El Salvador's power development through four loans and one credit, total-
ing US$30.3 million, for five CEL power projects. The first four projects,
have been completed successfully; the fifth is under construction, with
satisfactory progress, and is expected to be completed by early 1973. CEL's
performance under previous lending operations has been satisfactory.
iii.      CEL is a Dcr          ;
ment of all means of generating electricity in the country and for distri-
bution of electricity to rural zones not served by private companies. CEL's
installed capacity of 199 MW, comprising hydro, oil-fired steam and gas-
turbine generation, represents about 90 percent of the country's total
capacity available for public power supply. CEL's managemebnt is capable,
but its recently-formed planning staff needs strengthening.
iv.       El Salvador has only two indigenous energy sources of any
magnitude: the Rio Lempa and geothermal fields. Optimal power development
will involve a balanced utilization of geothermal energy to satisfy base-
load requirements and hydro energy to meet peak demand. Until now El Salvador
has depended on conventional oil-fired units to complement the hydro genera-
tion from the Cinco de Noviembre plant located on the Rio L]empa and the
smaller Guajoyo plant on a Lempa tributary.
v.        WEth UNDP assistance in the 1960s, CEL has been studying El Salvadorts
geothermal resources since 1953. As a result of these studies, CEL has
established the feasibility of building an initial installation of 30 MW at
the  each      g hewe-field; the station is expected to have a final
capacity of about 100 MW. Mhe_Project incja    .t4t1m_t'hcpan nni,
which will be the first such instaJation.nithe  _our,try
vi.       Also included in the Project are:  thLhefr1 t_-t.= rMWinitoe e;t
Cerro bGr4Udp,,4droelactric development; _g,e.t W                 _;nter  fQcommuni-
cation within the CEL system; studies of future projects; and trainl.gOf
CEL'6T s ssiona1 staf-.  The Cerron Grande plat, Tse 6econd on the Rio
Lempa-itself, would have an ultimate capacity of 270 MW. Flooding of land
by the Cerron Grande dam will necessitate relocation of a large number of
people; this relocation will be carried out by CEL in accordance with a plan
acceptable to the Bank.



- ii -
vii.      The proposed IBRD loan of, Jj22-3-million and the IDB loan of
US$38.1 million, totaling US$65.4 million, would cover all the Project's
foreign exchange cost of US$59.9 million, except a Us$065 million IDB
commitment fee, which CEL will finance. The IDB loan would also include
US$6 million equivalent of local currency financing. It would be made
from IDB's Fund for Special Operations on soft terms to the Salvadoran
government, which would re-lend the proceeds to CEL on the same terms during
the Project's construction period and on conventional terms thereafter. The
IDB loan would finance most civil works, supply of the turbo-generator units
and installation of all equipment at Cerron Grande. The proposed IBRD loan
would finance: the Ahuachapan geothermal station; engineering, diversion
works and the supply of equipment other than turbo-generators at Cerron Grande;
transmission lines related to both generating stations; studies of future
projects; and training.
viii.     Conj tjjg_a4 AeeqREsacceptable to the Bank would carry out the
design and construction supervision of all physical works and studies
included in the Project.
ix.       Because IDB would finance most of the Cerron Grande hydro project
and has or will have supervisory capability both in Wshington and El Salvador,
it would have primary responsibility for supervision of construction of that
project. The Bank would have primary responsibility for supervising CEL's
operations, would supervise procurement of all items which it finances, and
would be solely responsible for supervising construction of all project
elements which are not directly related to the Cerron Grande hydro plant.
x.        Procurement of items financed by the Bank would follow the Bank's
guidelines. To meet its estimated demands CEL would have to make commitments
for engineering and key Project elements prior to loan signing, involving
retroactive financing of US$1.2 million for engineering and equipment for
the geothermal unit and US$0.6 million for engineering and diversion works
for the Cerron Grande hydro plant.
xi.       CEL's proposed expansion program, which includes completing to
their ultimate capacity the two generating stations included in the Project,
represents the least-cost solution of meeting El Salvador's electricity
needs for discount rates up to 16 percent. The return on the program in-
vestment is estimated to be at least 17 percent.
xii.      CEL's financial position and earnings are satisfactory and are
expected to remain so, except for a temporary reduction in rate of return
expected directly after commissioning of the Cerron Grande hydro station.
xiii.     The Project would form a suitable basis for a loan of US$27.3
million equivalent, including US$4.6 million of interest during construc-
tion, with a term of 25 years including five years of grace. The loan
would be made to CEL and would be guaranteed by the Republic of El Salvador.



APPRAISAL OF SIXTIH POWER PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMIPA (CEL)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Sixth Power Project of the Comision
Ejecutiva Hidroelectrica del Rio Lempa (CEL) for which assistance from
the Bank and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has been requested.
The proposed loans would cover all but us$0.5 million (the IDB commit-
ment fee) of the Project's foreign exchange cost of US$59.9 million,
which represents about 60% of the Project's total cost of US$97.7mil-
lion, including financing costs.  In addition, the IDB loan would in-
clude US$6 million equivalent of local currency financing, thereby re-
ducing CEL's local borrowing requirements. CEL, the government-owned
entity responsible for generation and bulk supply of electricity within
El Salvador, would finance the Project's remaining local cost of US$32.3
million from internally generated funds and locaL borrowing.
1.02      With the assistance of the United Nations DeveLopment Programme
(UNDP), CEL has been studying E1 Salvador's geothermal resources since
1953 to determine their optimum use; it has thereby estalblished the
feasibility of building an initial installation of 30 MW at the
Ahuachapan geothermal field. The Project would include this initial
geothermal installation, the first in El Salvador and in Central America.
It would also include a hydroelectric plant at Cerron Grande with initial
capacity of two 67.5 MW units and related transmission lines.
1.03      The Bank and IDA have helped finance five power projects in El
Salvador. Bank/IDA financing, which has aggregated US$30.3 million, has
assisted in the construction of almost all of CEL's generating and trans-
mission facilities. CEL's performance under previous lending operations
has been satisfactory.
1.04      The Project appraisal was carried out in close cooperation with
the staff of IDB, which institution would provide most of the external
financing for the Cerron Grande hydroelectric plant. The Bank financing
would be applied principally to the Ahuachapan geothermal plant, certain
equipment for Cerron Grande, and the transmission lines.
1.05      This report, which was written by John E. Graves, R. E. Salazar
and K. Ringskog, is based on:
a.   A feasibility study of the Ahuachapan geothermal plant prepared
by Electroconsult (ELO) of Italy, and a UNDP-financed study
of the geothermal field and plant done by Kingston Reynolds
Thom & Allerdice of New Zealand and Kennedy & Donkin of the
United Kingdom in association with New Zealand government
agencies (Kingston et al);

2. THE POWR SECTOR
Energy Resources
2.01      El Salvador has only two indigenous energy resources of any
magnitude: the Rio Lempa and geothermal fields. Since the creation of
CEL in the 1940s, Salvadoran power development has been concentrated on
the Lempa river system, with oil-fired steam units at Aca;jutla and gas tur-
bines added to balance the power system; future development focuses on
continued exploitation of the Rio Lempa and geothermal resources.
2.02      The 81 KW Cinco de Noviembre hydro plant at Guayabo, whose first
units (Loan 22-ES) were commissioned in 1954, is the principal installation
on the Lempa itself.  Additional units (Loans 221-ES and 342-ES) were added.,
to this plant through 1966.  The 15 MW  Guajoyo plant (Loan 263-ES) is lo-
cated on the outlet of Lake Guija, which discharges into a tributary of the
Lempa (see map for plant locations). Lake Guija serves as an additional
reservoir for the Cinco de Noviembre plant; it is drawn down during the
dry season. The Guajoyo plant operates only during this drawdown period,
which coincides with the months of peak power demand.
2.03      On the Rio Lempa there are two potential sites downstream from
the Cinco de Noviembre plant - El Tigre and La Pintada. Because its reser-
voir would inundate Honduran territory as well as Salvadoran, development
of the large (approximately 400 MW) El Tigre site would require an agree-
ment between the two countries and must therefore await resolution of
current political difficulties with Honduras. La Pintada would be a run-
of-river installation with a capacity estimated at about 80 mw; it would
not be economic without upstream regulation. The proposed Cerron Grande
development, located immediately upstream from Cinco de Noviembre, would
provide the necessary regulation. Because of low river flows, hydro sites
upstream from the proposed Cerron Grande project are uneconomic. The
few potential hydro sites on other rivers are small and appear uneconomic.
2.o4      Geothermal studies and explorations have indicated that the
Ahuachapan field has a total   energy potential of about 24,000 GWi, and
that other fields also have some additional potential (see Annex 5).
Development of these other geothermal fields will require additional ex-
ploration to establish reserves; GEL intends to proceed with this explora-
tion program once it has gained operating experience with the initial
installation at Ahuachapan.
2.05      Under its present program, which includes the completion of the  pro-
posed initial unit at Ahuachapan in early 1975 and the first two sets at
Cerron Grande in 1976 and 1977, CEL will require additional generating capaci-
ty in 1979 and additional energy in 1981. Expansion of the proposed Cerron
Grande plant would appear to be the least-cost solution to satisfy the need
for additional capacity to meet peak loads. Subject to the experience to be
gained from the initial geothermal installation and further studies, CEL



-4 -
intends to expand the Ahuachapan plant, as outlined in Annex 5, to provide
base-load energy. If geothermal expansion is not feasible, CEL will have
to add oil-fired steam units in 1981 to provide energy, thus increasing
its dependence on imported fuel.
Organization of the Power Sector
2.06      Prior to CEL's creation in 1945, El Salvador's electricity needs
were served exclusively by private companies. CEL was created by law to
study the hydro resources of the Rio Lempa; subsequent amendments to its
enabling legislation gave it the responsibility of developing all means
of electricity generation for public service.
2.07      kiZth the assistance of the Bank and IDA, CEL has provided
practically all generating and transmission facilities in El Salvador
since 1954 and has interconnected all the distribution companies serving
the country. In addition to the 12,000 retail customers it serves in
nine rural zones as a result of its rural electrification program (see
paragraph 3.10), CEL sells electricity to two industrial customers,
various government agencies and eight private distribution companies. The
largest of the distribution companies are: Compania de Alumbrado de San
Salvador (CAESS), 88% owned by Canadian International Power of Montreal and
12% by Salvadoran and foreign individuals; and Compania de Luz Electrica de
Santa Ana (CLESA), owned locally. Details of 1971 generation and sales of
electricity by each utility are shown in Annex 1, and the attached map
indicates the zone served by each.
2.08      As detailed in Annex 1 and summarized below, CEL generated about
92% of the electric energy available for public service in 1971:

CAESS                             11.8                        19.8        2.8
Other utilities                    7.9                        36.3        5.1
185.8                      711.8      100.0
_~~ -
In addition to the above, eleven thermal plants of 500 to 2,500 kW capacity
each and about 25 smaller hydro and thermal plants with total installed
capacity of 19.9 MW furnished 30.9 GTh for private use during 1971. The
majority of these captive plants supply sugar mills and other installations
for processing agricultural products, principally cotton and coffee.
2.09      CAESS, which serves San Salvador and the central part of the country
as well as a large zone in eastern El Salvador, is the largest distribution
company; it distributes more than three-quarters of the electric energy sold
to the public.  Retail distribution in 1971 is shown below:

Regulation and Tariffs
2.10      Regulatory procedures in E  Salvador, which are based on the 1936
Electric Service Law and subsequent regulations and modifications, are satis-
factory. The Inspeccion General de Servicios Electricos (IGSE), under the
Minister of Economy, reviews the financial and technical condition of the
distribution companies; and the Minister of Economy decides policy matters
concerning the power sector with the advice of the executive director of CEL
and the director of IGSE.
2.11      All utilities except CEL are subject to regulation by IGSE.  The
private companies are permitted an 8% annual return on net assets after all
expenses, including taxes imposed on the companies and on dividends and
remittances to shareholders. Net assets include 75% of the assessed value
of assets in 1952 plus net additions at cost less depreciation since 1952.
khile CAESS's return had fallen considerably below 8% in the late 1960s, its
rate of return improved to over 7% in 1971, and further improvement is ex-
pected. These operating results are satisfactory to CAESS, which has no
tariff applications pending. CAESS's cash flow is sufficient for adequate
expansion and improvement of its distribution system and for providing an
annual expenditure of 0600,000 (US$240,000) annually for village electrifi-
cation in its territories beginning in 1972.
2.12      Under its charter CEL is allowed, with the approval of the Minister
of Economy, to establish tariffs sufficient to cover its costs and meet its
obligations under agreement with creditors. In practice this has enabled
CEL to earn a rate of return of at least 9% on average net assets in opera-
tion, as defined in existing Loan/Project agreements with the Bank/IDA.
2.13      The principal retail tariffs of CEL and the four largest distri-
bution companies are detailed in Annex 2. The retail tariff structure of
the various utilities are rational from a cost-of-service view point, with
block energy rates and appropriate demand charges. The average retail price
per kWh has decreased from 00.084 (us$0.034) in 1961 to 00.068 (US$0.027) in
1971. CEL's bulk rates to the distribution companies include an energy and
demand charge; the resultant average charge is about 00.04 (US$0.016) per
kWA.  Until 1972, the demand charge was based on the annual peak, resulting
in retroactive billing, which was unsatisfactory to the distribution companies.
Under new contracts, the demand charge will be applied on a monthly basis for
the maximum demand in the most recent 12-month period, thereby reducing the



-6-
average price per kW received by CEL by about 2%.
Consumption and Extension of the Electric Power Supply
2.14      During the ten-year period 1962-1971, production of electrical
energy in El Salvador increased by 168%, reaching a level of 711.8 GWh in
1971. Generating capacity, which totaled about 186 MW in 1971, has kept
pace with the growth in demand; supply has never been rationed. The total
number of customers increased by 92% to 178,000 in the ten years through
1971. Of the total, 149,000 were residential customers, representing about
25% of the total households in El Salvador.
2.15      In 1971 El Salvador ranked third among the five Central American
republics in terms of per capita generation of electricity for public service:
Country                                      kka/capita
Costa Rica                                      577
Nicaragua                                        273
El Salvador                                     193
Honduras                                        127
Guatemala                                       124
2.16      Industrial customers form the largest market for electrical energy
in the country, as indicated below. The four principal categories of consumers
have used about the same proportions of energy since 1963.
(Prior to 1963, consumer categories were defined differently, making comparison
difficult.)
Category of Consumer     1963 Retail Sales               1971 Retail Sales

2.17      To continue to meet the country's demands for electricity, CEL
intends to carry out the generating expansion program described in paragraph
4.01. Although CEL's rural electrification program has extended electric
service to most of the country's villages, it has not brought electricity
inside the majority of homes; the expanded rural electrification program
(paragraph 3.10) is intended to solve this problem.

3. THE BORROWER
3.01      CEL, whose responsibilities for developing means of generating
electricity are described in paragraph 2.06, is an autonomous government-
owned corporation. Since 1959 it has also had responsibility for instal-
ling distribution facilities in areas not served by private companies as
well as for developing all means of generating electricity in the country.
Organization and Management
3.02      CEL's seven-man Board of Directors is comprised of El Salvador's
Minister of the Interior, who serves as President, the Ministers of Economy,
Agriculture and Public Wbrks, and representatives of CELIs bondholders and
of the country's banks and industrial and agricultural associations. The
Board, whose president has held office since 1950, establishes policy. It
appoints an Executive Director who is responsible for all management func-
tions; the present Executive Director, a capable civil engineer, had previous
experience with CEL and private industry before assuming his present position
in 1971. CEL's engineers and management staff are capable.
3.03      CEL currently employs about 630 operational employees, including
72 who are directly engaged in the operation of its distribution system,
and about 470 in its construction forces, mostly in transmission and distri-
bution work. Its operations are efficient and its plant, well maintained.
3.04      Until recently CEL has relied on Harza, its principal consultant,
for all planning, having no internal planning organization.  In 1972 CEL
set up a small group to direct and review the consultant's efforts and,
eventually, to decrease CEL's reliance on its consultant. To perform this
function effectively, however, the planning group needs experience, addition-
al training and more personnel.
3.05      Despite the increasing size and complexity of its system, CEL
has not undertaken a long-term study of its future transmission requirements,
other than those included in the Sixth Power Project. Consequently, CEL
needs an overall system study to: provide for expansion of its own trans-
mission facilities; and determine the optimum future interconnection points
between its system and those of the major distribution companies. CEL has
agreed to the performance of this study by consultants acceptable to the Bank.
3.06      CEL has engaged a consultant familiar with public utilities in Latin
America to review its management structure and administrative procedures and
to propose improvements.
Facilities
3.07      As detailed in Annex 3 CEL has about 199 MW of generating capacity
located at two hydro stations, one conventional steam station, and a 33 MW
gas turbine plant at Soyapango, which was financed by IDA Credit 227-ES and
was commissioned in December 1972.



-8-
3.08      Extremely low rainfall in the rainy season which ended in
November 1972 and the resultant drawdown of Lake Guija would have caused
a power shortage by March 1973 unless CEL acquired additional capacity.
Consequently, CEL has contracted to purchase a 25 MW gas turbine from Hitachi
of Japan, who had a unit of this size available.  This unit will be installed
at Soyapango by the end of March 1973 and will be paid for by CEL's own funds.
This addition is designed for use only when severe drought makes hydro facili-
ties inoperative.
3.09      As shown on the attached map, CEL's transmission network connects
all densely populated areas of the country. The network currently includes
the following lengths of transmission lines.
Voltage                  Length of lines
-(kV)                      (circuit km)
115                          284
69                           88
44                          249
35                           62
A 110 km 115 kV line to increase the supply of power to eastern El Salvador,
also financed by IDA Credit 227-ES, is scheduled for completion in early
1973.  In addition, the various distribution companies own and operate 189 km
of 44 kV and 35 kV lines.
3.10      In 1961 CEL began a program of village electrification to provide
electricity to rural zones not served by the private companies. Under this
program CEL has constructed more than 1,000 km of 13 kV lines to most villages
with a population exceeding 100 people in the rural zones it serves. Because
the majority of potential rural customers still do not receive electricity,
GEL will expand its program to provide more distribution works, will coordinate
its promotion efforts under a centralized rural electrification office, and
will study a program to assist low-income homeowners in installing basic interior
wiring. The expanded program will be funded by an annual contribution of capital
of about 01.3 million (US$520,000) from the government. This contribution re-
presents the difference between CEL's debt service to the government on IDA
Credit 227-ES and the government's debt service to IDA. In addition, CEL will
contribute 0500,000 (US$200,000) per year from its own funds to the program.
In view of the social benefits to be derived therefrom, expansion of the program
in this manner is reasonable.
Financial Systems and Auditors
3.11      CEL's accounting system, which is under the direction of a quali-
fied accountant, produces prompt and complete monthly financial reports and
comparisons of actual and budgeted data. The new planning group is expected
to perform the financial planning,vhich the consultant now does.



- 9 -
3.12      Under Salvadoran law, independent auditors ap;pointed by the
Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador must perform annual audits of govern-
ment-owned organizations such as CEL. The present auditor, appointed more
than three yars ago, lacks familiarity with public utility concepts and
therefore is not acceptable to the Bank. Since the Central Reserve Bank
appears reluctant to change auditors, CEL has engaged a second external
auditor responsible to its own Board of Directors and acceptable to the Bank.
W4hile this is not an ideal solution because of the conflict which could
result from two sets of auditors, the prsence of an experienced auditing firm
represents an improvement over the previous situation.

4. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Program through 1984
4.01      CEL's development program needs through 1984 includes:
a.   completion of Soyapango Gas Turbine (Fifth Power) Project
(see Appraisal Report No. PU-55a dated December 1, 1970);
b. purchase of additional gas turbine capacity for emergency
conditions (paragraph 3.08);
c.   completion of current program of drilling geothermal wells;
d.   the Sixth Power Project, which would include Ahuachapan geothermal
tlnit 1 and Cerron Grande hydro Units 1 and 2, described below;
e.   two additional units of 30-40 Md each at Ahuachapan in 1981
(see Annex 5);
f.   two additional units of 67.5 MW at Cerron Grande, one in 1979
and the other in 1984 (see Annex 6); and
g.  expansion of distribution facilities, including village
electrification (paragraph 3.10).
Description of the Project
4.02      The Sixth Power Project will consist of:
a.  The Ahuachapan geothermal plant, comprising steam separators,
silencers, a power house containing one medium-pressure
(7 to 9 at. a.) 30 MW turbo-generator unit and appropriate
accessory equipment, switchyard and a 60 km canal to
discharge the effluent into the Pacific Ocean (see Annex 5);
b.   The Cerron Grande hydroelectric development, comprising a fill
dam across the Rio Lempa, spillway, intakes and pressure tunnels,
surface power house containing two 67.5 MW turbo-generator units
and appropriate accessory equipment, and switchyard (see Annex 6);
c.   115 kV transmission facilities:  a single-circuit 20 km line
from Cerron Grande to the Cinco de Noviembre plant; a double-
circuit 34 km line from Cerron Grande to Nejapa substation; and
a single-circuit 22 km line from Ahuachapan to Santa Ana substation;
d.   A telemetering center located in CEL's San Salvador headquarters;
e.   Engineering design work on the third unit of Cerron Grande and
pre-feasibility or feasibility studies of projects to be agreed
between CEL and the Bank; and



- 11 -
f.   Training of CEL's professional staff.
The telemetering center will include communications equipment and equipment
for supervisory control of Cerron Grande plant and switchyard, the Soyapango
gas turbine plant, and certain substations; it would be expanded at a later
date to provide economic dispatch, automatic load-frequency control, data
logging, supervisory control and communication with the entire CEL system.
The training program will supplement CEL's own staff development program
and will be directed particularly towards improving the capability of CEL's
-recently-formed planning group (see paragraph 3.04) and geothermal engineers.

- 1.2 -
The cost estimates are based on Harza and ELC es-timates with minor modifications
by the IDB and Bank appraisal teams. The unit cost of the Ahuachapan plant,
about US$500/kW of installed capacity, is acceptable for a geothermal plant of
this size, consiaering that the initial investment includes the effluent canal
and other facilities that will be used in connection with subsequent units as
well as the first. It is estimated that the unit cost of the plant, when
completed, will be about US$350/kW. While the unit cost of the first two units
of the Cerron Grande plant is rather high (about US$5Gè0/kW), expansion of this
plant to its ultimate design capacity of 270 iW will involve a relatively small
additional investment (about US$16 million, bringing the plant's total cost
to about US$91 million) and reduce tne unit cost to about US$340/kW. As
described in the respective annexes, the cost estimates for both generating
plants include appropriate allowances for physical contingencies and price
inflation, including possible effects of future currency revaluations, as
well as a special allowance of US$8.5 million for restricted procurement
from IDB member countries of items financed withl the IDB loan.
4.04      As detailed in paragraphs 6.08 and 6.10, the IDB loan will finance
the foreign and part of the local cost of civil works, supply of the turbo-
generator units and installation of all equipment at Cerron Grande, and
financial charges related to its loan. The Bank loan wa)ld finance the foreign
cost of the Ahuachapan station, engineaering, diversion works and other equip-
ment at Cerron Grande, transmission lines, the telemetering center, studies,
training and interest during construction.
Enktjneerig and Construction
4 .05     ELC will perform the general engineering for the geothermal plant,
and CEL's own staff will assist in this task, particularly in designing the
effluent canal. CEL's staff, including geotthermal engineers whose experience
includes on-site training at geotnermal sites in Italy, Japan and New Zealand,
with the assistance of ELC will supervise construction of the Ahuachapan plant.
4.06      Harza--wno has been CEL's principal consultant since the 1940s and
has engineered all of CEL's hydro projects--and Garcia Prieto will carry out
engineering design and construction supervision of:
a.   the Cerron Grande hydro plant;
b.   the transmission lines (including the Ahuachapan-Santa Ana line);
and
c.   the telemetering center.
The Bank has received evidence that an acceptable seismic design expert has
approved the design specifications for the Cerron Grande dam and associated
structures, which will be located in areas of strong seismic activity. The
Bank has also received assurances from CEL that the Ahuachapan geothermal
plant will be designed and built to withstand seismic effects, including
dynamic seismic forces.



13 -
4.07      In accordance with its practice CEL intends to award one gen-ral
contract for construction of civil works and installation of equipment at
each of the two generating plants included in the Project. Equipment will
be delivered C&F Salvadoran port and transported to the sites by CEL.
4.06      Two supply-and-erect contracts will be awarded for the transmniisioc
lines:  one for the single-circuit lines, the other for the double-circunit.
Construction Schedules
4.09      Provisional acceptance of the Ahuachapan unit is scheduled for
March 1975. Consequently, the turbo-generator contract was awarded ir
February 1973, ^-nd other works will begin in Spring 1973.
4.10      At Cerron Grande the diversion works were started by Columbus
Latinamerica of Panama in October 1972.  Construction of the main civil v-mI .
is scheduled to begin in November 1973. The first unit would be placed in
service by the end of 1976 to meet the year-end peak load, and the second nv-`
would be in service by early 1977.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      Procurement of equipment and selection of contractors for items
procured with Bank funds would follow the Bank's Guidelines for Procurem nt;
those procured with the proposed IDB loan would comply with IDB's procedures.
4.12      In order to meet the estimated demand, CEL will have had to make
commitments for engineering and key elements prior to loan signing. Th s
would entail a small amount of retroactive financing For expenditures incur-
red since June 1972, the date of the Bank's pre-appraisal mission concernli-
the Project.  The proposed retroactive financing of US$1.8 million wou- dL
as follows:
US$ million
Ahuachapan geothermal:
Turbo-generator                     0.8
Other equipment                     D.1

Total                                            1.8
4.13      Disbursements from the loan account would be made for G&F cost of
imported equipment and materials,for the foreign-cost component of consultant
services, and for the foreign currency cost of contractors, erection work,
and training. Of the total amounts of the contracts for engineering services



14 -
with ELC for the Ahuachapan geothermal plant and with Harza/Garcia Prieto
for the Cerron Grande hydro development, 95% and 924, respectively, would be
considered as the foreign component. Annex 7 shows the estimated schedule
of loan disbursements; the loan is expected to be fully drawn down by the
end of 1977. If the Project should cost less than estimated, any savings
from the loan should be canceled.
4.14      No manufacturers in El Salvador or the Central American Common
Market produce equipment to be included in the Project. Therefore, neither
CEL nor the Government has requested domestic or regional preferences for
local or regional manufacturers.
Project Supervision
4.15      Because IDB will finance almost all of the civil works for Cerron
Grande, the turbo-generator units and installation of all equipment, and
because IDB has capability in Washington and will have resident staff in
El Salvador to supervise this project,
responsibilit~y for supervisiQxn-o  qc.nstriction of the hydra project and;.imple-
mentation of the _elated resettlement prQgram (see paragraph 4.19).  However,
the Bank would have the right to=review the qualifications of the field
personnel proposed by IDB for this supervision prior to their appointment. IDB
would leave to the Bank primary responsibility for supervision of CEL's opera-
tions.  Moreover, the Bank would supervise procurement of all items which it
finances and would be solely responsible for supervising the construction of
those portions of the Project which it finances and which are not integral
parts of the Cerron Grande hydro plant, namely:
(a)  Ahuachapan geothermal plant and related transmission line;
(b)  Tra-rission lines connecting Cerron Grande to CEL's trans-
mission network at Nejapa substation and.to CEL's existing
Cinco de Noviembre plant;
(c)  Telemetering center;
(d)  Studies of future projects; and
(e)  Training.
The two institutions have agreed on the text of a Memorandum of Agreement
which will contain, among other things, these provisions on Project supervision.
It is expected that the Memorandum would be signed shortly after the Executive
Directorshave approved the proposed loan.
Environmental Aspects
4.16      As indicated in Annex 5, the gases contained in the geothermal steam
and noise resulting from its discharge will not menace the environment signifi-
cantly; their diffusion will be accomplished by construction of 15 to 20 m
stacks. After studying the method of conveying the effluent from the geothermal
wells proposed by CEL, Bank consultants recommended minor modifications to CEL's



- 15 -
original design, namely, lengthening the canal by 5 km and diffusing the
discharge in the ocean by use of a pipe with diffuser ports (see Annex 5).
CEL has agreed to these design modifications.
4.17      The Cerron Grande reservoir will flood 13,500 ha of land (see map).
According to available information, there are no mineral resources, historic-
al sites or rare species of flora or fauna in the area to be inundated. Based
on its own ecological survey and the experience obtained from Cinco de Noviembre
reservoir, which is located immediately downstream from Cerron Grande and has
shown no adverse ecological effects since its creation more than 20 years ago,
Harza has found that the hydro development will not produce detrimental effects
on the environment. EKcept for the resettlement problem (see paragraph 4.19),
the consultant's opinion is reasonable.
4.18      The total 13,500 ha of land to be flooded includes 4,400 ha of fertile
farm land under intensive cultivation. Creation of the reservoir will necessi-
tate the relocation of a sugar mill and reconstruction of portions of a roadway,
including a bridge on the north side of the reservoir, which CEL is prepared to
do or have done. The loss of net agricultural return from the loss of crops,
principally sugar cane and maize, is estimated at 03 million (US$1.2 Million)
annually. The economic implications of these effects are examined in Annex 9.
4.19      However, the principal Jyob1zr    t4r4$oa                sd servoir
involves the reloction aieployment ofWab-out Q,,QQ2 ,eopll jxving-in.thc
area t6obe flooded .-Sor the most part, the affected population consists of
sraPl-iandholders and landless farm workers and their families.  The Bank has
received and approved the outline of a program for the resettlement mad employ-
ment of the population displaced by the Cerron Grande reservoir.  While re-
settlement is not a normal function of a power agency, CEL has the financial ancd
managerial capability to implement such a program, either directly or in associa-
tion with other entities.  Accordingly, CEL has agreed to prepare and submit £or
Bank approval by the end of 1973 detailed plans for the resettlement/employment
program and to implement those plans satisfactorily, and the Government has
agreed to provide all necessary assistance to CEL to assure successful exec-uticn
of this program.
4.20      Because of the comparatively large size of the Cerron Grande dam
and the large volume of water which its reservoir will hold, CEL has agreed
to provide for periodic inspections of the dam and associated structures to
ensure that the dam will continue to present no hazard to the environment.,

5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Forecast of Sales and Demand
5.01      During the last ten years, energy consumption in El Salvador
has shown an average annual growth rate of 11.5%; Harza has forecast a
rate of growth of 11% per year for energy demand through 1984, slightly
lower than the past rate of growth. This growth rate appears reasonable.
5.02      Annex 4 shows actual and forecast capacities, demand, generation
(by type of plant) and sales related to CEL's installations, net of the
relatively small demand met by the private companies' own generating plants,
for the period 1965-1980. It is expected that the private companies will
continue to use their generating facilities in the present pattern, namely,
optimum use of hydro facilities and use of thermal facilities in periods
of peak demand. The GEL system yearly load factor increased from 51.5% in
1965 to 56.3% in 1971; it has been assumed that the load factor for the
forecast period will be about 57%.
5.03      According to Annex 4 CEL's present installed generating capacity
of 199 MW will be able to meet the demand only through 1973. Even with the
addition of the    25 MW gas turbine at Acajutla and the 30 MW Ahuachapan
Unit 1 in 1973 and 1975, respectively, CEL will have little or no surplus
capacity until the completion of Cerron Grande.
5.04      The size of the Ahuachapan unit was determined principally by the
estimated capacity of the geothermal field and the plan of utilizing it;
it will meet about 1Ω years' growth in CEL's demand. The 67.5 MW Cerron
Grande units will each satisfy about 2Ω years' growth in demand as forecast
for the 1976-1978 period.
Least-cost Solution
5.05      CELts expansion program, which contemplates carrying the two
generating plants included in the Project to their ultimate capacity plus
a 99 MW conventional steam plant in 1983, was compared with five alternative
programs that would meet El Salvador's incremental electricity needs
through 1984. As shown in Annex 8, the selected program represents the
least-cost solution for meeting those needs for discount rates up to 16%.
Return on the Program Investment
5.o6      As indicated in Annex 9, the benefits to the country have been
compared with the costs of the least-cost program, which includes completion
of the generating facilities begun in the Project, for meeting the country's
electricity demands through 1984. The return on the program, rather than the
Project, investment has been determined because the Project's two principal
elements involve substantial initial expenditures for works common to
generating units included in the Project as well as those to be installed
later. In this comparison, which equates the benefits to the country with



- 17 -
commercial revenues from electricity sales and which does not quantify
certain downstream benefits associated with the Cerron Grande hydro
project, the return on the program investment over the hydro project's
assumed 50-year life is estimated to be at least 17%.
Emnloyment Effect
5.07      As shown in Annex 10 the Project's direct employment effect for
unskilled labor would be positive during the construction period, providing
employment for up to 1,500 people per year.  The large requirement for un-
skilled labor for the Cerron Grande civil works is the principal reason for
this benefit.
5.o8      After completion of the hydro plant the direct effect of the Project
would be negative. To offset this negative effect, the resettlement plan
(see paragraph 4.19) is expected to provide farm employment for the population
displaced by the reservoir.  In addition, the Project will produce positive
employment effects through the indirect employment resulting from the increas-
ed production of electricity.

6   FI NANCE
Introduction
6.01      Since .1962 CEL has maintained a relatively high rate of return -
from 10.5 to 12 percent - and a conservative financial structure with equity
approaching 80 percent of total capital in 1971. This will enable it to
self-finance a reasonable portion - about 33 percent - of the Project. A
decrease in rate of return after project completion is expected to be
temporary, and CEL's financial performance would continue to remain highly
satisfactory.
Earnings Record
6.02      CEL's income statements for the years 1969-71 are showa in Annex 12.
During this period revenues from sales of energy increased at an average annual
rate of 9 percent, and net income at 11 percent. All earnings were retained
by CEL and were used to finance a 24% increase in plant, reduce outstanding
indebtedness by 012 million (US$4.8 million), and build up cash reserves of
¢7.5 million (US$3 million).
Capital Structure and Financial Position
6.03      CEL's financial position is sound.  Because of its relatively light
construction program in 1970 and 1971, CEL has accumulated enough cash to neet
its immediate needs. Its relatively low current ratio reflects a heavy
repayment schedule of short-term loans and suppliers' credits (incurred
principally for installation of Unit 2 at the Acajutla station) through 1972,
rather than a lack of current assets. Its debt/equity ratio has steadily
declined from 60/40 in 1962 to a conservative 22/78 in 1971, providing a
solid base for future borrowing. CEL's assets are stated at original cost.
Annex 13 shows CEL's balance sheets for the years 1969-71.
6.04      CEL's books of account at December 31, 1971 did not reflect the
various 1971 currency revaluations and did not provide for proper disposition
of amounts expended on studies, as explained in Annex 13. CEL has agreed to
account for these items in a manner acceptable to the Bank.
6.05      The Bank is CEL's principal creditor; of CEL's total 040.1 million
(US$16.0 million) debt, almost 82 percent, or 032.7 million (US$13.1 million),
is owed to the Bank. As shown on Annex 11 CEL has also issued long-term bonds
guaranteed by the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador and borrowed from IDB,
the Central Reserve Bank and suppliers.
6.o6      Two customers - Compania Oriental Salvadorena de Aluinbrado Electrico,
S. A. (COSAESA), a small distribution company, and Administracion Nacional de
Acueductos y Alcantarillados (ANDA), the government's water supply and sewerage
agency - have serious arrearages with CEL, including bills up to two years old.
The government intends to appoint an intervenor to settle the financial affairs
of COSAESA, and thereby settle its arrearages with CEL, which amount to about
0350,000 (US$140,000). ANDA, which owed CEL about ¢1 million (US$400,000)



- 19 -
in mid-1972, has serious financial difficulties and has been able to pay
CEL only one-months' billing every two months. The Government has agreed
that it will keep current the accounts of all government entities, including
ANDA, and that it will pay to CEL ANDA's arrearages over a period not longer
than three years.
Financing Plan
6.07      During the six-year project period 1972-77, net internal cash
generation will finance approximately 33 percent of CEL's expansion program,
plus additions to working capital. This is satisfactory especially in view
of the fact that CEL's net plant investment will increase by about 190 percent
during the period. Government contributions for village electrification will
provide 2 percent of the requirements, and borrowings will be required for
the remaining 65 percent. The financing plan is based on CEL's retention and
investment of all net income during the Project period, which CEL has agreed
to. The following table gives a summary financial plan, details of which are
.shown in the projected funds statement Annex 14.

6.08      The proposed Bank loan would be made to CEL for a term of 25
years, including five years of grace, at the current Bank interest rate.
It would be guaranteed by the Republic of El Salvador and would finance
the foreign cost of:

Total                                 68.2        27.3
6.09      The interest during construction to be included in the Bank loan
was originally estimated by computing interest on: expenditures for the
Ahuachapan geothermal project until its estimated completion; and on other
expenditures for the loan's five-year grace period. To facilitate loan
administration, however, interest and commitment fees would be lent on all
Project expenditures only through April 1977; this procedure would result
in the same amount of interest as the estimate previously determined and
would concentrate it in the period when CEL would need the cash most.
6.10      IDB would make its 095.3 million (US$38.1 million) loan from its
Fund for Special Operations to the Republic of El Salvador, which would re-
lend the proceeds to GEL. The IDB loan, which El Salvador would repay to
IDB in local currency, would be for forty years including ten years of grace
at 2 percent annual interest during the amortization period and one percent
during the grace period. As detailed in Annex 6, it would finance at the
Cerron Grande hydro plant:  the foreign cost and part of the local cost of
the general contract for civil works (except diversion works) and installation
of equipment; the foreign cost of the turbo-generator units; interest during
construction (but not commitment fee); and its supervision and inspection fee.
6.11      The government would relend the proceeds of the IDB loan to CEL
by means of a 25-year loan with five years of grace at interest rates of
one percent during the grace period and 5-;Ω percent during the 20-year



- 22 -
amortization period. IDB will require the government to place the difference
between the debt service it receives from CEL and that which it repays to
IDB in a National Development Fund.
6.12      IDB's directors have approved the IDB loan.  Because successful
completion of the Project depends on IDB as well as Bank financing, the
Bank should receive notification from IDB that it is prepared to make the
initial disbursement from its loan before the proposed loan is effective.
6.13      Besides its internal cash generation and the local-currency com-
ponent of the 1DB loan, CEL requires 016.0 million (US$6.4 million) of
local borrowing to complete the Project. To provide for unforeseen contingenc-
ies as well as those foreseen in the financing plan, the Government has agreed
to meet CEL's local financing requirements either directly or by underwriting
and guaranteeing bond issues up to 025.0 million (US$10.0 million). In the
financial projections, the proposed local borrowing is assumed to consist of
5-year bonds at 8% annual interest. These bonds would be issued in 1974-1976
and repaid in five equal annual installments beginning in 1977.
6.14      Before CEL can borrow money or invest its own money in the Project,
it must receive approval of its extraordinary budget for the Project from
El Salvador's Legislative Assembly, which would follow approval of the pro-
posed loan by the Executive Directors. The loan should not become effective
until the Legislative Assembly has approved the extraordinary budget.
6.15      Arrangements have not yet been made for the projected future loans
(1976-78) for the foreign cost of future projects.
6.16      The 06.5 million (US$2.6 million ) government contribution for
village electrification represents the IDA Credit 227-ES debt service
differential, as explained in paragraph 3.10.
Future Earnings
6.17      CEL's forecast income statement (Annex 12) and key financial ratios
(Annex 15) indicate a temporary problem with CEL's rate of return, which will
decline from the 10-12% level of 1969-1974 to 6.3% in 1976 and 1977, when the
Cerron Grande project will be completed. While this rate of return is below
the 9 percent rate of return specified in the current project agreement
(IDA Credit 227-ES), it would be acceptable for the few years when Cerron
Grande is not operating at full capacity because:
(i)  inclusion of the Cerron Grande hydroelectric plant will
approximately double CEL's rate base in 1976-77;
(ii) inclusion of the special contingency related to goods
and services financed by the IDB loan (see paragraph
4.03) adds about 021 million (US$8.5 million) to the
rate base, increasing it. about 6% from what it other-
wise would be;



- 23 -
(iii) CEL's forecast rate of return increases to 7.6 percent
in 1978, after the Project is completed, and indications
are that CEL will resume earning about 9 percent by 1980,
when Cerron Grande will be operating at full capacity; and
(iv)   CEL appears to have no need for additional cash in the
years when it will earn a lower return.
The currently effective Project Agreement (IDA Credit 227-ES) requires
CEL to effect tariff adjustments to result in a rate of return of at
least 9% but contains no provision allowing IDA to waive this requirement.
Depending on conditions actually existing at the time, the EBank would
consider waiving the tariff requirement during 1976-78; therefore, the
Loan Agreement repeats the provision but allows CEL not to make the required
adjustment if the Bank agrees.
6.18      CEL's annual debt service coverage will vary from 2.0 to 2.5 times
during 1972-77, which is satisfactory. However, its large increase in
borrowings related to the Project will result in a less favorable relation
of current cash generation to future debt service. CEL has agreed not to incur
any indebtedness without the Bank's approval unless its most recent 12-month
internal cash generation is at least 165 times the maximum debt service re-
quirement for any succeeding fiscal year.
Future Financial Position
6.19      CEL's debt/equity ratio will increase from a low 22/78 in 1971 to
about 50/50 at the end of the Project period, which is still quite acceptable.
CEL's debt structure, which will continue to consist predomi.natly of long-
term debt, will be satisfactory. Its current ratio and working capital will
be adequate until 1977, when its cash holdings will increase significantly.
Depending on financing requirements for future projects, this cash position
may enable CEL to consider tariff reductions after the Project period. Fore-
cast balance sheets and key financial ratios are shown as Annexes 13 and 15,
respectively.

7.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached on the following points:
(a) CEL will have studies performed by consultants acceptable to the
Bank to provide for future expansion of its own system and future
interconnections with major distribution companies (paragraph 3.05);
(b) CEL will extend by 5 km and add a diffuser pipe to the canal for
effluent of waste water from the Ahuachapan geothermal station
into the Pacific Ocean as recommended by the Bank consultant
(paragraph 4.16);
(c)  CEL will arrange for periodic inspections of the Cerron Grande dam
and associated structures by experts acceptable to the Bank
(paragraph 4.20);
(d) CEL will provide accounting treatment acceptable to the Bank
concerning revaluation of its external debt and disposition of
studies (paragraph 6.04);
(e) the Government will pay or cause to be paid on a current basis
all amounts owed to CEL by government entities and to pay the
arrearages of ANDA to CEL over a period not longer than three
years (paragraph 6.06);
(f) CEL will retain all its net income during the Project period
(paragraph 6.07);
(g)  the Government will provide, through underwriting or directly,
the local financing necessary to complete the Project (paragraph
6.13);
(h) CEL will set its electricity rates at a level sufficient to earn
at least a 9% return unless the Bank should otherwise agree
(paragraph 6.17); and
(i) CEL will not incur any indebtedness without the Bank's approval
unless its internal cash generation is at least 1.5 times its
maximum future debt service (paragraph 6.18).
7.02      Before the proposed loan is made effective, the Bank should receive:
(a) notification that ID3 is prepared to make~ the initial disbursement
from its loan (paragraph 6.12); and
(b) notification that the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador has
approved CELts extraordinary budget for the Project (paragraph
6.14).

ELECTRIC POWER TARIFFS IN EL SALVADOR
Retail Tariffs
1.        Retail tariffs of CEL (for its rural electrification zones) and
the four largest distribution companies are detailed in the table on page 2,
where they are grouped consistently. Rates of the smaller utilities are
similar to those shown. In addition, some utilities have special tariffs
for particular customers, e.g., street lighting, water supply, other govern-
mental and seasonal service. The special tariffs are basically in accordance
with the schedules shown.
2.        All retail tariffs have a rational structure with stepped energy
rates. The commercial and industrial tariffs (except F5 of (,LES) contain
a demand charge; generally, this charge is not metered but is calculated
on the basis of connected load.
Bulk Tariffs
3.        CEL's tariffs to the distribution companies are:
a.   an energy charge of 0.003/kWn; and
b.   a demand charge of 045 per kW/year to the larger cDmpanies (CAESS,
CLESA, CLES, CLEA, DEUSEM and DESSEM) and ¢50 per kW/year to the
smaller companies and the other bulk customers.
Until recently, the demand charge was based on the annual peak; the resultant
retroactive billing was a point of contention between CEL and the distribution
companies. Under a contract signed with CAESS in September 1972, the demand
charge is applied on a monthly basis for the maximum demand in the most re-
cent 12-month period. It is expected that this pattern will be followed in
future agreements with other distributors.

APPRAISAL OF SIXTH POWER PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJEUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
AHUACHAPAN GEOTHERMAL POWER STATION
Geothermal Field
1.        CEL has been studying El Salvador's geothermal resources, includ-
ing the Ahuachapan field, since 1953; UNDP has provided technical and
financial assistance to these studies since the late 1960s. Surface studies
of an area of about 300 km2 in western El Salvador show manifestations of
geothermal activity.
2.        Within this area, the Ahuachapan geothermal field of about 25 km2
was selected for exploratory drilling and for a UNDP-financed pre-feasibility
study, performed by Kingston et al. Most of the drilling has been concen-
trated in an area of about 1 km2, 2 Im east of the village of Ahuachapan
(see map) and 800 m above sea level. At the time of appraisal, eight wells
had been drilled; of these, six were producing steam from a Layer located
at an average depth of 480 m under the surface.
Characteristics of the Geothermal Fluid
3.        At the producing layer, water under a pressure of :L3-14.6 at.a.
and a temperature of around 2300C is found. At the surface, approximately
25% of the enthalpy of 230 kcal/kg can be obtained in form of usable steam
and 75% in form of hot water at 1000C with a very high content of salts
(mainly silicates and chlorides), which precipitate as the water temperature
decreases. A 30 MW installation would produce an amount of water of the
order of 0.3 m /sec. The high boron content (100 p.p.m.) makes this water
unsuitable for agricultural or residential uses and requires its disposal
to avoid contamination,
4.        In the case of Ahuachapan, steam of 7-9 at.a. is obtained by means
of a separator located at each wellhead. Vithin the steam flow, small
quantities (0.006% in weight) of noncondensable gases are present of which
94% is CO2 and 6% is H2S. The disposal of these gases presents no problem
from an ecological point of view. The noise produced by discharges of steam
into the air, which will be necessary occasionally for pressure stablization
and well maintenance, is within tolerable limits at 500 m from each wellhead
and so it would not affect populated areas.
Field Energy Potential and Initial Installation
5.        Based on present information an estimated value for the total
potential energy from the field is around 24,000 GWTh, of which about one-
third can be produced by means of the wells in operation at present. The
estimated total energy could be utilized by a generating capacity of around
100 MW operating for 30 years; this figure should be reviewed after a period
of operation of the first generating unit and after more wells are drilled
in the area.



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 4 pages
Initial Installation
6.        The initial installation will include:
a.   At least 4 producing wells (depending on the size of the unit
selected, the others will be held in reserve);
b.   Centrifugal steam separators and silencers at each wellhead;
c.   Steam piping from each well site to the main header at the
power house;
d.   A power house containing a condensing-type turbo-generator of
30 MW capacity, condensing equipment, and other accessory
equipment;
e.   A 13.8/115 kV transformer of 35 to 45 1MVA capacity;
f.   Outdoor switchyard; and
g.   A covered 60 km gravitational canal to convey effluent from
the plant to the Pacific Ocean.
7.        From the wellhead separators, the steam will be conveyed to the
main header, from which it will pass through two secondary separators (to
reduce the water content to 0.5% in weight) to the condensing-type turbine.
The condensers will be of the "mixed flow" type; the cooling water will
circulate in closed circuit through cooling towers. Make-up water for the
cooling towers will be obtained from streams in the immediate vicinity. The
water from the main separators will be discharged to the ocean via the
covered canal.
8.        A 22 km single-circuit 115 kV transmission line will be constructed
from Ahuachapan to CEL's network at Santa Ana. Galvanized steel single-
circuit towers and 477 MCM ACSR conductors will be used.
Future Installation
9.        Under drilling programs previously completed and presently underway,
wells of sufficient capacity to support about 45 MW of generating capacity
have been developed. Therefore, CEL expects to cover the requirements of a
second medium-pressure (7-9 at.a.) unit of 30-40 MW. At the same time,
water from each main separator would then be conveyed to a hot water header
in the power house, where a second-stage separator would provide low-pressure
(1.5 at.a.) steam for a third generating unit, also of 30-40 MW capacity.
Water Disposal
10.       As mentioned in paragraph 3, an adequate water disposal system will
be necessary to avoid contamination. Three basic systems were considered
for this purpose.
a.   reinjection into the field;



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 4 pages
b.   storage during the dry season and discharge into the Paz river
during the rainy season; and
c.   continuous discharge into the Pacific Ocean.
System (a) presents several unknowns which could require a long period of
tests in order to determine the absorption capacity of the ground and
possible saturation due to salt precipitation. System (b) would be
sufficient for only the initial installed capacity of 30 MW and would
introduce contaminants into an international river. System (c), continuous
discharge into the ocean by a means of a gravitational canal, is the system
that provides the highest degree of reliability.  This canal will be lined
and covered by removable pre-cast concrete slabs which would, permit in-
spection and removal of the salt deposits. It will be designed for 1 m3/sec
corresponding to the plant's final generating capacity of around 100 MW.
The final survey of the canal route is at present underway, and no major
obstacles are foreseen for its construction.
11.       Bank consultants (Drs. N. Nemerow and R. Faro of Syracuse University),
after studying the method selected by CEL of disposing of the effluent and its
effect on the ocean environment, have recommended that:
a.   the length of the canal be lengthened from 50 km, as originally
designed by CEL, to 55 Ikn, so as to terminate at the ocean rather
than at an estuary; and
b.   the effluent be discharged into the ocean by means of a submerged
pipeline of about 100 m with diffuser ports.
12.       CEL subsequently made further modifications to the canal's route,
so that its total length will increase from the 55 km suggested by the
consultants to about 60 km.
Cost
13.       The estimated cost of the initial 30 MW geothermal installation
at Ahucahapan is presented below:

14.       The estimated foreign cost of the turbo-generator unit and engineer-
ing was based on actual bids or contract prices. Because some design details
of the plant, particularly the effluent canal, had not been finalized at the
time of appraisal, physical contingency allowances of 35% and 15% were applied
to the other local and foreign costs, respectively, of the Project. Because
most foreign currency project expenditures will be made against firm-price
contracts to be signed in 1973, and because price inflation for Salvadoran
labor has been minimal in the recent past and is expected to remain so, a price
contingency allowance of about 10 should be sufficient to allow for price in-
flation, including that caused by currency revaluations.

APPRAISAL OF THE SIXTH POWR PROJECT - El SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
CERRON GRANDE HYDROELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT
Background
1.        El Salvador has only one major source of hydroelectric energy:
the Rio Lempa, whose total energy potential is estimated at 3,500 GWh per
year. The Cinco de Noviembre hydro plant at Guayabo (Loans 22-ES, 221-ES
and 342-ES), with an annual generation of 400 GWh, was the first instal-
lation on the Rio Lempa; the Guajoyo plant with annual generation of 70
GW, takes water from Lake Guija and discharges into a tributary of the
Lempa (see map for plant locations).
2.        Subsequent to the installation of the fifth unit at the Cinco
de Noviembre plant in 1963, CEL was ready in 1967 to proceed with the
next step in the river's development, the Poza del Silencio plant. How-
ever, political circumstances prevented the construct on of the Poza del
Silencio project at the time and necessitated the installation of a second
steam unit (33 MW) at Acajutla and two 16.5 MW gas turbine units at Soyapango
to meet CEL's requirements. In the ensuing four years CEL and its consultants
selected another site about 20 km upstream from the Cinco de Noviembre
plant near Cerron Grande.
3.        On the Rio Lempa, two sites upstream from Cerron Grande, and two
downstream from Cinco de Noviembre, have been identified (see map). Because
of a lack of water, the upstream sites both appear uneconomic.
Downstream, the El Tigre site, although large (about 400 MW) and apparently
economic, cannot be developed now because its reservoir would inundate
Honduran territory as well as Salvadoran. Dry-season regulation, which
Cerron Grande would provide, would be required to justify the low-head
rum-of-river La Pintada project; consequently, this smaller (80 MW) project
would appear economic only after completion of Cerron Grande.
4.        CEL and its consultants have concluded that Cerron Grande should have
a final installed capacity of 270 MW with an annual average generation of
584 GWi, based on a computer simulation of the monthly operation of the
system's hydro generating stations for hydrological conditions of 17 years
of recorded stream-flows and forecasted future demands. The regulating
effect of Cerron Grande's reservoir would increase the annual energy genera-
tion of Cinco de Noviembre plant by 142 GWh.
Description
5.        The Project, located 4.D km northeast of San Salvador at the head-
waters of the Cinco de Noviembre reservoir (see map), will consist of:



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 5 pages
a.   An earth-and-rock-fill dam across the Rio Lempa;
b.   Spillway on the left bank;
c.   Intakes on the right side of the spillway approach channel
connecting to tunnels feeding the turbines;
d.   A surface powerhouse on the left bank; and
e.   A switchyard on the right bank connecting to a double-circuit
115 kV line to San Salvador.
6.        The dam will have a maximum height of 85 m and crest at 250 m
above sea level; it will require about 6,000,000 m3 of fill; and its crest
length will be about 600 m. To the maximum possible extent, the dam will
utilize material from required excavation; other materials, including
impervious core materials, are available within a few kilometers of the
dam site. The dam will form a reservoir with the following dimensions
at El 243 m, its maximum operating level:
a.   Surface area - 135 km2;
b.   Length - 35 km upstream from dam site;
c.   Storage - 1,430 million m3 between operating limits at El 228 m
to El 243 m, plus 750 million m3 below El 228. m.
7.        The spillway, which will be founded on rock, will consist of a
control structure with four radial gates, each 15 m by 12.2 m, a chute
and a flip bucket. With the normal maximum reservoir level at El 243 m,
the spillway will have the capacity to discharge about 6,500 m3/sec, equal
to inflow which would occur once every 50 years. For larger floods, the
reservoir will provide storage up to El 249.4 m, and the spillway will
then discharge about 11,000 m3/sec. This is designed for protection against
the probable maximum flood.
8.        The power facilities will consist of two intakes, two pressure
tunnels, and a powerhouse with two 67.5 MW units. Minimum provisions will
be made for adding two additional 67.5 MW units in the future. The
vertical-shaft Francis-type turbines will each be rated at 94,100 metric
horsepower, 144 rpm at 57 m net head. The generators will be rated
75,000 kVA and 0.9 power factor. The generators will be connected to
individual step-up transformers, type FOA, rated 86,ooo kVA, 13.8 kV.
9.        A transnission line about 34 lom long will be built from the
switchyard, located across the river from the powerhouse, to Nejapa sub-
station, near San Salvador. The line will be double-circuit, 115 kV, on
self-supporting galvanized steel double circuit towers. The conductor
will be 477 MCM ACSR. In addition, a single-circuit, three-phase 115 kV
line will be built on single-circuit towers from Cerron Grande substation
to the Cinco de Noviembre substation about 20 km away. The conductor will
also be 477 MCM ACSR.

11.       Allowances for physical contingencies, price escalation and special
procurement were computed as follows:
a.   Physical contingencies of between 5 and 15% have been applied to
each cost component except engineering and administration. The
resulting overall physical contingency allowance is about 10%
for local and 9% for foreign costs.
b.   Price escalation of foreign costs was computed using a 4% annual
escalation rate . An additional price contingency allowance of 10%
was included for Project elements subject to worldwide competitive
bidding. The resulting overall price contingency is about 12.5%
of the estimated foreign cost.



ANNEX 6

This should be sufficient to allow for price inflation , including
that caused by possible currency revaluations. Sufficient allowances
have been made in the base cost estimates to provide for escalation
of local labor costs, which has been minimal in El Salvador during
the past several years.
c.   Because goods and services financed by IDB must be obtained from
its member nations, special allowances have been included for
such restricted procurement based on IDB's experience in similar
procurements. These special contingencies are 50% of the foreign
cost plus normal contingencies for the general contract, or US$7.58
million; and 20% for turbo-generator units, or US$0.96 million.
Financing
12.       The proposed IDB loan would finance about 71% of the foreign and 19%

APPRAISAL OF SIXTH POWER PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE POWER PROGRAMS 1974-1984
1.        From the many possible programs to meet El Salvador's incremental
electricity requirements through 1984, the six most practical have been
selected for comparison. The six programs, which are shown in the table on
page 2 of this annex, are based on different combinations of the following
types of generating units:
i.   30 MW geothermal units to be installed at Ahuachapan, with a
final capacity of 90 MW.
ii.   67.5 MW hydroelectric units to be installed at Cerron Grande,
with a final capacity of 270 MW.
iii.   33, 66 and 99 MW oil-fired steam units to be installed at
suitable places on the Pacific coast.
The characteristics of the selected units take into account the size of the
system to be served and the efficient utilization of available resources.
2.        The assumptions concerning capital, fuel and annual operating and
maintenance (O&M) costs for each type of unit included in the comparison
are shown on page 3. All costs exclude taxes, since CEL pays no taxes.
Local unskilled labor, which is underutilized in El Salvador, has been
shadow-priced at 50% of its cost.
3.        The resulting cost streams for the six programs for the period
1974-2024, which covers the assumed useful life of the hydroelectric plant,
are shown on page 4.  A useful life of 25 years has been assumed for steam-
electric and geothermal plants; each unit of this type has been replaced
with like and kind at the end of its assumed useful life in the computations.
Residual values of the remaining facilities have been treated as a negative
cost at the end of the period.
4.        The present worth of each program has been calculated for annual
discount rates from 5 to 20%. As shown on the graph (page 5 of this annex),
which shows the differences among the programs' net present worths, the
recommended Program A is the least-cost solution for discount rates up to
about 16%.
5.        In a separate calculation, the assumed price of fuel was reduced
by 10% for the two least-cost programs (the recommended Program A and the
all steam-electric Program F). The results of this comparison were similar
to the comparison  of the six programs:  the recommended program, denoted
A' on the graph, is the preferable program for discount rates up to about
14.5% when compared to the next-best alternative, denoted F'.

APPRAISAL OF SIXTH POWER PROJECT - EL SALVADOR
COMISION EJECUTIVA HIDROELECTRICA DEL RIO LEMPA (CEL)
RETURN ON THE PROGRAM INVESTMENT
1.        Both generating facilities included in the Project involve
substantial initial expenditures for works common to generating units in-
cluded in the Project as well as those to be installed later. To be
specific, the geothermal plant includes a canal designed for generating
capacity three times the 30 MW to be installed initially; the ultimate
capacity of the Cerron Grande hydro plant is double the 135 MW included
in the Project.  It is for this reason that the return on the program,
rather than the Prcject, investment has been determined. In this determina-
tion, the benefits to the country have been compared with the costs of the
program selected as the least-cost solution of meeting El Salvador's incre-
mental electricity needs for the period 1974-84 (see Annex 8).  This com-
parison has been extended over the assumed useful life (50 years) of the
hydroelectric project.
Project Benefits
2.        To establish the minimum value of the program benefits, revenues
have been determined by applying an estimated retail tariff of ¢0007
(US$0.028)/kWh to the generation of the Ahuachapan and Cerron Grande plants'
final capacities, plus the additional energy which will be produced at
Cinco de Noviemnbre as a result of increased regulation provided by the
Cerron Grande dam, less transmission and distribution losses.
3.        While Cerron Grande is not a flood control project, its regulating
capacity will provide additional downstream benefits, including:
a.   Reduction of flood losses;
b.   Possibilities of increased agricultural production in the lower
Lempa basin; and
c.   Increased potential generation of future hydro projects.
The computations have not taken these benefits into account.
Project Costs
4.        The capital costs of the two generating plants and related trans-
mission lines used in this determination are those estimated in the appro-
priabe feasibility studies at world-market prices and consequently do not
reflect minor modifications made by the appraisal team or the special
allowance for IDB member-country procurement. In addition, estimated costs
of distribution facilities to convey the energy to the retail consumer have
been included. Facilities have been replaced with like and kind at the end
of their assumed useful lives.



ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 3 pages
5.        Incremental operating and maintenance costs have been estimated
for each plant and for transmission based on the consultants' studies,
and for distribution based on the distribution companies' experience.
6.        About 4,400 ha of the 13,500 ha to be inundated by the Cerron
Grande reservoir is intensively cultivated, principally with sugar cane.
The loss in net agricultural return because of Cerron Grande is estimated
at 03 million (US$1.2 million) annually; this loss is reflected as a
project cost in the estimated price of the land. Also included in the
hydro project's capital costs are the value of the houses to be inundated
and the cost of relocating the sugar mill.
Income Transfers
7.        As detailed in paragraph 6.10 of the report, the IDB loan would
be on soft terms, which would compensate for the increased investment cost
caused by restricted IDB member-country procurement even if that cost were
to double. Under the assumption that El Salvador would have obtained this
net transfer for another project if the Cerroh Grande project had not been
available, the increased investment costs, which represent only income
transfers between countries, have not been introduced into the estimated
return on program investment.
Return on the Investment
8.        As shown on the accompanying table, the return on the program's
investment is estimated to be at least 17%.

ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 2 pages
ACCOUNTING MATTERS AND THEIR SUGGESTED SOLUTION
1.        CEL's balance sheet at December 31, 1971, did not reflect the
increase in the amount of CEL's external debt caused by the various 1971
currency revasuations. This increase amounted to about $2.3 million
(US$920,000), as detailed in Annex 11. During the appraisal mission, it
was suggested that CEL should reflect this revaluation as of January 1,
1972 by:
a.   increasing the book value of its external debt to show the
valuation computed by the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador;
b.   increasing the value of its fixed assets by a corresponding
amount; and
c.   depreciating the increased asset value over a period of 20 to
25 years, which would represent the remaining life of the assets.
2.        As of December 31, 1971 CEL was carrying about 08.2 million
(US$3.3 million) of studies as deferred charges on its books. These studies
included expenditures associated with future projects and for other purposes
as shown below:
- - - - thousands - - - -
Poza del Silencio                   01,071            US$  428
Geothermal resources                 4,898               1,959
Others                               2,214                 886
Total                            -08,183            US$3,273
Since CEL had not selected a definite accounting treatment for these studies,
the appraisal mission suggested that it establish the following procedure
for capitalizing and writing off these studies:
a.  For any studies directly associated with a future project:
capitalization when the project is commissioned and depreciation
over its life.
b.   For all other studies not related to a project planned within
the next five years at December 31, 1972 and each succeeding
year-end: capitalization on the following January 1 and
write-off over five years.
