DAHOMEY
HINVI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of the Republic of Dahomey has requested an IDA
credit to help finance agricultural development in South Dahomey.
ii.       Agriculture in Dahomey is based on the traditional system of
shifting cultivation. In South Dahomey conditions are suitable for more in-
tensive cultivation. Increased production of cash crops, but also of subsist-
ence crops will make resources available for export, upon which the economy
of Dahomey is heavily dependent. Palm oil and kernels are the main exports,
mostly being produced from natural palms whose yields are low. Internal con-
sumption of palm oil is increasing and exports are therefore declining.
iii.      In 1962, Government established SONADER (Societe Nationale pour le
Developpement Rural du Dahomey), a para-statal authority charged with devel-
oping agricultural production in Dahomey. SONADER is now responsible for all
the oil palm development in the country. It is a completely Africanized
organization which displays a high level of competence both at Head Office
and in the field, and since 1962 has organized the planting of improved oil
palms, on a cooperative basis, on some 13,000 hectares.
iv.       The project for which assistance is requested includes the estab-
lishment of ten cooperatives which would cultivate a total of 6,000 ha of
improved oil palms and 6,000 ha of annual crops, together with forests and
livestock.
v.        The project would produce 10,000 tons of palm oil and 2,400 tons of
kernels annually at maturity. In addition, 4,000 families would be organized
in cooperatives, and would cultivate annual crops, under close guidance, to
provide their own food requirements and surpluses of maize, groundnuts and
cotton for cash sale. Increased timber and livestock production would also
result. The project would yield a return to the economay of about 12%.
vi.       The estimated total cost of the project is CFAF 2,370 million
(US$9.6 million) of which it is proposed that about half would be supplied by
FAC (Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation) and half by an IDA credit. The Govern-
ment of Dahomey would contribute CFAF 96 million (US$0.4 million). Of foreign
exchange requirements of about CFAF 1,087 million (US$4.4 million) some 65%
would be financed by IDA and 35% by FAC. Project revenues would allow re-
payment of the total investment over 15 years, following a grace period of
9 years. The project would be suitable for an IDA credit of US$4.6 million.
The credit would be made to the Government of Dahomey, and would be on-lent
by the latter to SONADER.






DAHOMEY
HINVI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In August 1966, the Government of the Republic of Dahomey asked the
Association for assistance in financing an agricultural development project
in the Hinvi area of South Dahomey. The project was prepared by the Societe
Nationale pour le Developpement Rural du Dahomey (SONADER), and later modified
with assistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. In March 1967, a Bank
preappraisal mission, consisting of Messrs. Rowe, Vigie, von Czernicki (con-
sultant), and Bishop (FAO), reviewed the project and made suggestions for
further clarification and improvements. In July 1967, the final report, pre-
pared by SONADER, was handed to the Bank's appraisal mission in Dahamey.
1.02      This appraisal report is based on the findings of a Bank mission
composed of Messrs. van Gent and Parsons (Bank) and Fenn (FAO) which visited
Dahomey in July 1967. As joint financing by IDA, and Fonds d'Aide et de
Cooperation (FAC) is contemplated, Bank/FAO staff have collaborated closely
with the staff of FAC both in the preparation and appraisal of the project.
Messrs. Vene and Julienne represented FAC on the appraisal. A mission con-
sisting of Messrs. Willems and Hassid visited Dahamey in August 1968 to up-
date this report. The long delay since original appraisal has been due to
political circumstances in Dahomey which prevented IDA and FAC from proceeding
further with the project until the end of summer 1968.
II. BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.01      Dahomey has a total land area of 11.3 million ha and a population
of 2.4 million. Agriculture, still based on the traditional system of shift-
ing cultivation and bush fallow, occupies an estimated 77% of the active male
population and accounts for almost 50% of gross domestic product (GDP).
2.02      The Central and Northern administrative regions of Dahomey comprise
about 90% of the land area, lie mainly in the savannah zone, and are sparsely
cultivated. The Southern regions, with an average annual rainfall between
1,000 and 1,500 mm, are suitable for more intensive cultivation, and support
more than half of the country's inhabitants. In this area, population pres-
sure on farm land is becoming serious, and consequently levels of soil fertil-
ity are falling. Exports of most crops, including oil palm produce, therefore,
declined in recent years. An exception is Allen type cotton, which is being
effectively developed in northern areas.
2.03      The industrial sector of the economy is very small, accounting for
only 2½% of GDP, and based largely on processing agricultural products.
There are no known deposits of minerals to be exploited. Important develop-
ments of recent years have been the construction of a deepwater harbor at
Cotonou, and a palm kernel oil expressing factory with a capacity of 40,000
tons of kernels per year. These have been constructed with bilateral aid from
France and Germany respectively.



2.04      For 1963, GDP was estimated at CFAF 42 billion (US$170 million),
equivalent to approximately US$70 per head. This compares with Nigeria -
approximately US$100, Ivory Coast - US$200, and Upper Volta - US$45. In-
creases in GDP in real terms have been insignificant since 1959, and current
modest living standards are possible only through continuing overseas aid.
Government revenue from internal sources covers only 70 to 80% of public
expenditure on current account, and annual budget deficits have been met
mainly by France. Public investment has been financed almost entirely by
grants from external sources, particularly FAC and Fonds Europeen de
Developpement (FED).
2.05      Opportunities for industrial development are very restricted, and
the country's hopes of increasing national income, balancing its budget, and
improving its external trade, depend on expanding agricultural production for
export in both primary and processed forms. Increasing efficiency is both
feasible and necessary, not only in cash crop, but also in subsistence crop
production in order that more resources are made available for the export
sector.
2.06      Natural groves of oil palms cover an estimated area of between o.4
and 0.5 million ha in Southern Dahomey. These have been and remain the main
source of agricultural cash incomes and export earnings. In 1960 through
1967, exports of palm oil averaged 11,000 tons per year. From 1960 through
1965 palm kernel exports averaged 52,000 tons per year. With the opening of
the palm kernel mill, kernels were processed for export in the form of oil
and cake; see Annex 1. Since 1961, the annual value of oil palm produce
exports has averaged CFAF 2,100 million (US$8.5 million) out of a total of
approximately CFAF 3,400 million (US$14 million) for all exports, and the
share of total export earnings contributed by palm produce has increased,
from 52% in 1961 to 73% in 1965. In 1966, due to bad weather conditions, the
value of oil palm produce exported fell to CFAF 1,400 million (54%).
2.07      Palm oil is the principal source of edible fats for the people of
Southern Dahomey. Local consumption is rising with population grovth, and
domestic requirements are expected to increase from approximately 23,000 tons
in 1964 to 32,000 tons in 1975, and to double by 1985. Dahomey faces the
prospect of having to import palm oil within the next decade if palm produce
production is not increased.
2.08      There is an urgent need for the planned development of oil palm
production, both to meet domestic needs and to at least maintain exports.
Some further development of cotton, groundnuts and other export produce is
feasible. Crops such as cocoa, coffee or rubber, are absent, for reasons of
soil and climate. Therefore, the Dahomean economy, for the foreseeable
future, must remain largely dependent on the oil palm.
2.09      Initial programs to increase palm oil production consisted of the
construction, between 1951 and 1955, of four factories for milling fresh
fruit bunches (ffb)!/ from wild palms. These factories now process about
1/ ffb - fresh fruit bunches are the product of the oil palm; each bunch is
a cluster of individual fruits; each fruit consists of a nut, which con-
tains the palm kernel, surrounded by oily flesh from which palm oil is
extracted.



90,000 tons of ffb annually. A fifth factory, with a capacity of 30,000 tons
will be completed in March 1969.
2.10      To complement the factories, Government initiated a program of
planting improved oil palms. Starting in 1955, some 2,300 ha were planted
by 1961. These plantations were not successful due to land tenure problems
and maintenance difficulties. In 1962, however, Government enacted legis-
lation which allowed it to compulsorily acquire the use of privately owned
-land and to enforce the formation of producer cooperatives, thereby making
both land and labor available for organized agricultural development: see
para 6.03. At about the same time SONADER was created. Since then the
situation has improved considerably.  SONADER is a para-statal authority
charged with developing agricultural production in Dahomey, and is now respon-
sible for all oil palm development in the country; for details see Chapter VI.
1962 through 1968, some 13,000 ha of oil palms were planted. These, and
part of the previously planted area, totalling 15,700 ha in all, are now
managed and operated by cooperatives, supervised by SONADER and are very well
maintained. In addition to the Hinvi project - the subject of this report -
the planting of another 7,000 ha in the period 1967-1970 is planned. This
latter program - 2,618 ha have already been planted - is being financed by
FED.
2.11      The system of development used by SONADER is to acquire land in the
close vicinity of villages, and to establish sufficiently large blocks of oil
palms to permit the use of modern methods. Blocks of about 600 ha have been
shown to be the most suitable. Blocks of an equivalent size are established
at the same time for annual crop production. Villagers become cooperative
members, and work both oil palm and annual crop blocks under the supervision,
and with the assistance of SONADER. The system of locating the blocks close
to villages, makes major investment in new housing and social services unneces-
sary.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
3.01      In Southern Dahomey oil palms occur naturally in a coastal belt
varying in width up to 200 km. The "Grand Hinvi" perimeter is situated cen-
trally in this belt; see Map. The perimeter encloses 75,000 ha of which the
project will eventually utilize about 15,000 ha for oil palms, annual crops,
villages and roads. The railway and main surfaced road from Cotonou to the
north, form the western boundary of the perimeter.
3.02      Annual rainfall, and rainfall distribution in the project area are
sub-optimal for oil palm production, and oil palms take longer to mature and
subsequently yield lower than in neighboring countries. However, temperatures
and insolation of Hinvi are suitable for oil palms, and soils are satisfactory.
Population density is about 50 per km2, amongst the highest in Dahomey, and
labor supply for the project presents no difficulties. Land tenure, labor
costs, and present land use, together with details of the physical environment
of the project are described in Annex 2.



- 4 -
3.03      Research on oil palms in Dahomey is carried out by Institut de
Recherches pour les Huiles et Oleangineux (IRHO), on annual crops by Institut
de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales et des Cultures Vivrieres (IRAT), and
on cotton, mainly in Northern Dahomey, by Institut de Recherches du Coton et
des Textiles Exotiques (IRCT). Very close cooperation exists between these
organizations and SONADER. Details of research work and main findings are
given in Annex 2. SONADER has contractual arrangements for technical assist-
ance with IRHO, and benefits from the advice of IRAT and IRCT. Since mid-
1968 a Dahomean livestock specialist from the Ministry of Agriculture has
been attached to SONADER. Assurances have been received that SONADER would
continue its arrangements for technical assistance with IRHO, IRAT and IRCT
and obtain adequate advice on livestock matters.
IV. THE PROJECT
General Description and Objectives
4.01      The project, which started in 1967 and the development phase of
which will be completed in 1977 has the following elements:
- establishing and bringing to maturity 6,000 ha of oil
palms,
- preparing 6,000 ha for annual crop production,
- constructing a palm oil factory with an ultimate annual
capacity of 70,000 tons of ffb,
- planting 1,000 ha of teak and cassia trees,
- purchasing 310 cattle for the development of beef production,
- developing necessary roads and central project facilities.
Development, and subsequent production, would be organized through ten coop-
erative units - each with 600 ha of oil palms and 600 ha of annual crops.
During the first 25 years of project development and operation, SONADER would
have full responsibility for managing the project, and directing cooperative
activity. Subsequently, the ten cooperatives would become lessees of the
land and owners of the improvements described above. SONADER would train
required cooperative staff, and would meet cooperative staffing costs during
the development period.
4.02      The main objective of the project is to develop an efficient and
modern system of agricultural production, capable of ensuring participating
cooperators with a standard of living superior to that now obtained from
traditional farming methods. In achieving this, the project would increase
the production, and maintain, while initially increasing, exports of oil palm
produce from Dahomey.

Establishment of the Oil Palm Plantations
4.03      The following table shows the phasing of oil palm plantings:
DEVELOPMENT OF OIL PALM PLANTATIONS
1968          1969          1970
Planting (ha)                     1,800         1,.800         2,400
Creation of cooperatives (No's)   1,2,3         4,5,6         7,8,9,lo
Seed would be supplied by IRHO which has adequate supplies of material to
meet project needs. Plantings in 1968 were on schedule and nurseries have
been established for the planned planting of 1,800 ha in 1969.
4.o4      All land for the project would be cleared by hand.  Due to experi-
ence gained by SONADER on other schemes, cleari-ng operations are well orga-
nized and labor accustomed to the work.  A leguminous cover crop would be
planted between the palms.
Maintenance and Husbandry of Oil Palms
4.05      Under Dahomey conditions it is necessary to protect young oil palms
from rodent attack by placing a cylinder of wire netting around each plant.
Annual potassic fertilizer applications also are essential; the application
of other nutrients has not been shown to give economic returns. Lines of
trees - Cassia and Casuarina - would be planted to help isolate the oil palm
blocks against fire, and to act as wind breaks, an Important consideration
while the palms are young. All inflorescences appearing on young palms would
be pruned and not allowed to set fruit until the palm is four years old.
Work by IRHO has proved this to be economically beneficial.
Palm Oil Factory
4.o6      While quite a large surplus of ffb processing capacity exists in
Dahomey, the only factory near enough to economically process Hinvi project
production has a theoretical surplus capacity of only 17,000 tons of ffb.
The project would produce about 48,000 tons annually ati maturity, and conse-
quently a factory would be constructed in the project -area. A site has yet
to be chosen from four alternative locations; see annexed Map. Assurances
have been received from the Government that qualified consultants, acceptable
to IDA, would be employed for locating and designing the factory and for
preparing related bidding documents. CFAF 4.o million (US$16,000) is included
in project costs for these purposes. Construction would be in two stages,
the first, in 1973, with a capacity of 16 tons of ffb/hour, the second in
1976 with a total final capacity of 24 tons of ffb/hour. This capacity weuld
allow an annual throughput of 70,000 tons of ffb. It would enable the factory
to process the production of other newly established plantations in the Hinvi
area. Project oil palms would come into production in 1973, sh.ortly before
the commissioning of the factory, and the small tonnage then involved would
be transported to the nearest existing factory at Bohicon, 60 km distant.



-6-
Annual Crop Areas
4.07      The 6,000 ha for annual crops would be developed as ten 600 ha
blocks, each in conjunction with a block of 600 ha of oil palms. The blocks
would be cleared by SONADER, and each would be divided into lots for allo-
cation to individual cooperative members. Lots would be subdivided into six
rotational fields, and a seventh field for cultivation of miscellaneous crops
outside the rotation. Lots would be 1.4 ha each and would provide sufficient
food for the average family plus some saleable surplus and, in addition, would
be large enough to allow the cultivation of a cash crop, cotton. Details of
the rotation are given in Annex 3.
4.o8      SONADER's original plan was that the full 600 ha of annual crops
for each cooperative would be developed within three years. Experience has
shown, however, that six years is a more realistic period, consequently annual
crop blocks would be developed as shown in the following table:
DEVELOPMENT OF ANNUAL CROPS

In 1968 the target of 317 ha was achieved. Trained extension workers are
essential for the success of the annual crops sector of the project. In the
early years of developing each block one extension officer would supervise
25 hectares, but later intensity would be reduced to one officer for each
100 ha and 70 families. Extension workers would be initially SONADER, but
subsequently cooperative, employees.
Livestock
4.09      At present, livestock in the Hinvi area are mainly sheep and goats.
There are very few cattle. However, the legume cover under the oil palms
would provide valuable cattle fodder. SONADER has successfully demonstrated
this by establishing breeding herds of 50 cows in some of its existing coop-
eratives. A central project breeding herd would be established with the object
of providing stock for the ten project cooperatives. The central herd would
start with 300 breeding females and by natural increase would build up to
500 adult females by year seven, at which time each of the ten cooperatives
would be allocated 50 head. By year 15, each cooperative would be able to
maintain a herd of about 200 adult equivalent head, of which 100 would be
breeding stock, on the 600 ha of legume cover in the palm plantations and
50 ha of grass that would be established specially for the herd and utilized
mainly for dry season keep.



- 7 -
4.10      Ndama cattle, which are resistant to trypanosomiasis, would be pur-
chased from outside the project area if sufficient numbers of the local breed
cannot be purchased. Trypanosomiasis is endemic in the area and local cattle
are of the "lagoon" breed, very small, hardy, and trypanosomiasis resistant.
Rinderpest is endemic and inoculations would be routine, but tick born dis-
eases are not serious. There are no plans for milk production at present.
Maize Storage Silos
4.11      From 1971 onwards, increasing amounts of maize produced for commer-
cial sale on the annual crop blocks would justify central drying and storage
facilities. Traditional methods of drying and storing maize involve physical
losses of at least 20% over the normal five month storage period. Due to
this, market prices for maize are depressed immediately after the harvests in
July and December, and rise sharply in the period up to the next harvest. In
the months of May and June in particular, shortages of supplies commonly in-
crease market prices to at least twice the December/January level.
4.12      To permit rational marketing in this situation, conventional American-
type silos in units of 180 tons capacity would be installed for drying and
storing approximately 75% of the maize produced for commercial sale. Coop-
erative members would harvest and shell their maize, and after providing for
their own needs, would be able to sell the balance of their maize crop to
the project's Cooperative Union; see para 6.10. Storage capacity would be
progressively increased from three silos for 540 tons in 1971, up to 17 silos
for 3,060 tons in 1976. The units would be grouped together near the site of
the palm oil mill for reasons of economy and efficient management.
Afforestation
4.13      In addition to planting trees for wind and fire breaks, 700 ha of
teak and 300 ha of Cassia siamea would be planted on suitable land between
the cooperative blocks. Planting would begin in 1969, and be completed in
1973. Revenues accruing to the cooperatives from these ventures are calcu-
lated only for the teak. The teak would allow three thinnings, producing
building poles in years 6, 11 and 18, and a clear felling producing 200 m3 of
timber per ha after 50 years. The Cassia plantations would produce fuel -
wood, and replace natural sources of fuel which would be destroyed in land
clearing.
Villages
4.14      Full development of the project would necessitate some families
moving from their present scattered dwellings in the development areas to new
villages based on the cooperative blocks. Ten villages would be established,
and would be the headquarters of the ten cooperatives. So far as possible,
villages would be sited adjacent to the cooperative blocks and close to exist-
ing villages, so that full advantage would be taken of these and their existing
services such as schools, dispensaries and water points.
4.15      Two of the new villages, Hinvi and Goulo, would assume greater im-
portance than the others. The Cooperative Union headquarters with its central



- 8 -
equipment pool and stores would be sited at Hinvi.  Goulo would be a sub-
center, with lesser facilities, for cooperatives in the eastern section of
the area. Village development would be undertaken by SONADER, and would con-
sist of preparing the land, siting roads, allocating areas for different
purposes, and building stores and houses for officials. Individual coopera-
tors choosing to move into the new villages would be responsible for con-
structing their own houses.
4.16      Each village would be allocated 27 ha for private dwellings, 6.5 ha
for roads and paths, 8 ha for official buildings and 8.5 ha for wood lots and
open spaces - a total allocation of 50 ha per village. Official buildings
would comprise houses for the Director of the Cooperative and his assistant,
a store, and a stockade for the cattle. In addition, at Cooperative Union
Headquarters at Hinvi, there would be fire fighting units including tractors
and water trailers, a central store and two additional houses for Cooperative
Union officials. Dispensaries and schools would not be financed under the
project but would be provided by the Government.
4.17      The availability of groundwater for village supplies and nursery
irrigation has been the subject of the study reported in Annex 2. It is
possible to use surface water from the rivers and swamps in the area for
irrigation of nurseries. The road requirements of the project area, both for
communication between cooperatives and for transport of produce to rail and
road head, have been designed after detailed study. The proposed road net-
work is shown on the annexed Map. Connecting roads are designed with an eight
meters carriageway and the total system would amount to 52 km, of which 16 km
would be through the blocks themselves.
Labor Requirements
4.18      Some of the estimates of labor requirements for various field oper-
ations used by SONADER are in excess of standards established in oil palm
projects elsewhere. In particular, requirements for land clearing, planting
and maintenance are high. The efficiency of cooperative labor is likely to
be rather less, however, than that of paid laborers on commercial estates,
and in view of this SONADER's figures are acceptable. The standard of field
work on SONADER projects is extremely good, and as high standards are essen-
tial to obtain even moderate yields under Dahomey conditions, it is not con-
sidered wise to reduce the estimates. Annex 4 summarizes the labor require-
ments for the oil palm plantations.
4.19      Maximum project labor requirements occur in 1969 when 766,000 man
days of work would be necessary. This would reouire an average of about
2,500 men per day, and a turn-out of well over this figure at times of peak
labor requirements. Bearing in mind that a recent survey of the project area
carried out by SONADER shows the total population of the perimeter alone to
be 10,000 active men and 5,000 women over 14 years of age, there would be no
difficulty in obtaining this number of workers.

V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS
Cost Estimates
5.01      Project costs total CFAF 2,370 million (US$9.6 million), of which
the foreign exchange component is about CFAF 1,087 million (US$4.4 million)
or 45%. The breakdown of costs, given in Annex 5, is summarized in the follow-
ing table. Further details of foreign exchange costs are given in Annex 6.

5.02      Cost estimates for the oil palm plantations and annual crops are in
line with recent costs experienced by SONADER in similar projects, and have
been checked and agreed with IRHO, IRAT, CFDT and FAC. Factory cost estimates
are comparable with costs experienced in other Bank and IDA financed projects.
An overall contingency of approximately 10% has been applied to all cost items,
except those already disbursed.
Proposed Financing
5.03      The US$9.6 million (CFAF 2,370 million) total project cost would be
financed by IDA, FAC and the Government, and as follows:

- 10 -
The IDA credit of Us$4.6 million would be made to the Government, as would
the FAC credit of US$4.6 million. Proceeds of the IDA credit would be onlent
by the Government to SONADER at six per cent interest and would be repaid over
25 years including nine years of grace. Conditions of the FAC credit are that
it would be onlent to SONADER, and that SONADER would repay the credit within
a 31-year period at an interest rate varying from 0.75% to 2.50%. Repayment
of the FAC credit by SONADER would be not to the Government directly, but to
"Fonds Dahomeyen de Renouvellement de la Palmeraie", a fund established, at
FAC insistence, for the purpose of continuing oil palm development. The
Government contribution of US$0.4 million would be made in the form of reim-
bursements to SONADER of taxes and duties paid on indirect imports. In prac-
tice, and since France heavily subsidizes Dahomey's recurrent budget, FAC
would meet the Governments' commitment, consequently providing a total of
US$5.0 million of project costs. All direct imports for the project would be
free of import duties. Details of the financing arrangements appear in Annex
6. The project cash flow, at Annex 7, shows that SONADER would be able to
make full repayment of the IDA and FAC credits to the Government from cash
surpluses which would be available for this purpose as from 1977.
5.04      SONADER would indirectly onlend proceeds of the IDA and FAC credits
to the ten project cooperatives. In the first 25 years of the project, how-
ever, SONADER would have complete managerial, administrative, and financial
control of the cooperatives. All revenues would accrue to SONADER within
this period and surpluses would be returned to the cooperatives only after
all costs, including loan repayments had been met.
Disbursement and Procurement
5.05      IDA and FAC financing would be parallel in part, and the remainder
joint. All goods and services wholly financed by IDA - valued at US$2.7 mil-
lion - and all goods and services financed jointly by IDA and FAC - valued
at US$5.8 million - would be procured through international competitive
bidding, except for services provided directly by SONADER and individual
contracts costing US$50,000 or less, which would be let locally. Goods and
services wholly financed by FAC - valued at US$0.7 million - would be pro-
cured within the Franc zone.
5.o6      Disbursements for that part of project costs that would qualify for
100% IDA financing, would be made against the cif cost of approved imported
items, as certified by shipping documents. Disbursements of 100% would also
be made against the costs of erecting the palm oil factory and maize silos,
as certified by contracts and completion certificates. Disbursement of that
part of the IDA credit employed in joint financing with FAC, would cover 46%
of all other costs not directly financed by either IDA or FAC, and incurred
after December 31, 1968. Disbursement would be against certified records of
achievement in land development and other approved items. FAC would meet the
remaining 54% of these costs (including the Government participation of nine
per cent). The relative percentages take account of the fact that work on the
project started in 1967, and that by December 31, 1968, FAC will have met all
project costs incurred, up to this time. These costs are estimated at
CFAF 533 million (US$2.2 million).



Audit
5.07      The general assembly of shareholders of SONADER nominates for three
year terms one or more auditors, chosen from an authorized list. SONADER is
further subject to all economic and financial controls provided under current
laws; see Annex 8. These arrangements are considered satisfactory.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MA4AGEMENT
Authority Managing the Project
6.01      The project authority would be the Societe Nationale pour le
Developpement Rural du Dahomey (SONADER), a Government controlled company
(Societe d'Economie Mixte) charged with sponsoring agricultural development
in Dahomey, and the creation and supervision of producers' cooperatives.
SONADER was established in 1962, and has a capital of CFAF 150 million. Fur-
ther details of SONADER are given in Annex 8.
6.02      SONADER is a completely Africanized organization, and displays a
high level of competence, both at its head office and in the field. It is
efficient, and has gained considerable experience in agricultural development
and the organization and management of producer cooperatives. SONADER is
capable of handling an expanded program including the proposed project. It
is of the utmost importance to the continued success of SONADER's operations
that the quality of its senior staff is maintained. Assurances have been
received from the Government that the senior staff of SONADER at all times
would be mutually acceptable to the Government and to IDA.
6.03      In 1961 new laws were enacted which have had far reaching effects
on agricultural development in Dahomey. These permit Government development
agencies - SONADER at present is the only one so engaged - to: -
- oblige land owners in designated development areas to group
themselves into producer cooperatives, or alternatively,
- oblige land owners in development areas to rent their land
to producer cooperatives, established by the agency and
- supervise and control, for 25 years, producer cooperatives
established in the above manner.
6.o4      SONADER would organize ten producer cooperatives under the project.
Organization of the cooperatives would go hand-in-hand with the physical
development of the project. Physical development would be directly executed
by SONADER with its own staff and funds, and would include establishment of
the oil palm plantations, tree plantings, and cattle herds; road and palm
oil factory construction, and the clearing and development of village sites
and arable crops areas. During the development period the ten cooperatives,
and an apex organization - the Cooperative Union, see para 6.10 - would be
created by SONADER and would gradually take over responsibility for management.
Under the Cooperative Law of 1961 SONADER would have the power to take over



- 12 -
the direction of the cooperatives or even to dissolve them in the event of
unsatisfactory performance. In practice, and since the ten cooperatives would
be financially indebted to SONADER, the latter would exert a high level of
direct control over the cooperatives for the first 25 years of their existence.
It would be only after this time, and after discharge of their debt to SONADER
that the cooperatives would become autonomous. SONADER would play two distinct
roles in development and operation of the project. First as a development
agency, and second as a managing agent for the cooperatives. These arrange-
ments are satisfactory; but assurances have been obtained from the Government
that SONADER would retain the powers, now given to it under the Cooperative
Law of 1961, throughout the 25-year lifetime of the project.
6.05      SONADER would have to increase its present staff in order to be
able to execute the project. It would also have to recruit and train key
staff for the cooperatives. Arrangements for recruitment and training are
satisfactory, and fuller details are given in Annex 9.
6.o6      The finance and accounting department of SONADER would require
strengthening in order to carry out the additional work caused by the project.
The Government has given an assurance that the services of a suitable financial
advisor would be obtained.
Cooperative Organization
6.07      Each of the project's ten cooperatives would eventually manage
about 600 ha of oil palms, an equivalent area of annual crops, associated
tree plantings, cattle, and buildings and equipment. Land required for the
project would be leased, and where development is already taking place is
being leased, by its owners to one or another of the ten project cooperatives
under the provisions of the 1961 laws. Leases are for 50 years. In compen-
sation owners receive rent in the form of interest on shares which they are
given in the cooperative; see para 6.08. Interest is equivalent to an annual
rent of CFAF 900 (US$3.60) per ha, and during the first 25 years of the proj-
ect would be guaranteed and paid directly by SONADER. Subsequently the indi-
vidual cooperatives would be responsible for the payment of rent.
6.o8      The cooperatives would have two kinds of members.   First, the owners
of land in the development area who would receive one "A" share for each ha
leased by them for the project. "A" shares are valued at CFAF 30,000 (US$120).
Second, farmers who have worked for a minimum of 200 days on the establishment
of the oil palm plantations, and agree to work a holding of 1.5 ha of annual
crops. Members of the second group would receive a "B" share, also valued
at CFAF 30,000 (US$120). The basis for the issue of "B' shares is that the
"official" daily wage in the project area is CFAF 275.  Cooperative members
working on the project oil palms would earn only CFAF 1251/ Thus, the value
of a "B" share is equivalent to wages foregone during 200 days of work. Hold-
ers of "A" shares may obtain, and would be encouraged to obtain "B" shares in
1/ For the development period of the palm plantings only - about four years.
When the palms are in production, members would be paid CFAF 200 daily.



- 13 -
the above manner. "B" shares alone give their holders rights to participation
in the profits of the cooperative; this participation is limited, however, to
three per cent per year of the value of the shares. Profits after payment of
interest on "B" shares would be used for capital improvements and to increase
the daily wage for workers in the plantations.
6.09      The 1.5 (1.4 net) ha holdings of annual crops would be worked by
cooperative members and their families as individual enterprises, the produce
from these being their sole property. The cooperatives, however, would require
farmers to follow a specific rotation for 1.2 ha of each plot. On the remain-
ing 0.2 ha, farmers would be free to grow what they please. The cooperatives
would provide seeds, fertilizer and other inputs which would be paid for by
farmers, and marketing and storage facilities. Farmers would have the choice
of using the latter or not.
6.10      The ten project cooperatives would be grouped into a Cooperative
Union, which eventually would own the palm oil factory, maize silos and other
central facilities. As in the case of the individual cooperatives, the
Cooperative Union would be managed by SONIADER for 25 years.
Processing and Marketing Project Production
6.11      Societe Nationale des Huileries du Dahomey (SNAHDA) was established
by statute in 1962 as the national authority for operating palm oil factories
and for the export and overseas sale of oil palm produce; see Annex 10.
SNAHDA would, in principle, be the most suitable agency for managing the proj-
ect palm oil factory on behalf of the Cooperative Union and for marketing and
overseas sale of palm oil and kernels. SNAHDA as presently operated is not
suitable for this role, due to poor, in particular financial, management.
For some time, FAC has been concerned with this problem, and negotiations are
in progress with the Government for a FAC assisted program of reorganization
and staff training. If the program is implemented, SNAHDA might be capable
of assuming responsibility for processing and marketing project palm produce
when production starts in 1973. IDA would keep this matter under close
review. Assurances have been received from the Government that SNAHDA would
be suitably reorganized. If by 1972, IDA in consultation with FAC, the
Government and SONADER concludes that SNAHDA is still unsuitable it would be
necessary for SONADER to conclude an alternative management contract with an
organization satisfactory to IDA for factory operation and the marketing of
the factory's production. The agreement of the Government has been obtained
to such a contingency arrangement.
6.12      Maize would be sold on the local market. Groundnuts and cotton
would be sold to the existing official export marketing authorities.
6.13      Facilities for the evacuation by rail of palm products and other
project commodities from Hinvi to the port of Cotonou, port storage and sub-
sequent shipment facilities are adequate, and no special difficulties are
envisaged.



VII.  YIELDS, PRICES, PROJEC' REVENUES AND BENEFITS
TO COOPERATIVE MEMBERS
Prices of Oil Palm Produce
7.01      From maturity of its plantings in 1979, the project would yield about
10,000 tons of palm oil annually. Together with projected output from similar
schemes, see para 2.10, this would cause Dahomey's production of palm oil from
plantings of improved palms to rise to approximately 37,000 tons annually in
the early 1980's. By that time production from wild palms would have declined
from a presently estimated 30,000 tons to about 26,000 tons annually. The
decline in wild palm production would stem from a number of causes, impor-
tantly, a reduction in oil palm numbers due to land clearing, the increasing
average age of wild palms, and a decline in the number of people prepared to
engage in the arduous task of climbing and harvesting the tall wild palms.
Within the same period domestic consumption of palm oil would increase, from
some 27,000 tons at present to about 37,000 tons in 1980. Consequently, by
1980, Dahomey would have an annual surplus of about 26,000 tons of palm oil
for export, compared with an annual average of about 11,000 tons exported
during the 1960's.
7.02      The market for Dahomey's palm oil exports during the life of the
project would be the European Economic Community (EEC). By 1980 the EEC import
demand for vegetable oils is estimated to rise to about 2.9 million tons.
Dahomey's estimated exports of palm oil would amount to less than 1% of
these, as against 10% of annual imports of palm oil made by the EEC in the
years 1963-1965. Of project production of palm oil, part would be exported
-- about 73%; and part sold on the domestic market -- some 27%. The percentage
of project palm oil estimated to be sold on the domestic market has been cal-
culated on the assumption that all Government sponsored oil palm schemes would
share, on the basis of their production, domestic market requirements not met
by traditional processors of wild palm ffb. Consequently, sales of project
palm oil on the domestic market are expected to amount to about 400 tons in
1973 and to rise to about 3,000 in 1980. From 1979 project production of
palm kernels would amount to about 2,400 tons annually, these would be ex-
ported either as kernels, or as palm kernel oil and cake after processing
in Dahomey.
7.03      Annex 4 examines market and price prospects for export palm oil
and palm kernels. It concludes that there will be no problem in finding
markets for project production and that during the life of the project the
c.i.f. Europe price for palm oil would be in the range of US$155 to US$165
per metric ton, and that for kernels in the range US$134 to US$138. For the
purposes of this report the following prices are assumed for project palm
produce exports: palm oil US$160 per metric ton c.i.f. Europe; palm kernels
US$136 per metric ton c.i.f. Europe. These prices compare with the following
average European market prices in 1968: palm oil US$170; palm kernels US$155.
Prices for palm oil in 1968 weakened sharply in the summer reaching a low of
US$141 per metric ton in June, reflecting exceptionally heavy supplies of
fish oil, sunflower seed oil and soybean oil. At the end of the year prices
were again hardening, but while expected to rise to the range forecast by
the Trade Policies and Export Projections Division are not expected to rise



- 15 -
to levels experienced earlier in 1968 and in previous years. Project palm
oil sold on the local market would realise appreciably higher prices, and in
report calculations an ex-mill price of CFAF 50,000 (US$200) per metric ton
is used.
Producer Price Stabilization Policy
7.04      Producer prices are fixed annually by Government for each of Dahomey's
main export crops and subsequently guaranteed through the "Fonds de Soutien et
de Stabilisation de Produits a l'Exportation". One of these stabilization
funds is maintained separately for each crop, and is augmented by trading sur-
pluses made by Government agencies responsible for marketing export commodities,
such as SNAHDA, and by taxes and duties on both exports and imports. In the
case of oil palm produce, the price currently paid to producers for ffb is
fixed at a level commensurate with anticipated selling prices, SNAHDA's proc-
essing and marketing costs, and a surplus which accrues initially to SNAHDA
and then to the Government. The project would produce oil and kernels for
sale, not ffb, and if SNAHDA managed the mill and subsequently marketed project
production, it would receive a fixed fee for these responsibilities. Conse-
quently no trading surpluses would accrue to the Government and be available
for transfer to the stabilization fund. The Government has given no indication
that it would desire to control the price of project palm produce, other than
by taxation applied to all exports of palm produce. It is possible, however,
that it might wish to do so in the future and assurances have been received
from the Government that exports of project palm produce would be subject
only to those taxes and duties imposed upon all Dahomean palm produce exports.
Project Yields
7.05      SONADER's projections of palm produce yields are based on the
experience of IRHO in Dahomey, and are reasonable. Due to variations in
annual rainfall, however, yields and production will vary considerably from
year to year. Growth is, in general, slower than in other oil palm areas of
West Africa and yields at maturity will probably not exceed an average of

7.06      Yields of maize are expected to increase from their present levels
to two tons per ha and those of groundnuts in shell to 1.2 tons per ha within
the first full rotational cycle of six years. Yield growth rates will depend
on the capacity of the farmers to adopt improved husbandry methods and on the
rate of application of fertilizers. From the seventh year yields of maize
are estimated to progressively increase by 50 kg per ha and those of ground-
nuts by 10 kg per ha up to a final per ha yield of three tons of maize and
1.4 tons of groundnuts in shell. Yield increases of this magnitude over a
25 year period are conservative. Cotton yields are estimated as rising to
one ton of seed cotton per ha by year 9 and thereafter remaining at this
level. Further details of yields and prices are given in Annex 4 and 11.
7.07      Cattle would become available for sale around 1971, with the annual
number rising from 5 in 1971 to approximately 474 head from 1987 onwards.
Until herd numbers become fixed, the surplus stock would be composed of
three-year old bulls and, after year 8, female culls. Once herd numbers
stabilize, breeding heifers would also become available for sale. Stock
would be sold locally. Since there is a considerable demand for beef in
the area, no difficulties are envisaged in marketing. Despite the small
size of these cattle, a price of CFAF 17,000 per head is estimated as ob-
tainable locally.
Project Revenues
7.08      Revenues accruing to the project cooperatives are summarized in
Annex 7. Revenues from the oil palm plantations would accrue first in 1973
and all plantings would be in full production from 1980 onwards. The annual
revenue, ex-factory, from oil and kernels, from 1980, would be approximately
CFAF 390 million. Revenues from livestock production would be small until
1988 when total herd numbers would be stabilized at approximately 2,800 head.
From that time, all stock, surplus to replacement needs, would be marketed,
producing annual gross revenues of about CFAF 8 million. Periodic thinning
of the forest plantations would generate a gross revenue of about CFAF
150 million from the sale of teak poles within the project period. The
value of timber produced on final felling of the plantations after 50 years
is estimated at approximately CFAF 700 million.
7.09      As yields improve and the area under annual crops is progressively
increased from 317 ha in 1968 to 6,000 ha in 1976, revenues to cooperative
members from sales of maize, groundnuts and cotton would increase. By 1976
these would reach an estimated annual value of some CFAF 190 million, of which
maize sales would provide about CFAF 110 million. Thereafter, continuing
improvements in yields are expected to increase gross revenue, up to an
annual total of about CFAF 250 million.
7.10      By 1980, with oil palms in full production, the project's gross
annual revenue is forecast at approximately CFAF 620 million increasing
progressively to a level of around CFAF 680 million by 1992.
7.11      Exports of palm oil and kernels are subject to duties and official
charges. After making allowances for charges representing the cost of quality
control and other services, total levies per ton at present amount to CFAP



- 17 -
1,200 for palm oil and CFAF 4,500 for palm kernels. Total taxes on exports
of project oil palm produce, groundnuts and cotton are estimated to rise to
CFAF 37 million annually by the 1980's.
Benefits to Cooperative Members
7.12      About 16,000 people, comprising 4,000 cooperative members and their
families, would benefit financially from the project. Individual cooperators
would obtain these financial benefits from:
- wages obtained for work on the oil palm plantations;
about 80 days annually at CFAF 200 a day - CFAF 16,000,
- net income from saleable surpluses of annual crops; with
the full 1.4 ha holding in production this would amount
to about CFAF 42,000 annually,
- interest on "A" and "B" shares; totaling about CFAF 1,800
annually.
The total cash income of about CFAF 60,000 would be in addition to subsistence
food which would be produced on the annual crop holding. Surveys in the proj-
ect area indicate that potential cooperative members now obtain about CFAF
12,000 annually in addition to subsistence. Annex 12 contains further details
of the estimated incomes of cooperative members.
VIII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
8.01      The project would make a major contribution towards increasing
agricultural production and exports in a country where the development poten-
tial is not high. In particular it would maintain and increase exports of
oil palm produce. From 1980, the project would produce 10,000 tons of palm
oil and 2,400 tons of palm kernels annually, representing about 35% of the
palm oil and 4.5% of the palm kernels expected to be available for export in
1980. By 1980 the annual value of project originating exports - oil palm
produce, cotton, and groundnuts - would be approximately CFAF 600 million,
and would be equivalent to about 20% of the total annual value of Dahamey'a
agricultural exports in recent years.
8.02      Indirect economic benefits, especially revenues generated through
transport and services would be noteworthy. Finally, the social reorgani-
zation caused by the project would bring important non-economic benefits to
the population involved, in particular in the form of better living condi-
tions and opportunities.
8.03      Over an estimated project life-time of 25 years, and on the basis
of costs, yields and prices assumed in this report, the project would yield
an average internal rate of return to the economy of about 12%; see Annex
13. In the calculation of the above rate of return the alternative employment
opportunities of cooperative members are costed at zero. This is because



- 18 -
there are no other employment opportunities in the project area, and none likely
to become available in the foreseeable future. The loss of existing cash
crop production as a result of land clearing, is, however, taken into account.
IX. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The project, as planned, is technically sound and economically
justified, and therefore suitable for an IDA credit of US$4.6 million. Among
assurances obtained from the Government of Dahomey were:
(a)  SONADER would continue its arrangements for technical
assistance with IRHO, IRAT and IRCT, and would obtain
adequate advice on livestock matters (para 3.03);
(b) SONADER would retain its powers under its present
charter and current cooperative laws throughout the
lifetime of the project (para 6.04);
(c) SNAHDA would be suitably reorganized (para 6.11);
(d) management agents appointed for the operation of the
factory, in the event of SNAHDA being unsuitable for
the role, would be acceptable to IDA (para 6.11); and
(e) no less favorable marketing conditions would be pro-
vided for project palm produce than those provided
by the Government for non-project production (para
7.04).

HINVI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Physical Conditions in the Project Area
Climate
About 1,800 mm rainfall annually is considered optimal for oil
palm production, and this should be evenly distributed. Rainfall in the
project area is sub-optimal and not evenly distributed: the annual average
recorded at Niaouli, close to the project perimeter, is 1,171 mm with a vari-
ation of up to t 340 mm over the 26 years during which records have been
kept. There are two dry seasons, one month during July/August and three
months at the turn of the year. Table 1 shows the average rainfall distri-
bution at Niaouli.

The temperatures recorded in South Dahomey are entirely suitable
for oil palm production. The average annual totals of 1,893 hours of sun-
shine at Pobe and 2,194 hours at Cotonou compare favorably with other oil
palm areas of the world. Table 2 shows the mean monthly and mean minimum
temperatures at Niaouli.

The pedology of South Dahomey has been studied by various organiza-
tions in recent years. The soils identified in these studies have been
classified into six categories according to their suitability for oil palm
production. The soils encountered within the project area are all in Cate-
gories III and IV. Although not so fertile as Categories I and II, these
soils are suitable for oil palm production. They are in general low in
organic matter and bases.






ANNEX 2
Page 2
The project area is heavily cultivated, with forest remnants per-
sisting only in the "bois fetiches" and in valley beds. Land under fallow
following cultivation supports bush growth reverting to forest where the
fallow has exceeded 15 years. Towards the north of the area forest rezmants
become rare and the dominant vegetation is a type of bush savanna. Through-
out the area oil palms occur naturally in populations of varying density.
There is little surface water in the project area, but the rivers
Oueme and So flow close to the eastern border which is a swamp area. There
are a few wells supplying village and nursery requirements. The groundwater
hydrology has been the subject of a recent study. There exist two aquifers,
one at 70 m and the other at 400 - 600 m depth. The upper aquifer is consid-
ered suitable for limited exploitation in the south of the project area. The
deeper aquifer has not been test pumped. Irrigation trials on oil palm
started on a small scale at Mono but were discontinued in 1968 because of
abundant rainfalls. There is a possibility that the lower lying blocks at
Hinvi may be irrigable by surface water supplies. As water is the major
factor limiting yields in the project area this possibility is of interest
in the future, but no account is taken of it in this project appraisal.
Population
The Grand Hinvi perimeter contains a total population of 38,339
divided into 3,458 "homesteads',, 60 per cent of which contain two or more
families.  An average family is conposed of four people.  The population is
more dense in the south of the area.  In addition to paid labor, a family
head can call upon traditional community help in agricultural operations.
This help is available from kinship groups and is usually paid for in food
and drink or in an equivalent return of work. The system enables heavy tasks,
such as land clearing, to be done in good time and without cash resources.
Land Tenure
Originally, the usufruct of the land belonged to those who first
settled on it. Once there was no suitable land left for further allocation
on this basis, various types of tenure evolved. At present land is either
inherited or purchased. A recent survey in the Grand Hinvi area shows that
35 per cent of the privately owned holdings have been acquired by purchase,
64 per cent by inheritance, and 1 per cent is rented. Land inherited is often
held under "family" tenure, but the tendency in recent years appears to be
towards the division of holdings to individuals. This individual ownership
of land is rare in West African countries.
Labor SuDply and Costs
The population density in South Dahomey is high. In the Hinvi area
it approaches 51 people per km2; 65 per cent of the total active population
are engaged in agriculture and unlike some other parts of the country where
women are almost exclusively engaged in trade, in Hinvi the women share the
work in the fields and account for 33 per cent of the agricultural labor
force. At present there is no shortage of labor available for work in the






ANNEX 2
Page 3
project, nor is there any fear that the supply of labor will be limiting in
the future. Men domiciled as far away as Cotonou are Ikown to seek work in
the project area, even for remuneration at the reduced level proposed in the
project. Although there is a statutory minimum agricultural wage of CFAF 275
per diem, the normal wage in the country is much less than this and the daily
wage of CFAF 125 per diem assumed for the project is in fact higher than that
paid in some other parts of the area.
Present Land Use and Agricultural Practices
By far the largest proportion of land cultivated is sown to maize.
Table 3 shows the estimated area cultivated and estimated production from
within the Grand Hinvi perimeter during 1965/66.

NOTE: 1966/67 yield estimates for the Hinvi area indicate 1,700 kg/ha for
maizep 800 kg/ha for groundnuts, and 500 kg/ha for cotton (seed).
It is estimated that the production of palm oil from this area, derived from
wild palms, is about 1,350 tons annually. At present there is no timber pro-
duction as all the teak forests previously planted in the area are immature,
but there is a certain amount of bush fuel obtained from the area.
The year is divided agriculturally into two seasons, the first
season from March to June and the second from September to November, coin-
ciding with the two rainy seasons of the year. Maize is grown in both seasons,
groundnuts usually in the first season, and beans and cotton during the second
season. A certain amount of inter-cropping is practiced, but maize is always
the dominant crop. The average area cultivated per family is 1.55 ha in the
first season and 1.64 ha in the second season according to a survey made in
1965/66. Presently SONADER allocates 1.50 ha per family per season.






ANNEX 2
Page 4
Large landowners practice a form of shifting cultivation whereby
fields are cleared and cropped for three to four years before being abandoned
to natural fallow for eight years on the average. On holdings where there
is not sufficient land to allow this system to be practiced more intensive
rotation is adopted and in some cases continuous cultivation of land is
practiced. Fertilizers or organic manures are not in common use. Only hand
tools are used there being no traditional use of animal draught power in the
area. Tree stumps are never cleared. Planting is normally carried out by
placement rather than by broadcasting seed. Cotton has only recently been
planted to any extent. In order to control pests and diseases, cotton plants
must by law be uprooted and burned at the end of the season, but this is not
always effected.
Research
IRHO (Institute de Recherches pour les Huiles et Oleagineux) in
Dahomey have their main oil palm research station at Pobe. This station lies
in an area of just over 1,200 mm average annual rainfall containing the same
soil types that are found at Hinvi. The main work of the station is the pro-
duction of new hybrids from which the SONADER plantations obtain their
planting material. Recent hybrids of Deli x Dura/Tenera crosses show in-
creases in yields of up to 120 per cent over crosses of purely African origin.
This material grown at Pobe on category III soils similar to those found at
Hinvi has yielded 11 tons/ha under Pobe conditions of rainfall. This is
estimated equivalent to a yield of 9.5 tons/ha under Hinvi conditions where
water deficits are greater. Similarly it is estimated that yields of the same
hybrids in category IV soils at Hinvi will be in the order of 7.7 tons/ha.
The advisability of utilizing an aggressive ground cover such as
Pueraria appeared to be, under the marginal rainfall conditions of Hinvi was
investigated. Experimental evidence, however, showed such a cover to be
beneficial. Some work had also been done on the control of Imperata grass at
Pobe. This is a serious weed of some of SONADER's previous plantations and
the subject of considerable expense estimated for the present project. Pre-
sent recommendations to eradicate the Imperata grass cover multiple mechanical
operations, followed by 30 man-days hand labor per hectare.   Chemical weed-
killers have been tested, but have nou been satisfactory.
The cropping patterns proposed for the annual crop blocks at Hinvi
originated from the experience gained at the IRAT (Institute de Recherches
Agronomiques Tropicales et des Cultures Vivrieres) research station at
Niaouli. The evidence available indicates that with the recommended fertil-
izer applications the proposed rotation would maintain soil fertility over
the years. 1Maize and groundnut varieties are tested at the station and a
small amount of improved seed is supplied to SONADERe The bulk of the
station's seed, howvever, is delivered to a multiplication farm at Sekou from
where it is available to SONADERo The present varieties have been grown for
some years and are not very impressive. A certain amount of breeding work
on maize using varieties introduced from Nigeria and Kenya is being under-
taken but there are no results of tiis work available as yet. Fertilizer






ANNEX 2
Page 5
trials show the necessity for applying quite heavy applications of phosphate
and potash to maize in addition to nitrogen. A herd of cattle was kept on
the station and some work was being done on fodder crops.
Research work on cotton is carried out by a third organization known
as IRCT (Institute de Recherches du Coton et des Textiles Exotiques) while
the crop is marketed through CFDT (Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement
des Fibres Textiles). Seven spray treatments are necessary and a hand oper-
ated knapsack sprayer is advocated. Spacing and fertilizer requirements have
been clearly established. The "Allen" variety in general distribution in the
south was selected in the Ivory Coast and has a lint length of 1-1/32 to
1-1/A inches. Seed from the experiment stations is grown in multiplication
areas in the north of the country and distribution is organized by CFDT.

MARKET PROSPECTS FOR PALM OIL AND PAINT KERN.ELS
1.        A paper on the fats and oilssituation is currently under prepar-
ation within the Bank, and will deal in detail, inter alia, with the
market prospects for palm oil and palm kernels.   Progress on the paper
has reached the stage where it is possible to draw some conclusions about
palm oil and palm kernels, which are set out below; while these conclusions
must be considered tentative pending the publication of the more general
paper, no major changes are anticipated.
Palm Oil
2.        Trends in supply and demand for individual fats and oils are
far more difficult to judge than those for the total market, particularly
since most of t' e major oil Droducts are produced either as joint products
or by-products.   Thus, as in the case for soybeans, the production of
specific oils may be determined, not only by trends in the oils and fats
market, but also by the demand for the joint or related products.
Another feature which also has to be c cnsidered in reviewing the market
for a particular oil product is the amount of substitution possible
between different fats and oils.   Within a broad range, on technical
considerations, one oil can be substituted for another.    Currently, the
bulk of palm oil is used in the food industry.    Here it meets its
strongest competition from soybean, groundnut and sunflower seed oils.
Fish oils are also used for edible purposes, but they are at a disadvantage
compared with palm oil, owing to the high processing costs involved in
making them usable for this purpose.
3.        Usually, the associated product of the marine and vegetable oils
is a protein-rich cake or meal.   The oil palm, however, compared with
some of its competitors, produces a very low proportion of protein cake
to oil, and the cake is the by-product of palm kernel oil, rather than palm
oil.   The overall ratio of palm and palm kernel oils to cake is about 9:1.
In comparison, the soybean produces oil to meal in the ratio of 1:h in
terms of weight.
4.        Palm oil is produced almost entirely   in four developing countries:
Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia and Malaysia.    Table 1
indicates the production situation in these and other countries in recent
years.   Compared with other major fats and oils (Table 2) the growth rate
for world palm oil production has been low, up to recent years amounting to






ANNEX l
Appandix A
Page 2
only 1.3% per annum.   The only really significant expansion took place
in Malaysia.   However, in a number of countries, particularly Malaysia,
a considerable further expansion in production is planned for the future.
Some of these plans have already been put into operation.    If these
developments go according to schedule, total world production will amount
to approximately 2.5 million tons between 1975 and 1980.   This would
represent a growth rate of slightly more than 5% between 1965-67 and 1980,
compared with a yearly rate of increase of 1.3% between 195L-56 and 1965-67.
The share of palm oil production on total fats and oils production would
increase to approximately 5%,compared with 3% in 1965-67.
5.        Many of the developments are export-oriented and a considerable
share of the additional supplies will have to be absorbed by the inter-
national market.   Oil palm exports increased very slowly during the last
decade, largely owing to the slow growth in production rather than market-
ing  difficulties.   Actually, in the period fron 1954-56 to 1965-67, palm
oil exports declined slightly (Table 3).   It is estimated that by 1975
palm oil exports will amount to approximately 1.2 million tons, compared
with 550,000 tons in 1965-67.   Consequently, the share of palm oil exports
on total trade will probably increase to 9% in 1975, compared with 5.4%
in the earlier period.
6.        The palm oil economy thus faces two major problems in the future.
Firstly, it will have to face declining world market prices, a phenomenon
that is shared by nearly all major fats and oils.   Secondly, it will have
to increase its share as an ingredient in the total usage of fats and oils.
Considering the fact that palm oil does not have all the quality
characteristics enjoyed by some of the other oils (e.g. coconut oil), this
could only be achieved through price declines larger than those expected
for some other oils.
7.        It is in food uses where palm oil will have to increase its
market share.   In the past, this was only possible to a certain degree,
mainly because of limitation in availabilities.    Among other factors,
this apparently prevented processors from undertaking the necessary research
into the technical and economic difficulties which would have to be over-
come if palm oil is to be incorporated as a major ingredient in food pro-
ducts.   One major difficulty, particularly at the relatively high palm oil
prices of the past, appears to have been thedisposal at remunerative prices
of the inedible portion resulting from palm oil processing, which wvould
make large-scale processing feasible.
8.        The Chart (IBRD-L199) indicates that palm oil prices have
generally followed the trend of all fats and oils prices, declining to a
low level in 1962 and experiencing a sharp fall after the high 1965 prices.
Of particular importance is the narrowing of the large price difference
between soybean oil and palm oil which prevailed in the 1950's.    Since
1963, prices for both products have moved closely together, which indicates
that their future fortunes will also betightly knit.

9.        In the second half of 1968, palm oil prices dropped sharply to
approximately $1LO per ton, compared with $222 per ton in 1967.    This
steep decline was caused by large shipments of soybeans and soybean oil
and unusually large exports of sunflower seed and fish oil.    It is
believed that this is a short-term situation and that palmoil prices will
recover to a higher level.   In view of the large anticipated exports and
the technical difficulties mentioned previously, however, it is unlikely
that they will reach the 1967 levels.   Future prices have been estimated
to fall by the mid-1970's into a price range between $155-165 per m ton
c.i.f. Europe.
10.       These projections have to be seen in the light of the uncertain-
ties which surround any price forecast and of fats and oils in particular.
For example, if soybean exports under P.L. 480 are reduced or cease
altogether without compensating changes in U.S. production policy, the
above price forecast may prove to be optimistic.   On the other hand, if
only part of the large requirements that would be needed to meet the needs
of fat deficit countries could be turned into effective demand, the fore-
cast may be pessimistic.
Palm Kernels
11.       The fruits of the oil palm contain two separate sources of oil:
the fleshy and fibrous exocarp (pulp) from which palm oil is obtained and
a nut kernel in a hard shell from which palm kernel is extracted.    The
pulp of the fruits deteriorates rapidly after harvest and extraction has
to be carried out in producing areas.   Palm kernels, in contrast,
deteriorate very slowly.   Also, their processing into oils is a relatively
more complex operation.   Extraction is, therefore, usually performed in
large crushing mills, mainly in the importing industrialized countries.
Only in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have palm kernels been
crushed on a large scale and the country's exports consist almost entirely
of oil, rather than kernels.
12.       Wild palm fruits have a low proportion of pulp and a high pro-
portion of kernels.   In plantations now in the process of development,
however, the ratio of pulp to kernel is expected to increase.    Thus, the
future expansion in palm oil output will not be matched by a commensurate
increase in palm kernel oil output.
13.       Palm kernel oil, unlike palm oil, is a lauric oil and as such
closely resembles coconut oil.   These types of oils are regarded in many
countries as a desirable ingredient of margarine and shortening, and for
use in confectionary and bakery products.   Lauric oils also possess






ANNEX h
Appendix A
Page 4
special qualities which make them an essential constituent up to a certain
minimum in soap manufacture; they also have a wide variety of other
industrial uses, such as in the manufacture of synthetic detergents.
1l.       All these factors account for a more inelastic demand
than for most other fats and oils.   This became very apparent in 1967-68
when prices of nearly all major fats and oils decreased.    Prices of lauric
oils, incbuding palm kernel oil, remained high, mostly because of short
supplies, but also because of the limited degreeof substitutability.
Presently, there are some indications that new industrial processes will
make it possible to produce synthetically the special component of the
lauric acid oils which are the cause of the inelastic demand.    This, of
course, would limit the special role these oils play in the market.   How-
ever, so far no definite information is available which indicates that
industrial manufacture of lauric oils will be undertaken on a large scale.
15.       The price, production and trade situation for palm kernels and
palm kernel oil are indicated in the Chart and Table b.    It is assumed
that palm kernel oil, in line with other fats and oils, will follow a
downward trend in the future.   Since palm kernel oil will not increase in
output at the same rate as palm oil, however, it is unlikely that its price
will decline as much as has been projected for palm oil.    It is estimated
that a price range of $134-138 per m ton for palm kernels will prevail in
the mid-1970's.

HINVI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SONADER
(Societe Nationale pour le Vieveloppement Rural du Dahomey)
Constitution
SONiADER was created by decree No.61-191/PR/MAC of July 8, 1961 as
a "Societe d'Economie Mixte" and its statutes were approved by decree No.
50/PR/NAC/SNDR of February 3, 1962.
Objectives
Under this legislation, it is given official responsibility for
implementing development programs for increasing of agricultural production
and rural modernization. In order to pursue this objective it can undertake
the preparation, execution, coordination and supervision of agricultural de-
velopment operations in rural development areas which are designated accord-
ing to Law No.61-26 of August 15, 1961. It can act directly or through
specialized organizations.
Although SONADER's comrpetence covers the whole territory of Dahomey,
its main field of activity has been in the oil palm sector in the southern
part of the country where it has taken over all the responsibilities of an
earlier organization for the promotion of oil palm production, the "Secteur
Palmeraie Oueme".
Capital
The capital of SONADER was initially 50 million CFAF and in 1967
it was increased to 150 million CFAF. Fifty-one per cent of the shares are
of Category "A", and can only be owned by public bodies, and 49 per cent are
of Category "B", which can be owned by either public or private bodies. In
practice all funds have been obtained from Government sources.
Administrationi
SONADER is administered by a Board of 12 members, who serve for
six years, and are chosen by the general assembly of shareholders. Category
"A" shareholders have to be represented by at least seven members. The
President of the Board can, and does at present, fulfill at the same time
the function of General Maniager of the Company. The President - General
Manager is chosen by the members of the Board on the recommendation of the
1Minister responsible for supervision of the company. The activities of
SONADER are supervised by a "Controleur d'Etat"', nominated by the Council
of Ministers on a joint recomraiendation by the Ministers of Finance and Agri-
culture.






ANNEX 8
Page 2
Accounting
The general assembly of shareholders nominate for three-year terms,
one or more auditors, chosen from an authorized list. SONADER is further
subject to all economic and financial controls provided for by the current
laws. The annual accounts for the years 1964, 1965 and 1966 are summarized
in Appendix A. The accounts for 1966 have not yet been presented to the
Board. Starting in 1967, the financial year will begin on July 1st and end
on June 30th. From the revenues of the company, after all charges and pro-
visions for depreciation have been met, five per cent is allocated to a
legally constituted reserve fund until this fund reaches an amount equal to
one-tenth of the Company's capital. Any remaining revenue is allocated,
accorling to the decisions of the general assembly, to special reserves,
reinvestments in field operations of the company or amortization of its
capital. No dividend may be paid to the shareholders and no bonuses given
to the company's managers.
Organization
An organization chart of SONADER is shown as Appendix B. The
total staff amounts to about 100 persons and all established posts are held
by Dahomeans. The President - General Manager at present is Mr. Amoussou,
an agricultural engineer (Ingenieur du Genie Rural). In order to keep up
to date with developments in oil palm cultivation, SONADER has a contract
for technical assistance with Institute de Recherches pour les Huiles et
Oleagineux (IRHO) Institute de Recherches Agronomiques Tropicales et des
Cultures Vivrieves (IRAT) and Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpement des
Fibres Textiles (CFDT) also provide technical assistance for annual crops
(mainly maize, groundnuts and cotton), but no contractual agreements have
yet been made with these organizations.
Evaluation
SONADER has shown by its performance that it is well organized and
competent. Its field work in the planting and maintenance of oil palm
plantations as well as its organization of cooperatives and development of
annual crop cultivation is eminently satisfactory. At present SONADER is
training (mainly field) personnel for the increased tasks it will have to
fulfill when the yearly planting program increases considerably from 1969.
To cope with these enlarged undertakings in the future, some strengthening
of the financial and accounting departments would be advisable. SONADER
intends to recruit additional staff for these departments in the near future
but a senior financial advisor will still be required.

HINVI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Staff and Training of Personnel
Temporary teams would be formed to supervise the work in
prenurseries and nurseries, and for establishing the plantations themselves.
Three teams wiould be formed to guide the operations in the three cooperatives
to be established during 1968.   The teams would complete their work and move
on to supervise the three cooperatives to be established in 1969.  In 1970,
four cooperatives are to be established and a fourth team would be required.
In addition, there would be permanent staff to manage the cooperatives and
supervise the field work on the oil palms and annual crops.  All staff
would be in the service of SONADER, but the permanent personnel would
transfer gradually to the cooperatives as soon as SONADER judges them
capable of operating independently.
The staff for these teams requires training.  As also staff for
SONADER's other cooperative developments has to be trained, only a proportion
of the training expenses wTould be charged to the project.  Refresher courses
would also be necessary.   SONADER has made arrangements for the necessary
courses together with a program of educational visits, a schedule of which is
given in Appendix A.   The programs proposed are considered satisfactory.
The staff for running the courses and the facilities for the theory classes
would be supplied from existing SONADER staff and equipment, and by utilizing
experts of the experimental stations at Pobe and Niaouli.  Cooperative staff
would receive their practical training on the Hinvi blocks in the course of
formation and the extension workers would do their practical training at
SONADER's pl,atation at Ouedo.

HINVI AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMEU4T PROJECT
SNAHDA
(Societe Nationale Des Huileries Du Dahomey)
Constitution
SNAHDA was created in 1962 as a "Societe d'Etat".
Objectives
According to the terms of its establishing law, the Corporation
is to be responsible for operating existing and future oil factories, bulk
oil storage plants and all related enterprises and for the development of
cultivation of oil palms and other oil seeds, and the marketing of the
country's oil and oil products.
At present, SNAHDA manages four palm oil factories, one kernel
oil factory and the bulk oil plant at the port of Cotonou.   The total
annual potential capacity of the factories is 140,000 tons of palm oil and
40,000 tons of kernels.   The marketing overseas of the oil palm produce is
handled through brokers and with the help of a representative in Paris.
Capital
The capital of SNAHDA is 200 million CFAF provided by the Govern-
ment of Dahiomey plus the value of fixed and current assets transferred to
the Corporation at the terms of its establishment.
Administration
SNAHDA is administered by a Board of 13 members, of which 9 are
officials of the Government, 2 representatives of the Company's personnel
and 2 representatives of oil palm producers.   The President of the Board
is nominated by the Council of Ministers on the recommendation of the
Minister of Economy.   The Board meets at least four times a year or on
special request.   The General Manager is nominated by the President of the
Republic.
Accounting
The Council of Ministers, on the recommendation of the Minister of
Finance, nominates two auditors.   Within one month after the end of the
financial year (October 31), the annual accounts of SNAHDA have to be
submitted to the auditors, and within two months they have to be approved
by the Board and submitted to the Council of Ministers.    Owing to
difficulties and irregularities in the accounting procedures of SNAHDA, no
annual accounts are available.






ANNE 10
Page 2
Organization
An organization chart of SNAHDA is shown as Appendix A.   The
total staff consists of about 1,000 persons, all key positions being held
by Dahomeans.   The General Manager at present is Mr. Mabudu, who was
appointed in May 1967.
Evaluation
SUAJHDA has passed through considerable difficulties the last few
years, mainly due to deficient financial and accounting procedures.    A
large part of its books and documents have been impounded by the police.
The Government sought the assistance of the "Mission Francaise d'Aide et de
Cooperation" to find ways of correcting the situation, and consequently a
study was made by IDET - CEGOS in 1966-67, first of the problems connected
with accounting and later of the organization of SNAHDA in general.    This
resulted in proposals for a complete overhaul of SNAHDA's organization and
a new basis for accounting and financial controls.   At the request of the
Minister of Finance of Dahomey, FAC has agreed to send a team of experts to
SNAHDA for a three-year period to work out the reorganization.    The cost
of this operation, in vjhich IRHIO and management consultants will have to
participate, is estimated at between 15 and 20 million CFAF and will be
met by SNAHDA and FAC in equal parts.    SNAHDA has already taken some of
the measures proposed in the report.   The contract with the French
Technical ivianager, which ended on July 1967, has been renewed for two years.
A French advisor to the General Manager has been assigned to SNAHDA in iMay,
1968.   A French specialist for reorganization of accounting system and
auditing of SNAJ@Ii is expected to arrive in Dahomey in September 1968.
A Dahomean Director for Finance and Commerce has been appointed in August
1968.   The technical operations of SNAHDA, the operation of the palm oil
factories and the oil storage facilities are not too badly affected by the
organization and accounting problems.   However, data on processing costs
supplied by SIAHDA are either completely unrealistic because of poor
accounting or would indicate that the technical operations are very
inefficient.   Unless SNAHDA will be brought to a clearly acceptable state
of efficiency, the question, whether this organization will be able to
assume active responsibilities under the project in 1973, must remain open.
As an alternative, SONADER could operate processing facilities under
special license.
