MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMNDATION OF TE PEIDENT OF
TBE INERNATIONAL DEVELOPMET ASSOCITION TO
TB EXECtJlVE DJRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REIBIC OF ANGOLA
FOR A FIRST EDUCATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommeon oa proposed
developmt credi to the People's Republic of Angola for SDR 19.9 million, equivalent to US$27.1
milion on standard IDA teams with a matury of 40 years, to help fiance the rehabilitation,
revaliation and progressive expansion of the education system. No co-financing is anticipated under
this credit.
2.    Angol, with a populaton of about 10 mllion, growing at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, is
potentially one of the richest countries in Africa In terms of its endowment of natural resource (e.g,.
petroleum, Iron, manganese and diamonds). At the same time, its economy is one of the most
disrted In the continent. Since independence in 1975, the country has developed an economy higbly
dependen on petroleum. The oil sector represents about half of GDP. GNP per capita, estimated
at US$620 in 1990, is closely linked to oil prices. In 1990, oil export eamnings were about US$3
billion, equivalent to more than 90 percent of the counry's total export emings. On the other hand,
the non-oil sectors' peformance has been poor; it is estimated that their per capita growth has been
negative since the early 1980s. The performance of agriculture is a case in point: an important net
exporter of agdcultura products before independence, Angola has in recent years been increasingly
dependent on food imports and food aid to feed its urban population. The capacity utilization of
istig ma   ctg industries has been severely affected by the lack of inputs, spare parts and
mainteance services, as well as by a distorted policy environment.
3.    Angola's economic decline since independence Is largely explaited by three factors: (a) a 15-
year civil war, which has made much of the countryside too inset for agdcultura production and
transport required heavy mityexp         (contruting to chronically large fiscal deficits,
despite substantial retnues from oil), and destroyed part of the economic and social infrastructure;
(b) unusually severe human resource constraints, due to the massive exodus of Portuguese settlers at
independence; and (c) misguided economic policies that have created a highly distorted system, with
a formal urban economy Oargely public) managed by administrative controls, and a large parallel
economy.
4.    The social conditions prevailing in Angola are poor even by African standards. This is the
combined result of the civil war, inappropriate policies, rapid migration to the cities, and emigration
of skilled manpower. The child mortaity rate is 292 per thousand, almost twice the sub-Saharan
Africa average (157); life expectanq at birth is eimated at 44 years (compared to 51 years for sub-
Sabara Africa); less than 30 percent of the population has access to health services and safe -watr;
and despite the Governmeat's emphasis on education, the gross enrollment rate in the first level of
basic educadon s estdmated at only 52 percent. While women's access to basic educational
opportunities has expanded, the current level of literacy among women'is still low (33 percent).
Regional disparites in soci conditions are substanti  s a result, in particular, of war-induced
destuction. Poverty in rural areas is acute. In addition to the stagnation in economic activity, the
main factors contribung to ural poverty are the interrupdon of normal links to the cities, the drastic
decline of Inter-gional trade, a lack of incentive goods, and poor access to social serices.



-2-
5.    Of Angola's population of 10 million, 45 percent are under age 15. Amoni its labor force
of between three and four mllion, it is esdmated that less than 10 percent have completed the first
four years of basic education. The struce of the education system follows the Portuguese pattern
consisting of basic education (4-2-2 years), mid-level education (3-4 years) and higher education of
4-5 years. Enrollment in basic education is about 1.2 million, with 87 percent in the first four-year
cycle. Enrollment in the medium level, main source for primary schools teachers and for mid-and
high-level labor training, is about 17,000, of which 6,000 are in tacher streams, less than 5,000 in
general secondary and the rest in technical education, while about 6,300 are enrolled in hiA
education. The teaching conditions at all levels are not-conducive to quality and achievement, most
of teachers a-e.underqualifled and practically not supervised. Most of the schools are in a state of
disrepair and lack furniture and teahing mateials. The inadequate and inappropriate physical
conditions of the leaming/teaching process at all levels are compounded, at the basic education level,
by the common daily triple-shiftsystem cwsed by the scarcity of classrooms, with its negative impact
on teaching dme. The capacity for magemen of the edrcation system is weak at the central level
for the development of policy, investment programs, and opeational procedures; and at tme pro-incial
level for implementation and monitoring. In 1991, the share of education in the Government's
recurent and inestmen budgets was about 12.5 and 5.0 percent, respectively.
6.    1MM. The main issues in general education are: (a) inadequacy of the current education
structure, mainly its ability to achieve permanent literacy with four years of basic education; (b) low
quality of existing teaching/earnig conditions; (c) weak sector management capacity; (d) feeble
development of post-bsic education in light of fte need to strengthen human resources in a coutry
severely constrained in this area; and (e) the low level of financing. The issues of the pre-and in-
service traing of the labor force will e addressed tho  planned sector work and a fol-low up
project. = The rehabilitation and development oi the education sector in Angola constitute
a major challenge, particiarly during a period of much needed stabilization of the economy. The
first porty is to elimiate major Ieffiiencies, build up the capacity of the Ministry of Education
to manage the system and prtpare a comprehensive rehabilitation program for the sector. In 1990,
the Govenment decided to establish a new education structure, consistng essentally of the
itroducdon of a primary education cycle of six years, followed by lower and upper secondary levels
of three years each. In 1991 and in a major departure frm established policies, the Govenmuent
made legal provision for the opening up of private educatioL During credit negotiations, the
Govenment provied IDA with a draft policy statement on the education reform confirming Its
commitm   to the adjustment of the education system along the lines agreed with IDA during
appal, including application of the new stucture in all the new schools, independendy of their
financing source, and limitation of daily shifts to two in these schools.
ZPoect Obietives
7.    The project objectives are to help the Goverment start correcting the major inefficiencies
in the education sector and prepare a stategy for its overall rehabilitation, revitalization and
progessive expansion. The project would help Angola by (a) setting up a demonstration model for
education through improvement of the quality of iputs and physical conditions of teaching while
implementing the new education structure: (b) nhcing sector maagement capacity; (c) improving



-3-
the quality of training in economics and strengthening the  formation system of the university and
(d) preparing a ste  for the overa reiltation, revitaizaion and progressive expansion of the
education system and undertalng preparatory work for fure investments.
8.    The project would consist of the folowing components: (a) setting um of a demonstration
model bol        through improvement of the quality of inputs and adaptation of the education
structe  through (i) s ening of the National Institute for Educational Research and
Development NDE) to enable it to cary its fucin of producing relevant curicula, teating
matelals and examinations and evaluation systems; (i).provision of texdbooks to the demonstion
and.secondary schools; (ii) establishment of a prototpe Primary Teacher College; and (iv)
rehabiliation of seven and construction of six primary nd secondary schools; (b) steof
he Ministr of Education's manaFement capacit through () training of sector administrators; (n)
improvement of the cetral and provinci insdtiuons' capabiities for planning, budgeting, and for
human and matal resources management; (c) impmv   the teaching of economics andm
of the  miiversithrough () tainig of staff and provision of quality iputs to the faculty of
eonomics, and (i) rationalizing and strengthening the university management information system;
and (d) sttdies and   inof fture hnves§mn   to define the financial framework and pace for
the reform, rehabilitation and expansion of the education system, and to develop a related investment
program.
9.    The estmated tot project cost is about US$31.2 million, with a foreign exchange component
of US$ 25.3 milion (about 81 percent). Schelule A contains the project cost summary and finacing
plan and Schedule B the amount and methods of procurement and disbursemnts, as well as a
disbursement schedule. A tmetabe of key project processig vents and the status of IMA operations
n Angola are gi vn Schedule ind D respectively. A map showing the locations of the project
fities s attached. Staff Appraisal Report No. 10338-ANG, dated May 4, 1992 is being distributed
separately.
10.   The Office for Studies, Planning and Projects (GEPP) in the Mnistry of Education would be
responsible for overal imple on of the project and, specifically for procuremen, finance and
aunting, monitoring of civil works, and relations with I1DA. A Project Coordating Committee
(PCC), under the chima p of the Vice-Minister for General Educadon and composed of the
Director of the GMP, his Deputy, and the heads of the projec componens, would be responsible
for provi    guidance and monitoring project implemenn dthrough the review of annual work
programs and budgets and the sema progres and anna repor. The head of each component
would be responsible for aU substantive aspects, including the efficient use of acquired inputs, and
for timely I ,mp  onion of agreed annuial progm.
11.   Ihe project constitu  a fit step towards improvement of the efficency and effectivenesS
of the education system, which is a condition for sustainable development. Mhe project will
contribute to the adjusment and susnable growth of the education system by financing studies to
prepare a fancial framework to serve as a basis for progressive esion of the sector.

Lessons Lealmed frm Pmou IDAInovmt
12.   The proposed project is the first in tne educadon sector to be supported by the Bank group
in Angola. Hence, there are no direct lessons to draw from prior IDA experience in the sector.
However, during project preparation It appeared that the sector suffered from: (a) the lack of a
capacity for procuremnt and monitoring of civil works and equipment; and (b) shortages of
managerial and technical staff.   i assessment, and experience in similar counties led to the
strengthening of the GEPPs project implementation capacity (procurement, administration and
accoting,  ntong of works), whfle limiing its role to that of contract maeme  and
monitring for ci  works and supervision, tather than performing them direcdy, and to the
preparation of standard bidding docets.prior to credit effectiveness.
Ratgione for IDAinovmt
13.-- A critical constraint to Angola's development is the lack of trained manpower. Though
absorbing 12.5 percent of AngoLa's recurrent budget, the education sector is grossly inefficient. A
major change Is reqzlred, but the capacity to introduce and manage this change is almost non existent.
Since changes in the education sector take time to yield results, they have to be introduced as early
as possible. The proposed project would provide critical assistance at a critical tme to start
correctng the sector major inefficiencies through inaion of the rehabilitaion and revitalization
PMrocess of the education system, whffIe prepaing the conditions of an affrdable development  his
first project would deepen MDA's knowledge of sectoral issues and constraints thus enhancing the
focus of fuirther help to Angola; it would also pemit an assessment of the govemmenets commitment
to chane as well as of its absorpdve capacity, hence contributing to better design of strategy and
scope of investments.
.A8rment reahed
14.    lir         _   the government agreed to: (a) provide IDA with curricula for lower and
upper secondary schools and the primaty and teacher training sdcools; (b) establish a statute for the
primay teachers taning coleges and related primary application schools; (c) establish criteria for
the award of the long-tem fellowships including commiment to full-time teacwhing in the Faculty of
Economics for a period at least equient to that of training; (d) select an official to head the sector
Adm      ve  raing Center and submit to IDA the training program for the first year and
corresponding budget; (e) exchmge views annually with IDA on the investment and recurrent
expenditur budgets for the education sector for the coming fiscl year, and (t) undertake with MlA
a mid-term revwiew to assess progress in achieving the project development objectves.
15.   Prior to Board Presnaon, the Govemment provided IDA with Its policy statement otl
education refor.L  ond of credk eb&=s would be that IDA be provided with satsfactoy
evidence that: (a) INDE has been legaly reorganied, in accordance wih tems and conditions
agreed upon with DA; (b) MOE has taken the appropriate lega and administrtive meaumes to
review GE s functional resonsibilities to include a new Division of Construction and EquiPment
(DCE), and establish the Project Coordinat  Committee (PCC) with the functions, responsibilities
and sdtng agreed with  IDA; (c) the Minister of Education has confirmed the GEPP Director, as the
Project Director and te Head of DCE as his Deputy; and (d) the tenders commission has been legaly



-5 -
estblished. The Govem t would also submt to IDA tie standard bidding documens and draft
contracts to be used during project implemenatIon.
16.   The project Is not expected to have any significant enviomental Impact because of the small
size and urban sies of the constiucons involved.
b h~Pogam Obieczve Caeadi8
17.   Ihe project would benefit the low-income population groups through the locadon of some of
the new primary schools In poor areas of Luanda Another program objective category addressed
by the project is private sector development One of he studies financed under the project would
assess the potentil role and contribution of the privae sector in the education system and the
insdtutionl and fiancial arrangements to encourage Its participation.
18.   The main benefits of the project wouldInclude: O) establishing the conditions for Improving
the quaity of education; (u) strengtheing the management capaciy of the sector; (Ill) Improving the
quality of t2ainhg of economis; and Q1v) preparation of a sateg for the overallei
ritalizadon, and progresive expa     of the education system. Ihe project would provide the
ramework for the development of an Investnt program to meet the sector's needs and for the
coonation of the donors in its fiacing. The implementaion of the project would provide the
experenc requed to generalize the canges over th sysm   More Immediately, the quality
impvement undertake by the project would benefit about 24,000 students in primary and seondary
education and in the faculty of economics.
19.   The main risk is the weak managemnt capacity  thughout the education system, the scarcity
of qualified staff, and ineWperience with IA's Implementation and prourement pocedures. This
risk woud be minimlzed, to the eatent possible, though the detailed preparon of aU project
actities, the provision of specialist services and staff traig, and the use of sample bidding
docummenats.n
20.   1 am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreeme  of the
Association and recommend that the Executive Directrs approve the proposed credit
