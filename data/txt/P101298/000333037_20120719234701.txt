                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1. The proposed restructuring would make four changes related to (i) safeguards (with
   the triggering of OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement), (ii) new names for sub-
   national government entities based on recent Constitutional changes, (iii) a
   reallocation of loan proceeds to increase support provided under Component 1
   (Institutional Strengthening), and (iv) institutional support for the newly established
   Autonomy State Service. These changes are also reflected in the draft credit
   agreement and the addition of an involuntary resettlement framework.

2. OP/BP 4.12 was not triggered in 2007 because the project was not expected to cause
   acquisition of land or other assets and not require physical relocation of populations.
   Information available at the time of appraisal indicated that none of the road and/or
   bridge sub-projects required significant changes in width or alignment. During two
   supervision missions in April 2010 and July 2010, the Bank learned that minor land
   acquisition had occurred in one road subproject and one bridge subproject and that
   adequate solutions were employed which were consistent with OP/BP 4.12.
   However, these two cases had not been formally reported to the Bank. It was agreed
   that the Project should seek to activate OP/BP 4.12. In preparation for this, the
   Productive and Social Investment Fund (FPS) subsequently carried out a thorough
   review of 100 percent of the existing portfolio (225 subprojects), which detected
   7 cases of actual and 15 cases of likely affectation. A Resettlement Framework
   Policy, satisfactory to the Bank, was prepared and adopted by FPS on September
   2011. Reviews by the Bank team have since reduced the number of subprojects
   which activate OP/BP 4.12 to 20, of which, by March 2012, 6 subprojects
   implemented appropriate actions and 14 were executing adequate remediation plans.
   All cases of actual and likely affectation involve minor land acquisition and no actual
   physical displacement of people has taken place.

3. The changes to the Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia on January 25,
   2009 and the approval of the Autonomies and Decentralization Law on July 19, 2010
   changed the subnational governmental entities participating in the Project from
   Prefectures and Municipalities to Autonomous Departments, Autonomous
   Municipalities, Autonomous Regions and Indigenous Autonomies of Peasant Origin
   (AIOCs). The Autonomies and Decentralization Law also created the Autonomies
   State Service (SEA), a decentralized public entity with full legal, administrative and
   financial autonomy, under the Ministry of Autonomy to support the implementation of
   the autonomy process for each new level of subnational autonomous government. It
   is necessary to change the reference to Prefectures in the Project Development
   Objective and include all new levels of subnational governments. Additionally, three
   indicators need to reflect the same modification in legal names of the participating
                                            1
   subnational entities. Finally, institutional strengthening activities are proposed to
   assist the SEA to carry out its mandate.

4. To adjust Project activities to the new legal and institutional context and respond to
   the increased demand for productive investment subprojects, the proposed
   restructuring includes the reallocation of Project funds between disbursement
   categories.

B. PROJECT STATUS

5. As of December 31, 2011, the Project has implemented 75 percent of its original
   implementation plan and disbursed 63 percent of the IDA Credit. A significant
   amount of remaining resources has been committed, with 10 percent remaining. The
   Project has financed 692 subprojects (335 for Institutional Strengthening,
   225 Productive Investments and 132 Pre-investments) directly benefiting
   768,042 people and indirectly benefitting 1,964,775 more. An additional
   256 subprojects have been approved for financing.

6. The Project is rated Satisfactory both in progress towards achieving its Project
   Development Objective and in Implementation Progress.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7. Project’s Development Objectives. The original PDO was to “pilot the
   strengthening of institutional arrangements between the national, prefecture and
   municipal governments and civil society for sustainable management of subnational
   public investments in selected productive sectors with an emphasis on territorial
   development.? The proposed new PDO does not change in substance, but only in
   presentation. The change would remove the reference to “prefectures? (which no
   longer exist), and refer to “subnational governments? to reflect the four levels of
   autonomous subnational governments established in the 2009 Constitution, i.e.,
   Departments, Municipalities, Regions, and Indigenous Autonomies of Peasant Origin
   – AIOCs. The new PDO would read to “pilot the strengthening of institutional
   arrangements between the national and Eligible Subnational Governments and civil
   society for sustainable management of subnational public investments in selected
   productive sectors with an emphasis on territorial development.?

8. Results/indicators. One PDO and two results indicators are being adjusted to
   replace “prefectures? with “subnational governments?. Please see Annex 1 for
   complete language of proposed changes in the Results Framework.

9. Components. Component 1, Institutional Strengthening, is being modified to include
   all autonomous subnational governments (Departments, Municipalities, Regions,
   Indigenous Autonomies of Peasant Origin - AIOCs and Mancomunidades) in the
   Project area to be eligible for institutional strengthening activities. Additionally,
   activities to strengthen the newly created Ministry of Autonomy, specifically the
   Autonomy State Service (SEA), are being included for Project financing to support
                                           2
   the subnational     governments’     transition   to   fully   operational   autonomous
   governments.

10. New proposed activities under Component 1 are: i): Technical assistance to create
    and operate the National Council of Autonomies, which is a coordination and
    consultation body for the implementation of different levels of autonomy. This
    Council would consist of representatives of the departmental assemblies, Indigenous
    Assemblies, and governors, among others including the President of the Plurinational
    State of Bolivia and three ministers of Ministries of the Presidency, Planning and
    Autonomy. Support will be provided in decreasing percentages of funding;
    ii) Support for the preparation, consultation and validation of legal statutes of newly
    created autonomous Departments, Municipalities, Regions and AIOCs in accordance
    with the provisions of the new Autonomy Law; iii) Technical assistance to create and
    operate the SEA, a decentralized public entity of the Ministry of Autonomy, whose
    function is to provide all the technical inputs required for the design and
    implementation of autonomous subnational government procedures such as the
    implementation of the transfer of powers, the design of mechanisms for calculating
    the cost of assuming new responsibilities, the measurement of indicators of the socio-
    economic impact of the autonomy process. The SEA will work under the direction of
    a Board of Directors and will work on proposals derived from the National Autonomy
    and Decentralization Council. Support will be provided in decreasing percentages of
    funding; and iv) Support to the Ministry of Environment in the development of
    environmental regulations to be implemented as part of the autonomy process and to
    ensure the implementation of Bank safeguards in the newly created constituencies.

11. Component 2, Productive Investments, would be modified to allow all autonomous
    subnational governments to be eligible for implementing productive investments. All
    subnational governments would need to follow the existing operational rules as found
    in the project’s operational manual which governs the identification and
    implementation of subprojects.

12. Safeguards. The Environmental Assessment was disclosed in country on October
    10, 2007 and in Bank’s website on October 24, 2007. The Indigenous Peoples Plan
    was disclosed in country on September 14, 2007 and in Bank’s website on October
    24, 2007. Overall performance of triggered social and environmental safeguards has
    been satisfactory to date. Compliance with OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental
    Assessment, OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitats, OP/BP 4.36 Forests, OP 4.09 Pest
    Management, OP/BP 4.11 on Physical Cultural Resources, and OP/BP 4.10 on
    Indigenous Peoples has been confirmed during supervision missions. Where needed,
    training has been provided to strengthen capacity.

13. Out of the 225 investments/subprojects approved by FPS, 72 percent are for feeder
    road improvement and rehabilitation, pedestrian bridges, and vehicle bridges with the
    remaining 28 percent of subprojects in small and micro-irrigation systems. When the
    Project was designed, the Involuntary Resettlement Policy was not triggered. During
    project supervision in 2010, two subprojects were found to have had minor impacts
    related to OP/BP 4.12. As a precautionary measure, it was agreed to activate the
                                            3
   Involuntary Resettlement Policy, OP/BP 4.12 and prepare a Resettlement Policy
   Framework for the Project. In this spirit, it was agreed with the Productive and Social
   Investment Fund (FPS) that: i) 100 percent of the existing portfolio would be
   reviewed and assessed for any third party affectation to assess how many, if any,
   subprojects involved third party affectation. If there was affectation, appropriate
   measures were taken and if not prepare the appropriate remediation action plan were
   prepared; ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework would be prepared and adopted for the
   project satisfactory to the World Bank; and iii) any subprojects under preparation that
   had any affectation of third parties would comply with OP/BP 4.12 policy or not be
   financed.

14. The review of investment subprojects covered the whole portfolio and included site
    visits in 83 cases. A total of twenty-two subprojects were found to involve actual
    (seven cases) or likely (fifteen cases) minor acquisition of land, involving 0.3 to 5
    percent of individual landholdings—1.2 to 42 square meters of mostly agricultural
    land. The Involuntary Resettlement Framework was sent to the World Bank and
    received the No Objection on September 15, 2011 and published in country by the
    Government of Bolivia on November 30, 2011. Further reviews carried out by the
    Bank during supervision have since reduced the number of subprojects that activate
    OP/BP 4.12 to twenty. Of these, six have implemented appropriate measures and
    fourteen have adopted and are executing adequate remediation plans (in 6 cases, no
    works have been executed yet). No cases of displacement or physical relocation have
    occurred throughout the period of implementation. Neither were any resources and/or
    livelihoods of any household or communities affected. There were only minor
    impacts and remediation plans have been implemented for all such cases.

15. In relation to OP 4.10 on indigenous peoples, given that most of the targeted
    population was indigenous, the whole project was designed as an Indigenous People
    Plan. The Project has fully implemented the key processes required by OP 4.10
    including social-cultural assessment and free prior and informed consultation as
    inputs to its design. During project implementation processes have been in place to
    ensure Indigenous peoples participation in M&E and mechanisms to ensure broad
    community support. Also, no negative impacts, conflicts or complaints have been
    presented by the implementation of the subprojects.

16. Project Costs and Financing Plan. In the design of the Project, the requirement for
    subnational governments co-financing for both institutional strengthening and
    productive investments/subprojects was established as 60 percent. However, very
    few subnational governments could meet the co-financing target so it was agreed in
    July 2009 to change the co-financing to 25 percent to be in line with the national
    standard for subnational government co-financing. As a result, this has meant an
    overall decrease of US$30.2 million of projected co-financing for
    investments/subprojects. While this means fewer investments will be executed
    during the life of the Project, this will not affect achievement of the PDO. There is no
    specific number of investments included in either the Project Appraisal Document or
    Credit Agreement in order to achieve the PDO.
