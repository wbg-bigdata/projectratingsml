Block 1: Project Description
1. Project Development Objectives (see Annex 1 for key performnance indicators):
The project has three key objectives:
1. To deliver services to the poor and marginalized in Palestinian society, using NGOs as the delivery mechanism;
2. To improve the institutional capacities of NGOs receiving grants under the project; and
3. To support efforts by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestinian NGO sector to strengthen their working
relationship, including support for the development of a positive legal framework for the sector.
2. Project Components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
Under the project, Palestinian NGOs would be invited to submit proposals for grant funding. The project would be
managed by an NGO Project Management Organization (PMO), which would publicize the project, solicit proposals,
determnine grant awards, monitor sub-project implementation and provide technical assistance to NGOs in receipt of
grants.

number of "block grants" are expected to be
awarded to experienced, professional NGOs
for on-granting to smaller or newer
organizations.

3. Benefits and Target Population:
Benefits: Services to the poor and marginalized throughout the West Bank and Gaza would be strengthened and
expanded under the project. Potential grant recipients would be required to demonstrate community support for all sub-
projects, including in most cases community financial support; this would help ensure that sub-projects respond to
community priorities and enhance sub-project sustainability. Certain NGOs providing vital services, but suffering from
severe financial difficulties, would be returned to a more viable financial position under the project; in this way
organizations offering value but currently unable to function effectively would be sustained. Development of the NGO
sector in WBG would be enhanced by the introduction of an open, non-partisan, competitive grant award process which
would help raise NGO professional standards (principally through the grant preparation/implementation cycle that would
be applied to all grant recipients, and through the close attention that would be given under the project to financial
management and accountability). Hands-on assistance provided to grant recipients should also help them improve their
ability to attract other sources of funds. In addition, specific capacity-building grants would be used to equip NGOs with
improved managerial and community interaction skills. Relations between the PA and NGOs would be enhanced through
the preparation of the project's Operational Manual (see para. 4 below), through close sectoral consultations in the course
of the grant cycle, and by the provision of assistance to all parties in the drafting of new NGO legislation. Improved PA-
NGO cooperation should reduce duplication and improve the quality of services provided by both parties.
Target population: The poor and marginalized in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, estimated at about one-third of the
Palestinian population (see para. 17 below).
4. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
Implementation Period: July 1997- July 2003
Executing agency: For the first three years at a minimum, the project would be managed by a Project Management
Organization (PMO), an NGO consortium selected by open international competition on the basis of experience and
proven competence in a) managing NGO umbrella grant programs; b) field work in the West Bank and Gaza; c)
providing support for NGO institutional development work; and d) delivering community-based poverty alleviation
services. The selection of the PMO has been managed by the Bank.
At an early point in its assignment the PMO would draft an Operational Manual, in close consultation with the PA and
the NGO community. The Operational Manual would be completed within 3 months of project effectiveness. This
manual, which would be translated into Arabic and would be freely available to the public, would describe the purposes
of the project and the procedures that will be followed in selecting grantees and administering grants. No NGO grants
would be made until the Operational Manual has been finalized. It is expected that the PMO would periodically revise
and improve the Operational Manual to incorporate the lessons of experience.
The PMO would be directly responsible for overall project management and coordination. This would involve
maintaining relations with the various agencies of the PA and with NGOs and NGO networks, as well as managing the
project's grant cycle (announcing and advertising each round of grants; selecting grant recipients according to strict and
transparent competitive procedures outlined in the Operational Manual; signing grant contracts with the recipients;
disbursing grants; and supervising the use of grants by recipient NGOs, to include the provision of continuous hands-on
training and technical assistance).
It should be emphasized that the selection of grant recipients would be carried out independently by the PMO, so as to
ensure non-partisan objectivity in the award process.
The PMO would open Special Accounts in the field, which would be replenished by the Bank in the normal manner.
The PMO would, in turn, pass on funds to accounts in the name of the NGO grant recipients.

Country: West Bank and Gaza                                               Project Title: The Palestinian NGO Project
Beneficiary NGOs: NGO participation in the project would be governed by the following basic principles:
(i) Grant recipients must be non-profit, non-governmental organizations. Applicants for grants will need to operate in
compliance with relevant laws;
(ii) Grant recipients must be able to demonstrate, by reference to existing financial records. that they can manage money
in a transparent and efficient manner;
(iii) Grant recipients must agree to the operating principles of the project. These include the pursuit of non-political
humanitarian and developmental objectives, the acceptance of technical assistance from the PMO during the life of
the grant, and adherence to project procurement and accounting procedures;
(iv) Because grants are intended to support social and economic development programs, they will not be awarded for
projects which have as a principal objective the promotion of any particular political or religious viewpoint.
Project coordination: In order to ensure that NGO sub-projects proposed for funding do not duplicate existing activities
and are responsive to community needs, a broad consultative process would be established.
(i) Prior to each bi-annual grant "round", the PMO would lead a series of public meetings, to be convened by the Local
Aid Coordination Committee (LACC) and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) in
different locations in Gaza and the West Bank. These meetings would be advertised in the press, and would be open
to anyone who cares to attend (including NGOs, municipal officials, ministry and agency representatives). The
PMO would use these meetings to hear from participants about local needs, and to help obtain guidance on areas
and sectors that should be given priority in the forthcoming grant round. Participants would also be briefed on grant
application procedures. The PMO would also consult with the various NGO networks (see below) on priorities for
the forthcoming grant round. The adduced priorities would then be discussed in a meeting convened by MOPIC
prior to the grant selection process.
(ii) Once the PMO has selected the grant recipients, and before announcing the awards in public, MOPIC would be
asked to convene a meeting, or meetings, at which the subject ministry or agency (e.g. the Ministry of Health in the
case of a primary health care sub-project) would be briefed by the PMO on the proposed grant, and asked to confirm
that the project does not duplicate any ongoing ministry projects nor promote technologies or price structures which
are at major variance with official policy. The Bank's no objection would be sought prior to the announcement of
the awards; the interest of the Bank would be to ensure that due process and impartiality had been observed in the
selection process.
Accounting. financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The promotion of sound standards of financial management
would be a major priority under the project. All NGOs applying for grants should be prepared to have their financial
books inspected by the PMO in the course of appraisal. A threshold will be set by the PMO above which grant recipients
would need to provide the PMO with annual professionally-audited statements showing how project funds have been
handled. These grant recipient audits would be provided for from the proceeds of each grant. If an audit were overdue,
grant disbursements would be suspended. Wasteful or dishonest use of grant money would normally lead to the
cancellation of a grant, a condition that would be specified in the grant contracts to be signed between the PMO and the
grantees.

In the interests of transparency, the PMO would report quarterly to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on the status of
special accounts and on all transactions conducted through them; the financial books of the PMO would also be open to
the MOF at all times. The PMO would be required to provide the Bank with quarterly financial and narrative reports,
and would be subject to annual external audit by an international auditor acceptable to the Bank--the summary results of
which would be made available to the PA and the public. The external auditor would also conduct a systems check of the
PMO after 3 months of project implementation, and would advise the PMO of any necessary procedural adjustments.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: The PMO would be responsible for monitoring NGO grant recipients and
providing details of project progress to the Bank in quarterly reports. This information would also be made available to
NGOs. the PA and donors. Sub-grant recipients would be required to produce progress reports and project completion
reports.
In addition to the financial audit (see above) the Bank would require an independent management audit of the PMO each
year. The annual tranched payments to the PMO for project management costs would be conditioned upon satisfactory
action by the PMO to address any issues raised by these management audits.
The Bank would also require a project impact evaluation after four years of project implementation. This evaluation
would focus on the achievement of the project's three key objectives--and in particular, on the impact of the grant
program on the welfare of beneficiaries. The lessons learned would be used to improve project effectiveness.

5. CAS Objective(s) Supported by the Project:
The objectives of the project are consistent with the Bank Group strategy outlined in  There are no CAS requirements as

inequalities (by modernizing education and health systems and enhancing official    paper.
and non-governmental poverty alleviation programs); and (iii) developing good
governance (by promoting sound and transparent fiscal management, helping create
a lean civil service, supporting PA partnerships with NGOs, local government and
the private sector, and encouraging the impartial administration of economic laws,
regulations and procurement). The Palestinian NGO Project would actively support
the second and third of these objectives.
6. Main Sector Issues and Strategy of the Palestinian Authority:
In 1995, the Bank estimated that there were over 1,200 Palestinian and 200 international service-oriented NGOs active in
the West Bank and Gaza, collectively providing about 60% by value of all primary health care services and up to one-half
of secondary and tertiary health care--as well as all disability and preschool programs and most agricultural services, low-
cost housing programs and micro-enterprise credit. Since 1990, however, funding for NGO activities has declined steeply
(first as a result of the Gulf War and the loss of certain sources of support, and latterly with the creation of the PA and a
consequent shift in donor funding patterns). Bank estimates suggest that in the early 1990s NGOs received somewhere
between $140-$220 million each year from outside sources. By 1994, the first full year of the Oslo process, external

support contracted to perhaps $90 million, and fell further to about $60 million in 1995 and 1996--a loss in external
revenue of between a half and three-quarters during a six-year period. Recent MOPIC data shows that official donor
commitments to the NGO sector for 1997 amount to only some $30 million so far, with disbursements of $3.6 million.
Nor has the stagnation of the Palestinian economy since the beginning of the peace process allowed this shortfall to be
offset to any meaningful extent by an increase in local resources. Some contraction of NGO activity was inevitable as the
PA found its feet, and some was desirable in view of the rapid and largely unmonitored growth of NGO activities during
the intifada; nonetheless, a wealth of examples show that the contraction has been too sharp, and has led to real hardship
among the poor and disadvantaged in the sectors where NGOs are most active--and the PA is correspondingly not.
Between late 1993 and late 1996, as unemployment has risen from about 18% to about 34% and real per capita incomes
have fallen by about 19% (IMF data, February 1997), many hospital and outpatient services have been cut, dozens of pre-
schools have closed, several disability programs have been discontinued and experienced agricultural extension workers
have been laid off. At the same time, the demand for services that NGOs provide is increasing, with the population of the
West Bank and Gaza growing at over 6% per annum. The PA has neither the fiscal nor the organizational capacity to
meet all of these needs; nor does it wish to supplant NGOs from areas of their comparative advantage.
NGOs play another crucial role in the emergence of post-Oslo Palestinian society, through their efforts to help establish
good governance and reinforce the concept of economic pluralism. The PA's Preliminary Statement on Palestinian
Development Strategy of December 1995 stressed the importance of a pluralistic institutional climate, in which the public
sector remains "lean and competent" and works in harmony with private business and NGOs.
With fundinig to NGOs through traditional channels in decline, a new source of funds is needed. The state of the
Palestiniian economy limits the extent to which domestic resources can take on the burden at this stage. A multilateral
window. on the other hand, has the potential to tap bilateral finance from countries that lack reliable delivery mechanisms
in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as international corporate and private funds that would otherwise be unavailable to the
Palestinian people.
The PA is still developing its relations with NGOs, and debate continues on the extent of appropriate regulation of the
sector. In October 1995, a restrictive draft NGO framework law was submitted to Cabinet but was withdrawn for further
review; the draft has subsequently been the subject of public debate between the PA and NGOs, with many NGOs
pressing for a law modeled on the liberal provisions that have been enacted in a number of emerging democracies (such as
South Africa, Estonia and Bulgaria)--while admitting the need for greater accountability and for a clarification of the
ambiguities surrounding NGO tax liability.
The oldest formal association of Palestinian NGOs, the West Bank-based Union of Charitable Societies, had almost 400
members by late 1993. In 1994, the Palestinian NGO Network was formed (currently 80 members). Late 1996/early
1997 saw the creation of three other associations--the Board Union of Palestinian NGOs (which claims some 210
members), the General Union of Palestinian NGOs (claiming 68 members) and the Palestinian National Institute for
NGOs (a recent inaugural conference of which was attended by about 250 organizations). Relations between the different
associations are in some cases uneasy, and to some extent competitive (as regards the search for funding), and the extent
to which each network is supportive of a liberal institutional climate for NGO activity varies.
The Palestinian NGO Project has the support and endorsement of the PA, achieved through considerable discussion over
many months. The project was included in the Palestinian Public Investment Program 1997, presented to donors for
funding at the Paris Consultative Group Meeting in November 1996, and a project design was subsequently agreed in
detail by a Preparation Committee consisting of representatives from two Palestinian NGO associations (the Union of
Charitable Societies and the Palestinian NGO Network) and from the PA, MOPIC and the Palestinian Economic Council
for Development and Reconstruction (PECDAR). Subsequently, however, questions were raised about the degree to
which the project should be independently managed--a debate only concluded with a letter from Chairman Arafat to the
Bank, dated March 31, 1997, which confirmed PA support for the principles of the project, as explained in this PAD.

7. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
The main constraints to NGO activity at present are (a) reduced funding, resulting in reduced services (in particular to the
poor), (b) traditions of rivalry in the NGO sector and inadequate coordination between NGOs and PA technical ministries,
resulting in inefficiencies in resource use and duplication; (c) inadequate M&E systems and insufficient accountability
for funds received by NGOs; and (d) an unclear legal and regulatory environment governing the activities of NGOs.
The proposed project would address the first constraint by making funds available to NGOs to maintain and expand
existing high-quality services, and by financing new development activities. The sharing of information between NGOs
would be assisted by publicizing projects funded and their progress. Poor coordination between NGOs and with the PA
would be aided by the consultative processes described in para. 4 above. Monitoring, evaluation and accountability issues
would be addressed by the need for NGOs to submit to a competitive grant award process, to implement sub-projects
according to standard, transparent rules, and to accept regular audit--as well as through capacity-building training by
specialized institutions and individuals. Finally, advice intended to create a positive legal and regulatory environment
would be provided to the PA and to NGOs.
8. Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection:
Alternative 1: The project would be managed by a PA ministry/agency, by local NGO associations, or by a combination
of the foregoing--rather than by an independent PMO.
Reasons for Rejection: Bank experience under the Holst Fund argued for a mechanism that would channel funding for
NGOs through an independent NGO mechanism. The substantially factionalized nature of the NGO community counseled
against vesting decision-making with any particular NGO network or combination of networks, however. Furthermore,
the importance of funding NGOs registered in Jerusalem, which provide important social and economic services and have
been neglected by financiers in recent years, required that a visibly non-political decision-making structure be adopted.
Alternative 2: Include the PA and NGOs in a committee which would make policy decisions for the project, but not grant
awards.
Reasons for Rejection: This was the option preferred by the Bank and by the Preparation Committee (see para. 6 above).
Originally it was agreed that a project "Governance Committee" would be formed, consisting of representatives of the PA
and the various NGO networks. This committee was to act as the focal point for PA-NGO coordination, and to
recommend sector and area guidelines for each grant round. The Governance Committee would also have been asked to
help the Bank ensure that the PMO discharged its duties in accordance with its terms of reference (thereby broadening the
basis of understanding and support for the grant award process). As described above, however, the recent formation of
three new NGO associations has led to a degree of internal dissension within the sector; this led the Bank and the
Preparation Committee to conclude that it would not be prudent to create a Governance Committee at this stage, though
the option has not been permanently foreclosed.
9. Major Related Projects Financed by the Bank and/or Other Development Agencies: (completed, ongoing and
planned).
Maior Related Bank Operations:
Community Development Proiect: US$ I Om. from the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank, approved by the Board on
March II, 1997. CDP will provide funding and technical assistance to municipalities and villages for small-scale
infrastructure sub-projects, selected on a competitive basis according to criteria described in an Operational Manual. It
will be managed by PECDAR, and will aim to relieve chronic unemployment as well as enhance the infrastructure stock
in poorer communities.

provides small grants for civic development and for the promotion of democratic discourse.
10. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design:
The Bank's operational experience in WBG is largely confined to the public sector (central and municipal government).
This experience shows that the PA still lacks capacity to deliver services. It is also clear that the NGO sector has a history
of effective service provision, but needs help if it is to adjust to new financial and institutional realities. The Bank is
generally seen as a trustworthy development partner by NGOs and by the PA, a factor that should permit the Bank (and
the PMO, which the Bank is selecting and would employ) to play a constructive intermediation role as Palestinian society
evolves and as the relative potential of different actors becomes clearer.
An important general lesson from Bank operational experience in WBG is the need for continuous in-the-field supervision
presence, particularly in the start-up phase of an operation that is either new in concept, or in which the relationship
between the implementing agencies and the Bank is new. Both of these factors pertain, and the Bank would station an
expert in the Resident Mission to provide full-time supervision support to the PMO.
Another lesson of experience relates to the need to protect the NGO grant award process from politicization. This issue
underlies the decision to vest grant decision-making in an independent PMO.
Bank Social Fund experience highlights the importance of funding NGO preinvestment activities in order to promote local
participation and community mobilization efforts, and the need for careful targeting to ensure projects are responsive to
the priorities of the very poorest. The project has been designed to incorporate both of these important factors.
Preinvestment activities would be financed under the NGO grant program while adequate targeting to the needs of the
poorest will be required of grant recipients
11. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership:
There is no borrower; the project would be financed by a grant.
Palestinian Authority commitment can be gauged from the above-mentioned letter from Chairman Arafat to
Mr. Wolfensohn, which states that the PA appreciates the deep contribution that NGOs make to Palestinian society and
welcomes the NGO Project and its proposed mechanisms for coordination with the PA. In addition, the Minister of
Planning and International Cooperation, as the main PA counterpart for this project, has provided the PA's no objection to
the Trust Fund Grant Agreement as successfully negotiated with the Welfare Association.
NGO commitment to the project can be measured by the active involvement of the two most firmly-established NGO
associations, the Union of Charitable Societies and the Palestinian NGO Network, in the work of the Preparation
Committee (see para. 6 above). The three new NGO associations have been consulted about the project, and all have
expressed their support for the concept and the eagerness of their members to participate as recipients of project grants.
The Welfare Association has offered to donate $300,000 to the project from its own resources, and these funds are
evidence of the Trust Fund Grant Recipient's commitment (it should be noted that this pledge was not taken into account
during the bidding process).
12. Value Added by Bank Support:
The Bank has demonstrated the capacity to manage cofinanced projects in WBG, and to act as a neutral broker between
different interest groups. In addition to these necessary skills, the Bank has in recent years accumulated wide
international experience of partnership arrangements with NGOs (principally in the context of its social fund programs),
and this collective experience has been brought to bear in the design of the project (which has involved peer inputs from
NGO experts throughout the institution and from the international NGO community, in particular from PACT, Inc, a US

NGO which assisted with the early design phases of the project). Given these factors, it is anticipated that additional
official, corporate and private donors will consider augmenting the funding of the project once there is an appreciable
track record of achievement on the ground.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in the project file. See Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment:   g  Cost-Benefit Analysis:  - Cost-Effectiveness   z  Other
(See Annex 4)             ERR=  %;                    Analysis:
NPV=US$  million
Other:
Sub-projects would be selected on the basis of proposals from NGOs, and it is therefore premature to project the
composition of the portfolio. Grants would be awarded on the basis of their beneficial social and economic impact on the
poor, according to criteria to be developed in the Operational Manual.
Fiscal impact:
The project would have no appreciable impact on public finances, since no PA financial contribution is required. The
continuation and expansion of NGO services under the project should marginally reduce required PA outlays on
comparable programs.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5):
The proposed TFGWB grant of US$10 million would cover almost 60% of total estimated project costs. Approximately
one-quarter of the Bank contribution (US$2.8 m.) would be applied against goods, minor civil works, studies and training-
-with the balance (US$7.2 m.) applied to personnel costs.
Cofinanciers--the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Government of Italy--would provide grants of US$2.5 million
and US$2 million respectively. In each case, a similar division of contributions between goods, etc., and personnel costs
can be anticipated. The pledge of US$0.3 million from the Welfare Association has been mentioned above (see para. 1 1).
A further US$1.5 million would be required to complete the project's financing plan, but this would not be needed until
the fourth year. It would be raised during project implementation from donors and/or private contributions.
Communities and/or grant recipient NGOs will be expected to contribute just over US$0.7 million to the project. This sum
is equivalent to a VAT rate of 15% levied on the total expected non-personnel costs of the project (US$4.9 million);
donors cannot be expected to provide against it. Meeting this requirement--approximately 5% of the value of the proposed
grant program under the project--is not expected to be onerous, on the basis of what is known of current levels of
community contribution to projects and to NGOs in WBG. The explicit need to raise such contributions is also consistent
with the project's quest for sustainability. Community/NGO contribution requirements will be worked out in detail by the
PMO and will be specified in the Operational Manual.
15. Technical Assessment:
There is ample evidence of the capacity of Palestinian NGOs to deliver services of the type to be financed under the
proposed project, though, as indicated above, there is scope for improvement in cost control and in acquaintance with
modem management and delivery mechanisms.
As an integral part of the sub-project appraisal process, details of which would be spelt out in the Operational Manual,
the PMO would assess the technical quality of proposals and of the NGOs which would implement them. Where required,
TA would be provided to grant-recipient NGOs in the course of sub-project implementation.

Country: West Bank and Gaza                                              Project Title: The Palestinian NGO Project
The selection process for the PMO required that bidders demonstrate sound track records in key relevant technical skill
areas, including the financial and programmatic management of NGO umbrella sub-grant programs, the provision of
capacity-building services to nascent NGOs and dexterity in managing participatory community-based project work
oriented to the poor and disadvantaged. The project would also provide funding for specialized technical assistance to the
PMO as and when required.
16. Institutional Assessment:
a) Executing agencies: the assessment of the capacity of participating NGOs to implement sub-projects will be appraised
on a case-by-case basis by the PMO in accordance with the agreed guidelines to be set out in the Operational Manual.
b) Project management: the organization chosen as the potential PMO was selected on the basis of a rigorous and
competitive two-stage bidding process: (i) an internationally-advertised call for expressions of interest, under which
applicants were assessed by Bank staff and external reviewers against four mandatory criteria (see para. 4 above), on
the basis of which a short-list of five NGOs/NGO consortia was drawn up; and (ii) a formal competitive bid by the
five shortlisted parties, concentrating on the bidder's experience, anticipated approach to project management, staffing
plan and financial proposal. These bids were assessed by a panel of internal and external reviewers.
17. Social Assessment:
Levels of absolute poverty in WBG have risen since the beginning of the peace process. In 1993, the Bank estimated that
some 20% of the Palestinian population of WBG lived below a poverty line of US$2 per capita per day. By late 1996 this
figure had risen to perhaps a third, and to some 40% in Gaza. The need for new instruments to address rising levels of
impoverishment is not in doubt.
The PMO would be charged with specifying (and describing in the Operational Manual) a process that ensures adequate
involvement by potential beneficiaries in the identification, design and implementation of sub-projects--including, where
justified, financial involvement or participation in kind. The fact that the project would not be able to cover VAT
payments means that beneficiary groups contribute, as a minimum, an estimated US$0.7 million of the US$13.1 million
grant program (i.e. approximately 5% of the total costs).
Social fund experience demonstrates the importance of providing sufficient resources to ensure that the most needy can be
reached. The project would emphasize, and require NGO grant recipients to demonstrate, careful targeting and substantial
community involvement.
18. Environmental Assessment:         Environmental Category  [A  EB  EC
The sub-projects would not involve extensive land acquisition, nor would they result in involuntary resettlement or affect
any known historical or archaeological sites. All sub-projects would be subject to environmental screening by the PMO
in conformity with guidelines that will be established in the project's Operational Manual. Environmental mitigation
and monitoring measures would be included in sub-project design where necessary. Since no negative impacts are
anticipated, the project has been assessed as a Category "C".

20. Sustainability:
Community involvement and support for projects would be a requirement for all NGOs receiving funding.
Additionally, the PMO would encourage contributions towards project costs by the community and/or the grant-
recipient NGO. NGOs would be required to address issues of sustainability in their proposals, and would be asked to
propose how they would promote recipient/community self-help.
Overall project sustainability will be explicitly addressed in a Mid-Term Review that the Bank and project donors would
require after two and a half years of project operation. This Review would take stock of progress and would explore
options for the further evolution of the project. The Review would address the future role of the PMO and the potential for
the formation of a permanent mechanism for PA and NGO coordination and input into the project. One possible scenario
would be the formation then (or earlier) of a committee similar in scope and function to the proposed Governance
Committee (see para. 8 above). Committee responsibilities might be increased with time, such that it evolves into a
full Executive Board with independent authority to determine and to supervise NGO grant awards. At the same time the
future financial needs of the NGO community would be assessed, and different ways of meeting them would be
explored. In particular, the Review would look into the feasibility of establishing an endowed foundation for
Palestinian NGOs in the latter stages of the project.

such risk.

the private sector.

resulted in careful appraisal of the

the project as and when required.

build trust, risks remain. The Bank
would need to pay close attention in
supervision.
22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Funding of NGOs in Jerusalem. Due to ongoing bilateral disputes, the project's activities in Jerusalem could be
misinterpreted by one party or another as a political statement by the World Bank on the status of the city--which would be
incorrect. The Bank's sole objective, which has been carefully discussed with the PA, the Government of Israel and a
wide range of NGOs, is to assist Palestinian NGO activities in Jerusalem designed to help the poor and socially
disadvantaged, irrespective of bilateral political considerations. To this end, the Bank's purposes have been explained in
local press interviews and in the Public Discussion Paper, available for many months in English and Arabic to all who
have requested it. In recognition of the sensitivities involved, the Bank has also established special arrangements for the
administration of project grants in Jerusalem, to consist of a distinct local consultation process and separate administrative
arrangements between the PMO and the Bank.
Pressure on the PMO to award grants on a partisan basis rather than according to merit. This possibility exists, but has
been provided for by giving to an independent PMO the task of making awards (within the context of a consultative
process involving NGOs and the PA, and subject to the Bank's no objection).
Block 4: Main Grant Conditions
23. Conditions of Signing:
Prior to signing, the PMO would: (a) prepare a Business Plan covering the first three years of project operation, for
approval by the Bank; (b) furnish to the Bank a signed final copy of the Consortium Agreement, and commitment letters
from the British Council and the Charities Aid Foundation.

24. Conditions of Effectiveness:
The PMO would need to sign the Trust Fund Grant Agreement in order for the project to become effective.
25. Other:
The PMO has agreed to manage the project under the supervisory direction of the Bank, in accordance with Bank norms
for procurement, disbursement, auditing and Special Account management. The project would also be implemented on the
basis of a staffing plan, a work plan and a PMO budget agreed with the Bank at negotiations and detailed in the Business
Plan. The PMO has also agreed to accept TA on the recommendation of the Bank (this would be financed under the
project).
Block 5: Compliance with Bank Policies
The proposed credit would come from the Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank (TFGWB). The Resolution
establishing the TFGWB (No. 93-11 and IDA 93-7 as amended by Resolution No. 95-6 and IDA 95-3, and Resolution No.
96-11 and IDA 96-7) permits IDA, as Administrator of the TFGWB, (a) to enter into agreements with appropriate private
entities in Gaza and the West Bank; and (b) provide funding on terms approved by the Executive Directors on a case-by-
case basis. Therefore the provision of a Trust Fund grant to the PNIO is in conformity with the Resolution establishing the
TFGWB.

THE WEST BANK AND GAZA
THE PALESTINIAN NGO PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - USS 11.8 million (total cost of component)
NGO Development and Hardship Grants
Approximately US$11.8 million of the initial contribution would be earmarked for NGO
development grants (US$1Om) and for NGO hardship grants (US$1.8m) for the benefit of the
poor and marginalized in the West Bank and Gaza. Grants would be made for varying periods of
time up to three years, and could range in size from as little as US$5,000 to as much as US$1
million. The US$11.8 million is expected to be awarded in 5 rounds of US$2-3 million over the
1997-9 period, and the numbers of individual grants could range between 50 and 150, depending
on the grant program which the PMO would establish.
NGO Development Grants would form the bulk of the project, and would be of two
types: Direct Implementation Grants to NGOs proposing programs accepted by the PMO for
financing, and Block Grants, which would be provided to the more capable NGOs to on-grant to
smaller NGOs (thus lessening the administrative burden on the PMO and encouraging the
maturation of the local NGO sector's capacity to cater to its own technical assistance needs).
NGO Hardship Grants would be made to key development NGOs that face significant
financial difficulties as a result of the loss of previous sources of funding. These grants would be
given as part of an agreed financial recovery program which aims to return the NGO in question
to a path of greater financial sustainability. Co-financing of the recovery program from other
sources would often be necessary if viable packages are to be put together.
Under both categories, the project would provide funding for preinvestment activities,
particularly for initiatives that involve strong local participation and community mobilization.
Given the diversity of skills and abilities that exist within the Palestinian NGO sector,
joint programming between NGOs (whereby the larger or the more competent NGOs would
associate with smaller or less experienced ones) would also be encouraged. Joint programming
could enhance the exchange of skills, and allow the project to reach smaller, less well-served
communities. It would also promote cooperation and openness between NGOs, and would help
the more traditional NGOs to develop new approaches.



Annex 2

Project Component 2 - US$1.5 million (total cost of component)
Capacity Building Grants
Approximately US$1.5 million would be set aside for discrete capacity-building and
research activities intended to develop the competencies of NGOs.
Capacity-building Grants. There is a need to provide assistance to NGOs, either in
groups or individually, in such skills as financial and organizational management, strategic and
project planning, and fund-raising. Considerable capacity to develop and provide capacity-
building activities exists in universities and among Palestinian and international NGOs working
the West Bank and Gaza, as well as in local private companies and among locally-based experts.
Priority would be given to NGOs in receipt of Development or Hardship Grants. Capacity-
building would go beyond the provision of training programs to include innovative approaches
such as mentoring and the sharing of experiences between NGOs. Bids for Capacity-building
Grants would be solicited competitively alongside the Hardship and Development Grants.
Approximately US$ 1.0 million would be set aside for NGO capacity-building activities.
Research Grants. The project would support research which provides better information
on the sector and/or benefits the NGO community's development and its relations with the PA.
Once again, specific areas to be financed would be determined through the consultative process
established by the PMO, and competitive bids would once again be solicited. Approximately
US$0.3 million would be set aside for research studies.
Technical Assistance to the PMO. The project would provide support to the PMO for the
development and improvement of project management procedures and for strategic planning and
sectoral analysis. Approximately US$0.2 million would be set aside for the TA to the PMO.
Project Component 3 - US$ 0.2 million (total cost of component)
Support for Cooperation and Coordination between NGOs and the PA
The project would serve as a vehicle to help NGOs and the PA improve their working
relationship, which is still unsettled. The consultative processes which the project would use
(described under Component 4 below) should contribute to this normalization.
A sum of US$0.2 million would be set aside under the project for work on legal issues.
A key aspect of the relationship between NGOs and the PA is the legislative framework
governing the NGO operations. At present there is no satisfactory legal basis for NGO
operations in the West Bank and Gaza; existing law is based on Jordanian statutes in the West
Bank and Ottoman/Mandate structures in Gaza, none of which are particularly conducive to the
operations of NGOs as vital economic partners in a modem economy. These old laws have in
turn been supplemented by a variety of ad hoc orders, some emanating from the period of
occupation, and others--such as multiple registration requests by different PA ministries--in the
post-Oslo years. NGOs are understandably confused by contradictory and sometimes arbitrary
official requirements, while the PA is frustrated by the lack of coherence in such areas as NGO
tax liability and the obligation to disclose sources of financial support. It is important that an
adequate NGO Law be developed soon. The World Bank was asked by the PA, in October 1995,
I



Annex 2
Page 3 of 4
to provide advice on the NGO Law, and has used the services of the International Center for Not-
for-Profit Law (ICNL) for these purposes. Most recently, in November 1996, ICNL provided
support to a workshop financed by the World Bank in which PA and NGO representatives
discussed NGO legal issues. Under the project the World Bank would continue to work with the
PA and NGOs to facilitate the drafting of a law which would eventually be sent to the Palestinian
Council for ratification.
Project Component 4 - US$3.5 million (total cost of component)
Project Management, Technical Assistance and Evaluation
Approximately US$3.5 million would be set aside for project management and technical
assistance costs for the PMO over the life of the project, and to cover the cost of auditing and
evaluating the PMO and assessing the impact of the project in meeting its objectives.
Day-to-day management of the project would be carried out by an internationally and
competitively recruited NGO/NGO consortium (PMO). The PMO would be responsible for
announcing and advertising each round of grants; for selecting grant recipients according to strict
and transparent competitive procedures; for signing grant contracts with the recipients; and for
disbursing awards and supervising the use of grants by recipient NGOs. As part of its job the
PMO would provide continuous hands-on training and technical assistance to grant recipients.
At an early point in its assignment, the PMO would draft an Operational Manual. This manual
would describe the project management structure, the grant application and award process, the
various steps in the grant cycle, and project audit and procurement procedures.
The World Bank has selected and would hire the PMO, would supervise its work and
would also monitor the degree to which the project as a whole is meeting its objectives.
Great importance would be given to close consultation between the PMO, the NGO
community and the PA in the course of project implementation. A consultative process would be
used by the PMO to receive input from NGOs, the PA and other interested groups. Initially the
process would be as follows, although it is likely to change as the project develops:
*   During the preparation of the Operational Manual, the PMO would meet with the various
NGO networks and unions as well as with the relevant ministries and agencies of the PA
(MOPIC, Agriculture, Education, Health, PECDAR, Social Welfare, Youth and Sports) and
would draw up a draft that would be discussed in a meeting of these same organizations,
plus interested donors, under the chairmanship of MOPIC. The final version of the
Operational Manual would then be approved by the World Bank.
*   Before each bi-annual grant round, the LACC and MOPIC would convene publicity
meetings at a number of municipalities in Gaza and the West Bank (e.g. Ramallah, Nablus,
Hebron, Gaza City, Rafah). These meetings would be advertised in the press, and would be
open to anyone--NGOs, municipal officials, ministry representatives--who cares to attend
them. The PMO would use the meetings to hear from participants about local needs, and to
help obtain guidance on areas and sectors that should be given priority in the forthcoming
grant round. Participants would also be briefed on grant application procedures. These
adduced priorities would then be discussed with MOPIC prior to the grant selection process.
I



Annex 2
Page 4 of 4
*   Once the PMO has selected the grant recipients, and before announcing them in the public,
it would ask MOPIC to convene a meeting at which the subject ministry (e.g. Ministry of
Health in the case of a health project) would be briefed about the forthcoming activity, and
asked to confirm that the proposed grant does not duplicate any ongoing ministry projects
and does not promote technologies or price structures which are at major variance with
official policy.

WEST BANK AND GAZA
THE PALESTINIAN NGO PROJECT
The NGO Sector in the West Bank and Gaza'/
Palestinian NGOs (PNGOs) have played an essential part in delivering economic and social
services in the West Bank and Gaza, and in developing democratic institutions. Estimates place the
number of NGOs operating in the region between 1200 and 1500. This annex provides a brief
description of the composition of the NGO sector, and the major challenges facing the sector today.
Description of the NGO Sector
Palestinian NGOs (PNGOs) can conveniently be classified into charitable societies, development
NGOs, cooperatives and common interest trade unions. There are over 500 charitable societies, most of
them working in the health, education and social welfare sectors with annual budgets of under
US$100,000. They tend to be welfare-oriented, relying in part on local charitable contributions; only a
few have so far adopted modem management and consultative techniques. Service and consumer
cooperatives number about 300, are predominantly agricultural and provide a variety of savings and
loans services. There are perhaps 200 "developmental" NGOs. These tend to be more recent in origin,
more modern and professional in orientation, and deliver economic and social services to their client
populations. A number of these NGOs have strong political affiliations. Included in this category would
be hospitals and universities, a number of which were assimilated by the PA in the 1994-6 period. Trade
unions per se are not proposed as beneficiaries of the project and are therefore not addressed in this
analysis.
The situation of PNGOs today can be characterized along the lines of traditional vs.
modem/westernized (both in terms of affiliation and constituencies), as well as peripheral vs. central (in
terms of location, access to outside funding and type of communities served). These characterizations
generally reflect the timeframe during which different PNGOs were established.
Many of the older and more traditional social welfare NGOs, most notably the charitable
societies, predate 1948. The greatest number are to be found in the West Bank, with a much smaller
number in Gaza. Often without clear political affiliations, these grassroots NGOs are generally based on
family, clan and parochial relationships. Formerly these associations were strongly linked with Jordan,
but since Jordan's disengagement from the West Bank in 1988 have lost that connection--and
simultaneously, an indeterminate but appreciable proportion of their funding. Although large in number
today--approximately 385 of them are registered under the General Union of Charitable Societies--they
are predominantly small organizations and their focus is largely on relief and charity rather than on
development. Religiously-affiliated NGOs comprise another part of the older NGO community and
provide services to local communities by raising funds both locally (for example through the Islamic
I/    This paper has been developed on the basis of three pieces of work carried out in the course of the
preparation of the NGO Project--in particular, The Changing Role of Palestinian NGOs since the
Establishment of the Palestinian Authority, Sophie Claudet, World bank, June 1996--as well as the earlier
NGOs in the West Bank and Gaza, John D. Clark and Barbara S. Balaj, World Bank, February 1996; and A
Report on Palestinian NGOs for the World Bank, Denis Sullivan, World Bank, November 1995.

Zakat committees, which generate donations from the community on a tithing basis) and from outside--
particularly from Europe, in the case of Christian associations, and affluent Gulf countries in the case of
Muslim associations.
A new wave of NGO formation occurred after a 1978 PLO meeting which established a
Palestinian/Jordanian Joint Committee to channel funds from Arab countries to the Palestinian people.
Various charitable societies and cooperatives were reactivated, or created, to provide a conduit for these
funds--which went to support activities in a number of sectors including agriculture, housing,
transportation, and education.
The third generation of PNGOs appeared in the late 1970s and tend to have much clearer
political affiliations. Many of these organizations stemmed directly from political parties--either PLO
mainstream Fatah, or other PLO and non-PLO factions, including socialists, communists and militant
Islamists. A number of these organizations evolved into reliable service providers. Some, particularly
those with leftist or non-Fatah leanings, turned with success to Western donors for funding. Today,
many of these PNGOs are viewed as among the more modern and professional of the service providers.
The Changing Role of PNGOs
Given the historical evolution of the NGO sector, and its close links with political activism and
political developments in the region, NGOs operating under the Palestinian Authority now find
themselves needing to examine and redefine their role. Issues being faced by the sector are numerous.
*   One of the most significant and pressing challenges is how PNGOs will adjust to the
contraction in funding and changes in channels for assistance to the Palestinian people that
have occurred, particularly since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority.
*   Closely linked to this is the issue of how PNGOs will develop a relationship with the new
governing authority.
*   A further significant challenge is the effect of fragmentation and division within the NGO
sector, largely based on previous political affiliations and orientation, and how this affects
transparency and accountability in NGO activities.
*   Connected to the issue of accountability, and of no less significance, is the question of true
community participation and representation. Given that one of the benefits of NGOs is
their ability to reach, respond to and be accountable to communities, and particularly to the
poor and marginalized, NGOs need to ensure that they do indeed have a representative base
if they are to help sustain a pluralistic Palestinian society.
These issues are examined in order below.
The Funding Situation
For NGOs the peace process has been a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they have been
prominent campaigners for Palestinian autonomy, domestically and internationally, and have been
funded partly in recognition of this. But the handing over of certain governmental responsibilities from
the Israeli Civil Administration to the Palestinian Authority has eroded or threatened NGO pre-eminence

in service delivery. Donors that financed NGOs heavily in their period of most rapid growth, during the
intifada years, have switched funds dramatically to the PA. This NGO funding problem has been
compounded by the (unrelated) drying-up of external Arab funding after the Gulf War.
Hence Palestinian NGOs have mostly experienced extreme funding cuts, and are trying to come
to grips with what their new roles should be. According to Bank estimates (Balaj and Clark, op. cit.)
NGOs received approximately $43 million in bilateral funds and $22 million in multilateral funds in
1992 (probably the peak year); this went largely to development organizations and charitable societies.
In addition to this, somewhere in the range of $30 million to $100 million of Arab funding was received
each year up until the Gulf war. These funds consisted of official and semi-official Arab/Islamic
sources, and donations from organizations of Palestinians living abroad. Furthermore, some $45 million
to $50 million from all sources went to NGOs that are better regarded as public institutions, in particular
universities and hospitals. The charitable societies and Zakat committees between them mobilized some
$30 million in domestic funds.
In among the funding cuts, those NGOs regarded as public institutions, such as universities and
hospitals, have been considerably protected. Development organizations and charitable societies,
however, have seen a halving of their external funding since the early 1990s, and grass-roots
organizations have seen much steeper reductions; many of them have in fact been eliminated during the
last three years. In spite of the large number of NGOs, moreover, it is estimated that 30-40 of them
receive fully 70-80 percent of total external funding (but deliver less than a commensurate proportion of
NGO services).
It is inevitable that as the PA establishes its capabilities and infrastructure, the unusual role and
scale of NGO activities which flourished under occupation should diminish. The shrinking of the NGOs'
funding base is thus, to some extent, a natural process. However, the funding crisis is problematic
because of its precipitate and indiscriminate nature. The PA remains unable to replace the majority of
services delivered by PNGOs, and much of the service expansion undertaken since the Declaration of
Principles of 1993 has been achieved by absorbing into the PA various NGOs and institutions.
Furthermore, the service needs of the Palestinian people are increasing in absolute terms because of
rapid population growth and post-DOP economic decline. Statistics for recent years show the population
growth rate exceeding 6 per cent per annum 2/, with estimates of future growth remaining at similar
levels. In the period 1994-6, GNP per capita has declined by about 20 per cent, and the number of
people in absolute poverty (less than $2 per day) is estimated by the Bank to have doubled from less than
20 per cent to about one-third of the population of WBG (and perhaps 40 per cent of Gazans).
Relations with the Palestinian Authority
As described above, the PNGO community provides an unparalleled proportion of services and
employs large numbers of talented and committed Palestinian professionals. However, it is a heavily
factionalized and politicized community, with a greater tradition of competition and rivalry than
cooperation, and with weak systems for evaluation, transparency and quality control. Since the signing of
the peace accords, both the PA and the NGO community are attempting to overcome ingrained traditions
of secrecy developed during the last twenty-five years. As the PA starts to assume some roles previously
filled by NGOs, the latter are thinking strategically about their own evolution. Many groups within the
NGO sector recognize the need to become more transparent, accountable and democratic. However, in
2/    Demography of the Palestinian People, Palestinian Bureau of Statistics, December 1994.



Annex 4
Page 4 of 6
this period of transition, significant non-financial constraints to NGO development activities exist--most
notably, uncertainty within the PA over how to regulate NGOs and the degree of autonomy which they
should be permitted.
Some ministries, such as the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, have created an
NGO coordinating unit within their structure, and some communicate regularly with NGOs (notably the
Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Social Welfare). However, as the
ministries themselves are still developing, effective coordination with the NGOs is patchy, while in some
quarters officials harbor concerns about the political intentions of certain NGOs. There is also a degree
of envy of those NGOs that are well-funded from abroad, and a belief that not all such organizations are
scrupulous in their use of funds. Furthermore, the PA has yet to decide and clarify which ministry will
take the lead in overseeing the NGO sector. Appropriate regulation of any NGO community is clearly a
necessity--the goal should be to emphasize accountability while allowing NGOs freedom to operate
unencumbered by excessive regulations. To date, though, successive drafts of the NGO Law have
emphasized tight financial and govemance controls.
In terms of public service delivery, the PA has begun to experiment with sub-contracting systems
of different kinds, but so far only on a very limited scale (for example in agriculture and health care).
The extent to which the PA will choose to work with NGOs remains to be seen, but will hopefully be
based on an examination of the comparative advantage of NGOs as opposed to other service providers
(central government, local government and the private sector). Mechanisms to ensure that NGOs remain
competitive will need to be established, as will careful performance evaluation systems.
Coordination and Accountability within the PNGO community
Another aspect to the establishment of a healthy working relationship between the PA and the
NGO sector is the ability of PNGOs to organize themselves, coordinate their activities and collectively
define their preferred mode of relations with the PA. PNGOs have to some extent begun to organize
along sectoral lines, such as through networks in health and education. Sectoral networks are providing a
relatively neutral forum in which technical issues, and issues of technical coordination with the PA, can
be explored--the better to identify, plan and coordinate development objectives and priorities. These two
networks are also beginning to interact with the Sector Working Groups of PA and donor agencies
affiliated with the Local Aid Coordination Committee.
Cross-sectoral networking has become much more contentious in recent months. Up until the
end of 1996, the main cross-sectoral NGO groupings were the Union of Charitable Societies (385
members currently) and the Palestinian NGO Network (68 members). These two groups enjoyed mutual
good relations and were active in pursuing dialogue with the PA. Partly in response to growing tension
between (in particular) the Palestinian NGO Network and the PA, three new NGO associations were
formed at the turn of the year--the Palestinian National Institute for NGOs (PNIN) in the West Bank, and
the Board Union of Palestinian NGOs (BUPNGO) and the General Palestinian Union of NGOs
(GPUNGO) in Gaza. PNIN enjoys a direct relationship with the Office of the President, and claims
about 1200 members (this includes trade and professional unions and cooperatives). BUPNGO also has
on its executive committee a number of serving PA civilian and security officials, and claims 210
members. GPUNGO, which claims 68 members, has been careful to register early with the Ministry of
Interior in Gaza (it should be noted that there are no clear directives about where NGOs should register,
with more than one ministry claiming this responsibility). Since the formation of these new unions
coincides with a period of turmoil in PA-PNGO relations, it is no coincidence that two of them, on



Annex 4
Page 5 of 6
different occasions, have asserted an intention to represent all Palestinian NGOs. It is also clear,
however, that the formation of these new unions was motivated by growing financial desperation among
the smaller NGOs, many of which felt themselves shut out from access to external funds, and in need of
some mechanism for approaching donors like the Bank.
Notwithstanding this recent controversy, a major challenge to the PNGO community today is to
improve accountability and transparency. Enthusiastic but ill-disciplined donor funding of NGOs in the
past created a situation in which there was little emphasis on program evaluation, learning from
experience, financial management or coordination. The dispersion and lack of any coordination between
donor funders of NGOs has only contributed to the fragmentation of local development work. In a
changing environment, PNGOs now need to become more competitive and accountable, or they will
disappear. They will need to improve management and administration skills, financial discipline, their
adherence to sound technical standards, their attention to monitoring and evaluation, and the
coordination of their programs with each other and with the PA.
Community Participation and Representation
A key area is the need for NGOs to develop more democratic practices at the network level, and
to orient their programs more clearly to their grassroots constituencies (rather than to donor preferences).
Since the time of their earliest formation, PNGOs have grown in response to local needs, and on
the basis of indigenous initiatives at the community level; in this sense, local involvement has been a
constant feature of the PNGO sector. PNGOs have made major contributions to the advancement of
Palestinian society, both as advocacy organizations and as a key channel for redistributive equity. Due to
the impetus for social unity resulting from occupation (in particular during the intifada), many of even
the more traditional NGOs became active in establishing a more durable social base to meet long-term
community needs. PNGOs have played a significant role in the advancement of political awareness, the
freedom of speech, women's rights, awareness of the environment and the promotion of sustainable
approaches to development. Most significant of all, perhaps, they have preserved and enriched the plural
texture of Palestinian economic and social life; they both express, and add to, the distinct entrepreneurial
character of Palestinian society.
However, there are contrasting tendencies. Many of the older, more traditional PNGOs continue
to rely on tribal, family or individual loyalties, and to dispense their services accordingly. Others with
party-political affiliations have in recent years foregone their popular constituencies and concerned
themselves with political maneuvering to secure funding and other preferences. These kinds of behavior
risk a loss of awareness of constituents' needs, and dilute the checks and balances that PNGOs have so
successfully provided; nor do such explicit alliances usually enhance accountability.
Conclusion
At this juncture in the history of the PNGO movement, the onus is on all interested partners to be
clear about certain priorities.
*   for NGOs themselves, there is a need to re-dedicate themselves to the needs of their local
constituencies, and to pursue technical excellence and improved openness; depoliticized
fora for association between PNGOs and between NGOs and the PA should also be
developed, to provide a shared basis for building a new Palestinian economy;



Annex 4
Page 6 of 6
*   for the PA, there is a need to focus on developing an appropriate and balanced set of
regulatory rules and norms; while certain aspects of NGO activity undoubtedly require
regulation (such as clarifying tax rules and the assessment of tax liability, and the use or
propagation of certain technologies), there is a need to avoid stifling healthy pluralistic
activity. It will also be important to recognize more clearly the contribution that NGOs
have made and can continue making to service provision--particularly to the poor, the
isolated and the vulnerable;
*   for donors, coordination on NGO matters is almost non-existent, and demands attention--as
does the overall programmatic balance of financing between the PA and PNGOs. Donors
need to watch the direction of the development of the sector with care, and to make their
observations known. Skills enhancement and an insistence on accountability for funds are
also priorities which donors can influence.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods (Table A)
Procurement would be done in accordance with IDA Guidelines for
Procurement (January 1995, as revised in January 1996). The PMO would review the
procurement practices of local and international NGOs working in the West Bank and
Gaza, to identify and adapt current best practices in NGO procurement for use under the
NGO sub-project grant program. The resulting procedures (for the purchase of works,
goods and services) would be described in the Operational Manual, which will be subject
to approval by the World Bank. The PMO would be responsible for fully explaining
procurement procedures to all grant recipients, and for monitoring procurement activities
of NGOs.
Prior Bank review thresholds (Table B)
Procurement procedures implemented by the PMO for the first round of grant
awards.
Consultant contracts (other than under the NGO sub-project grant program) with
estimated value of US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals.
Disbursement
Allocation ofgrant proceeds (Table C)
Project funds are expected to be disbursed over a period of six years, with
completion by July 2003. It is estimated that -the PMO would be able to commit the
funds in five grant rounds, at an average of US$2-3 million per round. The PMO would
open Special Accounts to be used exclusively for project activities, and under terms and
conditions satisfactory to IDA. The accounts would operate as revolving funds: the
World Bank would make an initial advance into an account, and would replenish it to the
same amount on a monthly basis. The PMO would pass on funds to accounts opened by
NGO grant recipients; grantee accounts would also operate as revolving funds, with
grant recipients receiving a proportion of the grant in advance and subsequent
installments on the basis of satisfactory physical progress and financial accounting
(details of NGO grant recipient account management will be spelt out in the Operational
Manual).
