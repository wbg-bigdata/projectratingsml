MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO INDIA
FOR THE NORTHERN REGION TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.     I submit, for your approval, a proposal for a loan to India in an
amount equivalent to US$485 million. The proposed loan, to help finance
the Northern Region Transmission Project, will be issued at the standard
IBRD variable interest rate, and will be repayable over 20 years including
a five-year grace period.  The Japanese Grant Facility is providing about
US$1.1 million to finance consulting services. The Government is seeking
additional cofinancing of about US$60 million for equipment.
2.     Background.  The Northern Region is the largest of India's five
regional power systems. It includes the States of Haryana, Himachal
Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, and the Union
Territories of New Delhi and Chandigarh. The power system comprises about
16,000 MW of generating plant interconnected with load centers by heavily
loaded 220 kV and 400 kV networks. The system extends 1,800 km from
hydroelectric plants in the north to superthermal, pit-head plants in the
southeast of the region. The peak load in the system is over 9,000 MW and
is constrained by the available supply. Already the power system is nearly
as large as some national systems, and if demand in the region grows at the
predicted IOZ yearly rate, by 1995 the power system will be comparable in
size to Sweden's power system today. However, it is growing much faster,
at about four times the rate of Sweden's system, and as a result is much
more difficult to manage.
3.     Existing institutional arrangements call for the Northern Region
Load Dispatch Center (NRLDC) in New Delhi to coordinate operation of the
regional power system. Each state and each central government generating
agency has its own area control organization. In practice, however, the
system fails to achieve secure operation and economic dispatch for four
main reasons: (a) not enough data are telemetered to make the NRLDC aware
of what is happening on the system; this reduces its role to reviewing the
execution of pre-arranged contracts and analyzing outages after they have
occurred; (b) the member states of the Northern Region Electricity Board
(NREB) often ignore prearranged contracts and take more than their share of
power; (c) the structure of bulk tariffs and the linkage of power plant
staff salaries to plant load factor inhibit economic dispatch of the power
plants; and (d) there are no commercial arrangements for power trading.
4.     As a result of the heavily loaded transmission network and the
control deficiencies mentioned above, the power system operates with high
losses and delivers expensive, poor quality, unreliable service to its
customers. To derive full benefit from its investments in additional
generation, GOI must: (a) provide adequate transmission line and substation
capacity to allow power to flow as dictated by security and economic
dispatch criteria; (b) upgrade information and control facilities for real-
time monitoring of power system security and for informing members of the
NREB of opportunities for economic power trading; and (c) set up commercial
arrangements for Dower trading.



5.     Initially, GOI conceived the proposed project to evacuate power from
the Bank-financed Nathpa Jhakri plant under construction in Himachal
Pradesh. Later, GOI expanded the project scope to include the major
transmission links that will be required in the region over the next six or
seven years, and the load dispatch system that will be needed to monitor
and control the increasingly complex power system. The proposed project
now provides for evacuating power from existing and proposed hydroelectric
plants in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. The transmission lines
and substations included were defined in a least-cost transmission study
prepared by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) and reviewed by the
Bank. The load dispatch and system control facilities were defined in a
study prepared by NREB and reviewed by the Bank. These facilities will
make It possible for the power system to operate in a manner consistent
with security and economic dispatch criteria.
6.     GOI has recently created an institutional vehicle for improving
operation of the transmission system by iorming the National Power
Transmission Corporation (NPTC). NPTC will be responsible for buildi.,g,
maintaining, and operating regional transmission grids. An important goal
of the proposed project will be to support development of the NPTC. In
particular, the project will provide systems to facilitate the application
of the tariff structure and commercial arrangements needed for economic
dispatch and better quality service.
7.     Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project is consistent
with the Bank's strategy of promoting improvements in India's power sector.
This strategy involves the Bank working closely with bcth central sector
entities and selected State Electricity Boards. Through its involvement
with central sector entities, the Bank seeks to promote improvements in
areas that are common to the sector or a large part of it. For example,
the project will significantly reduce the cost of bulk power in the
Northern Region, and will lead to better quality electricity and thus more
effective use of available resources. In addition, the Bank's involvement
with the project helped reduce NHPC's receivables and will support a
financial recovery program for NEPC. This will lead to improved financial
discipline in the sector.
8.       The Bank perceived a need for better planning and increased
investment in transmission when it approved the Rihand Transmission loan
(Loan 2555-IN), which required CEA to produce a long-term transmission
study. The proposed project is a logical follow-up to the transmission
study since it provides some of the facilities recommended in the study to
correct existing deficiencies. The technological and institutional
developments pursued in the proposed project are likely to benefit the
entire power sector: the Northern Region directly and the remainder of the
country, by example.
9.     Project Objectives.  The primary aim of the proposed project is to
improve the reliability, operating efficiency, and quality of service in
the Northern Region power system. These improvements will be effected
through the provision of: (a) transmission lines and substations to
strengthen the interconnection of power plants and load centers; (b) a load
dispatch system to monitor and control the power system; (c) a commercial



-3-
framework to encourage better use of the available energy; and (d) a
communication system to improve NHPC's corporate and project management.
10.     Project Description, Costs, and Financing.   The proposed project,
which both NHPC and NREB will implement, will consist of two parts: (a) the
construction of transmission lines and substations; and (b) strengthening
of the regional dispatch system. NHPC's portion of the project consists
of: (a) construction of 1,100 km of 400 kV double-circuit line, 325 km of
400 kV single-circuit line, 600 km of 765 kV single-circuit line, and 40 km
of 220 kV single-and double-circuit line; (b) construction/modification of
nine substations with a total capacity of 2,500 MVA; (c) installation of a
satellite-based corporate communication system for NHPC; (d) consulting
services for t,-ansmission line and substation design, inspection services,
and training; and (e) compensatory afforestation. NREB's portion of the
project consists of: (a) installation of a regional load dispatch and
control system; (b) consulting services for design, procurement, and
supervision; and (c) training. In parallel with the proposed project, GOI
is actively considering two-part tariffs for bulk supplies from central
utilities--to be introduced principally for NHPC and the National Thermal
Power Corporation (NTPC).
11.    The proposed project will be completed in about eight years and will
cost about US$940 million. Interest during construction will add an
additional US$185 million. The cost of the project includes about US$731
million of foreign exchange (62Z of the total). Schedule "A" presents the
cost estimates and financing plan for the project. Schedule "B" presents
the arrangements for procurement and disbursement. Retroactive financing
of up to US$5.0 million will be provided for eligible expenditures after
May 31, 1990. Schedules "C" and "D" provide a timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank group operations in India. Map
No. 21690 shows the geographic location and phasing of the project. A part
of the proposed project is located in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which
is the subject of a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan.
However, in making the proposed loan to India, the Bank does not intend to
prejudice the final determination of the claims of the parties involved.
Staff Appraisal Report No. 8172-IN, dated June 4, 1990, is being
distributed separately.
12.    Environment.  The main environmental concerns related to the project
include: (a) the removal of trees for transmission lii,e rights-of-way; and
(b) the possible degradation of areas near transmission lines and
substations by uncontrolled construction activities. NHPC is routing the
transmission lines to avoid ecologically sensitive areas and
historical/cultural features.
13.    NHPC will have to clear about 780 hectares of forestland.  To
replace this land, NHPC will engage state forest departments in the
planting of compensatory forests. GOI's present policy requires the
planting of ten trees in degraded forestland for every tree removed. NHPC
will take precautions to prevent the displacement of populations or loss of
livelihood as a result of the land used for planting compensatory forests.
The potential impact of construction activities will be controlled in two
ways. First, the terms of reference for the consultants who will help
design the lines and substations in the affected areas specifically require



-4-
them to design the works in a way -%ich minimizes adverse environmental
impacts. Second, the Bank will make sure that all pertinent bidding
documents include clauses which require contractors to take the measures
needed to protect the environment as well as the health and safety of
personnel employed on the proposed project.
14.    Agreed a%ctions.  During negotiations, the government agreed to:
(a) send for the Bank's review, at least three months prior to the proposed
transfer, a detailed plan for the transfer of the transmission functions of
NHPC and the implementation and system control functions of NREB to NPTC;
(b) issue the remaining forest clearances for transmission lines in phases
two (1990-95), and three (1991-98) by June 30, 1992 and October 31, 1993
respectively; and (c) send to the Bank, no later than December 31, 1991,
terms of reference and a short-list of consultants to assist with the
design, procurement, and installation of the load dispatch system, and sign
a contract with the selected consultants io later than July 31, 1992.
During negotiations, NHPC agreed to: (a) reduce its outstanding receivables
from the present level of 11 months of billing to three months of billing
by FY95 with annual targets for each of the intervening years; (b) take all
measures necessary, including tariff adjustments, to earn a return on its
average net fixed assets of not less than 11.5Z; and (c) establish
commercial arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, with the Nathpa Jhakri
Power Corporation (NJPC) no later than one year prior to commissioning the
line which will evacuate power from Nathpa Jhakri.
15.    Benefits.  The transmission lines and substations included in the
proposed project form a part of the least-cost expansion program for
transmission in the Northern Region. The internal rate of return for the
time-slice of the regional program corresponding to the implementation
period for the proposed project is estimated at 15Z.  In addition to the
benefits quantified in the rate of return calculation, the project provides
systems to support tariff and commercial reforms which will yield
significant benefits by creating incentives for more intensive use of
available facilities. The project will introduce into India, for the first
time, the use of 765 kV as a transmission voltage. The project also will
provide knowledge on the design of high voltage lines at high altitude.
This knowledge will become increasingly important as India develops its
hydroelectric resources in the Himalayas.   Finally, the initiatives to
improve communication and project management in NHPC will directly reduce
the final cost of the project and may indirectly benefit the entire sector
by creating a good example.
16.    Risks.  The project carries higher than usual risks in two areas.
First, there are technical risks associated with using a higher
transmission voltage (765 kV) than the one used at present, and with using
400 kV lines at high altitud2c in icy conditions.  Second, there is a risk
of delay in completing the load dispatch component, as it is inherently
complex and involves coordination among all the utilities of the Northern
Region. NHPC is hiring consultants to help with the design of the 765 kV
facilities and the 400 kV, high-altitude lines. The 765 kV voltage class
and high-voltage, high-altitude lines have been in use for several years in
a number of countries. NREB is hiring consultants to help supervise the
design and installation of the load dispatch system. However, the success
or failure of the system depends very much on the level of cooperation that



-5-
can be achieved among the generating agencies of the states and the central
government. This cooperation is expected to be forthcoming, particularly
since the parties have jointly agreed on the principles outlined in the
project report.
17.    Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
