MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN
FOR A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE AND FAMILY PLANNING PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Islamic Republic of Iran for the equivalent of US$141.4 million to help
finance a project for Primary Health Care and Family Planning. The loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen years, including five years of
grace.
2.    Country/Sector Background. The Islamic Republic of Iran, with an area of 1.6 million
square kilometers, is the fourth largest country in Asia. It covers a wide diversity of topography
and climate, ranging from the humid, subtropical Caspian littoral to the dry, hot plains fronting
the Gulf of Oman, some 1,500 kilometers to the south. The country is endowed with rich natural
resources, including an estimated 10 percent of the world's oil reserves and the second largest
natural gas reserves. Iran is a lower middle-income oil exporting country with a 1991 population
of about 58 million and a i991 per capita income estimated at US$2,320. An Islamic Republic
was established in Iran in 1979. The economy had a mixed performance in the 1980s. During
the war years with. Iraq (1980-88), the economy suffered from price and trade controls, which,
coupled with a collapse in oil prices and the damage that occurred to oil production and export
facilities, brought down the rate of GDP growth from 8 percent per year in 1980-85 to -3 percent
per year in 1986-88. Since 1989, the economy has been recovering as a result of the
Government's adopting market-oriented development policies; GDP i estimated to have grown
an average 7 percent a year from 1989 to 1992.
3.    Current .iealth policies are based on a 'Master Health Plan," which was adopted in the
early 1980s for the period 1983-2002. The plan stipulates policies, strategies and quantitative
objectives for the development of the health sector. It gives priority to basic curative care and
preventive activities, over sophisticated hospital care, and focuses strictly on the population
groups at highest risk, particularly in deprived rural areas. In 1984, the Government launched
the Primary Health Care (PHC) Program as the main instrument to implement its policies in the
sector. Since the beginning, the program has enjoyed very strong political support, as reflected
by the relatively large proportion of the public expenditure for health allocated to PHC--about 40
percent in 1991. Medical universities and colleges were brought under the supervision of the
Ministry of Health in 1986 in order to sharpen the focus of medical education on PHC and public
health aspects.
4.    Family planning services were reintroduced as part of the PHC package in 1988 after a
decade-long hiatus. The strong policy commitment to containing rapid population growth has
been evident in the Government's high-level policy seminars focusing on population growth and
led, in late 1991, to the establishment of a separate Population and Family Planning Departnent
(PFP) in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME). The policy commitment has
been reinforced by the apparently widespread popular desire for small families. Underlying this



-2-
desire is the common impression that times are hard; lower fertility preferences are also bolstered
by substantial improvements in education and literacy, including among rural women.
5.    MOHME has the primary responsibility for the delivery of health care, including family
planning. Particular responsibilities of the Ministry include health policy formulation and
planning and monitoring at the national and local levels. The Minister of Health is assisted by
nine specialized deputy-ministers-one for each of the main MOHME programs (e.g., public
health, hospital care, drug administration and research). The Deputy Minister for Health Affairs
(i.e., Public Health) is responsible for seven key departments including Family Planning,
Environmental Health and Communicable Diseases Control.
6.    The public sector is the main provider of health care in Iran. At the village and
community level, the PHC network consists of Rural Health Centers (RHCs), Urban Health
Centers (UHCs) and Health Houses (HHs). In rural areas, HHs provide basic preventive and
curative services to the communities supported by RHCs that provide guidance, supervision and
referral services. As such, RHCs constitute the cornerstone of the PHC network. In uiban
areas, UHCs provide services similar to RHCs.
7.    Main Sector Issues The main constraint faced by MOHME in delivering PHC services
concerns the development of the physical infrastructure. The eAisting PHC network reaches
about 60 percent of the rural population and 90 percent of the urban population. Higher
coverage in urban areas is due to policies during the prerevolutionary period that favored urban
areas and to the availability of alteive sources of health care delivery, such as the private
sector. Apart from essential preventive services (e.g., i n) delivered by mobile health
teams, the remaining 40 percent of the rural population has virtually no access to healffi care.
These underserved population groups are among the poorest in the country. Their access to other
social services is often very limited as well. All health indicators substantiate the fact that health
conditions in rural areas are significantly poorer than in urban areas. According to a 1991
MOHME survey, infant mortality rates (per 1000), under-five mortality rates (per 1000) and
maternal mortalirty rates (per 100,000) were 25, 31 and 29 in urban areas, compared to 50, 56
and 80 in rural areas.
8.    The management of PHC services could be strengthened, particularly at the district and
provincial levels. Areas for improvement range from budgeting and accounting to long-term
planning and the management of specific support services (e.g., procurement, storage and the
distribution of supplies). Services could be better evaluated; presently, very little research on
ways to improve the system is being undertaken. There is also a continuous need to introduce
new approaches to service delivery, as is the case for new control programs (e.g., the
management of acute respiratory infections or the provision of new clinical methods of
contraception). District and provincial level managers lack adequate management training, as
well as the necessary tools to analyze and effectively use the large amount of data which are
generated at PHC facilities.
9.    The family planning program is at a critical juncture. Its recent rapid expansion has been
partly fueled by the absence of public services for over a decade. As the accumulated unmet
demand for contraception is filled, expansion will become more difficult. Expansion has also



-3-
depended largely on locally available contraceptive methods, leading to an excessive reliance on
older types of pills and IUDs and obsolete female sterilization n.ethods. At the same time, the
new department put in charge of the program has to contend with problems with staffing,
traing, facilities and the flow of management information. Only very limited international
technical and financial assistance has been available.
10.   Project Obiectives and Desaipto   The general objective of the project is to improve
health conditions in rural areas and reduce popultion growth in the countuy. The project would
focus on selected rural areas where health conditions are particularly poor and existing health
services relatively inadequate. The project would consist of three components: (a) Service
Delivery (US$219 million base cost), for expanding the PHC network through establishing 623
RHCs in 14 Provinces (see Map), and for strengthening the managerial capacity of health
personnel working at the provincial and national levels through establishing a training facility-the
National PHC Management Center; (b) Family Planning Program (US$36 million base cost),
for expanding the Government's family planning program and strengthening its institutional base.
Services would be provided through the primary health care network. The family planning
program would have four parts: (i) diversifying the contraceptive method mix and expanding
family planing services (ii) building the Ministry's institutional capacity at central and provincial
levels to plan, manage and deliver family planning services; (iii) developing information-
education-communication capabilities to reach target groups; and (iv) establishting a capacity for
program evaluation and research in family planning through the use of specific studies; and (c)
Health Financing Study (US$0.5 million base cost), for funding consulting services to carry out
a study that aims at improving the financing of health services in the country by examining the
fee structure and the role of the private sector in the provision of tertiary care and developing
plans to establish a national medical insurance scheme.
11. Project Costs and Financing. The total project cost is estimated at US$294 million
equivalent, with foreign cost representing US$141.4 million. Project financing would consist of
a government conribution of US$152.6 million for the local cost, plus a Bank loan of US$141.4
million for the foreign cost (Schedule A). Procurement and disbursement arrangements are
provided in Schedule B.
12.   Project Imulementation. A Project Implementation Unit (PU)) has been established
within MOHME, and its manager and key staff have been appointed. Provincial and district
health authorities would have the main responsibility for project implementation, and each of the
selected provinces and districts would have a workload well within their implementation
capability. Central level responsibilities include designing the architectural plans, allocating the
necessary budget and monitoring overall implementation, while actual implementation including
the identification and selection of local contractors, disbursements and field supervision are
handled at the provincial and district levels. Annual and mid-term reviews would be carried out,
and several surveys have been included in the project to periodically monitor the impact of
project activities on key health and demographic indicators. The project would be implemented
over a period of six years. The timetable of key processing events is given in schedule C, and
the status of Bank Group Operations in Iran is given in schedule D. A map (IBRD No. 24500) is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 11547-IRN, dated March 5, 1993, is being
distributed separately.



13.                      . The most important factor affecting the futuri' sustainability of
project actiies is the availability of fimds to adequately staff and maintain the RHCs and related
facilities and equipmten. Annual incremental recurrent expenditures under the project amount to
only an average of 3 percent of MOHME's annual recurrent budget for the period of the project.
MOHME would be able to sustain these expenditures during, and beyond, project life. There is
no evidence tha MOHME has faced any budget constraints for financing recurrent costs
associated with its PHC programs in the past; field observations of the staffing and physical
conditions of health care facilities presently in operation indicate a satisfactory level of O&M.
Public facilities, usually workshops located at the district and provincial level, provide adequate
repair and mainhenmce services. The use of private sector O&M service companies is commen.
14.   Lom  fm  Previous Bak  Inolveme. I he Bank has financed one operation in the
sector (Loan 928 of FY73, closed in FY77). The Bank loan was for US$16.5 million, and the
main objecthes of the project were similar to those of the present. According to the Project
Performance Audit Report (Report No. 3790), the project did not succeed in fully realizing its
objectives largely because of the Government's lack of commitment in adopting a clear
population policy. This issue is no longer relevant; the present Government sees family plaming
as a top priority md is supported in this by the religious authorities. Also, the proposed project
would strengthen the Ministry's institutional capacity at central and provincial levels to plan,
manage and deliver family plannig services.
15.   Ratonale for Bnk pxQim tn1. The project supports the Government's policies and
constitutes an essential part of the Bank's human resources strategy in the country. The
Government has a strong commitment to improving performance in the health sector, developing
naional population strategies and expanding the availability and use of family planning services.
In this it is seeking outside assistance, in particular Bank support, to design and implement
change. Government policy in health care, in the short run, emphasizes the extension of PHC to
underserved rural areas and the expansion of family planning services, while addressing the issue
of health care financing. In the long run, it seeks to expand the types of services offered by the
PHC network, to increase the role of the private sector in tertiary care and to adopt measures for
the financial sustainability of the health system. The present project would assist the Government
in achieving its immediae objectives by laying the institutiomial and physical foundations for an
effective PHC system and examining health financing; future sector work and lending operations
would address the long-term objectives. Moreover, expanding PHC services would streamli
the referral system, reduce pressures on hospitals and allow a more efficient use of resources in
the health sector as a whole. The policy framework for extending the PHC network, as well as
the politcal support for expanding the family planing program, are securely in place. It is
within this policy framework and based on such political support hat the Bank's intervention
should be viewed. Finally, the project would serve as a confirmation and a catalyst for a
comprehensive PHC strategy and would strengthen the resolve of MOHME to secure and commit
the necessary public resources for such a plan.
16.   Actions Amd. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that it would: (a) allocate the necessary recurrent budget on an annual basis for the proper
operation and maintenance of all facilities included under the project; (b) maitain throughout the
project a national Project Imlemenation Unit (PIU) with staffIng, functions and authorities



-5-
agreed with the Bank; (c) finish the Bank with semiannual progress reports on the
implementation of the project; and undertake, with the Bank, a midtrm review by June 1996; (d)
retain consultants in accordance with tms of reference satisfactory to the Bank to assist with
procurement under the project; and (e) carry out the project in accordance wIt an Action Plan
agreed upon wWi the Bank, covering I=  1al, studies and training programs to be conducted,
and institutional measures relevant to project mnagement ard implementation.
17.   Envirwmmetal Aspctc. The project is classified under Category C. The project would
have several favorable environmenta1 outcomes, but most importantly by helping reduce
population growth in the long run, it would reduce pressure on limited resources and aid in
combating environmental degradation.
18.       ba.f                       Strengthening the rural PHC network is consistent with
government policy to stem rural to urban migration and correct the imbalance in resource use that
results in less favorable health conditions in rural areas. This objective concurs further with
government efforts to reduce poverty, which remains more of a problem hi rural areas.
19.  Ibroect Bemfds. The project would increase access to public health services, especially
primary care and family planning, in rural underserved areas. It would provide a major catalyst
for the Government's effort to expand family planning services nationwide. The project would
also help bring rural health indicators more into Ine with urban indicators. The service delivery
component would provide the backbone for extending the health network to cover an additional
20 percent of the rural population, or about 5 million more people. It is too optimistic to expect
the least-served areas quickly to attain the levels of health in better-served areas, but if the gap is
closed by only a half, infant mortality in rural areas could fall to 37 per 1,000 from the current
level of 50 per 1,000. If the family planning program provides as much contraceptive coverage
as is being planned, in 5 years 1.3 million users should be added to the program, almost doubling
the urrent number covered by,MOHME. This would imply a population growth rate as much as
a third of a percentage point below what it would be without the increments provided by the
project and a population by the year 2000 as a whole 1.1 million smaller than without the
project.
20. Risks. The main risk relates to the lack of familiarity of the implementing agency with
Bank procedures in general. This risk would be given close attention during implementation. The
project would provide adequate technical assistance and training for PIU and MOHME staff in
the various areas of project management especially in the areas of procurement, disbursement,
project supervision and evaluation.
21.   Recommendation. IT am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
