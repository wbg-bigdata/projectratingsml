                 sharpening the strategic focus o f the budget; and (iii)improving service
                 delivery in key sectors.
                 The proposed operation i s an integral part o f the Bank's current
                 Country Assistance Strategy for Lesotho and the n e w CPS under
                 preparation. The new CPS i s built around t w o thematic pillars and
                 three cross-cutting issues. The t w o pillars are: (i)
                                                                      Human Development
                 and Improved Service Delivery; and (ii)    Economic Diversification and
                 Enhanced Competitiveness. The cross-cutting issues are: (i)    Public
                 sector accountability and governance; (ii)   Capacity development; and
                 (iii)Regional integration.
Risks and Risk   Mucro risks: T w o distinct macro risks exist. First, the recovery o f the
Mitigation       South African economy could be slower than anticipated and the
                 rebound o f SACU revenues could be delayed. This would put
                 enormous pressure o n what already i s a tough fiscal adjustment process
                 which can undermine fiscal sustainability and/or jeopardize necessary
                 social and capital expenditure. Second, the Government m a y not fully
                 implement the required program o f fiscal consolidation. The run-up to
                 the local elections in 2010 and the National Assembly elections in t w o
                 years may lead to unplanned expenditures. Mitigating these risks
                 depends o n Lesotho's capacity to adjust to the shocks and the
                 Government's ability to manage the impact o f the shocks. Significant
                 levels o f government deposits accumulated at the Central B a n k during
                 the years o f SACU revenue b o o m and high levels o f international
                 reserves at the Central Bank (almost double the level required to
                 maintain parity with the rand) provide a cushion f r o m the short t e r m
                 fiscal and external shocks. Bank and the Fund, through their respective
                 programs, will w o r k with the Government to identify ways to make this
                 fiscal adjustment w o r k through expenditure cuts, efficiency gains and
                 revenue diversification. Predictable and timely budget support through
                 the PRSC series and f r o m other development partners, including the
                 IMF will also help mitigate the risks.
                 Capacity risks: Limited Government administrative capacity and
                 coordination among relevant central and local agencies could lead to
                 delays in the implementation o f key reform measures particularly
                 related to service delivery. T o mitigate this potential coordination
                 failure, implementation arrangements for the PRSC seek to ensure
                 oversight and buy-in at the political level. Capacity building initiatives
                 underway with support f r o m other Development Partners have gathered
                 momentum and will also mitigate this risk.

     PROPOSED SECOND POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT AND GRANT
                               (PRSC-2)
                     TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO

                                              Program Document


                                         I.       INTRODUCTION


1.           The PRSC-2 i s the second in a series o f three annual development policy operations
(DPO), envisaged in the FY 2006-09 CAS.' The operation w o u l d support the Government o f
Lesotho's development program that underpins i t s Interim National Development Framework
(INDF) and the Growth Strategy. The proposed operation amount i s US$25 m i l l i o n equivalent.
The operation comes at a time when the Government o f Lesotho has to cope with the adverse
impact o f the global recession while retaining focus o n longer-term reforms to achieve faster
growth, address the HIV/AIDS pandemic, to tackle significant human development challenges in
health and education, and to improve public financial management. The proposed amount
includes U S $ l O m i l l i o n equivalent f r o m the Crisis Response W i n d o w (CRW), o f which US$5
m i l l i o n equivalent i s a grant.
2.       The global crisis i s affecting Lesotho through the following main channels: (i)  economic
slowdown in the United States (Lesotho's m a i n export destination for garments) has hurt
Lesotho's textile industry, leading to j o b losses; (ii) slump in diamond prices and the global
                                                        a
credit crunch have resulted in reduced production and export o f diamonds; (iii)    slowdown in the
South African economy has led to a sharp decline in i t s imports, and, as a result, will cut into the
Southern Africa Customs U n i o n (SACU) revenues; and (iv) weakening o f the South African
economy has also resulted in large-scale j o b losses in i t s mining sector where many o f the
Basotho are employed. The decline in S A C U revenues, estimated at over 65 percent in the next
t w o years poses by far the biggest challenge to Lesotho and can potentially create both fiscal and
external imbalances. Managing these deficits will require a judicious balance between financing
and containing growth o f government expenditures. The proposed financing f r o m the C R W in
FY 10/11 will provide m u c h needed fiscal space as the Government undertakes fiscal
consolidation o n the expenditure side.
3.       The Government o f Lesotho (GOL) i s seeking the support o f i t s development partners as
i t responds t o cushion the decline in aggregate demand and shelter the vulnerable segments o f
the population. The proposed PRSC-2 will support and help protect the Government's long term
reform program, essential for the country's sustained development, as it seeks to mitigate the
impact o f the economic crisis while facing a shrinking resource base. The fiscal space, analytical
support, and policy dialogue that w o u l d go with the proposed operation would help guide the
Government's focus o n k e y reform areas. It will also play a catalytic role t o furthering the p o l i c y
dialogue o n major reform areas such as public financial management, education and health.

4.     As was the case with PRSC-1, the proposed PRSC-2 i s being designed and implemented
within a harmonized framework for the provision o f budget support. This framework comprises

transaction costs for the G O L and the development partners (DPs). While the PRSC operations
together w i t h the contribution by the Joint Budget Support (JBS) Donor Group will provide
reliable and timely financial support for the implementation o f the National Development Plan,
support under each operation will be disbursed against specific prior actions as identified in the
P A F and agreed with GOL.


                                     11.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

                                       A.       COUNTRYOVERVIEW

5.     Lesotho i s a small, landlocked country, with a population o f around 1.8 million. I t
has close economic ties with South Africa through remittances f r o m miners and other workers
employed in South Africa; customs revenues f r o m SACU; the sale o f water f r o m i t s Highland
Water Project to South Africa; and, very strong trade with South Africa, especially imports. I t s
monetary policy i s anchored in the monetary union and pegged exchange rate with South A f r i c a
under the Common Monetary Area (CMA), while membership in S A C U determines i t s trade
regime.
6.      Lesotho's per capita income o f US$1,080 (2008, Atlas method) places it within reach
o f the I D A cut-off point o f US$1,135. Good, albeit uneven, recent growth performance,
averaging 3.4 percent per annum from 2004-2008 accelerated the country's ascent toward M I C
status. This progress has however been halted by the impact o f the global crisis. A shift in the
drivers o f production and income f r o m subsistence agriculture and receipt o f remittances t o
modern manufacturing, natural resource exports, and the services sector resulted in growth rates
higher than the sub-Saharan African average. However, over h a l f the population lived below the
national poverty line o f $1.50 per day and 37 percent o f the households lived below $1 per day in
2002/032. M a n y households, mostly in rural areas, have not benefitted m u c h f r o m economic
growth and the structural change. For some households, the loss o f income f r o m remittances
combined with the decreasing natural resources base for agriculture (arable land as w e l l as
grazing fields) has increased poverty, vulnerability, and exclusion. B y far, the most important
livelihood and income risk, however, i s the high prevalence o f H I V / A I D S .
7.      Lesotho has the third highest HIV adult prevalence rate in the world at 23.23
percent and the fifth highest Tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the world with 635 cases per
100,000 people. There are an estimated 62 n e w infections and 50 deaths due to AIDS each day
(implying that epidemic threshold has not yet been reached and that the p o o l o f HIV positive
persons - who need care and treatment, and who can infect others - keeps growing). At the end
o f 2007, there were an estimated 270,000 people living with HIV (PLWHA), o f w h o m 11,801
were children. L i f e expectancy at birth has dropped to 36.8 years from 44 years a decade ago.
The total number o f orphans i s estimated to be around 200,000. With 80 percent o f HIV positive
patients co-infected with TB, the HIV epidemic has dramatically increased the threat o f TB.
Multi-Drug resistant and Extremely Drug Resistant strains o f TB are o n the rise, threatening both

Lesotho and the Southern Africa Region as a whole. This "two disease, one patient" issue needs
to be addressed in a carefully coordinated way.
8.      Overall policy performance judged by the Bank's CPIA indicators has been good
and Lesotho stands among the better African performers on a broad range o f economic
and structural policies. Lesotho's aggregate C P I A rating was 3.6 in 2008 against the Sub-
Saharan average o f 3.3. Macroeconomic management has been good. Prudent fiscal policies
enabled fiscal surpluses in each year between 2003104 and 2008/09. L e s s than 10 percent o f
Lesotho's budget i s funded by foreign aid4. Public expenditure management, though s t i l l weak,
has been imploving w i t h the adoption o f the medium-term planning framework and the
introduction o f the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS). There i s
relatively easy movement o f goods and services across i t s borders. However, Lesotho lags
behind IDA-borrowers o n average, in t w o critical areas - business regulatory environment and
quality o f budgetary and financial management; both o f these reform areas will be supported
under the proposed operation.
9.      The challenge for policy makers i s to sustain shared growth and reduce inequality in
the face of the global economic crisis while addressing the critical human development
issues. In order to achieve the high, sustained and j o b creating growth i t aspires to, Lesotho
needs to diversify i t s economy and undertake structural reforms to enhance i t s competitiveness.
This has to be tackled against the backdrop o f limited human and institutional capacity.
Deepening regional integration and exploiting i t s proximity to South Africa can provide an
important contribution to addressing these challenges by creating greater employment
opportunities in the manufacturing sector, including agro-industry. Improving the business
climate overall to attract foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly f r o m South Africa to
produce for the regional market will lessen the dependence o n the U market for textiles. The
                                                                       S
recently signed Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the EU relaxes the rules o f origin
that allows for single transformation rules to apply to manufacturing processes and provides
another opportunity for Lesotho to expand i t s product and market base to the EU.
10.     The process o f reforms i s made difficult by institutional and human capacity
limitations on the one hand and a challenging political environment on the other. The
relative political stability during the 2000s enabled Lesotho to proceed with important structural
transformations that had been delayed over the previous decade by political instability. This
instability was fed in part by declining employment opportunities for Basotho miners5 in South
African during the 1990's, and, in turn, by declining remittances to Lesotho b y migrant labor. The
economic transformation that came about at the beginning o f the millennium has expanded economic
opportunities in Lesotho, which in turn have helped sustain the politic21 stability. However, the last
National Assembly elections, held in February 2007, were hotly colitested and aggrieved parties
have periodically protested against the allocation o f seats in the National Assembly. Delays in
enacting some key legislation6 could be at least partially attributed to these political tensions.


  Only grants and loans are included in this estimate o f foreign aid. However, SACU transfers also include a
significant component that i s not attributable to the trade taxes that Lesotho would collect if there was no customs
union. This i s roughly estimated to be about 70 percent of the transfers and could be classified as aid.
5
  Basotho i s a Sotho-speakingethnic majority in Lesotho comprising 99 percent of the population.
6
  The legislation required to prepare a Statement o f Affairs for the public accounts for 1997-2001 was delayed
initially as more time was required to get a buy in from the opposition party that chairs the Public Accounts
Committee in Parliament.

                                                            CRISIS

11.     Economic performance in the period leading up to the global recession was good
overall, with real GDP growth averaging 4.5 percent per annum between 2006 and 2008.
This growth was achieved on the strength o f Lesotho's exports (garments and diamonds) and
large SACU transfers made possible by strong growth in South African imports in the midst o f a
booming global economy7. SACU revenues rose sharply from 25 percent o f GDP in 2004/05 to
about 40 percent o f GDP in 2006/07, falling somewhat to 37 percent o f GDP in 2008/09. The
current account recorded a surplus o f about 10 percent o f GDP in 2008 and gross official
reserves at over $900 million were almost double the level required to maintain the parity o f the
loti with the rand. However, the impact o f the global economic crisis now risks unraveling this
good progress. GDP growth i s expected to be only 1.4 percent in 2009, before recovering
moderately to 2.8 percent in 20 10.
12.     While the fiscal stance of GOL has been broadly prudent, expenditures shot up as a
result o f S A C U windfalls. G O L saved a fraction o f the S A C U "boom" by reducing public debt
and increasing its deposits at the Central Bank. However, increasingly large portions o f the
windfall SACU revenue were spent. As a result, government expenditures rose from 48 percent
o f GDP in 2004/05 to 52 percent o f GDP in 2007/08, in large part because o f higher
compensation o f employees and spending on goods and services.              The establishment o f a
Defined Contribution Pension Fund with an initial capital injection o f M600 million and the
establishment o f Block Farming scheme with a capital o f M200 million in 2008/09 contributed to
a sharp increase in overall spending to over 62 percent o f GDP in 2008/09. While a fiscal
surplus was achieved every year up to 2008109, the non-SACU primary deficit increased from 16
percent o f GDP in 2004/05 to 32 percent o f GDP in 2008/09, making Lesotho vulnerable to the
external shock to SACU revenues when the global financial crisis hit.
13.     The immediate impact of the crisis was felt through a decline in export demand f o r
                       S
textiles from the U market and a sharp decline in diamond production and prices. U          S
 clothing imports from Lesotho declined by an estimated 30 percent year-on-year in March 2009.
As a result, employment in the textile sector dropped by over 10,000 (from a peak o f 50,000
jobs) over the same period. The mining sector (accounting for 6.5 percent o f GDP) came to a
                                                                     S
 standstill in the last quarter o f 2008. While the demand from the U market remains weak, an
upsurge in mining production on account o f the resumption in diamond mining at the biggest
mine, and exports o f textiles and some non-traditional items to the South African market are
having a positive impact on the economy. Overall, the pace o f economic growth i s expected to
recover from 20 10 onwards.

  Large increase in SACU revenues resulted from a restructuringo f the SACU revenue sharing formula, as well as a
rapid growth in the South African economy. The "new" 2002 SACU Agreement came into effect on July 15,2004
leading to a revision o f the revenue sharing formula in favor o f the smaller SACU members.

    14.     The more significant impact o f the crisis which i s expected to last through the
    medium term i s through SACU revenues. The S A C U revenue p o o l i s shrinking, as the
    precipitous' decline in South African imports since the onset o f the crisis results in lower
    customs collections. Given the S A C U revenue sharing formula and the agreed disbursement
    principles, Lesotho's S A C U receipts in 2009/10 remain high at about 35 percent o f GDP9.
    However, SACU receipts are expected to decline t o about 14 percent o f G D P in 2010/11
    (paragraph 20). This steep decline in S A C U revenues i s expected to lead to sharp deteriorations
.   o f both the fiscal balance and the current account, w h i c h would move f r o m a surplus in 2008 to a
    widening deficit in the medium t e r m (Tables 2 and 3), potentially leading to unsustainable fiscal
    and external positions in the absence o f strong adjustment measures.
    15.    Recognizing the challenge posed by lower SACU revenues, the Government scaled
    back from its initially announced countercyclical and significantly expansionary budget f o r
    FY10. Reaffirming a broad-based program of structural reforms t o promote private sector
    investment and achieve broad-based growth, the budget set aside M600 m i l l i o n over two years
    (about 6 percent o f i t s budget) to support specific investments related to the provision o f water,
    roads, factory shells and communications to attract f i r m s to locate in Lesotho. Part o f the
    stimulus fund i s also being used to support the upgrading o f tourism infrastructure to take
    advantage o f the Soccer W o r l d cup being held in South Africa. These activities have led to the

creation o f many jobs in the construction sector alleviating some o f the hardships caused by j o b
losses in the textile sector. Significant allocations were also made to income- and employment-
generating projects, including the Integrated Watershed Management Project which provides
employment across all ten districts to rehabilitate severely eroded roads and through the District
Councils for local infrastructure projects. The Government also extended i t s key social safety
net program b y raising the value o f the O l d Age Pension from M200 to M 3 0 0 per month and
extending the pension scheme to civil servants aged 41 to 45, requiring a capital injection o f
M 5 0 0 m i l l i o n over t w o years. Government's contribution o f 11.2 percent will require annual
payments to be increased by M 3 2 m i l l i o n per annum" (an increase o f about 25 percent f r o m
2008/09).
16.     With the scaling back of both, recurrent and capital expenditures, a small deficit of
one percent of GDP i s projected for 2009/10. Spending on vulnerable groups and key priority
areas needed to achieve sustainable growth has been safeguarded. Even so, total expenditures
are budgeted to be 70 percent o f G D P in FY10, an 8 percentage point increase over the FY09
outcome, with most o f the increases coming in current expenditure categories which typically are
difficult to r o l l back. Notably, the budget for wages and salaries goes up b y 25 percent over the
previous year budget, increasing their share o f G D P to about 18 percent (among the highest in
Africa). Domestically financed capital spending has been rolled back from the initial budget o f
14 percent o f GDP to about 9 percent o f GDP, while the capital budget financed by the
Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and other donors has not been rolled back. Spending
o n goods and services has been cut as well, particularly o n defense and foreign affairs. The
Government has also imposed an across the board reduction in travel related expenditures.
While these measures help to keep the fiscal deficit manageable in 2009/10, sharp decline in
S A C U revenues require a much stronger response in the medium term.

 17.    Lesotho faces significant challenges in the medium-term stemming from the
uncertain global environment in general and from lower SACU revenues in particular.
Real G D P growth i s projected to be only about 1.4 percent in 2009 o n account o f a sharp decline
in the manufacturing sector, particularly textiles, which i s expected to decrease by about t e n
percent. As the global economy recovers, Lesotho's economic growth i s also expected to
recover modestly to about 3 percent in 2010 and 2011. The outlook for SACU revenues i s
largely dependent on South Africa's economic recovery, which i s projected to be lackadaisical in
the next f e w years. A steep decline in S A C U revenues i s projected in 2010/11 and 201 1/12
resulting in the deterioration o f both the external and fiscal positions. S A C U revenues are
expected to revert to their historical pre-boom level o f about 20 percent f r o m 2013/14 (see Table
3).

18.      Growth will be driven by moderate growth o f the garment industry through roduct and
market diversification, a significant growth in the non garment manufacturing sector PI (although
f r o m a small base), a pick-up in construction driven by public investment to support private
sector growthI2, and resumption in mining. A surge in mining and construction activity i s
expected in 2012 as a n e w diamond mine comes o n stream and the key works for the second
phase o f the Lesotho Highlands Project13 are undertaken. As a result, G D P i s projected to grow
by about 6 percent in 2012. However, there i s a risk o f delays in implementing the Highlands
project arising if financing cannot be mobilized. G D P growth in that case i s projected to be
about 4 percent in 2012.
19.    The signing and final ratification o f the interim (goods only) E P A with the EU in June

regional trade under both S A C U and S A D C and, in particular, i t s close l i n k s with the largest
market in the region - South Africa also provide significant prospects for export growth and
diversification in Lesotho.
20.     South Africa's economic recovery will continue to play a major role, with the most
direct linkage being SACU revenues. Decline in S A C U revenues i s expected to continue in the
next few years and the rebound in the outer years will depend o n the speed w i t h which the South
African economy recovers. The most recent economic analysis o f the South African economy
projects a recession for 2009, w i t h growth returning to positive territory thereafter. W h i l e
Lesotho's relative share in each component o f the S A C U revenue sharing formula i s expected to
remain constant until 2011/1214, net S A C U transfer^'^ to Lesotho will decline by about 50
percent between 2009/10 and 2011/12. As a share o f GDP, SACU revenues are projected t o
decline f r o m 37 percent o f GDP in 2008/09 to around 15 percent o f GDP up to 2012/13.
Revenues are expected to recover to about 20 percent o f GDP from 2013/14 onwards (See Table
3).
21.           The drop in SACU revenues in the medium term will lead to a widening fiscal deficit
beyond 2009/10. In the absence o f any major policy shifts on the fiscal side, a fiscal deficit o f
about 22 percent o f GDP i s projected for 2010/11 16, declining somewhat to 18 percent o f G D P in
201 1/12. While the buildup o f government deposits at the Central Bank, estimated at over M 4
b i l l i o n (about US$500 m i l l i o n at the current exchange rate), largely saved out o f the S A C U
revenue windfalls in the past few years will provide a cushion in the short term, the fiscal
position will not be tenable in the medium term without significant adjustments o n the
expenditure front. Based o n our analysis, sustainable non-SACU primary balance should hover
around 20 percent o f GDPI7.
22.     As a result o f this very large unanticipated shock, Lesotho will need to embark on a
course o f strong fiscal consolidation. Therefore, designing and implementing a clear and
credible path toward achieving fiscal sustainability over the next five years i s critical. The
Government's medium term strategy comprises: (i)judicious balance between containing the
                                                     a
growth o f Government spending and financing measures to address emerging fiscal deficits; (ii)
improving tax administration to enhance collection o f non-SACU revenues, while improving the
compliance rate for VAT and income tax collections; and (iii)      increasing the efficiency o f
spending, in particular capital expenditures. On financing measures, Government i s seeking
bilateral support to repay the SACU obligations through soft loans", seeking further budget
support, and drawdown o f i t s deposits with the Central Bank o f Lesotho (CBL) in amounts
which do not jeopardize the CBL's international reserve position and i t s ability to maintain the
loti's peg to the rand. Other financing sources include some domestic borrowing in the f o r m o f
bond issuance.

   The shares for FY 2008/09 are 13.1 percent o f the total Customs Duty Pool, 0.54 percent on the 85 percent o f the
Excise Revenue Pool and 2 1.56 percent on the remaining 15 percent o f the Excise Revenue pool.
15
   Net SACU transfers include a repayment o f M750 million in 2010111 and M1.73 billion due in 201 1/12 on
account of overpayments in 2008109 and 2009/10. The repayment for 2009110 i s split between 201 1/12 and

23.     Fiscal consolidation on the expenditure side will be driven by cuts in both, recurrent
and capital expenditures" up to 2014/15. O n the recurrent side, these measures include:
containing the growth o f the wage bill by imposing a freeze o n new recruitment o f c i v i l servants,
and instituting n o general wage increase in 20 10111; rationalization o f foreign missions; and
reduction in non-priority recurrent expenditures including foreign travel and subsistence,
training, office furniture and Government fleet management. The wage bill i s expected to


  The cuts in capital expenditures will largely reflect cuts in the recurrent expenditures associated with the capital
projects. This distinction i s clear in the new 200 1 GFS format that the GOL i s beginning t o use.

decline from 18 percent o f GDP in 2009/10 to about 14 percent o f G D P in 2012/13, remaining
below the 2008/09 level o f 15.3 percent o f GDP. Cuts in expenditures o n goods and services are
the largest and will require careful management and corresponding increase in efficiency o f
expenditures to ensure delivery o f key public services. In this regard, strengthening o f public
finance institutions, including the introduction o f the Integrated Financial Management
Information Systems, the medium t e r m expenditure framework, outturn based budget (rather
than o n the basis o f previous year's budget), revision o f the Public Financial Management and
Accountability Act, as well as procurement reform provide a sound basis for improving the
effectiveness o f expenditures. The proposed PRSC supports reforms in all these areas. T o
improve the quality o f capital expenditures, the Government has revived the Project Appraisal
Committee (PAC). The P A C will review each new project for relevance, readiness and resource
availability before it i s included in the budget. These measures are expected to provide a saving
of about 5 percent o f G D P in 201 0/11 and about 8 percent o f G D P in 201 1/12.
24.     Following this adjustment path, the non-SACU primary deficit i s expected to reach
sustainable levels by 2013/14. The fiscal position i s projected to return to balance by 2014/15.
Reforms at the Lesotho Revenue Authority aimed at addressing loopholes in the collection o f
income taxes and value added tax have resulted in significant increases in tax revenue over the
past several years. Implementation o f further reforms being considered by the Government will
sustain this increase. Current initiatives t o increase government revenue20 t h a t have
recently been presented t o the committee of Permanent Secretaries include: (i)             raise the
value added tax rate on electricity, postal services and telecommunications f r o m 5 percent to 14
percent; (ii)evaluate with other S A C U countries, a potential increase in Excise taxes o n luxury
goods; (iii) computerization o f all systems which should reduce costs for the private sector;
control fraud more efficiently and improve the accuracy o f intra-SACU imports; and (iv) transfer
the responsibility to audit and collect all taxes should to LRA (property tax, taxes o n transfers o f
property, all levies o n fuel including the road levy, stamp taxes, estate tax). Overall, the non-
S A C U primary deficit i s projected to decline to about 20 percent o f GDP by 2014/15.
25.      Declining SACU revenues and falling garment exports will also worsen the current
account balance. While this decline will be countered somewhat by resumption o f mining
activity, threats remain to the external balance in the medium term. Strong competition from
                             S
Asian producers for the U textile market will lead to lower demand for Lesotho's textiles. The
long term viability o f the sector will require significant efforts to improve productivity and
diversify i t s products and markets. Given the need to maintain the loti's peg to the rand, there i s
little scope for external adjustment through the nominal exchange rate. The current account
balance i s expected to move from a surplus o f over 9 percent o f G D P in 2008 to a deficit o f 1.5
percent o f G D P in 2009. While capital inflows are expected to fully offset the current account
deficit and even build some reserves in 2009, the situation changes dramatically in 2010 and a
current account deficit o f about 20 percent o f GDP i s projected for 2010. About 40 percent o f
the deficit in the current account i s offset by capital transfers. Donor financing, and drawdown
o f reserves (which have reached over 1.1 billion U dollars at end 2009, well in excess o f
                                                          S
US$700 m i l l i o n required to maintain its parity with the rand) will finance the current account
deficit. The current account deficit recovers to about 7 percent o f G D P by 2013, largely o n
account o f some recovery in S A C U transfers, exports, and remittances.

 These are some o f the recommendations coming out o f the Policy Note on Fiscal Challenges and Options for
2o
Reform.

26.      Debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that Lesotho i s at moderate risk o f debt
distress over the medium term. The risk has increased relative to last year`s assessment,
reflecting large fiscal and external deficits expected through 20 12113. Debt ratios are expected
t o remain manageable over the medium t e r m as the fiscal position returns to balance. At end-
2008, the PV o f external debt stood at 33.2 percent o f GDP. Under the baseline scenario,
Lesotho's PV o f debt to GDP ratio i s projected to fall to 29 percent in 2009, reflecting the
appreciation o f the loti, and then increasing to 35 percent by 2012 as a result o f debt incurred to
finance the fiscal deficits. The P V o f debt-to-GDP ratio i s projected to rise further to 43 percent
by 2019, above the 40 percent indicative threshold2', although this i s almost entirely due to
borrowing related to the second phase o f the LHWP. The ratio i s expected to decline to
2 1 percent by 2029 as the fiscal position remains in balance. The P V o f debt relative to exports
and to revenues would also rise through 2019, but remain well below the indicative thresholds
for debt distress. There w o u l d also be a modest increase in the ratio o f debt service to exports
(from 4 to 5) and debt service to revenues (from 3 to 6) reflecting the increased stock o f
outstanding debt, but debt service w o u l d remain manageable due to the highly concessional
nature o f the existing debt. The highly concessional nature o f the existing debt and new
borrowing (with the exception o f the rescheduled S A C U payments and the borrowing for
L H W P ) helps to contain the increase in debt service ratios and contributes to their return to lower
levels as the impact o f the S A C U revenue shock begins to recede.
27.       The risk o f debt distress i s further magnified in the event o f adverse shocks to
economic growth o r large exchange rate depreciation. The k e y debt ratios are projected to
f a l l back below the indicative thresholds as the authorities move forward with the planned
adjustment o f expenditures and S A C U revenues recover. A large part o f the increase in debt
levels reflects the substantial increase in borrowing that would be required to finance the second
phase o f the L H W P . Assuming that the project does not go forward as planned, the PV o f debt
t o G D P ratio would initially increase to 35 percent by 2012, but would return below the
indicative threshold throughout the projection. In this scenario, Lesotho would continue to face
debt distress in the event o f a large nominal depreciation or deterioration in borrowing terms, but
the sensitivity to these shocks i s greatly diminished. These results underscore the need to realign
spending with i t s sustainable level based o n the long-run level o f S A C U revenues, and move
forward with structural reforms needed to boost productivity and competitiveness and accelerate
growth. Lesotho will also need to continue to receive grants and highly concessional loans.



                               111.      THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM


28.     The Government's program i s driven by the long term aspirations o f the Basotho, which
are articulated in the V i s i o n 2O2Oz2. The long-term vision i s that by the year 2020 "Lesotho shall
be a stable democracy, a united and prosperotu nation at peace with itselfand its neighbors. I t

" The applicable indicative thresholds for debt sustainability, proposed under the framework for low-income
countries are: (i) percent for the NPV o f debt-to-GDP ratio, (ii) 150 percent for NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio;
                 40
(iii)250 per-cent for the NPV o f debt-to-fiscal revenues ratio; (iv) 20 percent for the debt service to exports ratio;
and (v) 30 percent for the debt service to revenue ratio.
22 Vision 2020 was published in 2004.


                                                          11
shall have a healthy and well developed human resotme base, a strong economy, a well
managed environment and an established technological base". The key elements o f t h i s vision
were reflected in Lesotho's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) covering the period 2004105 -
2006/07.
29.     The GOL has adopted an Interim National Development Framework (INDF) to bridge
the period between the end o f the PRS and the adoption o f a comprehensive national
Development Plan in 2012. The INDF will guide planning and resource allocation, particularly
in light o f fiscal challenges resulting f r o m the global economic crisis and projected declines in
S A C U revenues. The overall objective o f the INDF i s to promote good government; improve
public services and accountability, and reduce poverty through: (i)           pursuing high, shared,
sustainable private sector led growth that generates employment; (ii)reducing social
vulnerabilities, including fighting the H I V / A I D S pandemic; and (iii)fostering good governance
to improve service delivery. The G O L has also prepared the PRGS w h i c h lays d o w n short and
medium t e r m approaches to achieve broad-based, sustainable growth as set out in Vision 2020.
The Growth Strategy identifies the expansion and diversification o f the manufacturing sector into
higher value added product lines and n e w markets as a key potential driver o f growth.
Continued expansion o f the mining sector, support for small, medium and micro enterprises
(SMMEs), greater emphasis o n tourism and agriculture are also identified as having great
potential for growth in Lesotho.
Growtk and Diversifcation
30.     The number one priority o f the Government i s to generate high, shared, private
sector led growth. This requires a large increase in the domestic production base, which
requires h i g h level o f investment from the private sector. While the global economic slowdown
could h o l d back some o f this needed investment, Government wants to keep i t s focus on the
medium to long term. In i t s role as an "enabler" o f private sector generated growth, Government
plans to focus o n undertaking structural and institutional reforms to enhance Lesotho's global
competitiveness and attractiveness for doing business and for being an investment destination o f
choice.
31.     Building on the lessons and successes o f the garment sector, Government i s
facilitating entry of other light manufacturing export-oriented activities and strengthening
the linkages o f the export-oriented sectors with the domestic economy. Lesotho has made
great strides and gained m u c h in t e r m s o f i t s success in t h e garment manufacturing industry
made possible by A G O A . This Agreement, while extended f r o m i t s original expiration o f
December 2004, will expire in 2015 and the provision o f sourcing fabric from third countries i s
scheduled to expire in 2012. The signing and final ratification o f the interim (goods only) E P A
with the EU in June 2009 allows for single transformation rules to be applied just as they are
applied under A G O A . This opens new opportunities for Lesotho to produce for the EU market.
There i s also the potential for increased regional trade under both S A C U and S A D C and in
particular, with South Africa.
32.     A crucial determinant o f Lesotho's ability to realize new export opportunities will be i t s
capacity to attract and sustain foreign investments, particularly f r o m new sources such as South
Africa, but also in new sectors. While i t i s clear that Lesotho has been actively trying to attract
FDI to develop export production in these areas, as well as to service new markets, such
investments (especially those from outside Asia) have not reached their potential. In particular,

                                                12
its success in attracting Taiwanese FDI for clothing export to the U has not been matched in
                                                                          S
other sectors (e.g., agribusiness) o r by other types o f investment (e.g., South African). Lesotho
therefore needs to increase i t s attractiveness as an investment destination and, to really succeed,
provide a better investment climate than South Africa, w h i c h i s facing i t s o w n challenges. This
means that those indicators o f competitiveness that rank relatively l o w in Lesotho should be
targeted for accelerated improvement if FDI i s to be attracted to promote export growth and
diversificationz3.
33.     Key elements o f the Government's program to create an enabling business environment
to attract private sector investment include:
           (i)One Stop Business Facilitation Center (OBFC), previously called the One Stop
              Shop (OSS). OBFC was established in September 2007 and i t brings under one r o o f
                the functions o f approval o f trading and manufacturing licenses, import and export
                issuances, residency visas and work permits. WMe the OBFC has facilitated the
                administrative process o f starting a business, outstanding challenges o f transfers of
                control f r o m other ministries effectively impede the OBFC's objective o f functioning
                as a single administrative unit.
           (ii)
              Provision o complementary physical infrastructure.
                         f                                                 Government recognizes that
                access to factory shells and supporting infrastructure must be facilitated. Most
                crucially, and to secure those foreign investments that are already waiting to happen
                in Lesotho by South African f i r m s , the Government must take immediate action to
                house these and provide the supporting infrastructure. This i s b y far the most serious
                constraint for n e w FDI in Lesotho. To overcome the current shortage in suitable
                industrial estates, Government has funded the provision o f advance infrastructure,
                including utilities and roads for Tikoe industrial estate. A proposal to build factory
                shells in this estate i s being considered to be financed f r o m the economic stimulus
                funds allocated in the budget. While these are the necessary immediate measures, the
                land l a w needs to b e changed to allow foreign investors to lease land directly and for
                longer periods. There i s also a need to reform land institutions, particularly the
                LNDC, to promote private sector development and/or management o f industrial
                estates.
           (iii)Creating legal and regulatory support services and institutions. Government
               recognizes that the Companies A c t o f 1969 and the Business Reporting and Industrial
               Licensing Bill are outdated and do not support a business friendly environment. The
               Companies A c t has been reviewed and the draft has been resubmittedto the Attorney-
               General for approval and issuance o f a clearance certificate. The process however
               has been unduly delayed. Further delay in enacting the Companies Bill will adversely
               affect Government's objectives to ease the burden o n business, as reflected in the
                D o i n g Business International ranking. In addition, the transfer o f the Companies
                Registry, which has been digitized and has the potential o f reducing the number o f
                days i t takes to register a company name f r o m 5 days to 1 day, to the OBFC may not
                take place until the Bill i s passed. This further highlights the urgency o f the legal
                process.



23   Lesotho i s currently ranked 130 out o f 183 countries in Doing Business.

                                                          13
       (iv) Investing in skills enhancement. Government i s paying special attention to skills
           development in the garment sector. With the support o f i t s Development Partners,
           t w o training centers (Northern Region Skills Center (NRSC) and the Maseru Skills
           Center) are registered with the Technical and Vocational Training Department,
           Ministry o f Education (TVD), fully staffed and operational. Based o n the training
           needs assessment carried out by both centers, training has been designed to respond to
           industry needs which reflected a need for a large number o f basic machinists. They
           have developed a formal training curriculum that has been submitted to the TVD for
           accreditation. Together the centers have trained 3 7 9 workers to date. Furthermore,
           with the support o f the W o r l d Bank, analytical work i s being developed w i t h regards
           t o the contribution o f the education sector to the development s k i l l s in line with the
           economic demands and the characteristics o f the Lesotho labor market. Such work i s
           expected to lead to policy reform in post-basic education.
34.     Government's growth strategy also focuses on agricultural development. As i t
stands today, the public sector dominates Lesotho's agricultural sector. I t provides the strategic
direction for agriculture; dominates with respect to choosing appropriate technologies; provides
almost all o f the capital used in the sector; and assumes most o f the risk associated with sector
performance. The participation o f the private sector i s only marginal. A fundamental dichotomy
persists in government policy between assuring food security and diversifying agricultural
production. So far, this dichotomy has been resolved de facto in favor o f food security which
has translated into the continued provision o f agricultural extension and other services, designed
to help farmers do more o f what they have traditionally done - subsistence agriculture (largely
maize). M o v i n g forward, Government plans to f o l l o w the two tracks in parallel. Subsistence
farmers need ,to be assisted in discovering paths for diversifying their livelihoods beyond
traditional farming.
35.      Advancing commercial agriculture in Lesotho will involve the creation o f market
linkages - between poorer rural areas and better o f f urban areas within the country, as well as
between the Lesotho agricultural economy and the better o f f South African economy. In his
Budget Speech to Parliament in February 2009, the Minister o f Finance noted the need for
programs w h i c h support commercialization and diversification in both the crops and livestock
sectors and that facilitate the development o f agro-industries. In order to attract agribusiness
investors, the Government needs to provide a supportive business environment which assures
contract enforcement, consolidation o f arable land into economic lots for farming and which
facilitates the development o f supply chain linkages between farm level organizations and niche
markets. The Government also needs to reform existing regulatory structures which limit
competition and which lock in traditional business models, modes o f competition and inefficient
forms o f supply chain operation. A National Forum o n agriculture i s planned to be held in the
early part o f 20 10 to review o f the status o f the agriculture sector and to chart a way forward.
36.      The Government recognizes that good quality and timely statistical data are prerequisites
to inform policy and for monitoring progress towards the goals set out in the results-based
development agenda; including the Poverty Reduction Strategy Budget framework papers, the
National Development Plan and the Millennium Development Goals. The Lesotho Bureau o f
Statistics (BoS) i s spearheading the process to improve the National Statistical System (NSS)
and i s preparing a National Strategy for the Development o f Statistics (NSDS). This first phase
o f the process culminated in August 2008 with the draft NSDS (2008/9-2012113) that covers 10

                                                14
key MDAs in the N S S . This draft outlines the current situation o f the N S in terms o f
                                                                                      S
operational strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats, data demands and gaps, and
capacities in statistical data production. This draft provides a good framework u p o n which to
build a result-oriented action plan to generate statistics that meet the critical information needs of
the Government. While achieving these goals will require a concerted effort by all key MDAs in
t h e NSS, the B o S recently started implementing substantive programs to improve the quality,
timeiiness and dissemination o f survey-based statistical data.

Public Expenditure Management

37.     Another key priority of the Government i s fostering good governance to improve
public service delivery. The most important component o f this i s improving public expenditure
management. High levels of S A C U revenues have allowed the Governnient to play a substantial
role in the economy. And public expenditures have been steadily rising in the last f e w years
reaching over 60 percent o f G D P in 2007/08. Recognizing that future economic growth i s
unlikely to fully offset potential decline in SACU revenues, Government i s committed to plan for
the eventuality that public spending has t o be rationalized to ensure macro stability. This
includes reducing fLiture expenditures and improving the efficiency and effectiveness o f
expenditures.
38.    Government has embarked on a comprehensive and ambitious Public Sector
Improvement and Reform Program (PSIRP) in order to increase the impact o f these
expenditures. PSIRP has the following k e y components: (i)    Public Expenditure and Financial
Management Reform: to improve planning, budgeting, accounting and accountability in the
                   Decentralization: to bring service provision closer to end users; and (iii) i v i l
Public Service; (ii)                                                                         C
Service Reform: to improve public service delivery.
39.             The Public Expenditure and Financial Management Reform program covers all stages o f
the budget cycle f r o m budget formulation to legislative scrutiny and audit. Significant progress
has been made in implementing these reforms. Budget Framework papers have been developed
by all line ministries and steady progress i s being made with the piloting and introduction o f a
MTEF linked t o the PRGS. The MTEF approach to budgeting marks a significant shift away
from earlier budget preparation and implementation processes. New procedures and forms have
been developed, and the budget classification system has been expanded to accommodate new
information about programs, objectives, outputs and activities. Several hundred ofiicials from all
m i n i s t r i e s have also been trained in the n e w approach. S i x ministries have been used to pilot
different stages o f the MTEF implementation. As at 3 1 M a r c h 2009, all line ministries: have
been trained in the key concepts and processes that comprise the MTEF approach; prepare their
budgets using a three year rolling forward estimates approach; prepare annual Budget
Framework Papers containing details o f their vision, mission, objectives, cost centers, programs,
outputs, activities, program and project performance, and proposed additional funding
requirements. Further, a consolidated National Budget Framework has been prepared for
Cabinet summarizing the competing priorities and bids o f the various ministries. This i s used by
the Ministry o f Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) and Cabinet to decide o n budget
ceilings for each ministry.
40.   Lesotho's fiduciary framework and public expenditure management are severely
hampered by weaknesses in i t s financial reporting. An Accounting and Reporting Task Force

                                                  15
aims to develop effective budget execution and reporting systems through amongst other things:
(i) replacement o f the existing Government o f Lesotho Financial Information System (referred to
as GOLFIS) by a new IFMIS, which became operational o n 1 April; (ii)      resolving the issue o f
incomplete balances information, due to the absence o f financial statements for the five years
1996/97 to 2000/01; (iii)   increasing training in accounting, IFMIS and internal control issues,
including raising the competence o f financial controllers and the awareness o f chief accounting
officers; (iv) establishing a new treasury organization within M F D P to undertake the n e w
accounting and cash management processes proposed under the IFMIS; (v) developing the
internal audit system into a hybrid arrangement under which internal auditors will report to the
top management o f the ministry in which they are located, as well as t o MFDP; and (vi) reforms
to the public procurement system based o n standardized procurement documentation and
streamlining procurement systems. Improved reporting facilities and control features in the
IFMIS should facilitate both timely and better quality reports. The Statement o f Affairs (dealing
with the impact o f the period 1996 to 2001 for which n o accounts are available) has been
prepared and submitted to Parliament. This affects the opening balances to be recorded in the
IFMIS.
41.     IFMIS went live o n April 1, 2009. All ministries n o w prepare their MTEF budgets using
the budget module o f the IFMIS, using the new chart o f accounts, and using the new budget
classification system. However, implementation problems arose. The key issues relate to:- (i)
staff (1400 direct users) inadequately prepared for the use o f the system and the impact that it
would have o n financial processing; (ii) user profiles not being correct, resulting in inability in
some cases to perform transactions; (iii)  problems to interface the payroll data into the IFMIS
and cheque payments not being possible until affected personnel were created as "vendors" in the
system, resulting in delayed and manual salary payments outside o f the system; (iv) some
supplier data not registered in the system, resulting in inability to effect payments to such
suppliers; (v) budgets for cost centers not loaded or incorrectly loaded, resulting in inability to
process payments for such cost centers; and (vi) bank reconciliation interfaces not yet activated.
A help desk and issues l o g i s in operation and corrective actions are being taken. Improved
control and benefits o f the system are realized and collective support for corrective action has
been secured24. About 18,000 transactions have already been processed using the IFMIS.
42.     A Public Finance Management (PFM) Bill has been draft. Donors have supported the
purchase, set-up, user training and go-live o n April 1, 2009 o f a central IMFIS, using EPICOR
software. Furthermore, Public Accounts for 2005 and 2006 have been audited and Submitted to
Parliament. Public accounts for 2007 have been submitted for auditing. Nevertheless,
significant delays in getting the P F M Bill enacted are a cause for concern.

Improving Access to Basic Services and Tackling the HIVIAIDS Paizdemic

43.    Government i s committed to maintaining and strengthening its interventions which
seek to directly improve the quality of life o f the Basotho. Getting services to the general
population, m u c h less to the poor, remains a challenge for the Government. I t aims to address
the quality and efficiency o f service delivery, and the targeting o f services to the most vulnerable
sections o f society.
44.      Health. Health i s a key pillar o f the Vision 2020. Vision 2020 outlines h o w Lesotho
should become "a healthy nation w i t h a well developed human resource base". There are t w o
core issues in the health sector - access and quality. The share o f the health budget over the
total Government budget has increased steadily f r o m 5.8 percent in 2000 to over 13 percent in
2008. However, the poor and rural areas have suffered worse health outcomes and benefited less
f r o m essential health services. M a n y Basotho, especially those in rural areas, are unable to
access health services. These problems o f access and quality explain why most o f the health
outcome indicators are very poor; infant mortality per 1000 live births was 91 in 2006 and
maternal mortality per 100,000 l i v e births i s 762.
45.      The Government has identified three core reasons that have caused these l o w and
deteriorating outcomes: (i)  brain drain o f skilled health workers overseas. Despite recent major
recruitments, about 18 percent o f the established posts continue to be unfilled (including 20-25
vacancies for doctors); (ii)  HIV and AIDS, which not only directly affects the health o f people,
but also robs the health service o f key workers and increases the strain o n existing healthcare
facilities; and (iii)high unit costs o f providing social services due to the topography o f Lesotho.
Several k e y development partners (including the Bank) are j o i n t l y supporting a long-term health
sector reform l e d by the Ministry o f Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) in order to achieve a
sustainable increase in access to quality preventive, curative and rehabilitative health care
services in Lesotho. The support i s organized through a Sector-wide approach (SWAP), with an
agreed sector expenditure framework, harmonized fiduciary systems, and common performance
indicators,
46.     In i t s efforts to improve health services, Government has successfully completed the
tender o f a n e w referral hospital to replace the Queen Elizabeth 2 hospital in Maseru. The
proposed hospital i s based o n the principles o f Public Private Partnership (PPP). The new 390
bed public hospital will be designed, built and fully operated (including clinical services) by the
private operator for 18 years. The Government has allocated M 4 0 0 m i l l i o n for the 2008/09 and
2009/10 budget. The private sector under the leadership o f Netcare will provide additional
M 6 0 0 million. The Global Partnership o n Output-Based Aid has provided a performance-based
grant o f US$6.25 m i l l i o n to support service delivery t o the poor under this project. Three filter
clinics will also be constructed at Likotsi, Mabote and Qoaling. The project's innovative PPP
structure and the use o f an output-based financing instrument enable Government to maximize
the quality and quantity o f health services while remaining within the budget, while the private
sector has been presented with a new and robust market opportunity. Most importantly, this also
means that patients will have access to significantly better medical services without increasing
the minimal charge they pay for public services today.
47.    HIV/AIDS. A k e y challenge facing the Government i s dealing w i t h the H I V / A I D S
pandemic, w h i c h has the potential o f reversing past progress o n human development and which
continues to threaten the productive sectors o f the economy. Lesotho has shown strong

                                                 17
commitment to fighting HIV. A National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan (2006-201 1) (NSP) and
a corresponding HIV and AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (2006-201 1) were
approved in December 2006. The N S P focuses o n achieving four main strategic objectives: (a)
strengthening management and coordination mechanisms; (b) preventing transmission o f HIV;
(c) treatment and care; and (d) mitigating the impact o f the epidemic in the population. in
addition, Lesotho expressed openness to w o r k with vulnerable groups in HIV and AIDS
prevention and control.
48.     The coverage o f several key H I V and AIDS interventions has improved. The strong
political commitment and increasing social mobilization plus increasing internal and external
funding have contributed to improvement in several key HIV and AIDS related interventions in
recent years. The coverage o f Prevention o f Mother to C h i l d Transmission (PMTCT) increased
fivefold from 15 percent in 2006 to 56 percent in 2008. The r o l l out o f Antiretroviral Therapy
(ART) made significant progress, 52 percent o f patients needing ARVs received treatment in
September 2009. The "Know Your Status" (KYS) campaign resulted in a total o f 229,092 people
being tested for HIV by December 2007, representing 12 percent o f the population and about
three times the number tested in 2005. Lesotho has maintained a TB case detection rate above 80
percent for the past 3 years, and currently has a treatment success rate o f 73 percent.
49.     Education. The education sector has gone through a process o f reform mainly at the level
o f basic education, which led to substantial gains being achieved in education in recent years,
and the Millennium Development Goals for universal primary education and gender parity are
within reach. The Government introduced free primary education (FPE) o n a phased basis from
2000, bringing the net enrollment rate f r o m 60 percent (1999) to 82 percent (2008). Good
progress has been made in laying the foundations for improved quality, and the Government i s
very m u c h committed in sustaining the gains already obtained in education and in working
towards improving the quality o f the services provided. W i t h the introduction o f FPE, the
system went through a period o f instability, characterized by overcrowded facilities and decline
in quality indicators such as the cohort survival rate. Such a result in not unusual in process o f
expansion o f education systems, where all children, regardless o f age suddenly attends school.
50.    The primary school cohort survival rate in Lesotho decreased f r o m 53 percent to 39
percent f r o m 2005 to 2006. i t has however, regained pace and in 2008, it was already 50
percent, and it i s expected to continue increasing given government interventions in quality. For
the past eight years the government has been investing in improving the quality o f infrastructure,
the quality o f education inputs through the distribution o f textbooks and other materials, and
qualifying teachers. Furthermore, with the support o f the education local donor group, the
government has prepared, and approved in parliament the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2005-
20 12, which lays the policy foundations for the development o f education and the achievement
o f the education MDGs. The Plan i s under implementation, and again with the support o f the
local education donor group, a revised version o f the Plan for the years 2009-20 12 was prepared.
B e l o w i s a summary o f some o f the results o f Plan implementation, which has been taken place
with government fLinds and w i t h the external support o f the W o r l d Bank, Irish Aid, and the EFA
Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund.
5 1.   Access and vetention: Enrollment stabilized in 2008, as t h e expansion wave has already
passed through the system. The gross and net enrolment and rates for primary education in 2008
were respectively 118 percent and 82 percent. Access in pre-primary education, although s t i l l


                                                18
very low, has also increased and the gross enrolment rate for this sub-sector moved from 8
percent to 13 percent. The completion rate i s high, 93 percent.
52.     Qzialitv: In spite o f s t i l l being high, pupil qualified teacher ratio decrease f r o m 69 in
2005 to 61 in 2008. The implementation o f a teacher training distance education program was an
important element for such decrease. M o r e progress i s expected with the completion o f a second
campus o f the Lesotho Teacher College o f Education, which was financed by funds f r o m the FTI
Catalytic Fund. Investment in the quality o f physical infrastructure and school and learning
materials and textbooks was also significant. As mentioned above, the cohort survival rate has
also increased and reached 50 percent.
53.    PoZicy P form: Curricular reform aimed at focusing the primary education curricula o n
basic skills was initiated. Emphasis will be given to issues o f numeracy and literacy from an
early age. Reform on teacher career, salary, and incentives was also initiated. This aims at
introducing performance based career progression and at attracting qualified teachers to the most
remote and difficult to access areas o f the country.
54.     Post-Basic Edzication: Lesotho does not have many donors involved in education and
until 2005 it was considered a donor orphan country. M o s t o f the support provided to education
targets the basic education sub-sector. Reform in post-basic education i s necessar) and desired
b y the Government and the donors, but little progress has been done so far. There has been a
traditional resistance to change in this education sub-sector. This has important negative
consequences which the government needs to address. O n the one hand, post-basic education
should develop in l i n e with the skills needed t o promote sustainable growth. On the other, a
revision o f financing o f the sub-sector i s urgently needed, as the current bursaries scheme, which
targets higher education students, constitutes a key line o f expenditure, w h i c h results have so far
not justified the costs.
55.     These programs and priorities are reflected in the Government's PAF. Consensus
o n the main areas to be included in the P A F and the nature o f indicators to be included in the
framework were reached during the initial discussions at the outset o f the PRSC program. A
combination o f process and outcome indicators has been identified in the PAF. The P A F defines
and elaborates the m a i n objectives and a number o f indicators o f progress in the areas of: (i)
Economic Growth and Macroeconomic Performance; (ii)Governance and PFM; (iii)               Human
Development; and (iv) Capacity Development.


             IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                     A.      LINKS THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCE
                                 TO                     STRATEGY

56.    The proposed PRSC series i s an integral part o f the Bank's assistance to Lesotho as
outlined in the CAS. The current C A S was approved in April 2006 and covers a four year period
(FY06-09). A n e w C A S (FY10-14) i s under preparation. The FY10-14 CAS seeks to support
Lesotho's efforts o sustaining growth i n the face o global crisis and addressing the critical
                   f                                  f
human development cliallenges. T o help achieve these objectives, GOL and the Bank have
agreed that the C A S would focus o n three areas o f engagement that are f u l l y aligned with the
country's Interim National Development Framework: (i)       undertaking fiscal adjustment and
strengthening public finance mnnagement; (ii)    improving efficiency and equality i n access to

                                                 19
basic services; and (iii) Strengthening the competitiveness o the economy and benefitting from
                                                             f
its proximity to Soritlz Africa.
57.      Capacity development and regional integration are the cross-cutting themes that will
become an intrinsic part o f the Bank's program in Lesotho and will reinforce the C A S
development impact. In this regard, the C A S foresees strengthening budget support as an
instrument to provide additional fiscal space and help pursue an ambitious reform agenda. As
envisaged in the CAS, the PRSC will support reforms aimed at: (i)    economic diversification and
enhanced competitiveness; (ii)  strengthening the institutions o f public sector accountability and
governance; and (iii)    human development and improved service delivery, including addressing
the H I V / A I D S pandemic.

58.      The B a n k has a relatively small portfolio in Lesotho w i t h an IDA allocation o f about
US$24 m i l l i o n per year in the IDA 15 period. The PRSC will complement several o f the current
investment projects in Lesotho. These include the following: Private Sector Competitiveness
and Economic Diversification (PSCED) Project, Integrated Transport Project, and Water Sector
Improvement Project - all geared towards creating an enabling environment for broad-based
growth and improving infrastructure and access to basic services. It also complements ongoing
projects in the Health, Education, and HIV/AIDS geared towards improving access and quality
o f services in these sectors. The PRSC i s also linked to the second phase o f the Water Sector
Improvement Project (WSIP) (FY09) which will support long-term solution to water supply for
the capital city and surrounding lowland areas through the construction o f the Metolong dam.
This i s essential to avoid critical shortages in domestic supplies and provide water required for
continued industrial expansion, particularly in the textile industry.

                            COORDINATION                     DONORS

59.    Maintenance o f sound macroeconomic management will be a precondition for
implementation o f the PRSC. While there i s n o Fund program in Lesotho, Bank coordination
with the IMF i s strong and the Bank team participated in the review during the Fund Article I V
mission in November 2009. A joint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) has also been prepared
within the framework for l o w income countries. The staffs will continue this collaboration
throughout the PRSC period and discuss areas o f common interest to be included in the PRSC
program.
60.        The PRSC i s being prepared within the j o i n t framework o f budget support developed
under the leadership o f the Government o f Lesotho (GOL) with five participating development
partners, including IDA. The other development partners are the European Commission, United
K i n g d o m (DFID), African Development Bank (AfDB) and Ireland. As a result o f the impact o f
the global financial crisis o n Ireland, budget support financing f r o m Ireland will not be
forthcoming in t h e near future. However, they have stated their commitment to the principles o f
budget support and will continue to be actively engaged in the discussions. Gennany (KfW and
GTZ) while not providing direct budget support at present have been active participants in this
process.


                                              20
61.     In M a y 2006, development partners established the guiding principles o f a possible future
budget support program. I t was agreed that a nationally-owned PRS and an associated common
performance assessment framework would provide the basis for prospective budget support. I t
was also recognized that the program should align around the budget timetable and MTEF
process and should be mindful o f the need t o ensure predictability in disbursements. The
program should also aim for a judicious balance betLYeen realism and ambition in the overall
results indicators that would set the basis for these disbursements. The Government welcomed
this approach, noting the importance o f budget support in securing the s t i l l fragile reform agenda
whilst cautioning against the use o f unrealistic results indicators.
62.    The donors are collaborating to support Lesotho in implementing i t s development
programs by providing financial and technical support in a coordinated manner. Annual joint
reviews are planned and the second review was conducted in November 2009.


                                     D.          LEARNED
                                            LESSONS

 63.      Preparation o f PRSC 2 has benefitted f r o m lessons learnt f r o m the First PRSC approved
 in M a y 2008. The design o f the operation i s also guided by the overall advice o n D P L s provided
by OPCS, including the good practices principles o n conditionality and also takes into account
 IDA'Soverall experience with regard to implementation o f projects in Lesotho. I t also takes into
 account the experience from the implementation o f the EU budget support operation in Lesotho.
 The first lesson concerns selectivity and flexibility, focusing on reform areas that will have a
 significant impact when completed. The second relates to a broader ownership o f the reform
 program by the Government - all stakeholder l i n e ministries should o w n the program and not
just the MFPD. Other lessons include:
0       The program should be realistic as to what can be achieved, mindful o f capacity
        constraints.
0       I t should have limited conditionalities/milestones and indicators that are monitorable.
0       Where necessary, supporting operations should be in place to provide technical assistance
        and build capacity for reforms.


                               E.      ANALYTICAL
                                                UNDERPINNINGS


64.    The preparation o f the PRSC program has been informed by several analytical studies
and reviews. These studies and reviews were outlined in detail in the program document for
PRSC-1. Since the PRSC-1 program document was prepared, the Poverty, Gender and Social
Assessment has been completed. A set o f Policy Notes in key areas identified by the Government
aimed at strengthening the overall dialogue and providing analytical inputs into the government's
growth strategy and the National Development Plan have been prepared. These were presenred
to Lesotho's Cabinet in July 2009 and are being discussed further with the Government. Initial
findings fully support the focus and content o f the program.
65.    The series o f Policy Notes examine: (i)  Fiscal challenges in Lesotho and options for
reform; (ii)
           Realizing the potential o f FDI to diversify Lesotho's exports; (iii)Agriculture -
Challenges and directions for agri-business; (iv) Growth potential o f mining sector; and (v)

                                                21
Effectively using available public resources, particularly for capital expenditures. The Fiscal
Cltallenges note looks at t w o fiscal issues relevant for Lesotho: (i)    developing a sustainable
fiscal framework accounting for the vulnerability in S A C U revenues; and (ii)      enhancing non-
S A C U revenues to mitigate the impact o f declining S A C U revenues. Based o n the long-term
evolution o f fiscal variables, and under varying scenarios o f sustainable S A C U revenues, i t i s
found that fiscal policy in Lesotho has been somewhat expansionary and i t i s likely to remain so.
While there i s some scope for increasing grants, given Lesotho`s unique characteristics*', a
future sizeable reduction in S A C U revenues will be difficult to offset by increasing tax and non-
tax revenues. The significant decline in S A C U revenue foreseen over the next t w o years and
uncertainty over the future evolution o f S A C U revenues reinforces the need for a prudent fiscal
policy.
66.      Lesotho has done very w e l l in attracting FDI for export led growth. But external
conditions that have driven Lesotho's trade boom are disappearing. With a much lower export
                    S
demand from the U (its largest export destination), there i s a need to diversify i t s exports to take
better advantage o f i t s relatively l o w wage structure, the country's easy access to South African
physical infrastructure; i t s attractive position in the regional market by virtue o f i t s membership
in S A C U and SADC; and new opportunities presented under the interim Economic Partnership
Agreement with the EU. The policy note o n realizing Lesotho's export potential addresses the
policy and structural constraints that must be overcome to attract FDI. This includes improving
the investment climate by reducing the costs o f doing business and making Lesotho competitive
vis-a-vis South Africa and providing factory shells and supporting infrastructure. B o t h these
elements are an integral part o f the PRSC series. The PRSC program will draw o n the findings
from the other policy notes as the series progresses.
67.     The Country Integrated Poverty, Social and Gender Assessment focuses o n three m a i n
areas: livelihood patterns among Lesotho's households and h o w these correlate with opportunity
and exclusion; h o w the government could make access to public services and overall social
development more equitable; and h o w the economic and social vulnerabilities o f households,
including H I V / A I D S , could be alleviated in order to reduce poverty. Analysis in this report
concludes that i t i s possible for Lesotho to reduce poverty and to continue i t s transition to an
economically diverse middle-income country by undertaking three key strategies: continuing to
develop the investment climate for labor-intensive production; implementing programs to
support commercial agriculture and reduce land degradation in rural areas; and developing a
strategy to support socioeconomic and geographic mobility o f workers into higher-productivity
sectors. Public funds should be better targeted towards assisting the poor to build human capital
and manage risks. Other recommendations to improve the plight o f the people o f Lesotho
include creating a more equitable and inclusive society, especially for women, and developing a
more effective campaign against H I V / A i d s . The PRSC i s aligned with the key findings and
recommendations.




l 5 As a small country fully surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho has a lot o f trade with South Africa and border
trade i s more important than in countries o f larger size. Variances in tariffs for imports and excises would provide
opportunities for round tripping o f exports and smuggling. The same logic applies for consumption taxes. Given its
geographic characteristics, Lesotho has lower degrees o f freedom than most countries to vary its tax rates. This also
puts some limits on the income tax rate and income tax base. Different rates with South Africa would encourage
firms either to incorporate in the other country or to use transfer pricing.

68.     The PRSC program aims to contribute to the Government's medium-term development
objectives as set out in the IYDF and the SuppOrtii:Q Growth Strategy. While Lesotho has
achieved respectable growth rates in the last few years, poverty remains widespread and
unemployment levels are high. The situation has bee: further impacted by the global financial
crisis as mentioned earlier. SACU revenues will sharply decline over the next 2-3 years. The
Government's program i s aimed at addressing medium to long t e r m issues to achieve sustained
and shared growth. Significant progress has been made by the Government in implementing i t s
reform program as identified in the PAF. Table 4 presents the progress to date. I t also includes
the triggers for PRSC-2 as they were identified at PRSC-1 stage and also the prior actions
identified for PRSC-2. The differences, if any, are explained in the comments column and are a
result o f intensive consultations during the review period.

Component 1: Creating a Conducive Environment for Private Sector Led Growth

69.     Despite the setbacks arising f r o m the global financial crisis, Lesotho i s keeping i t s focus
o n the medium and long term. As highlighted in the Budget Speech to Parliament for the
2009/10 fiscal year, the Government has identified the launch o f a coordinated program o f
structural reforms aimed at removing barriers to doing business in Lesotho and creating a
conducive and competitive investment climate as the first element o f i t s 1O-pronged action plan
to respond to the global crisis.
Macroeconomic Stability

70.      A stable macroeconomic environment i s necessary for sustained economic growth.
Lesotho's membership in the C M A allows it l i t t l e oversight o n matters regarding monetary
policy. Therefore, the Government's m a i n instrument in sustaining a healthy macroeconomic
environment i s i t s fiscal policy. As mentioned earlier, the GOL has done a good j o b in creating a
healthy fiscal balance so far. However, in light o f the steep decline in S A C U revenues foreseen
in the next two to three years and a permanent decline in the medium to long term reiterate the
need for prudent fiscal policies to maintain macroeconomic stability. The expansionary Budget
presented for 2009/10 raised concerns about fiscal sustainability. Even though a revised budget
was drawn up, weaknesses in the communication mechanism resulted in failure to implement the
revised budget. Therefore, GOL reverted back to the budget ceilings approved by Cabinet in
December 2008. With the adoption o f these revised budget ceilings and a review o f the wage
bill, a small deficit o f about 1 percent o f G D P i s envisaged for 2009/10. While the legal rules in
Lesotho do not require this revised budget (lower than what was appropriated by Parliament) to
be approved by Parliament, MFDP has expressed i t s intent to provide this revised budget to i t s
Parliament for information. Adoption o f a macroeconomic framework reflecting ceilings
approved b y Cabinet, ensuring that the fiscal deficit does not exceed 3 percent o f GDP i s a prior
action for PRSC-2. Adoption o f a sustainable macroeconomic framework with agreed ceilings
o n non-SACU deficit and the wage bill i s a trigger for PRSC-3.

Cabinet, w i t h the fiscal deficit not exceeding 3 percent o f GDP.

Improving the Business Environment
71.     The private sector i s the key in delivering jobs and investment necessary to realize and
sustain Lesotho's poverty reduction goals in the long term. For this, Lesotho needs to create a
better investment climate to achieve this growth and to reverse its worsening performance vis-a-
vis its competitors for jobs, trade and investment. Lesotho i s currently ranked 130 out o f 183
countries for ease o f doing business.26 There i s a worsening o f i t s position relative to other
countries despite some progress being made to simplify procedures, reflecting the need to pick
up the pace o f reforms.

72.     The OBFC has undergone a process o f reform. This involved folding the two distinct
processes o f Trade and Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA) into a single process. Export process
have been redesigned to eliminate unnecessary steps. Exporters no longer need to: submit
applications for recommendation to the M T I C M , they are approved at the OBFC; apply for
rebate permits for each individual consignment, they n o w apply for rebates once a year
irrespective o f the number o f consignments; and fill out five different forms, they only complete
a universal data form. Import processes have been changed froin blanket permits o n all goods to
permits for only restricted goods27. Licensing administration has been changed to simplify the
fee structure (no application fee28) and reduce the number o f pages o n a f o r m to 1 page from 5
for traders and 16 for manufacturers.
73.     Sensitization and training o f private sector clients has been undertaken (information
sessions, public notices, publications etc.). New software has been developed to integrate
business licensing, export and import permits. improving information collection, automating
forms as w e l l as reducing processing time. Import permits average lead time f r o m application to
issuance i s 1.9 days d o w n f r o m 4 days and export visas average lead time from application to
issuance i s 5-6 hours down f r o m 2-3 days. Since M a y 2009, the O B F C has been issuing
residence permits for the manufacturing sector. F o r the period July to September 2009, OBFC
issued o n average 15 new residence permits. In 2008, O B F C issued an average o f 59 work
permits per month and more than two-thirds o f these were issued to managers and supervisors. In
the year t o October 2009, O B F C issued 8,163 export visas (permits). In addition, during the
same period, it issued 114 manufacturing licenses, 245 small scale industry licenses and 3,350
trading enterprise licenses.
74.     While these achievements are positive and have reduced time and costs for businesses,
there are further opportunities to simplify the process with the adoption o f new legislation and
simplified procedures. The O B F C faces a number o f challenges in strengthening i t s capzcity and
effectiveness. These include: (i)the lack o f an organizational and management structure
including clearly established requirements for reporting, performance management, disciplinary
procedures and operating hours; (ii)  budget constraints and inconsistent employee remuneration
(salary differentials are often three to four fold between LRA and M T I C M employees); (iii)
timely recruitment o f a permanent Director as the Advisor's current contract expires in
December 2009 with the ending o f support under the DFID-funded Priority Support Program
(PSP); and (iv) ensuring continuity o f I T support services after December 2009. The OSS
Steering Committee has approved the appointment o f a Director for the OSS under the M T I C M
which i s a key step in strengthening the institutional capacity. However, the OSS Steering
Committee will not be fully effective without Cabinet level inter-ministerial support for the OSS.
There needs to be a clear policy statement f r o m GOL o n support for business environment
reform under the oversight o f a Cabinet Committee. This recommendation i s also consistent
with the findings o f the Economic Policy Notes.
75.     PRSC-1 recognized the establishment o f the OSS (now the OBFC) and included i t as a
prior action. The extension o f O B F C services to include rebate certificates, residence and w o r k
permits, and industrial licenses was an indicative trigger for PRSC-2. I t remains a prior action
for PRSC-2. The incorporation o f Companies' registration to the O B F C will be supported under


     However, the Dept o f Trade's preference i s to maintain the old system.
28
     This needs to be gazette before it comes into effect.

the PRSC-3. These reforms are expected to reduce the time taken to register a business f r o m 28
days to one day; reduce the time taken to issue export and import permits f r o m 7 days to one day,
and consolidate many procedures at the Trade and Investment Facilitation Centre (TIFC),
including incorporation o f Companies Registration and introduction o f streamlined licensing
procedures. Companies A c t has been o n the agenda for the past several years but has not come to
fruition. The long overdue enactment o f the Companies Bill i s a cause o f serious concern.
Without the enactment o f this legislation, companies' registration will not be incorporated in the
OBFC. Similarly, the draft business reporting and industrial licensing has gone through
numerous reviews but has not moved beyond the M T I C M .


PRSC -2 Prior Action: Extension o f One-Stop Shop services to include rebate certificates, w o r k
permits, residence permits and industrial licenses.

76.     Addressing the infrastructure constraint in parallel i s critical to facilitate the entry o f new
investment - foreign and domestic. Several international investors are currently waiting for
availability o f factory space to invest in garment and non-garment manufacturing. This
expansion has the potential o f employing over 4,000 people. Identification o f industrial
infrastructure sites and development o f new factory space were identified as indicative triggers
for PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 respectively.
77.         The L N D C has completed feasibility studies for t w o industrial sites (one o f which i s a
new site and the other i s an extension o f an existing industrial estate to accommodate more
investors). Government undertook a feasibility study o n the Maseru Industrial Estate Traffic
R e l i e f Road to provide easy and safe movement o f traffic in Maseru West Industrial Estate
during peak hours. I t also undertook a study o n the development o f vacant spaces at Maseru,
Nyenye and Maputsoe to assist LNDC to explore the possibility o f securing commercial
financing for the development o f factory buildings on the already serviced industrial estates.
Significant progress in the provision o f advance infrastructure has been made at the Tikoe
industrial estate. Seventeen sites have been provided with utilities and roads and one factory
shell has been completed. Construction o f Nyenye Fire Station (Leribe) funded by GOL has also
been completed. Construction o f the Metolong D a m which will provide water to industrial users,
amongst other things, has started. Border post infrastructure refurbishment has been completed at
the Maseru border post to facilitate trade o f goods across border.

PRSC -2 Prior Action: Identification and approval o f target sites and related investments to
enhance industrial infrastructure.

78.    The PRSC series i s committed to supporting the strengthening o f the statistical systems to
ensure that frequency and quality o f data improves to such levels that they can provide
meaningful information to policy makers. The National Monitoring and Evaluation System has
been set up to improve the collection, dissemination and use o f data across Lesotho. I t i s situated
in the Department o f Development Planning in M F D P . One o f the first activities has been to
compile an extensive database o f all development data produced in Lesotho. This i s called
"LesothoInfo", based on the DevInfo software o f UNDP. A subset o f this database has been
selected as "core national indicators: to best provide an overview o f the development situation in
Lesotho. In parallel, the Bureau o f Statistics (BOS) undertook a concerted effort to document


                                                 30
and disseminate existing household survey data (on which many o f the indicators are based) via
their website. The BOS has also taken important steps towards the development o f a National
Strategy for the Development o f Statistics (USDS) based o n the Paris 21 Principles. I t has
completed the inception report o n the design o f NSDS, conducted stakeholder consultations and
completed situation analysis in k e y line ministries. This was recognized as a prior action for
PRSC-1.
79.     Finalization o f N S D S was identified as a trigger for PRSC-2. A draft NSDS was
prepared, but completion was delayed due to capacity constraints imposed by the need to engage
staff in critical data collection and analysis activities (such as the 2006 Population Census and
Labor Force Survey) and the recognition that the final strategy must be accompanied by a result-
oriented action plan to generate statistics that meet the critical information needs o f the
Government. T w o priority actions to finalize and implement the NSDS include: (a) alignment o f
the NSDS production and dissemination calendar for censuses, surveys, recurrent statistics and
administrative data with the information needs outlined in the PAF, N M E S and the National
Development Plan; and (b) adoption o f a data dissemination strategy and calendar, including for
micro-data survey and census files. Recognizing these challenges, the Government has
requested, and the Bank has agreed to provide technical assistance t o finalize the N S D S
addressing the concerns identified above. With this agreement on the Bank's direct engagement
with the G O L in finalizing the NSDS, this trigger i s not turned into a prior action for the PRSC-
2. N S D S i s expected to be finalized by June 2010. The t w o priority actions to finalize and
implement to N S D S will be triggers for PRSC-3.

Component 2: Improving Public Expenditure Management and the Fiduciary Framework

80.     Government i s a key player in the economy, with public expenditures accounting for over
50 percent o f GDP. F o r various reasons, including political instability and lack o f manpower
and capacity, Lesotho has had a long history o f poor accountability and non-production o f
financial statements. Weaknesses in the management o f these resources have resulted in less
than favorable outcomes in terms o f reducing poverty and fostering growth. In order to increase
the impact o f these expenditures, the Government has embarked upon a comprehensive reform
prograin in 2005 covering all stages o f the budget cycle f r o m budget formulation to legislative
scrutiny and audit. In addition to significant professional training, GOL has introduced a
medium-term perspective in i t s budget formulation and f r o m 1'' April 2009 has introduced the
core components o f an I F M I S across all ministries and offices. The PRSC-2 will continue to
support the Government's reform in all aspects o f the budget cycle.
81.    An assessment o f P F M based o n the PFM Performance Measurement Framework (PMF)
has recently been conducted j o i n t l y by the Government and i t s key DPs and a draft report has
been prepared. The assessment notes that although longstanding weaknesses in budget
execution, the internal control framework and financial reporting identified in t h e previous
assessment continue, some progress i s clearly being made. The assessment also notes that there
are many built-in features o f the n e w system that are designed to address problems in the areas o f
expenditure commitments, authorization o f expenditure and reconciliation o f accounts29.
However, there appears to be some evidence that there i s need for a greater sense o f urgency

29The Assessment does not take into account the possible improvements that may be achieved as a result o f the
recent introduction o f the integrated financial management and information system.

                                                      31
particularly with regard to the legislative requirements o f the PFM reform process. The lengthy
delay in presenting the draft audit bill to parliament i s an example o f where a delay in
completing legal reforms impacts significantly on the overall reform process. Similarly, there
have been delays in the submission o f the Public Financial Management and Accountability
(PFMA) Bill, which i s required to support legally the new business processes, as well as the
approval o f the Internal Audit charter.

82.     Lesotho has focused i t s PFM reform w e l l o n the areas o f significant weakness and has
recorded good progress since PRSC-1. A key area o f further progress was the go-live with a
central IFMIS o n 1 April 2009. I t i s expected that the new IFMIS will further assist to improve
transparency, budget predictability and expenditure control, financial reporting and auditing.

Planning and Budgeting

83.    Lesotho has an orderly and participative budget process, involving spending agencies and
the political leadership in accordance w i t h a pre-determined budget calendar that i s broadly
adhered to. Cabinet discussion o f the budget has been enhanced by the establishment o f a
Cabinet Budget Sub-Committee, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and comprising the
Minister o f Finance and eight other ministers. The Budget sub-committee reviews the budget
submissions mid-January. The budget i s normally approved by the Legislature in a timely
manner.
84.     A multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting has been
deepened w i t h the adoption o f the MTEF. As an integral part o f MTEF development, a M e d i u m
Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) i s prepared annually. The annual preparation o f the' MTFF has
five main objectives: (i) prepare a realistic forecast o f the m a i n components o f revenue and
                           to
grants; (ii) make an accurate assessment o f statutory expenditure obligations; (iii)n the basis
            to                                                                            o
o f the current policy framework, to forecast the requirements for discretionary ministerial
expenditure; (iv) to use these forecasts o f revenue and expenditure to recommend a budget
balance and financing strategy which i s consistent w i t h the core objectives o f fiscal policy; and
(v) to set indicative ceilings showing the division o f future ministerial expenditure ceilings by
economic classification (wages and salaries; goods and services; transfers and subsidies; and
capital) .
85.     As part o f the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) process, individual
ministries also prepare Budget Framework Papers (BFP), setting out their visions, missions,
objectives, proposed revisions to their programme structure and proposed changes to their
pattern o f resource utilisation. Discussions o n the BFPs are held to highlight the Government
goals and priorities, and to build consensus o n the resource allocation by cost centres, sub-cost
centres, programmes and sub-programmes. W h i l e both the sector strategies and the BFPs are
costed, the MTEF information being captured and reported f r o m the IFMIS s t i l l largely focus o n
expenditure items, with 6 PRS pilot Ministries n o w preparing MTEF information on a program
basis. The G O L plans to increase this to 10 for 201 1/12 budget cycle. MTEF information for the
current fiscal year has also no*t been published and substantial work remains to be done to
achieve the full benefits o f a transparent medium-termperspective in planning and budgeting.
86.     Progress made by the Planning and Budgeting Task Force o n integrating planning and
budgeting processes through a MTEF was recognized as prior action for PRSC- 1. Development
o f budget framework papers by all ministries for 2009/10 - 201 1/12 i s a trigger for PRSC-2.

Financial Reportirig

87.     Lesotho's fiduciary framework and public expenditure management are severely
hampered by weaknesses in its financial reporting. Reliable and timely in-year and annual
information to monitor budget execution i s not yet available. Because o f weaknesses o f the
Government o f Lesotho Financial Information System (GOLFIS) there was heavy reliance o n
manual accounting procedures, rendering the accounting system and financial reporting
susceptible to inaccuracies and delays. Further, the lack o f adequate numbers o f trained
accounting staff has Seen a major contributing factor. This has prevented drafting and
submission for audit o f financial statements for the five years 1996197 to 2000/01, which in turn
resulted in incomplete information o n opening balances in financial statements for subsequent
years and qualified audit reports.
88.     An Accounting and Reporting Task Force aims to develop effective budget execution and
reporting systems through amongst other things: (i)       replacement o f the existing Government o f
Lesotho Financial Information System (referred to as GOLFIS) by a new IFMIS, which became
operational o n 1 April; (ii)   resolving the issue o f incomplete balances information, due to the
absence o f financial statements for the five years 1996/97 to 2000/01; (iii)    increasing training in
accounting, I F M I S and internal control issues, including raising the competence o f financial
controllers and the awareness o f chief accounting officers; (iv) establishing a new treasury
organization within M F D P to undertake the new accounting and cash management processes
proposed under the I F M I S ; (v) developing the internal audit system into a hybrid arrangement
under w h i c h internal auditors will report to the top management o f the ministry in which they are
located, as w e l l as to MFDP; and (vi) reforms to the public procurement system based o n
standardized procurement documentation and streamlining procurement systems. Improved
reporting facilities and control features in the I F M I S should facilitate both timely and better
quality reports.
89.       The adoption o f an I F M I S implementation plan by MFDP was a prior action for PRSC-1.
The submission o f public accounts for the years 2004/05, 2005/06 and 2006/07 to the Auditor
General i s a PRSC-2 prior action and the phased roll-out o f the IFMIS starting with the six pilot
l i n e ministries already implementingthe MTEF has been agreed as a trigger for PRSC-3.

PRSC-2 Prior Action: Submission o f Public Accounts for 2004/05, 2005/06 and 2006/07 to

External Oversight and Audit

90.     W h i l e public sector auditing in Lesotho i s carried out in accordance w i t h international
standards, i t i s hampered by delays in account preparation, lack o f financial resources and skilled
staff. Progress with a n e w Audit A c t t o strengihen the independence o f the Office o f the Auditor
General has been slow and it s t i l l awaits submission to Cabinet and Parliament. At the same time
the capacity o f the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) i s weak and needs to be strengthened to
review reports issued by the Auditor General and ensure adequate follow-up o f i t s reports by the
Executive. The P A C should also consider having i t s meetings open to the public o n a regular
basis to foster greater transparency and accountability.

Auditor General and submission to Parliament.

Public Procurement

92.    Lesotho has made significant progress in reforming and modernizing i t s public
procurement system since the adoption o f the Public Procurement Regulations 2007 (PPR). The
fundamental principles o f the PPR are generally sound and go a long way in ensuring
consistency with international practices and procedures. The 2007 Regulation i s based on a
decentralized system in order to foster transparency and accountability. To that effect, Ministries
and District Councils are in charge o f their own procurement management through their
Procurement Units while the former Central Tender Board has been disbanded. The procurement
process within each Ministry and District Council i s based on distinct evaluation and award
phases by an Evaluation Team and a designated Tender Panel in each institution.
93.     A Procurement Policy and Advisory Division (PPAD) to support, monitor, and enforce
compliance at the ministries and at the districts has been established. According to the
Regulations, PPAD actually covers the major functions o f developing relevant legislation,
providing means o f controlling and enforcing compliance through audits, channeling information          '



relating to all procurement activities, managing the training efforts, and providing an
independent appeal mechanism. Other roles include guidance and advice to procurement units as
well as compiling an inventory o f public assets.
94.     Training programs have been initiated under the auspices o f the Chartered Institute o f
Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) and the first batch o f CIPS graduates will be on board b y the end
o f 2009 and the next batch by end 2010.
95.     Review and revision o f the coverage and provisions o f the public procurement
regulations in line with CPAR findings was identified as a trigger for PRSC-2. The Government
has confirmed i t s broad agreement with the findings o f the CPAR and has taken steps to
implement several o f the identified actions. Amendments to the Public Procurement Regulations
have been drafted. However, i t s finalization i s awaiting the legislation o f the revised P F M Act.
Under the circumstances, this trigger i s not retained as a prior action for PRSC-2. While the
CPAR proposed establishment o f an Independent Procurement Regulatory Authority (IPRA),
Government i s establishing a Procurement Tribunal to provide an appeals mechanism that would
have been provided by the IPRA. The required amendments to the P F M Bill have been made.
Establishment o f the Procurement Tribunal i s a PRSC-3 trigger The Government has requested
technical and financial assistance from donors, including the Bank, to fully implement the action
plan.
Component 3: Improving access and quality o f basic services
96.     Lesotho's human development path has diverged from i t s economic development path in
the past decade. Despite high economic growth and public expenditures, particularly in the social
sectors, Lesotho's Human Development Index (HDI) has worsened by nearly a tenth. This
divergence has strongly been influenced b y the impact o f HIV/AIDS on a key element o f the

                                               36
HDI calculation, namely l i f e expectancy at birth3'. The quality and efficiency o f service delivery,
and the targeting o f services to the most vulnerable sections o f society remains a significant
concern. For example. Lesotho has one o f the lowest rates o f outpatient visits per capita o f
around 0.75. The national average of bed occupancy rate in the same year i s only 3 8 percent,
below the 80-85 percen: target. Lesotho has the worst ratio o f health care workers to population
in sub-Saharan Africa with less than one health professional for 1,000 people.
97.       In the health sector, the reform program, w h i c h commenced in 2000 with the assistance
f i o m the Bank and other development partners, entered i t s ninth year in 2009. Since i t s start, the
SWAP has been fundamental to harmonize efforts in order to achieve the objectives o f the
reforms. Progress in the area o f institution building includes strengthened capacity to coordinate
and monitor the reform program as evidenced by the development o f a 10-year health sector
policy and strategic plan and the first three-year rolling health sector expenditure program linked
to the overall MTEF. Progress has been made in achieving high immunization rates, revitalizing
the national Tuberculosis program, and improving access to HIV testing, prevention and
treatment. New notified TB cases in 2008 were 541 per 100,000 o f which 19 percent were smear
positive. TB success rate was 76 percent. The number o f sites providing HIV testing and
treatment has gone up f r o m 102 in 2007 to 171 in 2009. The proportion o f people living with
A I D S and in need o f ART who receive ARV treatment increased f r o m 41 percent in December
2008 to 52 percent in September 2009, meeting the target o f 50 percent. This i s commendable
given that the Government changed the eligibility criterion for receiving treatment f r o m a C D 4
count o f 250 to C D 4 count o f 350, making more patients eligible for treatment. Proportion o f
mothers attending anti natal care (ANC) who were HIV positive was 15 percent while the
proportion o f A N C attendees who were HIV positive and eligible and given ART or HAART
was 98 percent. M o r e than 1100 pregnant women attended ANC at least once.
98.     Progress in the area o f human resources continues to be a challenge, but there have been
some successes in the development and implementation o f the Emergency Human Resources
Plan. In addition, the organizational structure o f the MOHSW was reviewed in order t o improve
efficiency. The decentralization process o f health services has been slow but i s gradually taking
shape-most o f the District Health Management Teams (DHMTs) have the core staff and are
able to develop their operational plans.
99.        Despite the above achievements, concerns exist under the health sector reform. Lesotho i s
off track to reach the health MDGs-with continuing high maternal mortality rate, high child
mortality rate that i s being fueled by an increasing number o f orphans, and the third highest adult
H I V / A I D S prevalence in the w o r l d and, as a consequence, an increasing tuberculosis prevalence.
The human resource crisis persists at a l l levels; it hampers the implementation o f the health
sector reform program and severely weakens service delivery. The unresolved issues around
health service decentralization also continue to cause problems in service delivery at the district
level. Because o f these factors, w h i l e the budget for health significantly increased in the last
several years, the expenditure level remains l o w .
100. The PRSC supports GOL programs focused o n key health and related interventions that
are doable within the three-year time-frame: (a) improvement in child nutrition through greater
food security at the household level to avert the adverse consequences o f the drought and
increasing level o f food deprivation o f orphans; (b) sustaining disease prevention through

immunization mainly by making vaccine financing more predictable and sustainable; (c)
improvement in case-finding and treatment o f tuberculosis through the implementation o f the
new national program o n TB control; (d) widening the ARV treatment and prevention program
through more intensive implementation o f the national HIV/AIDS strategic plan, greater
mobilization o f donor support and N G O involvement, and a more intensive local response; and
(e) broadening the support to orphans and vulnerable children through wide-scale registration o f
beneficiaries and provision o f an essential package o f support t o them, as delineated in the
National O V C Strategic plan.
101. The Ministry o f Local Government ( M o L G C ) has completed a broad registration o f
orphans with the support o f District Councilors and the Ministry o f Health and Social Welfare
and about 200,000 orphans have been identified. U N I C E F i s supporting the M o L G C to design
and implement a more comprehensive O V C registration system, which i s linked to the vital
registration system (births and deaths). Stakeholders consultations, development o f a data

development o f guidelines on the implementation process, and the training o f data collectors in
some communities in four districts (Thaba-Tseka, Berea, Quthing and Qacha's Nek) has taken
place. Needless to say, all o f these interventions hinge critically o n more intensive recruitment
o f health workers to be deployed in under-staffed districts/facilities, and stronger capacity
building, staffing, and equipping o f district health offices to enable them to manage health
interventions in their localities. The Table below highlights the support provided by key donors.

percent increase in Form A intake. In 2007 the first cohort enrolled with F P E reached secondary
school, and a record number passing the primary school leaving examination (PSLE) created a
surge in demand for secondary places. Increases in demand for enrollment o f around 8,000
students per year are expected until 201 1, if F o r m A intake i s sustained at current rates, and these

 105. The PRSC supports an improvement in the quality o f primary education as measured by a
 progressive increase in the cohort survival rate and access to secondary education over the PRSC
 series. Extension o f existing infrastructure to accommodate additional entrants at the secondary
 school level has led to a ten percent increase in secondary school enrollment. This was
 recognized as a prior action for PRSC-1. Preparation o f a three year costed plan for the
 education sector aimed at increasing access to secondary schools i s a prior action for PRSC-2.
 The Government has developed a medium term update o f the Education Sector Strategic Plan,
 covering the period 2009-2012. This plan includes detailed costing f r o m the planned
 development o f the sector, consistent with the approved budget for 2009-10 and the medium
 term expenditure framework indicative ceilings for subsequent years. This update o f the
 Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) has been appraised and the basic education components
 endorsed by the development partners active in the sector. This has not been taken to cabinet as
 the plan i s only a 3 year costed updated version o f the Education Sector Strategic Plan 2005-
 201 5 w h i c h was approved by Cabinet.

  106. Leadership o f the decentralization reform has been assigned to the Ministry o f Local
 Government and Chieftainship (MoLGC) which has the responsibility to oversee and coordinate
 the establishment o f an effective and efficient decentralized local government system.
 Subsequent to local government election in 2005 when the local authorities were established,
 substantial effoi-ts have been made and continue to be made to implement the reform. However,

this i s yet to be guided by a clearly defined implementation agenda. Notwithstanding, Lesotho
 Vision 2020? Local Government Act 1997, Public Sector Improvement Reform Program
 (PSIRP), in addition to the Constitution outline the need for decentralization reform. T o
 strengthen i t s operations, MoLGC has prepared a Strategic Plan (2009-2013). The Plan
 identifies decentralization as one o f the four main priority areas with a priority statement - 'to
 enable local governments to be responsible for service delivery and development within their
jurisdiction'.
107. The decentralization reform program has a focus o n improving decentralized service
delivery and decision making with the a i m of reducing poverty. Decentralization for improved
service delivery i s premised o n certain key elements w h i c h include: the legal and policy
framework which assigns functions to the local level; political and administrative accountability
which deals with election o f representatives and autonomy for decision making; fiscal measures
(resource envelope for devolved functions to local authorities); and decentralised human
resources to administer the devolved functions. These are expected to be anchored o n
institutional arrangements at the central level for reform coordination. These key elements
guided the discussions and development o f National Decentralization Action Plan (NDAP). The
N D A P has been prepared and endorsed by Cabinet. A t present, an Inter-ministerial Working
Group i s preparing an implementation strategy for the plan, including fiscal decentralization.

            Box 2: The Proposed PRSC and Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The proposed PRSC supports implementation o f Lesotho's development program as laid out in i t s
Interim National Development Framework (INDF). The INDF will guide planning and resource
allocation, particularly in light of fiscal challenges resulting from the global economic crisis and
projected declines in SACU revenues. It bridges the period between the end o f the PRS and the
adoption o f a comprehensive national Development Plan in 2012. The GOL has also prepared a Growth
Strategy which lays down short and medium term approaches to achieve broad-based, sustainable
growth as set out in the Vision 2020. It has prepared a PAF, which provides a basis for monitoring the
program o f overall budget support. The PAF consists o f a number o f relevant, monitorable, time-bound,
and realistic targets related to priority policy objectives. Prior actions and triggers to be supported by the
PRSC have been selected from the PAF.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountability framework
A l l missions have been held jointly and joint aide memoires have been prepared and agreed with the
Government. The broad principles of budget support were agreed in May 2006 and are identified in the
May 2006 Joint Budget Support Aide Memoire. The first joint review was carried out in October 2008
and the second joint review was carried out in November 2009. It has been agreed that subsequent
reviews will be carried out jointly in Octoberhlovember each year, to fit in with the Government's
budget preparation timeline. Disbursements o f budgetary support will be based on a positive outcome o f
this review.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities o f Bank support to country
circumstances
The joint budget support review will be aligned to the country's budget cycle and will be held in
OctoberMovember each year. Disbursements are expected to be made for the following budget year
starting in April.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
One o f the principles of the joint budget support i s that the PAF should consist o f a few monitorable and
realistic indicators. The triggers and actions for the proposed PRSC represent only those actions that
will be critical for achieving the program's project development objectives and the various outcomes.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-
based financial support
In order to improve predictability o f budgetaiy support from donors, the JBS framework requires donors
to indicate levels o f budgetary support that they are planning to disburse well in advance o f the start of
the fiscal year, such that the amounts can be included in the Budget submitted to Parliament. Once the
main annual PAF review in Octoberhlovember has been concluded, all the JBS donors in Lesotho will
indicate to the Government how much they are planning to disburse in the following fiscal year.
Government in turn uses this information during the budget preparation process.

                                A.    POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

 108. The poverty and social impacts of the reforms supported by the operation are expected to
be favorable overall. The benefits are expected f r o m direct j o b creation in the private sector and
improvement in service delivery, particularly to the poor in rural areas. A greater proportion o f
the population living in the highlands i s stricken with poverty than those living in the lowlands.
Populations living in the highlands rely heavily o n livestock and subsistence farming. In the
recent past, men would find employment as mine workers in South Africa. However, increasing
unemployment in the mining sector has led to able-bodied men returning t o the rural areas and
engaging in subsistence farming. Given that farming alone cannot provide sustainable
livelihoods in the rural sector which i s confirmed by recent analysis o f the household survey
data, an increasing number o f households are relying o n more than one source o f income in the
rural areas. Jobs in the non-farming sector, in particular in manufacturing and petty trading are
becoming an important source o f income. Improved business environment and better industrial
infrastructure are expected to boost the private sector and create jobs. The operation supports
reforms that will create more wage jobs in the private sector.
 109. The effects o f H I V I A I D S have taken a larger t o l l in the poorer areas o f Lesotho,
especially the highlands. N o t only m a y it be difficult to receive medicine, but also poverty
stricken households have poorer nutrition and greater food insecurity. W h e n family members
fall ill or die, girls are expected to care for the sick and orphaned siblings. In families stricken
with illness and/or poverty, children become an additional, or sole, source o f livelihood. School
Principals have noticed that those who need to repeat upper classes tend to be orphans as they do
not attend school regularly. The increase in the program o f support to the OVCs i s expected to
lead to an overall reduction in the social burden associated with caring f o r the OVCs. The
creation of n e w sites providing ARV treatment i s expected to increase the coverage o f ART to
affected people. Most o f the beneficiaries are expected to be under-privileged who will be able
t o lead a better life with the availability o f treatment.
110. Increasing access to secondary schools for the large cohort o f primary school leavers (as
a result o f the completion o f the free primary school cycle) will provide better income earning
opportunities to these students when they enter the labor market.
111. Improvements and further reforms in public finance management envisaged in the
program have an indirect poverty and social impact through creating the conditions for improved
governance and provision o f public services.



                     B.    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING EVALUATION
                                                   AND

112. The institutional arrangements for the implementation o f the operation fall within the
framework of the JBS. The proposed arrangements seek to ensure oversight and buy in at the
political level. A dedicated team of officials from Department o f Development Planning in the
M F D P and the Bureau o f Statistics will monitor progress in implementation o f the overall budget


                                                43
support program. This team acts as the Secretariat for JBS implementation and monitoring. At
the Ministerial level, dedicated teams o f relevant officials responsible for implementation and
monitoring o f activities3' will monitor implementation o f P A F activities and collect data to
verify achievement o f P A F indicators and report to the Secretariat. The JBS Secretariat i s
headed by Department o f Development Planning and will report, o n a quarterly basis, to the
Improvement and Reform Steering Committee (IRSC). Representatives o f the DPs are members
o f the IRSC, ensuring that they are also aware o f the progress being made in implementation in
between the annual j o i n t reviews. The Chairperson o f the IRSC will, in turn, report, through
Minister, MFDP, to the Budget Committee. The P A F progress report will be submitted by the
Principal Secretary, M F D P to the Committee o f Principal Secretaries as they are responsible for
delivering o n these indicators. This will be the forum for initial discussions towards the required
remedial actions where problems exist. The Principal Secretary, MFDP, will also pursue these
discussions bilaterally with affected MinistriedAgencies for implementation o f the required
actions. Briefings to development partners envisaging budget support will b e provided at regular
intervals.
113. The P A F will be the basis for monitoring and evaluation o f the program. An annual
progress report submitted by end-August o f each year will be followed by a j o i n t annual review
o f progress, based o n the PAF, to analyze progress towards agreed triggers and targets. The m a i n
objective o f this review i s to come to a j o i n t view o n performance, which will serve as the basis
for commitments for the following financial year.

Public Fin an cia1 M a n agement System

114. Lesotho's fiduciary framework i s adequate overall to receive the proceeds o f the Credit
and Grant, particularly in light o f the adoption o f a comprehensive P F M reform program and the
implementation progress made. Implementation o f the P F M reform program i s currently being
supported by DfID, EU, and Ireland. The support will be deepened under the auspices o f the
JBS.
115,   An assessment o f P F M based o n the PFM Performance Measurement Framework (PMF)
has recently been conducted jointly by the Government and i t s key DPs and a draft report has
been prepared. The assessment notes that although longstanding weaknesses in budget
execution, the internal control framework and financial reporting identified in the previous
assessment continue, some progress i s clearly being made. The assessment also notes that there
are many built-in features o f the n e w system that are designed to address problems in the areas o f
expenditure commitments, authorization o f expenditure and reconciliation o f accounts32.
1 16. Progress has been made in a number o f areas, including deepening o f the MTEF, drafting
of the Public Financial Management and Accountability Bill, launching o f IFMIS, preparation o f
outstanding public accounts up to 2006/07, auditing o f public accounts and adoption o f n e w
procurement regulations. The PRSC will support continued implementation o f reforms under the
Government's PSIRP.

117. U p o n effectiveness, expected in April 2010, a single tranche o f SDR 16.2 m i l l i o n
(US$25.0 m i l l i o n equivalent) will be disbursed to the Government o f Lesotho. The PRSC-2 will
follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for Development Policy Lending. In particular, the
Credit a d Grant proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the
development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases and n o procurement
requirements will be needed.
118. U p o n receipt o f separate withdrawal applications for the Credit and Grant f r o m the
Government, IDA will disburse the Credit and Grant proceeds to a United States Dollar
denominated account maintained by the Central Bank o f Lesotho (CBL) and forming part o f the
official foreign exchange reserves o f Lesotho. Within t w o business days, the C B L will credit the
l o t i equivalent o f the Credit and Grant proceeds to the consolidated account maintained o n behalf
o f the Government o f Lesotho for budget execution. The Accountant General will be notified
accordingly. The C B L will not impose any charges or commissions o n the Government for these
transactions. The conversion f r o m United States Dollars to l o t i will be based o n the prevailing
exchange rate o n the date that the funds are credited to the consolidated account. The
Government, through the M F D P will - (i)       provide a written confirmation to the B a n k within 30
days, that an amount equivalent to the Credit and Grant proceeds from the B a n k has been
credited to the consolidated account, with an indication o f the exchange rate applied; (ii)       provide
evidence that the l o t i equivalent o f the Credit and Grant proceeds was'recorded as financing for
Government budget; and (iii)        ensure that the l o t i equivalent o f the Credit and Grant proceeds i s
subject to controls to ensure its use for eligible budgeted public expenditures only. The
administration o f this Credit and Grant shall be the responsibility o f M F D P .
119. Auditing: The budgeted public expenditure partially financed b y the l o t i equivalent o f the
Credit and Grant proceeds i s subject to external audit by the Auditor-general under the normal
auditing arrangements applicable to the Government. The Association will have access to these
audit reports.

120. The program i s not expected to have any direct significant environmental consequences.
Infrastructure improvements to enhance the quality and coverage o f primary and secondary
education do not involve the construction o f new schools immediately. Needed improvements
will take place in existing schools. The Ministry o f education, in collaboration with the National
Environment Secretariat (NES), has prepared the necessary environmental instruments in
anticipation o f potential adverse impacts f r o m the construction o f these schools. N e w secondary
schools m a y be constructed in 2-3 years time. Improvements in the business climate are likely,
however, t o lead to increased business activity, some o f which may have potentially negative
impacts o n the environment, such as those involved in industrial production. In addition, the
proposed trade facilitation measures are intended to contribute to j o b creation in export sectors,
in particular the textile industry, posing additional challenges for the management o f industrial
pollution. Adequate capacity for handling and expediting the clearance processes, and
monitoring and enforcement to deal w i t h potential adverse pollution arising f r o m increased
investment activities i s lacking currently and needs to be strengthened.

                                                  45
 121. In this regard, i t will be important for the Government to continue to strengthen the legal
and institutional framework for environmental impact assessment, monitoring and enforcement.
The Environment A c t 2001 has a number o f sections specifically pertaining to Environmental
Assessment (EA), and requires submission o f EAs and Environment and Social Impact
Assessment to the Authority, currently the National Environment Secretariat (NES). An
Environment Bill (2007) i s under consideration, and would establish a National Environment
Council and Department o f Environment, with Assistant Environment Officers to be appointed at
the District level. I t i s envisaged that the establishment o f the National Environmental Council
will strengthen the institutional framework and enhance NES' role in monitoring and
enforcement o f environmental legislation in the country.
122.    In order to strengthen the analytical foundations for the continued building o f
environmental management capacity at both the national and local levels, it i s proposed that the
Bank prepare in close collaboration w i t h the NES a Country Environmental Analysis focusing o n
these issues, the recommendations o f which m a y be incorporated into the planned PRSC-2 and 3.



                                   F.       AND MITIGATION
                                        RISKS

123. Impact o the global economic crisis. T w o distinct macro risks exist. First, the recovery
                     f
o f the South African economy could be slower than anticipated and the rebound o f SACU
revenues could be' delayed. This w o u l d put enormous pressure o n what already i s a tough fiscal
adjustment process w h i c h can undermine fiscal sustainability and/or jeopardize necessary social
and capital expenditure. Second, the Government m a y not fully implement the required program
o f fiscal consolidation. The run-up to the local elections in 2010 and the National Assembly
elections in two years may lead to unplanned expenditures. Mitigating these risks depends o n
Lesotho's capacity to adjust to the shocks and the Government's ability to manage the impact o f
the shocks. Significant levels o f government deposits accumulated at the Central Bank during
the years o f S A C U revenue boom and high levels o f international reserves at the Central Bank
(almost double the level required to maintain parity with the rand) provide a cushion f r o m the
short tenn fiscal and external shocks. Bank and the Fund, through their respective programs,
will w o r k w i t h the Government to identify ways to make this fiscal adjustment work through
expenditure cuts, efficiency gains and revenue diversification. Predictable and timely budget
support through the PRSC series and from other development partners, including the IMF will
also help mitigate the risks.
124. Capacity risks. The systemic problem o f capacity in Government continues to pose a risk
for the program and m a y cause delays in the implementation o f some measures, especially in
public sector reform. T o mitigate this potential coordination failure, implementation
arrangements for the PRSC seek to ensure oversight and buy in at the political level. Capacity
building initiatives underway with support f r o m other Development Partners, particularly in the
area o f public financial management reform will also mitigate this risk;
125. Lesotho also faces the challenge associated w i t h the political willingness to push for
legislative reforms, especially with the upcoming local and political elections.

Dear Ms. Ezekwesili,


              Letter of Development Policy for the Poverty Reduction
                         Support Grant and Credit (PRSC-21

1. I write on behalf of the Government of Lesotho to request approval of the second
Poverty Reduction Support Credit and Grant (PRSC-2) in the amount of U S 2 5 million
of which US$ 20 million is a credit and the balance a grant, from the International
Development Association (IDA).

2. You will recall that the Government of Lesotho concluded a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) with international cooperating partners on General Budget
Support (GBS), amongst whom the World Bank is a key member. The World Bank
approved the first Poverty Reduction Support Credit to support the Government's efforts
in poverty reduction. Its disbursement was made in 2009. The proposed PRSC-2
would therefore constitute a continuation in the said support and would further
contribute towards reducing poverty through increased economic growth and
employment generation and reduction in social vulnerability.




                                        51
3. The Government of Lesotho launched a Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2004,
whose timeline ended in March 2007. Despite its implementation over the three-year
period, very little impact was made on poverty due to among others inadequate financial
resources to implement the strategy in all its aspects. Furthermore, while the strategy
had defined the level of economic growth that would be required to make an impact on
poverty, it had omitted an important element of defining how the growth would be
achieved which is a pre-requisite for sustainable economic growth and poverty
reduction. As a result, little focus was placed on the sectors and activities that would
promote economic growth. In recognition of this therefore, the Government embarked
on the preparation of a Growth Strategy, which has identified the potential growth
sectors and the requisite activities for the development of these sectors. A National
Development Framework was also developed to address the poverty reduction issues
that were covered by the Poverty Reduction Strategy and to guide the planning process
while a more comprehensive Five-year National Development Plan is being developed
for implementation starting in April 2012.

4.   The global economic slowdown has significantly put a downward pressure on
economic growth in Lesotho. The past decade witnessed the emergence of two large
export oriented sectors - garment and clothing industry and diamond mining - which
together account for roughly 20 percent of GDP and 72 percent of total exports. It is
these two industries that are most vulnerable to global recession. Falling demand in the
United States, which is the recipient of almost 95 percent of Lesotho's garments, has
already impacted negatively on the industry as exports in this sector fell by 11 percent in
2008. Given that the US economy is forecasted to contract by a further 1.6 percent in
2009, Lesotho garment exports are likely to witness another year of negative growth.
Furthermore, as a result of credit crunch some of the garment manufacturers are
already facing difficulties obtaining trade credit for input financing from foreign banks
and their parent companies in Asia.

5. 'In 2008 economic growth is estimated to have fallen to 4.2 per cent from 5.1 per
cent in 2007, slipping to 1.9 per cent in 2009 before recovering slightly in 2010. The
slowdown has been due, in part, to the global financial and economic crisis but high
inflation driven by soaring food and oil prices in 2008 has also played a role.

6. The sharp drop in commodity prices has reduced demand for labor in South Africa
and put pressure on remittances, a key source of rural income for Lesotho. Exports to
key developed country markets have also contracted due to the global slump. The
downturn in the United States in particular has impacted clothing and textiles exports,
with 42 000 jobs at risk. The government, however, has continued to strengthen
capacity in the textiles sector while exploring other market opportunities, particularly in
Europe and regionally and diversifying products. It has also introduced an importlexport
scheme with the support of the African ExporVlmport (AFREXIM) Bank.




                                          52
7.    By economic categories, diamond mining continues to make a significant
contribution to Lesotho's economic growth following the reopening of LetSeng mine.
The share of mining has risen, to 7.4 per cent of GDP in 2008 from less than 1 per cent
a decade ago. Activity in this subsector has also contributed to the increase in capital
formation, put at 24.3 per cent of GDP in 2007. The manufacturing sector came under
pressure in the second half of 2008 as consumer demand in the United States
weakened. It is estimated that textiles, footwear and leather products output will contract
by 10.7 per cent for the whole year, compared with an increase of 5.1 per cent in 2007.
Manufacturing accounted for 13.3 per cent of GDP in 2007, with the most contribution
coming from textiles manufacturjng. The share of manufacturing however, fell by an
estimated two percentage points in 2008 due to weaker demand as a result of the
global financial crisis. To avoid further deterioration in this key industry, the government,
through LNDC has injected equity in some of the textile companies and to facilitate
trade finance through the establishment of an export guarantee scheme to provide
assistance to textile manufacturers.

8.   The share of agriculture in GDP has fallen steadily over the years. It was
estimated at 8.3 per cent in 2008, down from 11.4 per cent 10 years earlier.
Construction activity remained robust in 2008 as a .result of ongoing road projects.
Growth in the tertiary sector is projected to fall to 2.5 per cent in 2008, driven by a
slowdown in financial intermediation.

9.   Lesotho's financial sector is small and relatively isolated from the global capital
markets but the crisis has been felt through its very important links to South Africa.
Lesotho's currency, the loti, is pegged to the South African rand. The strengthening of
the Rand has affected Lesotho's textile exports negatively.

Government Policies and Development Obiectives

I O . The Government's policy objectives continue to be premised on poverty reduction,
combined with the promotion of high, sustainable and broad-based growth and
reduction social vulnerability. As indicated earlier, the Government prepared a Growth
Strategy that focuses on identifying the key areas that could be supported to promote
high economic growth and hence poverty reduction

11. The over-riding objective of Government remains that of attaining an accelerated,
shared and sustainable economic growth rate of 6 to 7 percent per annum but the
current global economic and financial crisis has made this goal hard to achieve. Other
important objectives and policy goals of the Government for the medium and long term,
as stated in Vision 2020 include:

      a)      Scaling up the fight against HIV and AIDS;
      b)      Creating an environment conducive for increased private sector
              investment, rapid job creation and reduction in unemployment;




                                           53
             Developing infrastructure so as to make economic opportunities
             accessible to all segments of the population and to provide the basis for
             rapid industrialization and job creation;
             Developing infrastructure and services to promote tourism;
             Improving the quality of and access to education, skills training and health
             services for all Basotho;
             Enhancing food security by improving agricultural productivity and
             introducing high value cash crops, better farming practices, irrigation,
             water harvesting, afforestation, and realistic marketing arrangements;
             Integrating youth, children and gender issues in all Government policies
             and programs;
             Promoting efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of public services
             through enhanced public financial management, audit of Government
             operations and use of public-private partnerships; and
             Consolidating democracy, peace and stability by fighting crime, promoting
             safety and security and by enhancing the role of Parliament, accountability
             and transparency through a new Public Financial Accountability Bill that
             will be introduced in the February sitting of Parliament.

            overarching objective is to create income-generating opportunities for
unemployed and underemployed members of the labor force by encouraging private
sector growth. Core policy components include: (i) responsible macroeconomic
management; (ii) appropriate microeconomic policies; and (iii) continued improvements
in the reform of the public service; and (iv) reforms aimed at improving the investment
climate and competitiveness.

13. Investors are reluctant to locate in countries with large fiscal deficits, increasing
debt ratios and declining foreign exchange reserves as these indicators affect
expectations and monetary stability. The attainment of positive outcomes based on
sound macroeconomic policy and management is a necessary condition for sustained
investment and economic, growth. Lesotho will ensure stable fiscal, inflationary and
balance of payments positions that will create an appropriate economic environment.

14. The main objectives of the Government's macroeconomic policy are to:

      0          provide the basis for sound and consistent macroeconomic
                 management;
      0          create an attractive macroeconomic environment for the private sector
                 which will support efficient production and generate faster economic
                 growth by attracting both domestic and foreign investment; and

      0          improve public sector performance by consistently applying the
                 principles of sound public expenditure management (i.e. achieving
                 aggregate fiscal discipline; concentrating public resources on a core
                 set of activities including both poverty-targeted programs and support
                 for a pro-poor growth strategy; and improving operational efficiency).

                                         54
15. The Government of Lesotho remains committed to maintaining a stable
macrGeconomic environment, both as a means of ensuring high and sustainable growth
and to attract foreign direct investment that would support such growth. As a result,
Government took a conscious decision to cap the annual budget deficits at 3 percent of
GDP. Indeed since 2003/04 up to 2008/09, excluding grants, the Government has
maintained an overall fiscal surplus. The recent global financial and economic
recession has however led to a reversal of this performance in 2009/10. The reduction
in the revenue receipts from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) resulting from
the decline in the demand for imports into the customs union, has negatively affected
the Government's fiscal position. We therefore begin to see a shift from the, historical
surpluses to a deficit in 2009/10.

16. In response, the Government has embarked on a strategy to aggressively reduce
expenditures in the immediate and medium-term. The Government's policy is therefore
to maintain annual budgets at the previous year budget outturn levels in order to ensure
that all budgeted resources are utilized. The Government however recognizes that it
will be difficult to effect the necessary adjustments speedily as there are ongoing
commitments that would need to be completed and important social programs that
cannot be stopped. The impact of these budget policies will therefore not be obvious
immediately, but will lead to a more sustainable fiscal position in the medium- to long-
term

 PRSC-2 Prior Action: Macroeconomic framework for 2009/10 reflecting ceilings
  approved by Cabinet, with the fiscal deficit not exceeding 3 percent of GDP
                             adopted by Cabinet.


17. The Government established in 2008, a one-stop shop with the aim of streamlining
the processes for establishment of businesses and facilitation of foreign direct
investment. As a follow-up, the Government has continued to work towards improving
its operations, particularly with respect to the range of services provided. The services
of the one-stop shop have now been extended to include rebate certificates, residence
and work permits and industrial licenses. The intention is to include company
registration, tariff investigations and trade remedies in the services provided by the one-
stop shop. It is expected that a new Companies Bill, that will give legal effect to the
proposed investment climate reforms will be presented to Parliament before the end of
the current Fiscal Year.

   PRSC-2 Prior Action: Extension of One Stop Shop services to include rebate
        certificates, residence and work permits and industrial licenses

      PRSC-2 Trigger: Extension of one-stop shop services to include rebate
                                  certificates.




                                          55
18. As part of the Government's efforts to promote industrial development, the
Government intends to develop industrial facilities as a key intervention. This will
involve upgrading of services to existing industrial locations and building new industrial
facilities. Focus will particularly be on the expansion and development of two sites at
Ha Nyeye and Ha Tikoe. In the meantime, work continues to identify further sites for
future development once work has been completed on the two initial sites.

                       PRSC-2 Prior Action and Trigger:
 Based on the ongoing Investment Infrastructure Studies, target sites and related
                     investments identified and approved

19. A key goal of the Government continues to be that of strengthening public financial
management and public service. A new Integrated Financial Management Information
System (IFMIS) was launched in April 2009, and has been the basis for maintaining
Government accounts during this Fiscal Year. The system has also assisted in
implementing new planning and budgeting, accounting and reporting, and procurement
systems. With the assistance of the system, Government has been able to put together
public accounts for 2004/05, 2005/06 and 2006/07 for which auditing has been
completed and the relevant reports presented to Parliament. Auditing of the accounts
for 2007/08 is being concluded by the Auditor General, and Government is in the
process of finalizing the accounts for 2008/09 and it is expected that the auditing will be
concluded early in the coming Fiscal Year.

  PRSC-2 Prior Action and Trigger: Public accounts for 2004/05 and 2005/06 and
 2006/07 audited by the Office of the Auditor General and submitted to Parliament

Public accounts for the financial years 2004/5 and 2005/6 audited by the Office of
               the Auditor General and submitted to Parliament.

20. As part of integrating planning and budgeting, the MTEF approach, which had
initially been piloted in six Ministries, has now been rolled out to all Government
Ministries. Budget Framework Papers have been prepared for all Ministries since
2008109. Notwithstanding, there are persistent problems with the implementation of
MTEF, mainly arising from low capacity and general appreciation of the process in the
line ministries. As part of an exit strategy for the financial and technical assistance
provided under the Public Financial Management Program, the Government intends to
undertake intensive training programmers for all Public Servants, including senior
officials, on the MTEF process.

 PRSC-2 Prior Action and Trigger: Development of Budget Framework Papers by
                       all ministries for 2009/10 - 201 1/12

21. In January 2007, the Government launched a new Procurement Manual and
procurement procedures as part of the Public Financial Management Reforms. The
procurement reforms involved the decentralization of ministerial procurement and the
establishment of ministerial procurement units. A recent Country Procurement


                                          56
    Assessment revealed several weaknesses that would need to be addressed in order to
    render the new procurement procedures efficient and transparent. This will involve the
    revision of the regulations as well as reinforcement of ministerial procurement through
    training of staff. The G,wernment is in the process of preparing proposal to be
    presented to the World Bank for technical assistance to build capacity in line ministries
    for effective implementation of the new regulations, as well as to fine-tune weaknesses
    that were identified by the CPAR.

    PRSC-2 Prior Trigger: Review and revise coverage and provision the CPAR
    fin dings

    22. Despite progress in various areas, many challenges remain. Poverty continues to
    be widespread with half of the population still living below the poverty line. The HIV and
    AIDS epidemic is a major threat to Lesotho's attainment of the Millennium Development
    Goals, combating poverty and promoting sustainable human development. HIV and
    AIDS have a IongLterm impact on development. The Government is committed to
    halving the number of new infections from over 22,000 in 2007 to under 11,000 in 201 1.
    In addition to intensifying the Know-Your-Status (KYS) Campaign, which encourages
    voluntary HIV testing, the number of health facilities providing anti-retro viral (ARV)
    treatment has been increased from 140 in 2008 to 142 in 2009. These will include
    government, private and mission clinics and hospitals.

    PRSC-I Prior Action and Trigger: The number of sites providing ARV treatment,
    including Government, mission and private/public partnerships increases

    23. The HIV/AIDS pandemic has resulted in a growing number of orphans and
    vulnerable children (OVCs) who need legal protection to safe guard their rights to
    accessing basic social services.       In 2004, the Government undertook a Rapid
    Assessment, Analysis and Action Planning (RAAAP) exercise on OVC in consultation
    with key sectors and civil society partners. The exercise has resulted in the
    development of a comprehensive costed OVC National Action Plan. It is since this time
    that the Department of Social Welfare in collaboration with the Registrar of Births and
    Deaths in the Ministry of Local Government has been developing a computerized
'


    database to register orphaned children at the district level in all 10 districts. This key
    initiative will enable Government to budget appropriately based on accurate data at
    district level and provide basic services that respond to the felt needs of orphaned
    children. The program for the registration of OVCs will be piloted in 6 districts, with the
    expectation that once the pilot stage has been completed, registration would continue in
    the rest of the country. It is expected that this will facilitate development of a
    comprehensive and inclusive support package for OVCs.

          PRSC-2 Triggers: Ministry of Local Government completes nationwide
                                  registration of OVCs

     Ministry of Health and Social Welfare completes design of a support package for
                                           ovcs


                                              57
24. The government is committed to providing universal free and compulsory primary
education. In this regard, in 2000, free primary education was introduced in Lesotho on
an annual incremental basis from standard one. The more global policy principle of the
government, guided by the MDGs and Education for All, is that basic education is an
integral part of social and economic development and that it is a fundamental human
right. It is also seen as an essential pre-condition for mid-level employment and
secondary and post-secondary education and training, which is expected to create the
practical skills and knowledge that will facilitate rapid and better integration of the
population, men, women and children, into a unified society

25. The envisaged economic development for Lesotho is dependent on the availability
of highly skilled manpower. To achieve this, the government has adopted a Technical
and Vocational Education and Training or skills development strategy and policy which
are expected to improve the skills profile of the Lesotho workforce thus promoting
economic growth and alleviating poverty through provision of demand-driven training
programs. Other priority areas include lifelong learning; early childhood development;
and teacher development, supply and management. Cross cutting issues that affect
education and training need to be adequately addressed, especially, gender, HIV and
AIDS.

26. Government's efforts are directed towards ensuring adequate resources in the
form of trained teachers and infrastructure to be able to continue the implementation of
the Free Primary Education Program as well as to provide adequate secondary school
facilities to absorb the intake from the primary level. In implementing the ten-year
Education Sector Strategy roved in 2005, the Government has prepared a three-year
plan, which has guided the medium-term budget process. This plan has been endorsed
by stakeholders, including donors and its implementation will require substantial
financial resources, for which Government will continue to seek support form
development partners.

  PRSC-2 Prior Action: Production and endorsement (by stakeholders) of basic
     education components of a three-year costed education sector plan

PRSC-2 Trigger: Production and endorsement (by cabinef) of a three-year costed
                        plan for the education sector.

27. The Government is in the process of developing a National Monitoring and
Evaluation System, which will monitor the implementation of its programs as well as the
extent of achievement of its development targets as set out in the Performance
Assessment Framework agreed with Budget Support Partners. A data base of all
ongoing projects and programmers has already been established. Resources will be
set aside to ensure adequate capacity to collect, present and analyze economic and
social statistics.

Conclusion

                                         58
28. The global economic situation has impacted negatively on Lesotho's economy. In
particular, textiles manufacturing, which has been the lifeline of Lesotho's economy, and
the largest private sector employer. It has been affected by the decline in the demand
for its exports as a result of the recession in the United States of America. At the
regional level, the low demand for imports resulting from declining economic activity has
resulted in a decline in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenue, which
accounts for over 50 percent of Lesotho's revenue. Consequently, it is projected that
the Government will be faced with increasing fiscal deficits in the medium term, up to
2012/13 at which time it is projected that there will be a slight recovery in the
performance of the economy. In the meantime, Government will need to mobilize as
much resources as possible from alternative sources to finance crucial social and
development programs. Most importantly, the Government will be required to identify
programs and activities to develop the critical growth sectors with the objective of
creating employment, reducing vulnerability and poverty. The Government intends to
develop a National Development Plan whose implementation is expected to commence
in 2011/12 and which will articulate an investment program intended to meet the above
goals. It is against this background that the Government is requesting a second Poverty
Reduction Support Credit and Grant to be appraised and negotiated as quickly as
possible by the International Development Association of the World Bank.

Thank you for your continued and timely support.

                             The Acting Chair's Summing Up
                      Kingdom o f Lesotho-2009 Article I V Consultation
                              Executive Board Meeting 10/17
                                      February 22,2010

       Executive Directors agreed with the thrust o f the staff assessment and recommendations.
They commended the authorities for Lesotho's recent favorable macroeconomic performance.
They observed, however, that government spending has increased rapidly since 2008 and that the
country faces significant challenges going forward as the projected decline in Southern African
Customs U n i o n (SACU) revenues i s expected to result in large fiscal and external deficits.
        Directors agreed that, in order to ensure fiscal sustainability, action will be required on
several fronts, and they encouraged the authorities to follow through o n their medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan. First and foremost, i t will be necessary to contain the growth o f non-priority
expenditure, including that o f the wage bill, while safeguarding spending o n vulnerable groups.
Directors also called o n the authorities to enhance the efficiency o f public expenditure, improve
the quality o f capital spending, and strengthen the mobilization o f non-SACU revenues. While
the emerging fiscal imbalances can be partly financed with a judicious drawdown o f government
deposits and the issuance o f domestic debt, Directors encouraged the authorities to aim for a
sufficiently frontloaded adjustment.
       Directors agreed that Lesotho's monetary and exchange rate regime under the Common
Monetary Area and the peg o f the l o t i to the rand has helped maintain price stability. Achieving
external sustainability, however, will require increased productivity and external
competitiveness, as well as a prudent fiscal policy.
        Directors observed that despite strong growth in recent years, considerable challenges
remain in reducing poverty, unemployment, and income inequality, which have been exacerbated
by the H I V / A I D S pandemic. Directors noted the expected positive impact o n medium-term
growth prospects o f large infrastructure projects. They stressed that broad-based growth and
poverty reduction will require determined efforts t o reduce the cost o f doing business and
improve the investment climate, in l i n e w i t h the authorities' strategy to advance economic
diversification and facilitate private sector development.
       While t h e financial sector has weathered the global financial crisis relatively well,
Directors observed that additional efforts are needed to increase access to financial services and
to improve regulatory oversight o f nonbank financial institutions. They supported the current


                                                76
efforts to deepen and enhance the efficiency o f the financial sector and to increase access to
financial services, especially in the rural areas. Directors also welcomed the actions being taken
to strengthen the supervisory role o f the central bank, address remaining vulnerabilities arising
from weakly supervised nonbank financial institutions, and facilitate the resolution and the
prevention o f fraudulent investment schemes. Directors looked forward to the establishment o f
the Financial Intelligence Unit as an important step in the implementation o f the anti-money
laundering framework.
       I t i s expected that the next Article I V consultation with the K i n g d o m o f Lesotho will be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.
