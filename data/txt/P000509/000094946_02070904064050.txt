3. Assessment of Developnieit-Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3..J Original Objective:
Chad's Health and Safe-M-6therhood Project (HSMP) was designed to assist the Govermment in
irnplementing its long-term strategy for increased access of the population to quality basic health,
nutritional, and family planning services. The project supported Government's efforts to: (i) enhance



capability at the cental level to support regional health services, (ii) improve access to basic health services
in the Prefectures of Gu6ra and Tandjile, and (iii) ensure accessibility of the population to low-cost
essential drugs. Considering conditions existing in the country, namely (a) limited access to basic public
health care services, (b) insufficient health staff, both in quantity and quality, and (c) limited access of the
population to essential drugs, these objectives were relevant and appropriate for Chad. They were
supportive of primary health care (PHC) and the minimum care package (MCP) approach which are the
basis of the national health policy.
3.2 Revised Objective:
Not applicable (NA)
3.3 Original Components:
The project had three components, namely (i) reinforcement of the capacities of the central level
to support peripheral health services, (ii) support to health, nutritional and family planning services in the
Prefectures of Guera and Tandjile, and (iii) development and implementation of the national
pharmaceutical policy. These components were divided into nine sub-components, as follows:
Component 1: (1) improving the budgetary process at central and regional level, (2) developing
skills and upgrading training modules for regional and district health personnel, (3) developing and
implementing a national infornation, education and communications (EEC) program, (4) reinforcing
Government's capacity to plan, coordinate and implement donor financed projects;
Component 2: (5) establishing a network of district health facilities, (6) implementing skills
upgrading programs for district health personmel, (7) promoting community participation in local health
services planning, implementation, and monitoring;
Component 3: (8) developing the planning and management capacity of the Division of Pharmacy,
and (9) creating a central purchasing agency for essential and generic drugs.
3.4 Revised Components:
Following the mid-term review in 1997, the project sub-components were expanded to
include (i) decentralized basic training for paramedical personnel and (ii) additional financing of
water supply systems for rehabilitated health facilities.
3.5 Quality at Ent,y:
3.5.1 Consistency with Bank and Government Priorities:
Project objectives and components were consistent with both the Govemment's health policy and
the CAS. Components were appropriately designed to contribute to achievement of the overall project
objectives. However, given the innovative approach of the project for Chad, operational research should
have been a priority and funded at the outset. This could have improved project perfornance.
3.5.2. Amendments to the Credit Agreement:
A supplemental credit of SDR 8.2 million (US$10.0 million equivalent) was signed in October
1998 and the Credit closing date extended by one year. The increased funding was needed to address (i)
-2 -



underestimation of the cost of civil works in remote areas, (ii) decentralized basic training for paramedical
personnel, including the construction of two regional training centers in Abeche and Moundou, (iii) water
supply systems for renovated health facilities which had not been anticipated, and (iii) financing gaps when
co-financiers did not meet commitments.
3.5.3. Quality of the design:
Weaknesses identified in the project design include: (i) underestimating the number and
professional skills required to implement activities; (ii) underestimating local costs for civil works, which
represents about 40% of the amount of the IDA credit (the Staff Appraisal Report - SAR- underestimated
by about 30%). However, the project objectives were consistent with both the national health strategy and
the Bank CAS, and the components were relevant and would contribute to the achievements of the project
objectives. At the time of appraisal the country was just coming out of a war, and it was very difficult to
make good cost estimates. Overall, quality at entry is rated satisfactory.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The three project objectives were achieved, and the project is rated satisfactory. The objective of
enhancing capability at the central level was achieved as a result of a number of institutional improvements
in the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH). Access to health services improved in Guera and Tandjile, with
Gu6ra rising from 47% (1995) to 77% (2001), and Tandjile rising from 58% to 76% in the same period.
BCG coverage, a good indicator of access by the poor to health services, was 93.6% in 2000 in Guera and
76.2% in Tandjil6 as ooposed to 16.9% and 37.2% in 1995 respectively (see Annex I Bis, page 16 for data
on vaccination and matemal services). With more than half of project resources (US$16.2 million)
supporting minimum care package-related efforts in these two prefectures, the fundamental goal of
increasing basic health, nutrition, and family planning services was well served. Improved nationwide
access to low cost essential drugs was not quantified; however, the success of the pharmaceutical supply
;ystem is indicative of greater and wider availability of essential drugs.
4.2 Outputs by components:

4.2.1. Reinforcement of the capacities of the central level to support peripheral health services. The
four sub-components were implemented successfully and all are rated satisfactory:
(i)   Improving the budgetary process at central and regional level: The project succeeded in putting
in place a new budgetary nomenclature, in parallel with the Government nomenclature, since year 2000.
The 2002 budget is based on prefectoral budgets and on the budgets of two Directorates of the MOPH
(other Directorates did not prepare their budgets, and therefore an estimate based on last year's budget was
used). Management capacity of the Division of Financial Resources within the MOPH has been
strengthened and equipped with appropriate management tools, making financial management more
transparent and more efficient. 165 personnel of the MOPH and the Ministry of Finance at the national and
the regional levels were trained in budgetary processes and management.
(ii)  Developing skills and upgrading modulesfor regional and district health personnel: The
Training Division produced 46 training modules in total, thereby surpassing the initially planned 20
modules. These modules were pre-validated and tested before general application. Different themes are
covered, including technical, managerial and organizational aspects of health services. The Training
Division carried out the planned training sessions, benefiting the different levels of the health pyramid. The
project introduced, at mid-term, decentralized training ("Formation Initiale Decentralisee" or FID). The
first class of FID graduates were recruited into the civil service and will be soon working in the field (150
technical agents and 22 delivery nurses; FID continues to provide health personnel to the regions). Long
term training for MOPH staff was provided in anesthesia, pharmacology, community health, IEC,
I aboratory, and public health. The project also contributed to the revision of the curricula of the nursing
school (ENASS). A training data bank, created by the project and updated on a regular basis by the
Training Division, provides consolidated figures on training-related activities, supported by the different
partners active in the health sector in Chad. This data bank provides information on each trainee, e.g, type
of training, dates of training, expected dates of availability, and source of financing. (This data base is
now being computerized to facilitate its use).
(iii) Developing and implementing a national Information, Education and Communication (IEC)
program: The Division of Information, Education and Communication (DIEC), is operational and has
elaborated a national communication strategy for health, which serves as a guide/framework for the
preparation of its workplan and for others in the MOPH which have budgets for IEC activities. Two senior
staff of the Division received long-term training and are back in the country. The Division trained 23
tbainers at central level, 95 health personnel and 40 social mobilizers on IEC aspects at operational level.
With the technical support provided by a national NGO (Bureau d'Appui a la Sante et ti l'Environnement -
bASE), the Division produced a wide range of IEC materials for key programs including Expanded
Program of Immunization (EPI), malaria, HIV/AIDS, vitamin A, and family planning. These materials are
widely used in the country and are well appreciated by involved beneficiaries and partners. In addition, in
collaboration with the Bureau d'Appui a la sante et a l'Environnement (BASE), the Division conducted a
series of qualitative studies, including studies on the perceptions within the Chadian society of teenage
picegnancies (1997), breast milk and breast feeding (1998), and a comparison of maternal mortality causes
for deliveries at home and in health facilities (2000).
(iv) Reinforcing Government's capacity to plan, coordinate and implement donor financed projects:
The National Public Health Strategy (NPHS) elaborated by the Government and discussed during the
context of the Health Sector Round Table in 1999 represents the framework and the main dialogue tool for
the MOPH and its development partners. The Bank was named the lead donor, in collaboration with WHO,
-5 -



for the health sector. The project contributed to the revision/up-date of the NPHS. The National
Pharmaceutical Policy (NPP) and the promulgation of the National Pharmacy Law were supported by the
project. These measures determined the national list of essential drugs for each level. In addition to the
creation of the Central Pharmaceutical Purchasing Agency (CPA), establishment of drug lists for essential
and generic drugs, the project supported four central MOPH Divisions including the Division of Financial
Resources (DFR), the Division of Training (DT), the Division of IEC (DIEC), and the Division of
Pharmacy (DP).
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) put in place by the MOPH proved to be an effective
coordinator of project activities and liaison/interface with the Bank and with other donors. It promoted a
participative approach by organizing regular progress meetings during which were discussed not only
project activities, but planning activities and other broad health-sector issues.
4.2. 2. Provision of technical assistancefor health, nutritional, andfamily planning services in the
Prefectures Guera and Tandjil6:
(i)    Improving the network of district healthfacilities: Substantial progress was made in network
expansion, particularly in civil works (construction or rehabilitation, equipment, and drilling for water).
Basic health coverage increased from less than 40% to 77% and 89% respectively in Guera and Tandjile.
However, two district health centers in Guera, to be constructed in newly created responsibility zones and
to be financed with Government counterpart funds as well as three health centers in the Tandjile, and the
Hospital of Lai, experienced long delays due to poor contractor performance. Furthermore, there was not
enough stakeholders' involvement in the actual design of the major facilities. Despite these problems and an
isolated case of misused of funds in the Prefecture of Tandjile, this component is rated satisfactory overall
because the project has significantly improved the geographical access of the population to health services
in the districts of the Prefectures of Guera and Tandjile.
(ii)  Implementing skills-upgrading programsfor district health personnel: Very comprehensive
skills-upgrading training programs covering various themes were successfully implemented. The planned
activities were fully delivered. More than 1,000 district health personnel in the Prefectures of Guera and
Tandjile participated in these training programs. The in-service training component will be evaluated in
2002.
(iii)  Promoting community participation to local health services planning, implementation, and
monitoring: Both the cost recovery system and a system ensuring the availability of essential and generic
drugs became a reality within the health system through community participation. However, community
participation at the health center level does not include management of health services. It focuses on the
purchasing and selling of essential drugs through the health management committee and on the cleaning of
health centers. At the district hospital level, contrary to the health center level, cost recovery covers only a
fraction of the cost of drugs (15 to 25%, depending on the hospital).
4.2.3. Development and Implementation of the National Pharmaceutical Policy:
(i)    Developing the pharmaceutical legal infrastructure, as well as the planning and management
capacity of the Division of Pharmacy: This sub-component was satisfactory. HSMP provided training,
equipment, management and technical assistance (through WHO/Department of Drugs and Medicines) to
the Division of Pharmacy. The main achievements are (i) the National Pharmaceutical Policy, (ii) the
ratification by Parliament of the law on pharmaceuticals, and (iii) the existence of a national list of
essential drugs, which is revised and updated every two years. However, Prefectoral Supply Pharmacies
- 6 -



(Pharmacies Prefectorales d'approvisionnement - PPA) remain unregulated despite multiple donor efforts.
PPAs still do not have legal status, although a draft law has been prepared. If this situation persists it
could adversely affect CPA operations and financial access of essential drugs by beneficiaries.
The Pharmacy Division did not demonstrate its capability in terms of planning and management.
On the financial side, the fees paid by suppliers for the registration of drugs were held in an account which
is to finance the functioning of the Division. The Ministry of Finance gave its authorization for this use,
but to date these funds have only been used to pay the fees of the members of registration commission.
(ii)   Creating a Central Pharmaceutical Purchasing Agency (CPA) for essential and generic drugs:
This sub-component was very satisfactory. The Central Pharmaceutical Purchasing Agency (CPA) is fully
operational. The CPA Management Commnittee includes representatives of health committees, civil
society, involved donors, and the Govermnent, and represents a transparent management tool. Its annual
sales figures for calendar year 2001 was CFAF 2.7 billion (about US$ 4.0 million). CPA contributed to
rnaling essential and generic drugs available throughout the country at a reasonable cost (lower than
I1NIPAC costs). Essential drug supply to the health service delivery system became a reality in Chad. This
was mainly due to HSMP support and to other partners who joined later, particularly the European Union.

Not applicable
4.4 Financial rate of return:
HSMP had a financial impact on the health sector by making resources available for both major
investment and recurrent costs over a period of approximately 6 years. During this period, activities
planned in the prefectures and districts covered by the project were implemented and operating costs were
covered. This was also the case for the four MOPH Divisions and the CPA supported by the project.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
HSMP developed institutions in the public health sector and provided valuable support to NGOs,
while simultaneously gaining valuable experience from these same partners. The project reinforced both
the technical and the management capacity of the five central structures, the "Delegations Prefectorales
Sanitaires (DPS)" and the District Health Teams in the Prefectures of Guera and Tandjile. The Project
Coordination Unit was effective in providing support for a wide range of health sector activities, and its
expertise continues to benefit the health sector.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
S.I Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
(E)    Private Sector Capabilities: The competence and experience of the ATETIP, the contract
management agency which had the task to recruit civil works contractors was not within the control of the
Governnent. As explained below in 5.2 (b), there were problems with the ATEPIP performance.
However, it would have been difficult to anticipate these problems as ATETIP was a newly created agency
and the health sector contract was one of its first task. With regard to the competence of civil works
contractors, although an assessment has not been done, the preparation team knew they were limited; this is
why they had required that a firm be hired to supervise civil works. Unfortunately, the contractors
recruited through the ATETIP were small contractors and their performance was even lower than that
- 7 -



expected for Chadian contractors in general.
(b)    Co-financier shortfalls on commitments: UNDP did not provide all UN volunteers promised and
those it provided, arrived after much delay. French Cooperation provided only nine months of technical
assistance to the Pharmacy Division, instead of the twelve initially planned for and promised. To ensure
that this Division received the necessary technical support, the project negotiated an amendment to the
contract with the World Health Organization's Drug Action Program (WHO/DAP).
(c)    Resource Requirements: A supplemental credit for SDR 8.2 million (US$10.0 million equivalent)
was signed in October 1998 to enable the Govenmment to successfully complete the planned civil works, the
financing of which was originally insufficient because the pricing estimates were based on sub-regional
averages instead of field visits in Chad, and to launch an accelerated training program for paramedical
personnel.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
(a)    Water supply needs for rehabilitated health facilities: Although the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)
did emphasize that only 36% of existing health facilities had a functioning water supply system within close
range of the health facility, no systematic survey was conducted prior to the costing of the project to
ascertain whether water was available at the rehabilitated sites. Subsequently, site investigations
established that water was often not available at the health facility sites, and that bore holes had to be
drilled for most of the health facilities supported by the project.
(b)    Problems with an implementation partner: As one effectiveness condition, the MOPH had to sign
a contract with a contract management agency (specifically the Agence Tchadienne d'Execution de Travaux
d'Inter8t Public: ATETIP), a supervising firm responsible for quality control and an architectural firm
responsible for architectural studies of the health facilities. The three agencies selected to work in a
partnership did not choose to work together, and the coordination of their planning and activities proved a
difficult enterprise. In addition, many subcontractors selected by ATETIP proved unqualified, and some
contracts had to be cancelled, others took a long time to complete, and in two instances, works were never
completed satisfactorily by the original contractors, but their performance bonds were not returned by the
banks. As a consequence, planned civil works of the first stage took longer than expected, the quality of the
work was poor, work had to be redone in several facilities, and the cost of construction was higher than
anticipated. The contract with ATETIP was cancelled at the end of the first phase of civil works and an
architect was hired in the CPU to assist the Procurement Specialist with the bidding process to recruit
contractors. This arrangement proved more successful and less costly than the original arrangements and
has been used in the follow-up project.
(c)    Timely recognition of the importance of human resources development and capacity buildingfor
the health sector: In March 1997, in the context of the Mid-Term Review (MTR), the MOPH decided to
allocate more resources to human resources development and management in the health sector. This new
priority was deemed necessary for the following reasons: (i) human resource capacity had been
underestimated, in both quality and quantity (more persons needed to be trained than anticipated; some
persons counted as health personnel were not). The health personnel census had been carried out at the
beginning of the project, but not with project resources; and (ii) the school for paramedical training
financed by WHO and Swiss Cooperation at the time of project preparation closed shortly thereafter
because of insufficient funding and reopened only in March 1997. As a consequence, the number of trained
health personnel declined, instead of increasing as had been expected under the health personnel deployment
plan developed by the Borrower prior to the project. These factors seriously hampered the implementation
- 8 -



of the plan. It was decided by the Ministry of Public Health in collaboration with IDA, the European
UJnion, French Cooperation, WHO and UNICEF, to support an accelerated program of basic health sector
training (FID) to supplement regular basic truining.
(d)    The Commitment of the Government to its National Health Policy and Related Programs: The
National Health Policy of 1992, which was endorsed by development partners, was revised and presented
at the March 1997 Health Sector Round Table. Government commitment was reflected in by the allocation
of CFAF 1.1 billion in the 1998 budget for health center construction under the project. An amount was
provided to the health component of the Project for Social Development Actions, the first project in Chad
vvhich had a health component. Thus Chad's National Health Policy served as the basis for a dialogue and
negotiation tool between the MOPH and its partners. It also facilitated donor coordination in the country.
(e)    Relative political stability during the project life: The political stability of the country greatly
facilitated project inplementation.
(i[)   Collaboration with other partners: The involvement of UNICEF and WHO at different levels
(headquarters, regional, and country offices) as well as the collaboration of other partners, particularly the
EU through its Seventh European Development Fund, French Cooperation, and the civil society (especially
EIASE, a national NGO), substantially improved effectiveness and raised the visibility of the project.
E[owever, it should be noted that contractual arrangements with WHO/AFRO posed a problem because
WVVHO/AFRO did not provide the PCU with regular financial reports.
(g)    Project Coordination Unit (PCU) Staffing: MOPH's decision to recruit PCU staff on the basis of
their qualifications and competency, and to give them full responsibility for coordinating project activities,
significantly contributed to the successful implementation of the project Nevertheless, the PCU was given
only a limited coordinating role and liaison function with the Bank. Project activities were implemented by
MOPH Directions/Divisions on the basis of workplans they developed.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
(a)    Management style of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) and Staff Stability: The management
style adopted by the PCU Coordinator promoted functional relations rather than hierarchical ones, thereby
creating and maintaining a good atmosphere for project teamwork. PCU staff remained virtually unchanged
during project implementation, and this contributed to the very satisfactory PCU and project performance.
Mlore and regular staff meetings would have improved efficiency.
(b)    Periodic review meetings: Periodic review meetings kept the partners informed, promoted a
participative approach, and prevented the project from becoming isolated. Mid-year review meetings to
monitor project activities proved to be an effective instrument for better coordinating and monitoring the
HSMP. It also made it possible to correct some of the design weaknesses and to adapt the project
implementation plan to new realities (e.g. the closing of the paramedical training school).
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
The original Credit, in the amount of SDR 13.1 million, (US$18.5 million equivalent) was approved by the
Board on June 14, 1994, signed on June 30, 1994, and became effective on February 24, 1995. A
Supplemental Credit in the amount of SDR 8.2 million, (US$ 10.0 million equivalent), was signed in
Ortober 1998. No separate counterpart fund account was required under the original Credit (the
Govermment was committed to provide salaries, office space, and the CPA building). Under the

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
6.1.1 Institutional sustainability
Apart from the Pharmaceutical Department, which was weak in terms of program planning and
management, the central Departments supported by the project (IEC, Training, and Financial Resources),
were capable and efficient in implementing the activities related to their respective mandates. In addition,
the Central Pharmaceutical Purchasing Agency (CPA), was staffed with well-qualified personnel and
proved to be self-sufficient and autonomous, functioning on a private sector model, using transparent
management tools.
District hospitals and ongoing equipment maintenance, however, remain problematic in terms of
sustainability because: (i) beneficiaries have not been involved in the planning, implementation and
monitoring of activities of these facilities, (ii), there is no national maintenance policy nor any qualified
maintenance agencies in the country (the new project is addressing this last point), and (iii) financial
- 10 -



resources allocated to the sector are insufficient to cover operational costs.
6.1.2 Financial sustainability
On the financial side, the CPA and the Pharmacy Department, which technically performed below
expectations, are the only,entities financially sustainable. Fees paid by suppliers for the registration of
drugs are kept in an account to finance the operational costs of the Division of Pharnacy. Registration fees
thus ensure the financial sustainability of this Division as long as they will continue.
Elsewhere, as mentioned above, financial resources including the cost recovery fund and the
recurrent health budget are insufficient to cover district hospitals, health centers, and other operational
costs.
However, the Government's decision to increase the State Budget allocation to the health sector by
20% per annum will progressively contribute to covering recurrent costs associated with the project
investments. Furthermore, the additional resources generated by the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) initiative will also contribute to reinforce the district team through the recruitment and motivation
of health personnel and the support to disease prevention and control, with an emphasis on Malaria,
Tuberculosis, and HIV/ AIDS. Finally, it is hoped that the current Chad-Cameroon Oil Project will
produce revenue which will improve the macro-economic situation from which the social sectors (health
and education) will benefit because they have been identified as one of the five priority sectors in both the
Chad Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the Bank 's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).
Indeed, the health sector has been designated by Government as a priority sector to receive part of the oil
revenue. By law 72% of oil revenues will be allocated to certain "priority sectors," namely Health,
Education, Transport, Rural Development and Governance.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
An indication of effective transition to regular operations in the context of Chad is the continuation
of basic mechanisms supported by both Government and donor resources. Over time this will increase the
confidence and capacity of the Government. Thus the new Health Sector Support Project (Projet d'Appui
au Secteur Sante- PASS), the successor to this Health and Safe Motherhood Project, is already operational.
As a consequence, there was no time gap between the two operations. In addition, the 8th European
Development Fund - EDF- project will take over from HSMP in the Prefecture of Guera, providing the
necessary technical support and assistance to the different levels of the health pyranid. This 8th EDF
project, building on the work begun by PASS, is fully operational.
The reappointment of the same team (apart from the Administrator who was not selected when the
positions were opened to competition for the selection of the members of the new project coordination
team), is further assurance that the workflow and continuity of good practices, such as timely response for
planned interventions, will continue. In fact, all audits were carried out on time and were unqualified and
the project performance in terms of disbursement (100%) was excellent due to the timely and efficient
implementation of the project by the MOPH.



7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Despite the inaccuracy of the estimation of the project cost, the Bank's performance during the
identification, preparation and appraisal of the project is rated satisfactory for the objectives. The Health
and Safe Motherhood Project was developed and has been implemented within the broader framework of
multi-donor efforts to strengthen the health sector and promote the development and implementation of a
safe motherhood policy. It assisted the Government in implementing its long-tern strategy to increase
access of the population to quality basic health, nutritional, and family planning services.
The Board approved a supplemental credit to ensure the full completion of the planned activities
and to cover the cost of new activities, in particular expanded civil works for facilities and water supply, as
well as an accelerated training program for paramedical personnel. These additions were responsive to the
needs and priorities of the Government and the Bank, in pursiing the development objectives.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performance in terms of supervision is rated satisfactory. Supervision missions were
carried out on time and Back to Office Reports (BTOR) were prepared on time. The supervision missions
were generally conducted by a multi-disciplinary team, which remained stable throughout project
implementation. This continuity contributed to in-depth coverage and analysis of various critical points of
the project implementation such as civil works, financial management, essential drugs management, human
resources management and capacity development, community participation, as well as the identification of
solutions to the problems identified. The team took into consideration the changing situation. Response
time to Government requests for non-objection were appropriate.
The resident mission provided satisfactory administrative support for the supervision of this projec
t.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
The overall Bank performance for this project is rated satisfactory. Even though the costs of civil
works were underestimated and basic health training was not fully addressed, the Bank made substantial
efforts to correct these deficiencies in collaboration with the Govemment and the other partners. There was
regular communication between the Borrower and Bank staff, adjustments were made on a timely basis so
as not to disrupt project execution, and the relationship was considered supportive and constructive. As a
result of this partnership, all the project objectives were achieved by the end of the project
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The Borrower's performance during the preparation of the project is considered satisfactory.
The Government showed commitment to the objectives of the project. This interest and
commitment was motivated by the realization of the poor demographic and health indicators of
the country (maternal mortality ratio estimated at 825 maternal deaths per 100 000 live birtis, an
- 12 -



average annual demographic growth of 2,7 %, and limited access (30%) of the population to basic
public health care). However, it should be noted that very few national actors at the central and
regional levels were involved in this process.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government implementation is rated satisfactory.
Government commitment to, and support of, its National Health Policy contributed to the
satisfactory implementation of the project. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was
competent, demonstrating ability to deal well with the day-to-day implementation of project
activities and coordinate with the Bank. Donor coordination and follow-up of Health Sector
Round Table meetings were organized on a regular basis to solve implementation problems such
as drug stock-outs and to discuss broad issues such as decentralization, traditional birth attendant
training, and donor coordination. This coordination was not an easy task, given the diversity of
partners and their respective procedures, the geographical allocation of regions among the
partners, and the government's effort to have some consistency between regions.
Weaknesses on the Government side identified during project implementation included (i)
a delay in adopting the text regarding the status of the Prefectoral Supply Pharmacies (Pharmacie
Prefectorale d'Approvisionnement - PPA) and the National Pharmacy Law and (ii) bureaucratic
problems with the procurement commission (Commission des Marches).
7.6 Implementing Agency:
The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) performance is rated satisfactory. The PCU dealt with
procurement, disbursement, auditing, and progress reports competently and with complete
professionalism. It coordinated effectively with other partners by organizing periodic information
and planning meetings. Its document storage and retrieval systems need to be better organized,
making it easier to find project documents and reports.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, the Borrower performance is rated satisfactory.
3. Lessons Learned
<. 1. Technical lessons
'i)   A sound donor coordination framework is key to success: HSMP was developed and
implemented within the broader framework of multi-donor efforts to strengthen the health sector. With
their different strengths and program objectives, donors must fit into a national assistance strategy which is
coordinated by Government, and donors must be willing to work together. UNICEF assisted the
Government in promoting community participation in local health services planning, implementation, and
monitoring in the two project prefectures. WHO provided technical assistance in the preparation of the
modules for training health personnel (WHO/AFRO), and in developing the planning and management
capacity of the Division of Pharmacy (WHO/EDM). The French Cooperation, the European Union, BASE
(a national NGO) also participated in capacity development The principal donors institutionalized regular
- 13 -



monthly meetings on various topics and shared chairmanship responsibilities.
(ii)   The necessity of discussing hospital plans with all the stakeholders: All potential stakeholders
should be part of the discussion regarding planning for a hospital in their area (Projets d'etablissement
hospitalier). The establishment and equipping of specialized units within hospitals, in addition to relying on
national standards, should take into account sub-national/local capacities and needs (the epidemiological
situation; size of the population; availability of qualified personnel such as technical, administrative and
management staff; geographical and financial accessibility).
8.2. Project design and management lessons
(i)   Field visits contribute to better cost estimates: Particularly where there has not been wide
experience in the type of construction or civil works envisioned or areas have not been fully accessible,
field visits improve the accuracy of cost estimates. Average costs for similar construction in Sub-Saharan
Africa is a useful benchmark but these should be used in combination with some local measurements to
determine sub-national estimates.
(ii)   Management agent selection is a critical decision, as are the contractual relationships with
others: Benefits from outsourcing management tasks are potentially great, but success ultimately depends
on the competence, experience, and reliability of the management agent. The agent must be able to screen,
select, and supervise sub-contractors effectively and with the best interest of the client in mind. The size of
contractual responsibilities must be considered: the management agent should not be delegated
responsibility over resources beyond its competence. Further, interlocking contracts must be clearly
written to avoid conflicts in terms of responsibility and accountability. (For example, in defining the
relationship between the management agent, the architect, the construction contractor).
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The National Parliament and the Govenmment (central and prefectoral in Guera) provided very
positive feedback/opinions on the HSMP. They rated the project highly satisfactory. Stakeholders view
this project as one of the best, if not the best, ever implemented in the health sector in Chad.
(b) Cofinanciers:
The French Cooperation, UNDP and UNICEF were cofinanciers: UNICEF was involved in the
preparation of the project at a very late stage and dealt with community participation in local health
services planning, implementation and monitoring. From the outset UNICEF considered the availability of
human resources a critical issue. UNICEF was not satisfied with the performance of district health
personnel in the treatment of diseases such as malaria, Acute Respiratory Infection, and diarrheal diseases
despite the training received under the project. However, UNICEF noted a positive attitudinal change in
the population with the acceptance of the cost recovery system. UNICEF was pleased with the level of
collaboration with the World Bank.
WHO was satisfied with its collaborative work with the World Bank and other partners, in
particular with the support to the Division of the Pharmacy. WHO also appreciated the introduction of the
initial basic training component in the project as well as the efforts made by the PCU and World Bank staff
with respect to donor coordination in the health sector in Chad.
- 14 -



(c) Other partners (NGOs/private sector):
BASE provided technical assistance to the Division of IEC and actively pursued the involvement
of the civil society in the implementation of the project Their belief that health sector development is not
solely the business of the health professional but the business of all the concerned parties was supported by
the project. BASE was able to share its field experience and its expertise in terns of social surveys and
social mobilization.

Additional Annex 8. Borrower's comments
The document was reviewed by the former Directeur General of Health who was in charge
during project implementation. He agreed with the report which indicates that all the objectives
were met. He had very few comments but wished to point out the following:
* the civil works costs were under-estimated during preparation of the project and the new
TTL had to revise certain aspects of project appraisal and to request a Supplemental
Credit
* there were legal problems (two performance bonds were never returned; there was court
summons because of contracts that were terminated for non-performance) despite
interventions by the Minister of Health
* there is a need to qualify statements made about the partners whose procedures
occasionally blocked the project (Page 9 (b))
The major factors which contributed to the project success the following:
* the stability of the PCU staff
* the smooth communication between the Ministry of Public Health and the partners, not to
mention the tramnsparency in project implementation
* the sound supervision by the PCU and the Bank staff
* the fact that the PCU did implement the activities financed by the project, but the Ministry
of Public Health, through its directorates, divisions, prefectorl health teams, did.
In 1999, at the Geneva IV Round Table, the Public Health Ministry organized a "sectoral
meeting" and not a "roundtable" (para. 4.2.1)
Commentaires de l'Emprunteur
Le document a ete examine par la personne qui etait Directeur General de la Sante au moment oi
le projet a ete realis6. I1 est d'accord avec le rapport qui indique que tous les objectifs du projet
ont ete atteints et il a peu de commentaires. Cependant, il voudrait souligner:
* Les sous-estimations des couts du genie civil durant la phase preparatoire du projet. Le
nouveau Charg6 des Operations ( TTL) a ete oblige de reprendre certains aspects de
l'evaluation du projet et de deamnder un Cr6dit supplementaire;
* Les deboires du projet avec la Justice (deux cautions jamais rendues, citation en Justice
pour des contrats qui ont et resili6s pour non-performance) et ceci malgre les
interventions du Ministre de la Sante;
*   Le besoin de nuancer l'appr6ciation concemant les partenaires dont les procedures ont
parfois gene le projet ( Page 9 (b) ).
Parmi les lecons majeures ( page 16, Point 8), il faudra peut etre signaler:
* La stabilite des cadres de la Cellule de Coordination du Projet (CCP);
*   La bonne formation des cadres de la CCP et la confiance qui leur a et accordee par la
hierarchie;
* La bonne communication entre le Ministere de la Sant6 Publique et les partenaires sans
oublier la transparence dans l'execution du projet;
- 28 -



*   La bonne supervision assuree par la Cellule de Coordination du Projet par le personnel de
la Banque;
*   La Cellule de Coordination du Projet n'a pas eu une gestion directe des activites financees
par le projet qui ontete mises en oeuvre par les services du Ministere de la Sante
Publique: directions, services, delegations sanitaires prefectorales, etc.
En 1999, dans le cadre de la Table ronde de Geneve IV, le d6partement de la sante a organise une
reunion sectorielle et non pas une table ronde (par. 4.2.1 iv)
