MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A HEALTH AND SAFE MOTHERHOOD PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval lie following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Chad for SDR 13.1 million, the equivalent of US$18.5 million,
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a health and safe motherhood
project. The Govermnent and local communities would contribute US$3.6 million equivalent.
Parallel cofinancing of about US$1.3 million and US$2.3 million is expected from UNDP and
UNICEF respectively. The proposed project constitutes an important element of IDA's Country
Assistance Strategy for Chad discussed by the Board on May 25, 1993.
2.    Country/Sector Background. Chad's demographic and health indicators lag behind those of
most low-income countries. Life expecancy at birth is 47 years, one of the lowest in the region (52
years in SSA); maternal mortality is estimated at 700 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births (630 in
SSA); and infant mortality rate is about 124 per 1,000 live births (106 in SSA). Chad's population,
which stood at roughly 3.0 million in 1960, has more than doubled. At present, the average annual
growth rate is 2.5% (3% for SSA). The high prevalence of sexually transmitted disease and sterility
might explain the country's low (compared to other SSA countries) fertility rates. However, Chad
has not yet started its demographic transition from high to low fertility, and improved health and
socioeconomic conditions and the resulting decline in mortality is expected to cause fertility to
increase before it starts to decline. The share of Government budgat allocated to health is around
4%. International aid finances 80% of the total investment and recurrent expenditures in the health
and population sectors.
3.    Despite difficult political and economic conditions, Government's commitment to addressing
these problems has evolved rapidly over the last several years. With the support of major donors,
Government has taken steps to coordinate interventions in the health/social affairs sector and to
increase coverage of basic health services by focusing on decentralization and integration of services.
Accordingly, a redistricting of the country into 46 socio-health districts has been completed, and a
minimum package of basic primary care services, including nutritional and FP services, is being put
in place. The Health and Social Affairs Round Table in January 1993 produced a sound sectoral
strategy-emphasizing a substantial improvement in access, efficiency, and quality of care-which is
supported by the donors.
4.    The limited access to basic public health care services is paramount: only 30% of the
population has access to a health facility within seven miles, and available facilities require major
repairs and reequipping. Health personnel problems are not so much a result of inadequate numbers
as of inappropriately qualified, poorly distributed, and inefficiently utilized personnel. The public
pharmaceutical sector is disorganized, non-operational and impoverished. As a result, low-cost
essential drugs are non-existent in the local market. There is heavy reliance on external aid and
practically no community participation in the management and operations of health facilities. Better
coordinated IEC activities are needed to empower the population to take charge of its own healt.



- 2 -
5.    Project Objectives. The proposed project has been developed and would be implemented
within the broader framework of multi-donor efforts to strengthen the health sector and promote the
development and implementation of a safe motherhood policy. It would assist the Government in
implementing its long-term strategy for increased access of the population to quaiity basic hMalth,
nutritional, and family planning services. The project would support Government's efforts to: (a)
enhance capability at the central level to support regional health services; (b) improve access to basic
health services in the regions of Guera and Tandjile (comprising 12% of Chad's population); and (c)
ensure accessibility of the population to low-cost essential drugs. In view of the increasing threat of
AIDS, activities aimed at AIDS prevention would be an integral part of all project components.
6.    Project Description. To attain these objectives, the project would support the development
and implementation of policies and investments designed to: (a) strenethen capability at the central
level to support regional health services (US$4.2 million or 16%) by: (i) improving the budgetary
process at central and regional level; (ii) developing skills-upgrading modules for regional and district
health personnel; (iii) developing and implementing a nationwide IEC program; and (iv) reinforcing
Government capacity to plan, coordinate, and implement donor-financed projects; (b) provide
assistance for health. nutritional, and FP services to the Regions of Guera and the TandiilU (US$16.2
million or 63%) by: (i) establishing a network of district health facilities; (ii) implementing the skills-
upgrading programs for district health personnel; and (iii) promoting community participation in local
health services planning, implementation, and monitoring; and (c) support the development and
implementation of the National Drug Policy (US$5.3 million or 21%) by: (i) developing the planning
and management capacity of the division of pharmacy; and (ii) creating a central purchasing agency
for essential and generic drugs.
7.    Project Implementation. The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) would implement the
project. However, UNICEF would be assisting the Government in the management of the
subcomponent pertaining to promoting community participation in local health services planning,
implementation, and monitoring in the two regions of project focus, and WHO would be providing
assistance in: (i) the preparation of modules for training health personnel; and (ii) in developing the
planning and management capacity of the Division of Pharmacy. The terms of reference of both
agencies focus on transfer of competence and capacity building. Management of the construction
program would be contracted to a construction management agency. A Project Coordination Team,
located in the MOPH, would be responsible for project monitoring and evaluation, administrative and
financial issues, and inter-agency coordination. A project implementation manual was reviewed
during negotiations and will be finalized during the project launch workshop.
8.    Project Sustainability. As mentioned previously, Chad depends extensively upon donor
assistance to cover health expenditures. Health delivery in Chad will not be financially sustainable in
the foreseeable future. However, the present project will help the system to gradually become more
sustainable. The project wil add only limited new personnel costs since the staffing of new facilities
would be made primarily through redeployment of existing staff. Furthermore, the implementation of
cost-recovery schemes in the health sector and the strengthening of financial management at the
provincial and district levels are expected to contribute to sustainability by promoting local ownership
and community cost-sharing and management.
9.    Lessons Learnedfrom Previous IDA Involvement. This would be the first free-standing, .DA-
financed health project in Chad. The Social Action Development Project (PADS), effective April 17,
1991, and scheduled to close June 30, 1996, has a health component which aims at improving health
and living conditions of disadvantaged groups in N'Djamina and the Tandjil6. Operationally, the
project has been successful as a pilot test by developing various cost recovery schemes and sensitizing
the population to the importance of community participation and cost sharing. The component which
-;matl nt nrnvidinp credit and technical assistance to small and micro-enterprises has been particularly



- 3 -
successful. However, the infrastructure and health components have been slow getting started
because of lack of adequate supervision and procurement delays. Timely implementation has been a
serious problem, and PADS, along with other projects in Chad and the Africa region, has taught us
some important lessons regarding project implementation and supervision. The most important lesson
pertains to the insufficient capacity of the concerned Government agencies, including the Project
Coordination Team (PCI), to carry out ambitious projects. To address such deficiencies, the present
project would incorporate the following measures: (a) a construction management firm would be used
as the executing agency for the complex civil works component; (b) training and capacity building
would be at the center of all components; and (c) frequent supervision would be planned. Second,
policy reforms need to be addressed at the early stage of project processing. Under this project,
difficult issues such as drug procurement, cost recovery, development of district health plans, and
plans for redeployment of health personnel have been addressed during project preparation and agreed
upon before appraisal. A Sector Development Policy Letter summarizing Government's health
policies was finalized during negotiations and has been provided by Government. A third lesson
learned from Sahelian projects is that to improve utilization rates of existing health infrastructure, the
quality of services needs to improve. In turn, this requires availability of affordable drugs. T'his is
addressed in this project through the creation of the Central Purchasing Agency. Finally, to have an
impact, a health and safe motherhood project should respond to the demand of the community.
Beneficiary assessments have been an integrated part of the preparatory work for the proposed project
to ensure pertinence of proposed activities to the needs as expressed by the community.
10.   Rationale for IRA Involvement; Relationship to Cowunry Assistance Strategy. IDA's Country
Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Board on May 25, 1993. The strategy focuses on poverty
alleviation and improving the prospects for long-term growth by: (i) increasing the accessibility and
quality of basic social services; (ii) increasing incomes through productivity increases and improved
services (including transportation) to the agricultural sector where the majority of the population lives
and works; (iii) improving basic infrastructure which serves to increase competitiveness and improve
welfare; (iv) promoting employment generation and entrepreneurship by encouraging the provision of
services by the private sector; (v) supporting the reallocation of public expenditures towards
development purposes; and (vi) promoting a coherent strategy for tapping the potential of the energy
sector. The assistance strategy is flexible and designed to build on Chad's positive attributes, to
continue the policy dialogue and to adjust rapidly to an improvement in country conditions. This
project constitutes an important element of this strategy, especially with respect to objectives (i), CMii)
and (v). From the sector work preparation stage and throughout the ensuing dialogue with
Government and donors, the Bank has been a key partner in the development of the National Health
Plan. The project reflects the importance given by IDA to safe motherhood and to the decline of
maternal mortality and infant and child mortality. IDA would be the lead partner to support the much
needed health reforms to improve the quality of health services, especially through training of health
personnel and restructuring of the pharmaceutical sector.
11.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it would: (a)
maintain a separate budgetary chapter for two categories-drugs and operating costs (excluding
personnel)-for each of the 13 health regions (prectures socio-sanitaires) through the end of the
project; (b) implement the National Plan of Redeployment of health personnel and the National Plan
for Training of health personnel according to the timetable agreed upon during negotiations; (c)
operate the Division of EEC with terms of reference (including staffing) acceptable to IDA; (d)
operate the Project Coordination Team under terms of reference (including staffing) acceptable to IDA
and not replace any key staff without IDA's prior consent; (e) adopt, following consultation with
IDA, a three-year Pharmaceutical Plan not later than January 31, 1996; (f) prepare semi-annual
management audits of the Central Purchasing Agency (CPA); (g) ensure that the CPA would occupy,
not later than June 30, 1995, the designated facilities agreed upon with IDA; (h) submit to IDA
progress reports on project implementation and outcomes twice a year in April and October), using



the format developed in the on-going education project; organize no later than November 30 of each
year, starting in 1995, a joint IDA/Government review of project implementation; carry out a mid-
term review of project implementation-including financ-al and technical audits-jointly with IDA, no
later than May 1997; (i) apply the procurement procedures and arrangements agreed upon at
negotiations; and U) submit to IDA annual audit reports of all project accounts within six months of
the end of Government's fiscal year and semiannual audit reports of the SOEs within three months
after the end of each audit period.
12.   As a condition of Board presentation, the Government delivered to IDA its Letter of Health
Sector Development Policy.
13.   As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Govermnent would: (a) adopt by ministerial decree,
a time-bound National Plan for redeployment of health personnel and a time-bound National Plan for
training of health personnel, satisfactory to IDA; (b) have entered into two agreements with WHO,
each in form and substance satisfactory to the Association, for carrying out activities in the Training
component and the Pharmacy Component; (c) establish the PCT, under terms of reference satisfactory
to IDA, with the Coordinator and the three senior professional staff in post and the accounting and
financial management system in place; (d) enter into an agreement, satisfactory to IDA, with
UNICEF and a construction managment agency; (e) establish the CPA with operational procedures,
satisfactory to IDA; (f) recruit long-term technical assistance for the CPA; (g) provide for the CPA
sufficient facilitis for the start-up phase of its operations and adopt a facilities expansion plan for the
CPA, each satisfactory to IDA; (h) prepare bidding documents, satisfactory to IDA, for the
procurement of the list of major civil works and goods agreed upon with IDA; and (i) appoint an
independent auditor under a multi-year contract acceptable to IDA.
14.   Environmental Aspects. The environmental category assigned to the project is 'C'.
15.   Program Objective Categories. The project responds to the country's antipoverty and human
resource development strategies. Because of its focus on safe motherhood and improved IEC
activities it has a WID dimension and will contribute to AIDS prevention.
16.   Project Benefits. By the end of the project, the increased efficiency of the health system
would result in increased access to, and improved quality of health, nutrition, and FP services, even
within the framework of existing limited sectoral resources. For the regions of Guera and Tandjile,
the project would intervene directly to extend the capacity of the health care system, and proposed
activities would directly benefit about 750,000 people (more than 12% of the population), mostly
women and children, who would gain access to basic services. Increased availability of low-cost
essential drugs, together with intensive retraining of health personnel is expected to enhance the
quality of health services throughout the country. Sector-wide restructuring measures will also help
establish a basis for a more responsive administration and for a more efficient and sustainable
program. The implementation of an EEC strategy is expected to increase community participation in
its own health development. The steps taken to improve access to quality MCHtFP services would
put in place the basic infrastructure necessary for attaining the increase in family planning service
delivery required to implement the Government's planned population program. And finally, this
program, to be supported through the proposed IDA-funded FY95 Poprlation and AIDS Control
Project, is expected to contribute to increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate from the present 1%
to 10% in the year 2000.
17.   Risks. There are three main risks: First, the implementing capacity of the central Government
is weak. This risk would be minimized by: (a) up-front implementation of key policy reforms such as
personnel redeployment; (b) relying heavily on stakeholder commitment through local management
and community participation; and (c) obtaining assistance from UNICEF, WHO, and ATEllP in the



-  -
implementation of the project. S=nd, the Government's chronic financial constraints may affect
counterpart funding, as well as salary payments. This risk would be mitigated through: (a) annual
discussions of project and sector performance, budgetary allocations, and Public Expenditures
Reviews; (b) redeployment of existing health personnel to staff new infrastructures created through
this and other donor-financed projects; and (c) gradual introduction of cost recovery to promote
increased cost-sharing by the communities. Third, implementation of the national drug policy
focusing on the use of essential and generic drugs may face opposition from the private
pharmaceutical sector. To address this risk, the private sector will be given a place in the new
system, allowing them a profit margin on essential drugs in generic form higher than on specialty
drugs. Also, through IEC, the public will be taught that inexpensive generic drugs are as effective
and safe as expensive brand name drugs.
18.   Recommendation. I amn satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the E:xecutive Directors approve it.

HEALTH AND SAFE MOTHERHOOD PROJECT
Action Plan for Improving Disbursement Performance
Economic and Financial Management Projet (Cr. 1872-CD): The credit became effective
on September 23, 1988, almost eight months after signing. This project has been a problem
project for much of the last five years. Nonetheless, its performance has improved over the
last year and its curent ratng has now been upgraded to a "2". While disbursements have
lagged badly, partly due to poor initial preparation and subsequent national difficulties in
1991-1992, several major components are now fully prepared and are ready to be
implemented. A mission is currently restructuring this project with the aim to support the
technical assistance and capacity building essential to the implementation of the Economic
Recovery Credit recently approved by the Board.
Livestock Project (Cr. 1912-CD): The credit became effective on January 27, 1989 about
seven months after signing. As of March 1994, about $11.3 million had been disbursed out
of a total credit of $18.6 million. The project has been a problem project for two years and
has now been restructured. Disbursements have been slow since the number of project
components was reduced following the restructuring. The current mission's findings will
assess which measures will be taken to improve implementation performance, or whether to
suspend or cancel the operation if improvements are unlikely.
Social Development Action Project (Cr. 2156-CD): The credit became effective on April 17,
1991, almost ten months after signing. Although a disbursement lag is still being reflected,
it has decreased progressively over the last year and is dropping even more quickly at present
since the infrastructure construction component has entered into the action phase. Several
contracts which will draw heavily on disbursements are being finalized. During the last
mission a project programming exercise, which shows that all amounts will be used by the
close of the project, was completed.
Engineering Credit (Cr. 1840-CD): The credit became effective on March 15, 1991, three-
and-one-half months after signing. Its objectives are to assist the SEERAT in preparing
project specifications and cost estimates and to conduct the necessary studies for the appraisal
of the petroleum and power project (the "Sedigi project"). Tender documents and
prequalification of bidders were completed in March 1992, but due to a lack of progress on
the macroeconomic front in Chad, project activities and disbursements have ceased since that
date, although disbursements have not been formally suspended. Recently, discussions with
Government have resumed regarding the reactivation of this project for the Sedigi project
preparation work with an update of the bidding documents, the prcing studies and the
environmental work. Resuming disbursements is pending progress by the Chadians on
economic management and public finance management, as well as on three conditions: (i)
increased private sector participation in SEERAT; (ii) implementing measures to improve
petroleum tax collection; and (iii) allocating petroleum fiscal revenues to priority
expenditures.
