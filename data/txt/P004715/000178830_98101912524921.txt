APPRAISAL OF THE TWELFTH IRRIGATION PROJECT
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The Royal Thai Government has requested Bank assistance in financing
a Twelfth Irrigation Project. The project would provide irrigation facilities
to serve 27,000 lha of paddy land located in the M4alaiman area along the left
bank of the Mae Klong River, about 80 km west of Bangkok. The project would
be the first phase in developing the Malaiman area, which has a total
cultivable area of about 156,000 ha. Water for year-round irrigation of the
project area would be provided by two Bank-financed multipurpose storage dams,
the Srinagarind (Ban Chao Nen) dam (Ln. 977-TH) and, when it is completed in
1984, the Khao Laem dam (Ln. 1770-TH). Water would be diverted to the project
area by the existing Vajiralongkorn diversion dam (Ln. 394-TH). About 6,800
farm families would benefit from the improved water control and year-round
cropping potential afforded by the project.
1.02      The project was prepared by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID)
with the assistance from the consulting firm of ILACO (Netherlands) under the
provisions of Bank Loan 1468-TH. This report is based on the findings of an
appraisal mission in September/October 1980 comprising Messrs. J. G. Stemp,
J. N. Drew (Bank), and C. C. Gonzales (Consultant).
The Agricultural Sector
1.03      Thailand's agricultural sector is one of the most dynamic in Asia.
Agricultural GDP in constant prices has grown at an average of about 5% p.a.
since 1960, and now represents about 30% of GDP. Agriculture produces 60% of
export earnings. The agricultural labor force is growing at 1.5% p.a.,
compared to 3% p.a. for the country as a whole, the difference being due to
migration to cities and the rise in rural non-farm employment. About 75% of
the nation's labor force is now employed in agriculture. The area in
agricultural use is about 20 rmillion ha, of which 14 million ha are cropped
each year.
1.04      Much past growth in agriculture lhas resulted from diversification
into upland crops on newly cultivated land. This has contributed to a steady
increase in farm incomes [n many parts of the country. Production of upland
crops, including cassava, sugarcane, maize, tobacco and rubber has increased,
far offsetting the decline in cotton, coconut and other minor crops. Growth
in agriculture has been stimulated by the country's flexible farming community
and by its effective and competitive marketing sector. These have responded
well to changing world market opportunities, particularly for upland crops,
and to improvements in the road network. Upland crops now account for about
40% of Thailand's export earnings and about 70% of agricultural export
earnings.



- 2 -
1.05      The more rapid expansion of upland crops has meant that the share of
rice in agricultural value added declined from 50% in 1960 to 40% in 1975.
Despite this relative decline, the area planted to paddy has increased at
about 2% p.a. since 1960 and this is the main reason for past increases in
rice production. As a result, despite rising domestic demand, Thailand
continues to export 1.5-2.0 million tons of rice a year and this provides
about 20% of agricultural export earnings. Rice remains Thailand-s single
largest export earner and now represents 15% of export earnings.
1.06      The potential for expansion of the cultivable area, either for rice
or upland crops, has been almost fully exploited and further growth in the
sector must come through more intensive use of existing areas. This requires
a number of measures such as improved price incentives to producers; land
titling; improved planning and implementation of projects; easier access to
agricultural credit; better extension advice and agricultural research to
improve agricultural technology; and continued expansion and better use of
irrigation facilities.
Irrigated Agriculture
1.07      The development of irrigation has been a major factor in maintaining
Thailand's comparative advantage in rice production. Irrigation has accounted
for about 80% of public investment in agriculture (and 60% of public expen-
diture in agriculture). In the future, investment in the agricultural sector
is expected to be more diversified with increased attention given to rainfed
rice production. However, if Thailand is to continue exporting large
quantities of rice, investment in irrigation should remain at a high level,
as it remains the simplest and most efficient means of raising yields.
1.08       Since its formation in 1904, the Royal Irrigation Department (RID)
has constructed irrigation, flood control and navigation systems which benefit
nearly 2 million ha. Until the 1960s, irrigation development in Thailand was
limited to the area of greatest potential and highest level of economic
development, the Chao Phya Basin, which is predominantly in the Central
Region. Early irrigation development was characterized by an extensive
approach aimed at modifying natural flood regimes over large tracts of land.
This method, which was appropriate to the vast flat lands of the Chao Phya
plain, was then applied in other regions with less success. It was found to
be particularly difficult to apply in the Northeast where the irregular
terrain precludes flood irrigation except in the narrow river valleys.
Furthermore, the circumstances that favored this extensive approach have now
changed and it is no longer appropriate, even where flood irrigation is
possible; farming techniques have advanced, and current and projected paddy
prices give the farmers incentives to take advantage of higher standards of
on-farm development. Similarly, on-farm development is now justified on
economic grounds by the higher international price of rice. Thus, in recent
years, more emphasis has been placed on the reliable and timely delivery of
water to the farmers fields in order to exploit fully Thailand's irrigation



potential.  This approach should be continued in the fu-ture and will involve
upgrading virtually all existing irrigation systems, and incorporating
higher standards of water control in the expansion of existing systems and in
new projects.
1.09     tHost of the irrigable areas in Thailand are in the flood plains of
major rivers where heavy rainfall and flooding preclude the cultivation of
crops other than paddy in the wet season.  In the Chao Phya Plain, and in the
coastal plains in the south, heavy soils predominate and so paddy is also the
preferred crop in the dry season.  Dry season cropping is more diversified on
the alluvial soils of the Northern Region and in the small areas so far
developed for irrigation in the Northeast.
1.10      In t'ne wet season, irrigated rice is now grown on about 2 million
ha, or about 25% of the total area planted to paddy, and a furtlher 0.6 million
ha will be served by projects under construction. In the dry season, 0.5
million ha are irrigated, of which 0.4 million ha are planted to paddy and the
remainder to upland crops. About 75% of irrigated land is in the Central
Region, although this accounts for only 25% of total land planted. Most
remnaining irrigated areas are in the Northern Region, where schemes are mainly
privately operated.
1.11      The Chao Phya Basin covers 180,000 sq km (35% of Thailand-s land
area) in the Northern and Central Region.  The C'nao Phya river is formed 200
km north of Bangkok where its four tributaries, the Ping, Wang, Yon and Nan
converge. After 60 km, the river splits into three branches which flow to the
Gulf of Thailand. RID's first major undertaking was the completion of a
network of navigation/drainage canals over 500,000 ha in the southern
Chao Phya Plain, an area that had been subject to deep and prolonged flooding.
The canals were designed to spread the seasonal floods more evenly over the
Plain, and to provide access to large tracts of luncultivated land.
1.12      By 1950, RID had turned its attention to the construction of a
gravity irrigation system of 600,000 ha in the northern Chac Phya Plain where
drought is more of a constraint to rice production than floods.  A key element
in this system, the Chainat Diversion Dam, together with a number of major
canals, was financed by the Bank in 1950 (Ln. 36-TM).  This was the Banks
first loan to Thailand for irrigation development. Since 1950, the Bank has
financed two multipurpose dams on the northern tributaries of the Chao Phya:
the Mhunipol Dam on the Ping comple-ed in 1964 (Ln. 175-TH) and the Sirikit
Dam on the Nan completed in 1973 (Ln. 514-TH). These projects, wqhich
exploited the only two mnajor reservoir sites in the Basin, have permitted more
regular wet-season flows and greatly increased water availability for
dry-season irrigation. The projects are also major sources of hydroelectric
power and energy.
1.13       In the 1960s, it became apparent that higher standards of water
control within the irrigated areas were needed to exploit fully the Basin-s
irrigation potential. The Bank-financed "Ditches and Dikes Project" in 1963



- 4 -
(Ln. 328-TH), was developed to serve some 1.5 million ha with a simple system
of tertiary canals replacing semi-controlled field-to-field flooding from the
main and secondary canals that had characterized irrigation until that time.
1.14      As new high-yielding rice varieties were introduced and rice prices
began to increase, further improvements in water control became economically
feasible. The Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement project, financed by the Bank
in 1973 (Cr. 379-TH), pioneered on a large-scale (15,000 ha) an intensive
mode of on-farm development comprising tertiary canals, drains, farm roads
and land leveling. A follow-up project for 60,000 ha was financed in 1976
(Ln. 1468-TH). Another major Bank project in the Basin, the Phitsanulok
Project (Ln. 1149-TH), consists of a new irrigation system for 95,000 ha
downstream of the Sirikit Dam; this is the first Bank-financed project in
the Northern Region. There is little potential for additional storage dams
and so further increases in dry-season cropping in the Chao Phya Plain will
be difficult to achieve. The Government is considering the possibility of
diverting flows from the Mekong to the Chao Phya Basin although the costs
may prove prohibitive. In the absence of this project, dry-season irriga-
tion can only increase if there is an improvement in the efficiency of water
use in both seasons. This can be achieved through higher standards of
on-farm development, which will also raise yields in both seasons.
1.15       The Mae Klong Basin, situated immediately to the west of the Chao
Phya Basin, covers an area of 27,700 sq km and has the greatest potential
of any river basin in Thailand for further increases in production. The
Basin was relatively undeveloped until the 1960s, but in 1964 construction
of the first stage of a project on the left bank, south of the Malaiman
area, began with Bank assistance (Ln. 394-TH). The extensive mode of
irrigation development current in the 1960s was adopted for the first stage
and in subsequent areas developed by RID. The Mae Klong-s two main
tributaries, the Kwae Yai and Kwae Noi join to form the main river, some 90 km
from the sea. Construction of the Bank-financed Srinagarind (Ban Chao Nen)
multipurpose dam on the Kwae Yai (Ln. 977-TH) began in 1974 and will be
complete in 1981. The Khao Laem multipurpose dam on the Kwae Noi (Ln.
1770-TH) should be complete in 1984. These two dams will be able to provide
water for year-round irrigation of the Basin-s 400,000 ha of irrigable land;
the development of irrigation and drainage systems in conjunction with fairly
intensive forms of on-farm development will produce very large benefits. The
Bank-financed Irrigation Project XI (Ln. 1787-TH) provides for irrigation
facilities, including on-farm development, for 66,000 ha on the right bank of
the Mae Klong.
1.16      The Northeast is poorly endowed with water resources; full control
of the region-s rivers would irrigate less than 10% of the 8.5 million ha of
paddy land. In the 1960s, RID, with bilateral assistance, embarked on a major
program of dam construction in the region. Six large dams and nearly 200
small dams were built, but there was a considerable time-lag between con-
struction of the dams and subsequent construction of the irrigation system.
In general, the systems were poorly designed and on-farm development was



- 5 -
lacking. RID is now engaged in a program to improve irrigation systems
downstream of the large dams with loans from various sources, including the
Bank (Cr. 461-TH and Ln. 1630-TH). Comnpletion of these works will bring
year-round irrigation to 160,000 ha, more than half of the region's irrigation
potential.
1.17       The South.  Existing developments are concentrated on the east coast
which has close to 90% of the region's 600,000 ha of rice land. About 75,000
ha are served by numerous projects consisting of diversion dams and canals
which generally provide irrigation for the wet-season rice crop only. Dry
season cropping is limited to about 10,000 ha, of which about one-half is
paddy. About 45,000 ha in the low-lying coastal areas benefit from conserva-
tion projects which consist of drainage systemns and control works to prevent
salt water intrusion. Three large projects have been studied, whose total
irrigation potential is close to 160,000 ha. The most advanced is the Pattani
project, which includes a dam and power plant on the Pattani River financed by
a Bank loan made in 1977 (Ln. 1485-TH). The dam will provide sufficient water
for the 40,000 ha of irrigable land in the Pattani area. The Eleventh Irriga-
tion Project (Ln. 1787-TH) provides for construction of facilities to irrigate
the first 15,000 ha.
1.18       In summary, since 1950, Bank assistance to Thailand's water
resources development has included five multipurpose dams and 11 irrigation
projects for a total of US$626 million. Of the irrigation projects, six were
in the Chao Phya Basin, one in the Mae Klong Basin, two in the Northeast,
one in the South, and one for the Petchaburi project close to the Mae Klong
Basin. The five projects undertaken since 1973 have incorporated higher
standards of water control through varying standards of on-farm development
(para. 1.08). The introduction of on-farm development required improvements
in RID-s survey and mapping capability and this was achieved with the help
of a Survey Adviser, whose services were financed under Bank projects.
1.19       In 1976, Bank staff undertook a review of the irrigation subsector
at the request of the Government. Because of the limited potential for
expanding yields of rice in rainfed areas, it was concluded that irrigated
paddy production would have to more than double if Thailand is to maintain its
share of the world market. The review outlined a program to be carried out in
the period 1977-90 to meet this objective. It comprises improvement of
existing systems (710,000 ha), extension of existing systems (290,000 ha) and
new projects (315,000 ha).  Although this is an ambitious program, a start has
already been made on some major elements of the program, mainly with Bank
financing. Although the proposed program is reasonably well distributed
between the four major regions, it should be noted that irrigation by itself
has only limited scope for redressing income inequalities between and within
regions, due to the need to select projects in areas with suitable soils,
topography, and water supply, all of which affect production potential.

1.20      As a follow-up to this review, Bank staff have assisted RID and
other government agencies in identifying in further detail individual
projects, which will be initiated in the early 1980s and which would be
suitable for external financing. In the Northeast, the program includes the
Nam Mun project, consisting of two storage dams and new irrigation systems
for 19,000 ha, the preparation of which is nearly complete. Projects in the
North would include a dam on the Yom River to irrigate nearly 70,000 ha and
the Mae Kok project for some 20,000 ha.  A nationwide medium-scale irrigation
project is included and a first phase is now being prepared. This would
consist of new projects and the rehabilitation of existing schemes. A start
would also be made on a number of schemes in the Bang Pakong Basin to the
east of the Chao Phya Basin. Some of these projects are being prepared, and
others will be prepared, with financing from current Bank loans for
irrigation.
1.21      Two Project Completion Reports have been prepared, one for the
Sirikit Dam (Ln. 514-TH) and one for the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement
Project (Cr. 379-TH). These two projects were the subjects of a joint Project
Performance Audit Report. The Sirikit Dam project was very successful, made a
major contribution to the rapid expansion of dry season cropping in the Chao
Phya Basin and was a timely addition to the country s power production. The
Chao Phya project was also successfully completed and has provided valuable
experience to the Government in the planning, design and implementation of an
intensive mode of on-farm development. This standard of development permits
better water control leading to increased yields and more efficient use of
water. The Chao Phya project provided the first opportunity for both RID
and the domestic contracting industry to undertake on-farm works and, together
with subsequent Bank projects, it led to a rapid development of their capa-
bilities to carry out such works. A further encouraging development in recent
projects has been the employment of local consultants to augment RID's own
capacity in the detailed design of on-farm development. The Chao Phya project
also provided for a restructuring and intensification of extension services in
the area, which worked well and gave a basis for the Bank-financed National
Extension Projects and for improving extension in subsequent irrigation pro-
jects. It was found, during implementation, that operation and maintenance
(O&M) of both the main and farm level systems required some improvements and,
under more recent projects, steps have been taken to strengthen RID-s O&M
capability mainly through provision for consulting services to assist RID
develop 0&M procedures in these project areas.
1.22      It is still necessary to improve further the quality of O&M staff
particularly to help them train farmers to operate the irrigation system at
the tertiary level, and RID is now, with bilateral assistance, examining how
it could strengthen further its O&M capability for all irrigation projects.
Implementation of current Bank projects is satisfactory, and although problems
of interpreting the new Government procurements have led to delays over the
past two years, these appear to have been resolved.

Project Formulation
1.23      Mae Klong.  In 1964, the Bank made a loan of US$23 million for a
first stage project in the Mae Klong Plain (Ln. 394-TH). The purpose of the
project was to provide regulated wet-season irrigation, surface drainage, and
partial flood control to 175,000 ha on the left bank (known as the Stage I
area). The project also included land classification of the entire Mae Klong
Plain (390,000 ha) and a feasibility study for a Stage II project. The
feasibility study under Ln. 394-TH was completed by RID in 1968 with the
assistance of advisers from the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR).
In their report, RID proposed construction of a multipurpose dam on the Kwae
Yai and an irrigation, drainage and road system to serve the Stage II area.
1.24      Concurrently, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
(EGAT) prepared a proposal for a dam at a different site on the Kwae Yai
which would supply sufficient water for the irrigation development proposed by
RID. The Government supported EGAT's proposal and in 1974, the Bank made a
loan of US$75 million for the Ban Chao Nen Hydroelectric Project (Ln. 977TH)
scheduled for completion in 1981. Also in 1974, the Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperatives (MOAC) commissioned consultants ILACO to further analyze the
land use, crop production and performance of existing irrigation works and to
review the plans for future development of irrigated agriculture in the
Mae Klong area. This study, financed from funds provided for consultant
services under Ln. 379-TH, was submitted to the Government at the end of 1974
and included a recommendation to develop the Malaiman area. Meanwhile, RID in
1970 began design and construction of the main canals and laterals to serve
the Stage II right bank area. In 1979, the Bank made a loan of US$80 million
to EGAT for the Khao Laem Hydroelectric Project (Ln.1770-TH). The project
involves construction of a storage dam on the Kwae Noi to be completed in
1984. The Ban Chao Nen (now renamed Srinagarind) and Khao Laem dams, together
will provide sufficient regulated flow in the Mae Klong River to irrigate all
of the Mae Klong Basin (400,000 ha)
1.25       In anticipation of the availability of dry-season water from these
dams, the Government took further steps to accelerate development of the
Basin. They arranged in 1977 for the Japanese International Cooperative
Assistance program to provide consultants, Sanyu, Inc. to carry out a
feasibility study for on-farm development of 50,000 ha in the Stage I area and
also to prepare a Master Development Plan for the Mae Klong Basin. In 1979,
RID with the assistance of ILACO prepared a project for completing the
irrigation and drainage system, with on-farm development, on 66,000 ha on
the right bank of the Mae Klong. Funds for this work were provided under
Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project II, Ln. 1468-TH. Subsequently, the
Bank made a loan of US$80 million for the Eleventh Irrigation Project
(Ln. 1787-TH), including US$60 million for the Mae Klong right bank area.



1.26       A feasibility study by ILACO of the Malaiman area, 175,000 ha in the
left bank Stage II area of Mae Klong, was completed in 1980 also using funds
from Loan 1468-TH. This study forms the basis for the proposed project.
Upland areas, where sugarcane is widely grown, account for about 60% of the
total area and paddy land the remaining 40%. In reviewing the study with
the Government it was decided to develop the paddy areas first since RID
already has considerable experience in the design and construction of
irrigation facilities for paddy land.  In contrast, more information is
needed on imodes of development and construction methods for on-farm
irrigation facilities for upland sugarcane areas and RID proposes to
establish a pilot project to study these aspects before developing the
sugarcane area. The proposed project would be a first phase in developing
paddy land in the Malaiman area.
2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01       The project area is located in the Central region of Thailand
about 100 km west of Bangkok and forms part of the Mae Klong River Basin, one
of the largest river basins in Thailand. The service area is situated in
Kanchanaburi and Suphanburi provinces in the Malaiman area on the left bank
of the Mae Klong river (see map 14432R).  The provincial capital of
Kanchanaburi, with a population of 50,000, is adjacent to the project area on
the Mae Klong river. Kanchanaburi, together with a number of district towns
scattered in and around the project area, offers banking, storage and
processing facilities, as well as supplies of inputs to the agricultural
areas. The project area is linked to Bangkok by good highway, railway and
waterway connections. Within the project area, a network of paved
provincial roads links all the district towns and numerous unpaved roads
provide reasonable access to the villages throughout the year.
Climate
2.02       The project area has a tropical and monsoonal climate with warm
temperatures throughout the year. The average annual rainfall is 1,100 mm
with about 85% occurring between May and October during the southwest monsoon.
However, dry periods of up to ten days are not uncommon during the wet season,
especially in June and July, and wet season rice frequently suffers signi-
ficant yield reductions due to both late planting and periodic drought. In
the dry season, irrigation is essential to ensure a rice crop.  Further
climatic details are given in Annex 2.
Topography, Drainage and Soils
2.03       The principal land forms of the project area consist of low, old
terrace lands merging into semi-recent terraces in the lWest Malaiman and an



- 9 -
alluvial flood plain in East M4alaiman.  A large alluvial fan separates these
two areas. The service area is generally flat and the land slopes gently
from south to north and from west to east. Surface drainage in
West Malaiman is generally good but in East Malaiman about 6,000 ha of
low-lying land is subject to flooding in wet season.
2.04       About 60% of the project area is located in East Malaiman where
soils are of marine alluvium. These are heavy clay soils of the Bang Phoe,
Bang Len and Rangsit series which have a generally high nutrient status and
are ideally suited to rice. In West Malaiman, old terrace soils occupy about
26% of the project area.  These are transitional sandy clay loams and clay
loams of the Korat and Roi Et series, suitable for both rice and upland crops.
Soils in the remaining 14% of the service area are of riverine alluvium.
These are heavy clay soils of the Ratchaburi series, ideally suited to rice.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.05       There are about 6,800 farm families who live and operate farms in
the project area. With an average family size of 6.5, the farming popula-
tion is about 44,000. Approximately 90% of farmers are owner-operators of
which about 15% rent additional land. Only 10% are tenant farmers who operate
under various share, cash and labor exchange arrangements. Farmers who reside
in the project area operate an average of about 4 ha inside the area and about
I ha on land that has recently been developed elsewhere. Most farmers grow
only a wet-season broadcast paddy crop and yields are low. Therefore, despite
the relatively large average farm size, the average per capita income is only
about US$210 and about 40% of the farm families have incomes below the
absolute poverty level (US$180 p.a.). Farmers in the project area are among
the poorest in the Central Region and farm incomes are similar to those in the
Northeast, Thailand-s poorest region. The farm size distribution has been
estimated from RID surveys (1979) and details are given in Table 2.1.
Existing Irrigation Facilities
2.06       The project area will benefit from part of a basin-wide system which
has been under construction since the 1960s (para. 1.15). A main feature of
the existing system is the Vajiralongkorn Diversion Dam on the Mae Klong River
about 14 km downstream from the town of Kanchanaburi (see map 14432R), which
was completed in 1970 as part of the Mae Klong Stage I project with assistance
from Ln. 394-TH.  This dam diverts water for wet season irrigation through
canals serving parts of the Mae Klong basin on both banks of the river. On
the left bank, a 3 km feeder canal delivers water to the Stage I area (para.
1.23) and to the recently constructed main and lateral canals serving about
4,000 ha in the western part of the proposed project area. RID began con-
struction of these canals in 1978, and to date, 48 km of main canals (IL and
2L) and 24 km of laterals have been built, all of which are concrete lined.
In the eastern part of the project area, no irrigation facilities have been
constructed but about 1,200 ha are irrigated in the dry season by pumping from
the Song Phi Nong River and adjacent natural streams.

3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01       The proposed project would provide irrigation and drainage for
27,000 ha on the left bank of the Mae Klong River in the Malaiman area
(Map 14432R). The project would include:
(a) construction of 19 km of main canals and service roads;
(b) construction of 164 km of lateral and sublateral canals and
service roads;
(c) improvement and enlargement of 70 km of inain and secondary
drains and construction of 130 km of new secondary drains; and
(d) tertiary canals, drains and farm roads for about 27,000 ha.
3.02      The project would also provide equipment for construction,
communication, operation and maintenance, and consulting services to assist
in the design and implementation of the project works and in the preparation
of future projects. In addition, a review would be made of RID-s organiza-
tion with a view to determining reorganization and training requirements.
Project Works
3.03       Hain and Lateral Canals.  The service area of the proposed project
includes 10,400 ha in West Malaiman and 16,500 ha in East Malaiman to be
served by the IL and 2L main canals respectively (see Map 14432R). Under the
project, the IL main canal would be extended by 16 km and a further 16 km of



- 11 -
laterals would be built.  The capacity of the existing lL canal, 18 cu mn/sec
at the head regulator, is sufficient for the 10,400 ha of paddy to be
irrigated from this canal. The existing part of the 2L canal also has
sufficient capacity for the purposes of this project and thus neither of the
existing canals require remodelling.  The 2L main canal would be extended by
about 3 km and 149 km of lateral and sublateral canals would be constructed
including the 5L-2L lateral (41 km). The design capacity of the 5L-2L lateral
(50 cu m/sec at the head regulator) would be sufficient to eventually irrigate
about 21,000 ha of uplands in addition to the 16,500 ha of paddy land to be
developed under the proposed project. The main canals and about 48% of the
laterals pass through permeable upland soils and would be concrete lined. The
remaining 52% of the lateral system would be located in heavy clay soils and
would be unlined. Service roads along main and lateral canals would be 5 m
wide and paved with a 20 cm laterite surface.
3.04       M4ain and Secondary Drains.  The service area of the proposed project
drains into the Song Phi Nong River. Under the project, about 70 km of
existing main drains would be enlarged with additional structures installed,
and 130 km of new secondary drains would be constructed. Provision would be
made to convey the runoff from the hills north and west of the project area
through a main drain, which would have a discharge capacity of 90 cu m/sec.
Drains would be designed to evacuate flood flows from a 10-year frequency
storm in 5 days.
3.05      On-farm Development.  The proposed level of on-farm development
is similar to that being implemented on the Mae Klong right hank under
Ln. 1787-TH. Tertiary canals would be provided to serve units of about 50 ha.
The maximum area served from one farm turnout would be about 4 ha and most
farmers would have direct access to irrigation water and drains. The average
ditch-to-drain spacing would be about 200 m. For mnost of the project area
farm roads, 3 m wide, would be provided along about 80% of the tertiaries.
However, for about 2,700 ha in East Malaiman, much of which has moderate
flooding in the wet season, farm roads would only be provided along about 50%
of the tertiaries. Wherever possible, canals, roads and drains would be
constructed along existing plot boundaries, and a minimum amount of boundary
realignment would be necessary. Rough land leveling would be provided only
in the vicinity of the new facilities and boundaries; any final leveling
necessary would be the responsibility of the farmers. Paddy land over most
of the project area is reasonably level and plots are generally large with
little fragmentation of holdings.
3.06       About 3,400 ha adjacent to the Song Phi Nong River in the eastern
part of the project area is below 2 m MSL and is regularly flooded in the wet
season to a depth of at least 1 meter. This situation will continue in the
future and no wet-season crop will be grown. Consequently, irrigation
facilities would be confined to feeder ditches and drains with an average
ditch-to-drain spacing of 250 m. Paddy-to-paddy irrigation would be practiced
within 50 ha service units. The system would permit irrigation by gravity of
the entire area in the dry season whereas at present only part of the area is
irrigated by pumping from the river and adjacent natural drains.

Water Supply, Demand and Quality
3.07       The M1ae Klong River hlas a catchinent area of 25,600 sq km above
Vajiralongkorn diversion dam with a rnean annual runoff of about 13,400 MCMI,
of which the Kwae Noi contributes about 50%, the Kwae Yai 40%, and other
tributaries 10%.  With the completion of the Ban Chao Nen and the Khao Laem
Multipurpose Dams by 1985, about 9,800 MCM1 of regulated flow would be
available at the Vajiralongkorn diversion dam.  Water requirements for
domestic and industrial uses, salinity and pollution control, and navigation
have been estimated at 2,600 MCM annually (including 1,000 MCM for Bangkok).
The remaining 7,200 MCM would be available for irrigation of about 310,000 ha
in the Mae Klong area.  Extensive sampling and detailed chemical analyses have
shown the water of the Kwae Yai and Kwae Noi to be of excellent quality for
sustained irrigation.
3.08       Irrigation demands for the project area were calculated for the
cropping patterns described in Chapter 5 and the crop calendar shown in
Figure 5.1. Irrigation requirements for land preparation and crop growth
(consumptive use minus effective rainfall plus percolation loss) were calcu-
lated on a monthly basis using appropriate crop factors. Land preparation and
nursery were estimated to take 60 days. Percolation losses for rice were
assumed at 1 mm/day during the dry season and 0.5 mm/day in the wet season.
The net annual irrigation requirements amount to about 375 MCM. The diversion
requirement was determined by applying the following efficiency factors:
Main canals and laterals          80%
Farm efficiency                   75%
Overall efficiency                60%
Annual irrigation diversion requirements would be about 630 MCM which,
together with an estimated 1,500 MCM required for the right bank Stage II
area, amounts to about 30% of the available regulated flow. Therefore a
substantial volume of regulated flow remains available for further develop-
ment of the basin.
Status of Designs
3.09       The alignment of main and lateral canals and drains and the
location of major structures are based on 1:10,000 scale maps supplemented by
strip surveys at a scale of 1:4,000. RID's survey division will survey all of
the project service area in 1981 and new 1:4,000 scale maps will be prepared
for on-farm development designs. Detailed designs for the IL main canal and
the associated laterals and 3 km of the 2L main canal to be built under the
project together witlh the first 33 km of the 5L-2L lateral canal will be
completed in March 1981. Quantities and cost estimates for tertiary
development are based on detailed designs for similar areas in the Chao Phya
Irrigation Project II (Ln 1468-TH).



- 13 -
3.10       Preparation of Future Irrigation Projects.  The Government has
requested that provisioni be made in the loana for financing the detailed prepa-
ration of other irrigation projects. These projects would be selected and
the scope of studies decided by RID after consultation with the Bank.
Projects already identified as having high priority for detailed preparation
are the Mae Yom and Mae Kok Projects in Nortlhern Thailand. A 1968 feasibility
study of thie Mae Yom Project was updated in 1980. The project includes a dam
on the Yom river which would irrigate about 90,000 ha.  Further work would
include detailed design and contract documents for the dam. The Mae Kok
project includes a dam and distribution system to irrigate about 20,000 ha.
*fi        The project costs and benefits as presented in a 1970 feasibility study would
be updated. Subject to confirmation of the project's economic viability,
detailed designs and contract documents would be prepared for the dam and for
the initial stages of the irrigation system. Other activities might include
preparation of detailed designs and contract documents for selected medium-
scale irrigation projects and a study of small-scale irrigation.  Consulting
services for the above work would be provided by foreign firms in association
with local consultants. Funds would also be available to finance baseline
surveys to be carried out by local consultants.
Project Implementation
3.11      The project would be constructed over a period of five years begin-
ning in the 1981/82 dry season (Figure 3.1). The first contract for the
remaining 19 km of the main canals and for the first 25 km of the 5L-2L
lateral would be awarded by September 1981. Subsequent contracts would be
awarded as designs are completed. Work on drains and on-farm development
would start in 1982. Construction of main and lateral canals and drains would
proceed throughout the year, but earthmoving operations would be slowed down
and sometimes suspended for short periods during the wet season (July through
October).  On-farm development would be confined to the dry season to avoid
interference with the wet season crop.
Cost Estimates
3.12      Total project costs in 1981 prices are estimated at US$115 million,
with a foreign exchange component of US$57 million, or 50% of total cost.
Construction costs are based on quantity and unit price estimates prepared by
RID and include about 10% for taxes and duties. Unit prices are in line with
recent bid prices for similar work in Thailand updated to mid-1981.  Details
of the cost estimates for the major work items are shown in Annex 1. Physical
contingencies of 15% have been added to all civil works costs. Estimated
price increases were derived by applying the following annual rates of price
escalation:

Foreign costs   9.0   8.5   7.5   7.5   7.5   6.0
These rates of inflation have been applied to all items of expenditure.
Expected price increases amount to US$24.7 million, or 27% of base cost plus
physical contingencies.  A summary of project costs is given in Table 3.1.

Financing
3.13       The Bank loan of UJS$57.0 million would finance the foreign exchange
requirement of the project. The Government's contribution of US$58.0 million
(B 1,160.0 million) would finance the balance of project costs through annual
budgetary allocations to RID.



- 15 -
Procurement
3.14      I-ost of the project's civil works would be carried out by contract
in accordance with RID's policy of reducing the share of its construction
program carried out by force account. Construction of all canals, laterals
and on-farm works, and expansion of main drains would be carried out by
contract. Force account would be employed only for secondary drainage works
(US$6 million).
3.15      The total value of civil works contracts would be US$80 million
(including physical contingencies and expected price increases). The value
of civil works contracts would range between US$0.5 million and about US$25
million. Construction of main and lateral canals (US$39 million) and main
drains (US$17 million) would each be packaged into two or three contracts and
these would be awarded following ICB according to Bank Group Guidelines. The
size and phasing of contracts for construction of on-farm works (US$24
million) would be dictated largely by the rate at which mapping, detailed
designs and specifications can be prepared and right-of-way obtained. Also,
on-farm works need to be coordinated with the construction of laterals and
drains and scheduled to permit farmers access to their land at least during
the wet season; these works would be divided into about 10 contracts and
carried out in blocks of about 3,000 ha.  Experience in Thailand has shown
that contracts of this size are of little interest to international
contractors. Therefore, contracts for on-farm works and buildings (US$1
million), would be awarded following competitive bidding in accordance with
local procedures. Contracts would be advertised in Thai and English in the
local press and documents would be in English. Foreign firms would, however,
be eligible to bid. RID's local contracting procedures, which have been
followed on several Bank-assisted projects to date, are satisfactory.
3.16      Vehicles and equipment (US$2.7 million including expected price
increases) would be procured following international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. A 15% preference margin, or the
prevailing customs duty if lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in
the evaluation of bids. Vehicles and equipment costing less than US$20,000
each and limited to a total of US$300,000, which would not be practicable
for international tendering, would be purchased through normal government
procurement procedures (local competitive bidding or competitive quotations)
which ensure adequate competition. A list of equipment requirements is given
in Annex 1, Table 5.
Disbursements
3.17       Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made against 100% of
foreign exchange cost of directly imported vehicles and equipment, 100% of the
ex-factory price for items manufactured locally, and 65% of the total costs
for other items procured locally. For consultants' services, disbursements
would equal 100% of total expenditures. Disbursements for civil works would



- 16 -
be at 52% of total contract expenditures, to be disbursed against periodic
contractors  progress payments.  There would be no disbursement for construc-
tion of secondary drains which would be carried out by force account. It is
expected that disbursements would be completed by June 30, 1987.  Estimated
schedules of expenditure, disbursements and the proposed allocation of the
proceeds of the loan are presented in Annex 1.
Project Cost Accounting
3.18      RID would maintain accounts in sufficient detail to record all
expenditures for force account construction and payments to civil works
contractors, equipment suppliers and consultants.  RID-s annual progress
report would show these expenditures, both annual and cumulative. For civil
works, the expenditure would be broken down according to the major elements of
the irrigation systems, such as main canals, laterals, drains, tertiary
systems, etc.
Environmental Effects
3.19      The project would have a beneficial effect on the environment by
providing a year-round water supply in an area presently dependent on
uncertain rainfall.  Its adverse effects would not be significant.  The
project area is already flooded for paddy cultivation for about six months
every year so that double cropping is not expected to increase the farmers
exposure to waterborne diseases or malaria. Drainage improvements would
reduce flooding. The canals would not be used for drinking water since the
villagers rely on wells and rainwater for domestic use. Schistosomiasis is
not present in the project area. A major emphasis in Thailand's rice-breeding
program is to produce disease- and pest-resistant varieties; therefore, chem-
icals to control pests and diseases would only be used sparingly by farmers in
the project are.a and no significant environmental damage is expected.
4.  ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
The Royal Irrigation Department
4.01      The Royal Irrigation Department (RID) would be responsible for
project implementation. RID is now organized in 22 functional divisions and
12 regional offices, under a Director-General (Figure 4.1). Three Deputy
Directors General and two Chief Engineers assist the Director General in the
management of the Department. RID, together with most of the agriculture-
related government agencies, falls under the Ministry of Agriculture and
Cooperatives (Figure 4.2).
4.02      For recent Bank-financed irrigation projects, RID has adopted a
system of project management which is aimed at placing all aspects of project
implementation under the control of a Project Manager. He reports to a Deputy



- 17 -
Director General who acts as Project Director responsible for overall direc-
tion, for day-to-day management and for coordination with the consultants, the
functional divisions, and other government agencies.  Thus, while much of the
work continues to be done by the different organizational units, their
activities are coordinated and carried out in a logical sequence.  RID intends
to adopt the same organizational arrangements for the proposed project as for
the Eleventh Irrigation project financed under Loan 1787-TH (Mae Klong Right
Bank) for which the Deputy Director General (Construction) acts as Project
Director. As far as possible, the same key officials would be retained but
with additional staff to handle the extra work load. A Project Engineer would
be appointed to coordinate field operations.  An assurance was obtained at
negotiations that a Project Director, a Project Manager and a Project Engineer
would be appointed for the proposed project.
4.03       The size of RID and its range of responsibilities have increased
enormously in recent years but there has been no corresponding change in the
structure of the organization. Concern about the efficiency of RID led to an
Administrative and Organization Study which was carried out by consultants
financed under Loan 1149-TH and completed in mid-1979. The consultants'
recommendations would retain the existing organization along functional lines
but would provide a more logical grouping of the different branches, strength-
ening of senior and middle management levels and a clearer definition of the
responsibilities of the Deputy Directors General and Chief Engineers. The
consultants also recommended improvements in planning and budgeting and a
closer monitoring of the implementation and impact of irrigation projects. To
be effective, these changes would also have to be accompanied by improvements
in the quality of staff through training and better promotion prospects. RID
has submitted proposals to the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC)
based upon the consultants' recommendations and the Administrative Committee
for Foreign Loans in Irrigation in MOAC has set up a Subcommittee for the
Reorganization of RID to consider these changes. Agreement was obtained at
negotiations that RID would (a) review with the Bank by September 30, 1981,
its proposals with respect to the consultants' recommendations; (b) prepare a
Plan of Action for review with the Bank by January 31, 1982; and that (c) the
Government would, after review of the Plan of Action with the Bank, take
appropriate steps to implement the plan in a timely manner.
Consulting Services
4.04       RID would retain consultants, a foreign firm in association with
local consultants, to assist in the preparation of designs and contract docu-
ments, in the supervision of construction, in the establishment of operation
and maintenance programs, and to assist in project monitoring and evaluation.
It is planned to have virtually all detailed design work carried out by
consultants.  The estimated consultant input is 185 man-months of expatriate



- 1i -
staff and 430 man-months of local engineers and technicians for project
implementation.  Funds would also be available for consultants to assist RID
in the planning, design and preparation of contract documents for future
irrigation projects in Thailand (para. 3.10), and for assistance in imple-
menting reorganizational requirements including necessary training
(para. 4.03). The relative input of foreign and local consultants for such
assistance cannot yet be determined since it will depend on the scope of
work. However, the requirement has been roughly estimated at about 275 man-
months of expatriate and 260 man-months of local staff. The estimated
average man-month cost, in 1981 prices, is $6,700 ($11,500 for expatriates /1
and $4,500 for local consultants). Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that all consultants would be employed on terms and conditions acceptable to
the Bank. Appointment of consultants for project implementation would be
a condition of effectiveness of the loan.
Agricultural Supporting Services
4.05      Extension.  The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) is pri-
marily responsible for providing agricultural advice to farmers in the project
areas. The extension services of DAE are currently being expanded and
strengthened under a country-wide program in two phases: National Agricultural
Extension Projects I and II (Loans 1393-TH and 1752-TH). The first phase is
being implemented over the five-year period 1977-81 and phase two started in
1980 and is due to be completed in 1984. These projects will provide one
extension agent for every 1,000 farm families with technical support from
subject matter specialists. Farmer groups in irrigation areas will be based
on the tertiary service unit as opposed to the tambon in rainfed areas. The
activities of field extension workers and RID's O&M staff will be closely
coordinated (para. 4.11). The project area includes parts of Suphanburi and
Kanchanaburi provinces. The new extension program is already operative in
Suphanburi and will cover Kanchanaburi under Phase II in 1981.
4.06      Research.  The rice division of the Ministry of Agriculture operates
the main rice research station for the central region at Suphanburi, adjacent
to the project area. The main emphasis of the work on rice on this station is
on varietal screening, production of foundation seed, fertilizer trials and
pest and disease control. RID maintains an irrigation research station at
Kamphaeng Saen, just south of the project area, where work is focussed on
irrigation water use and seed multiplication. The project area is adequately
provided with information on the current technology of rice cultivation.
4.07      Seed.  A total of about 2,900 tons of rice seed is used in the proj-
ect area annually. Most of the seed is obtained by retention from the
farmers' commercial production. At full development, the project would use
approximately 2,050 tons of rice seed per annum. As a result of switching
from broadcasting to transplanting and improved seed quality and water
control, there would be a decrease in the existing 75 to 125 kg/ha seed rate
/1 Includes international travel and subsistence.



- 19 -
to 45 kg/ha.  Assuming that rice seed would be replaced every six crops, the
estimated annual seed requirement at full development wouldi be about 340 tons.
In order to meet these requirements, about 100 ha would have to be devoted to
seed production each cropping season.  Foundation seed would be supplied by
the Suphanburi Rice Research Station and seed bulking would be carried out
by RID's research station at Kamphaen Saen and by selected seed growers under
the supervision of the Seed Multiplication Division of DAE. These
arrangements are adequate to meet the project-s requirements for improved
seed.
4.08      Fertilizer.  At present, fertilizer use in the project area is con-
fined to about 6,300 ha of transplanted rice; annual fertilizer consumption
amounts to 220 tons.  Virtually all fertilizer used is ammonium phosphate
(16:20:0). Application rates are low, averaging only 30-50 kg/ha. At full
development the project would require about 11,800 tons of fertilizer. Ammo-
nium phosphate would account for 74% of the total requirements and urea for
the remaining 26%. In terms of nutrients, the average application per
hectare for each crop would be about 35 kg of nitrogen and 20 kg of phosphoric
acid for local improved varieties and 60-79 kg nitrogen and 40 kg phosphoric
acid for 1HYVs.  Although the present demand for fertilizer in the project area
is negligible, fertilizers are widely used in adjacent large areas of sugar-
cane. The existing fertilizer distribution network is adequate and could be
easily expanded to meet increased demand in the future.
4.09      Credit.  Under existing rainfed conditions in the project area, with
low use of inputs, there is little demand for production credit.  Nevertheless
about 70% of farmers do obtain some credit and institutional sources are
accounting for a growing proportion of borrowings. At present, the Bank for
Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) accounts for about 25% of
borrowings in the project area, other institutional lenders a further 25%,
relatives and neighbors 20%, seller's credits 20%, and merchants and landlords
10%. BAAC is well represented in the project area and lends both directly to
farmers and indirectly through cooperatives, farmers- associations and
farmers' groups. The recent Agricultural Credit Project (Loan 1816-TH) is
aimed at strengthening BAAC and the institutions through which it lends to
farmers. The long-term objective is for BAAC to act as an apex lending agency
which would lend money only to other institutions for on-lending to farmers.
It is anticipated that, in the future, most credit to farmers would come from
BAAC. With the development of irrigation, the demand for short-term credit
from BAAC and other institutional sources is expected to increase from about
B 13 million to B 175 million at full development (in 1981 prices). An
assurance was obtained from the Government at negotiations that BAAC would
make additional staff and funds available to meet the additional credit
requirements in the project area.
Operation and Maintenance
4.10      RID would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
irrigation system down to the farm turnouts, the service roads, and the main
and collector drainage system. Consultant assistance would be provided to



- 20
assist RID in developing O&H procedures for the project.  An amount of US$1.2
million would be provided in the loan for the purchase of O&M equipment to
strengthen RID's capacity for O&M work (Annex 1, Table 5). The annual cost
of operating and maintaining the project facilities for which RID would be
responsible is estimated at US$18/ha on average.
4.11       RID is engaged in a program to strengthen its O&M capability with
bilateral aid. French assistance through Fonds d'Aide et de la Cooperation
Economique has been obtained to undertake a study of maintenance procedures
and three engineers from RID are currently undergoing training in France.
In addition, a request has been made to the Japanese International
Cooperative Assistance program for assistance in setting up an O&M training
center in the M4aeklong area.
4.12       Operation and maintenance of the systems below the farm turnout
would be the responsibility of the farmers, who would form water users' asso-
ciations. RID, with consultant assistance, would promote the establishment of
the water users' associations and provide them with technical assistance.  The
farmers in each group would elect a group leader and a common irrigator who
would be responsible for operating the on-farm works and for ensuring that
maintenance is carried out. RID would coordinate the activities of its O&M
staff with those of the field extension staff of DAE. One set of farmers'
groups based on the tertiary service unit would be used for both water manage-
ment and extension purposes.  Joint visits by O&M personnel and extension
workers would be regularly scheduled to advise farmers on irrigation and crop-
ping schedules and operation and maintenance of on-farm irrigation and drain-
age systems. RII) has recently initiated similar organizational arrangements
in the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Projects I and II (Loans 397-TH and
1468-TH) and results to date are encouraging.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.13       The Economics Branch of RID's Planning Division would be respon-
sible for monitoring project implementation. The Irrigated Agronomy Branch
of RID's O&M division would assist in data collection. A program to
strengthen these two units is being set up, with assistance from consultants,
under the Eleventh Irrigation Project (Loan 1787-TH). Consulting services
for tlle proposed project would include periodic visits by a monitoring
specialist to provide continuing support for RID's monitoring unit. Biannual
reports on monitoring would be produced by RID and would be made available to
the Bank upon request. Evaluation of the project would be carried out by the
Office of Agricultural Economics in MOAC, whose reports would also be
available to the Bank.
5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Present Cropping Patterns
5.01      About 25,000 ha of rice are cultivated in the wet season in the
project area.  Dry season cropping is confined to about 1,200 ha near the Song
Phi Nong River where one crop a year is grown by pumping from the river and



a(djacent drains. Part of the Past falaiman area is regularly flooded in the
wet season fromn the Song Phi Nong River and floating rice varieties are grown
on about 2,200 ha of deeply flooded land close to the river. Broadcast
deep-water rice is grovwn over the remainder of the project area in the wet
season. With limited access, lack of drainage and dependence on rainfall,
farmers try to minimaize risks and consequently use few inputs. Planting takes
place in June/July and most of tne crop is harvested in November/December,
althouglh harvest in the floating rice area continues through January.
Transplanting is confined to about 5,000 ha (incluiding 4,000 ha partially
irrigated from the existing 1L canal).  Tligh yielding varieties are grown only
in the small area cropped in the dry season.  Planting takes place in
March/April and the crop is harvested in July/August. In East MIalaiman, about
900 ha of transitional clay soils are currently planted to sugar cane.
Planting is restricted to the period April-June, to correspond with the start
of the rainy season. Harvest of the plant crop takes place during the dry
season between December and April, and consequently the first crop is taken in
less than 12 months, resulting in low yields and sugar content.
Future Cropping Patterns
5.02       In the absence of the project there would be no significant change
in cropping patterns. However, some increase in dry season cropping would be
possible in the area served by the recently constructed 1L canal system and
the dry season cropping intensity would increase from the existing 5% to about
15%.
5.03      WIith the project, the irrigated cropped area in the wet season
would be about 12,000 ha, of which about 20,000 ha would also be cropped in
the dry season.  This includes about 900 ha currently planted with sugarcane
which would convert to paddy once a reliable water supply becomes available.
The remaining 3,300 ha would continue to be flooded in the wet season when
only floating rice would be grown. However, the long growth period of
floating rice would make double cropping difficult, and yields would be low.
Consequently, when irrigation is available, farmers are expected to grow a
single dry season crop on this 3,300 ha. Thus, the total dry season cropped
area would be 23,300 ha and the cropping intensity would increase from 100% to
178%. A reliable water supply and improved drainage would enable farmers to
grow a high proportion of high yielding semidwarf varieties (HYVs). In the
wet season, about 70% of the cropped area would be planted to semidwarf I-YVs
(RD7, RD9) in areas free from flooding.  The remaining 30% would be local deep
water varieties together with some newly released HYVs (RD17, RDl9) which grow
well in up to 1 meter of water. In the dry season, semi-dwarf HYVs (RD7, RD9)
would be grown exclusively.  Present and projected cropping patterns and
production are shown in Table 5.1.

Yields and Production
5.04      Present and projected yields are shown in Table 5.2.  Given improve-
ments in the extension service and adequate supplies of credit and inputs,
good water control would result in projected yields being reached in the sixth
year after completion of project works.  Yield increases would result from the
provision of irrigation and drainage, increased planting of HYVs, better
quality seed, heavier fertilizer inputs and improved weed and pest control.
Yields are based on results from the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project
(Cr. 379-TH) where soils and climate are similar to those in the project area.
As a result of the project, paddy production would increase from about 35,000
tons at present to 166,000 tons at full development.
Cropping Calendar
5.05      Figure 5.1 shows a proposed crop calendar.  The main difference
between the proposed calendar and existing practice is the expansion of dry-
season cropping.  Floating rice would no longer be grown and the adoption of

early maturing, photoinsensitive TIYVs would shorten the cropping period for
much of the area in the wet season. In the dry season, the current calendar
would be brought forward by about two months to avoid the need to harvest in
months of heavy rain.
Farm Mechanization
5.06       Land preparation in the project area is already highly mechanized
with about 80% of the cropped area cultivated by tractor. Both four-wheel
(40-60 hp) and two-wheel (8-15 hp) tractors are used. The machinery is
largely owned by farmers and contracted out to their neighbors. With better
water management, improved access, the need for tighter scheduling of
operations and increased cropping intensities, it is estimated that land
preparation would be fully mechanized in future, as it is now in the area
of the first Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project (Cr. 379-TH).
5.07      Manual lharvesting by sickle is expected to continue in the future.
At present, over 50% of the paddy crop is threshed mechanically. Under
project conditions of better access and improved drainage, it is assumed that
mechanical threshing would be used on 90% of the area.
Drying, Storage and Processing
5.08      Depending on weather conditions, harvested paddy may be allowed to
dry in the field for a day or two before threshing. After threshing the paddy
is sun-dried on whatever suitable surfaces are available.  Ilost of the larger
rice mills have concrete drying floors. Sun-drying of paddy will continue
under the project but additional drying floor space would be needed to
accommodate increased yields. Similarly, storage capacity, which is ample for
the present level of production would need to be expanded in the future.



- 24 -
Farmers can increase their own storage capacity without difficulty and
additional 'sulk storage facilities will be provided by cooperative warehouses
now being built as part of a countrywide government-sponsored program.  There
are about 270 privately-owned rice mills in the project area with a total
annual capacity of over 216,000 tons of paddy whereas the present annual
production in the project area is only about 35,000 tons. However, these
mills also cater to the needs of farmers outside the project area and some
additional milling capacity would be required at full development. The
private sector can he expected to neet any additional milling requirements
without difficulty.
6. MARKETS, PRICES, INCOtES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01       Over the past 20 years, the domestic consumption of rice in Thailand
has increased at about 3.5% p.a. while production has grown at around 3% p.a.
Rice exports have fluctuated greatly over the same period although there was
an overall upward trend to an average level of about 2.0 million tons p.a. in
the late 1970s.  The incremental production of 125,000 tons of paddy,
equivalent to 80,000 tons of rice, at full development of the project, would
constitute about 0.6% of projected national production in 1990 and should not
have a significant effect on either domestic or export prices.
6.02       Paddy production is at present sufficient to meet the consumption
needs of the rural population in the project area and to satisfy part of the
demand of adjacent urban areas.  However, farmers with small holdings some-
times have to purchase additional rice. The projected marketable surplus can
be disposed of in the nearby urban areas, in the adjoining sugar producing
areas where farmers grow little or no rice, and in the Bangkok domestic and
export market. Transport costs to Bangkok are low because of the
well-developed road, rail and waterway network.
Prices
6.03      The price structure for rice and paddy used in the economic and
financial analyses is presented in Table 6.1. Future prices are based on
the Bank's commodity price forecasts, adjusted for grade differences, and
expressed in 1981 constant prices. The present and future average export
prices for 5% broken rice (f.o.b. Bangkok) are US$540/ton and US$630/ton.
The present farm gate price is B 3,400/ton and is expected to rise to
B 4,000/ton by 1990.
6.04       Fxport quality and prices are largely determined by international
markTet forces, although the composition of exports by grade depends on weather
conditions at harvest time. Government intervention in the form of the rice
export premium and other taxes, partially intended to stabilize domestic
consumer prices, has resulted in depressed farm-gate prices. Domestic prices
are further held down by the Government-s requiring exporters to retain and
store a specified quantity and grade of rice for each ton exported. The

present reserve requirement is 0.6 ton for each ton of white rice exported.
The reserve, which must be made available to the Government on demand at a
fixed price, is mainly released through special outlets in urban areas to
control retail prices and the remainder is used for Government-to-Government
sales.
6.05      In 1978, the Government began to use part of the proceeds from the
export premium to support farm-gate paddy prices by open narket purchase and
storage. Responsibility for price support lay initially with the Marketing
Organization for Farmers within the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives
but the quantities bought were insufficient to influence market prices.  In
1980, the Ministry of Commerce took over responsibility for price support, and
public warehouse capacity is being increased to allow storage of a larger
buffer stock. Exporters have also been instructed to build up their warehouse
capacity and will be required to purchase rice if the price falls below a
predetermined level. These changes are intended to stabilize and boost
domestic prices, thereby increasing the farmers' incentive to grow paddy.
6.06      The present and future economic prices were derived by taking the
weighted average f.o.b. price and working back to the farm-gate, excluding
taxes and the rice premium and adjusting domestic costs by applying specific
conversion factors to express all local costs in border price equivalents
(Annex 4, Table 1). The resulting economic farm-gate prices are B 6,000/ton
and B 6,900/ton for present and future respectively (in 1981 constant prices).
Farm Incomes
6.07      Farm budgets have been prepared for three farm models, representing
typical farms of different sizes and cropping systems. It is assumed that
family labor contributes 60 man-days/month and that labor is hired only when
demand exceeds the estimated family labor supply in a given month. Hired
labor is costed at B 30/man-day. Project charges at the levels shown in para.
6.12 have been assumed in the farm budget analysis. Paddy production in the
project area is expected to increase nearly five-fold (Table 5.1) but average
household income would only increase about three-fold due to a reduction in
income from other sources and the need to hire more labor with the project.
A summary of the farm buidget analysis is presented in Table 6.2 and shows that
the project would increase farm incomes by between 110 and 220% in nonflooded
areas and by about 60% in areas which are prone to flooding and where only a
dry season crop will be grown.
6.08      Table 6.2 indicates that, at present, farm families with less than
2.5 ha of land in the project area generally have incomes below the level of
absolute poverty, taking account of income from livestock, land outside the
project area and off-farm income. Farm size data in Table 2.1 shows that
approximately 40% of farm families have holdings smaller than 2.5 ha and this
represents the proportion of farm families that are among the absolute poor.
At full development, this figure would decrease to about 10%. Similarly, over
90% of farmers in the area at present have incomes below the relative poverty
level and, at full development, this proportion would fall to 40%.

Project Charges
6.09      In 1975, the Thai Parliament passed the Land Consolidation Act which
provided for the recovery of up to 90% of the cost of constructing common
tertiary facilities, the full cost of land levelling,/l and the full cost of
O&M for on-farm facilities. This legislation only applies to designated land
consolidation areas which were originally defined as those with full boundary
realignment and land levelling. The definition has recently been relaxed,
however, and the Act can now be invoked with or without full boundary realign-
ment and land levelling, provided 70% of farmers have irrigation ditches
directly serving their plots. These criteria are mnet in many irrigated areas
in Thailand and would also be met under the proposed project. The cost of
tertiary facilities, including land levelling, typically represents 25-30% of
the total cost of irrigation systems and thus the cost recovery index
obtainable under the Land Consolidation Act is about 25%.
6.10      On the basis of a cost recovery study carried out by MOAC for the
Chao Phya I project area (Cr. 379-TH), the Government proposed an annual fee
of B 690/ha (US$34.5) which was also adopted for the adjacent Chao Phya II
project area (Loan 1468-TH).  They estimated that for the Chao Phya II area,
this fee would recover from beneficiaries approximately 50% of the total cost
of on-farm development, over a period of 15 years with an interest rate of
12% and a two-year grace period.
/1 Terms of repayment, such as interest rates, are not specified in the
legislation.



- 28 -
6.11       The Irrigation Act provides for collection of O&M fees for facil-
ities not covered by the Land Consolidation Act.  However, the maximum fee
permitted is inadequate and there is no provision for capital cost recovery.
The Government intends to submit to the National Assembly in 1981 an amendment
to the Irrigation Act which would allow for both capital cost recovery and
adequate 0&M fees for all irrigation facilities. The proposed amendment
would be in compliance with a covenant under the Northeast Irrigation Project
II (Loan 1630-TH).
6.12       In order to assess the level at which charges should be set for the
present project, a cost recovery analysis has been carried out on the basis of
the estimated project cost (Table 6.3). In this analysis, it is assumed that
farmers would pay the full cost of O&M for the main system B 350/ha/year, and
50% of the total cost of on-farm development, B 1,200/ha/year in 1981 prices.
Based on these charges, the rent recovery index would range from 20% to 25%.
These figures are considered reasonable since, at full development of the
project, farm incomes are expected to be below the relative poverty level for
about 40% of farmers (i.e. those with less than 2 ha of land in the project
area).  The cost recovery index, based on these direct charges, would be 13%.
6.13      At present the Government imposes taxes on exported rice amounting
to about B 1,200/ton and this is expected to increase to B 1,250/ton by 1990,
in 1981 prices.  These indirect taxes on incremental production should be
taken into account when considering the policy for cost recovery on irriga-
tion projects. An analysis has been carried out taking into account the rice
premium and export duty, and assuming that all incremental production due to
the project would be available for export. In the absence of direct charges,
the rent recovery indices would be 40-45% and the cost recovery index 74%.
Combining direct and indirect charges on farmers, the rent recovery index
would increase to about 65% for each typical farm and the cost recovery index
to 87%, which would be quite satisfactory and acceptable. Final determination
of the level of direct charges would be made by the Central Office of Land
Consolidation when the actual costs of on-farm works on the first 3,000 ha
are available.
6.14      Assurances were obtained at negotiations that:
(a) RID would prepare and submit to the Bank for review and comment by
June 30, 1982, proposals for the amount of 0&M fee to be levied
on project beneficiaries and the mechanism by which such fees
would be collected;
(b) subject to (a) above, RID would impose and collect an agreed O&M
fee, commencing one year after completion of the tertiary system in
the blocks of 1,000 ha;
(c)  on the basis of data collected for project monitoring, RID would
assess the capital costs of the project and estimate charges that
would recover at least 50% of on-farm development costs plus a

7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      General.  The proposed project would increase cropping intensities
and yields for about 27,000 ha of paddy land. At full development, the
incremental annual production of rice would be about 80,000 tons, resulting in
net annual foreign exchange earnings of about US$40 million in 1981 prices,
before repayment of the Bank loan. Approximately 6,800 farm families would
benefit directly from the project and the average capital cost per farm family
would be US$12,500 in 1981 financial prices. About 40% of these families
would, in the absence of the project, remain in absolute poverty. The project
would generate demand for an additional 3.0 million man-days of labor per
year, much of which would be met by the 2,000 landless agricultural households
in the project area. The project would therefore meet Government objectives
of improving the balance of payments and raising the incomes of the poorest of
the rural population.
7.02      Distribution of Benefits.  Initially farmers will benefit from the
project roughly in proportion to the area of land they cultivate. However,
over time, the distribution of benefits can be expected to be more favorable
than indicated by the size distribution of farm holdings (Table 2.1) because:
(a) farmers with relatively small holdings, as well as landless households,
may rent land from farmers with larger holdings; (b) cropping intensities are
likely to be higher on small farms than large farms; and (c) there will be a
trend towards subdivision of the larger holdings among adult family members or
through sale to others, because of the demanding management requirements for
intensive year-round activities. The effect of these factors cannot be
readily predicted, but it is likely to be significant. Where farmers with
larger holdings lease out land, some additional income would accrue to them in
the form of rent. However, current rental rates for Bank-financed projects in
the Chao Phya suggests that less than 20% of cash income would be paid in rent
and so most of the additional income would accrue to the tenant, not the owner
of the land.
7.03      At present, about 40% of farmers in the project area have incomes
below the absolute poverty level (US$180 p.a. per capita) and nearly all have
incomes below the national average (US$580 p.a.).  Farmers in albsoluxte poeTty
cultivate about 15% of the land in the area and so, if benefits are assumed to



- 31 -
accrue in proportion to the area of land cultivated, the ahsolute poor will
receive 15% of the benefits (excluding those accruing to the Government in the
form of export taxes, etc.). However, for the reasons discussed above, the
proportion of benefits to the absolute poor is expected to be much higher than
15%.
7.04      Incomes in the proposed project area are lower than in the rest of
Malaiman and this is partly why it was decided to develop this area first. At
present, there is no double cropping and a single wet-season paddy crop is
grown on 90% of the area. Because water levels are uncontrolled, broadcast
rice predominates and yields are therefore low, despite the excellent soil
quality. This explains why few farmers in the project area are wealthy
despite the large average farm size.
7.05      Foreign Exchange.  The unit of account used in appraising the
project is uncommitted foreign exchange in the hands of the Government,
expressed in terms of local currency. All tradeable components are valued
directly in foreign exchange and converted to local currency at the official
exchange rate and adjusted for local transport and handling. Specific
conversion factors for a number of broad categories of goods and services
produced or consumed by the project have been used to express all nontradeable
inputs and outputs in terms of the common unit of account (Annex 4, Table 1).
7.06      Farm Labor.  There are about 6,800 farm families and 2,000 landless
agricultural households in the project area, with an average family size of
about 6.5. With 2.5 workers per family, the total agricultural lahor force is
about 22,000 and the labor supply, assuming 24 workdays per month, is about
530,000 man-days per month, or 6.3 million man-days per year.  Estimated labor
requirements in the project area are given in Annex 4, Table 3. Although
annual labor requirements are 30% below annual supply, there will be a local
shortage of labor in the peak months of February, June and December. However,
there should be no problem hiring labor from the surrounding areas. The
demand for labor in the area is quite high because of the labor requirements
of the major sugarcane-producing area located immediately adjacent to the
project area. As a result, prevailing wage rates for rice farms in the area
indicates an average wage of about B 30/day. In view of the high demand for
labor in the sugar areas, this is believed to reflect closely the opportunity
cost of unskilled labor in the vicinity of the project.
7.07      Production and Benefits.  The economic prices for various inputs are
given in Annex 3, Table 1. Details of estimated production and corresponding
economic benefits, both with and without the project, are given in Annex 4,
Table 2, a summary of which is given in Table 7.1. The value of agricultural
production, net of production costs, is seen to increase with the project from
B 213 million (US$10.7 million) to B 828 million (US$41.4 million), an
increase of B 615 million (US$30.7 million). About B 258 million (US$12.9
million) or 42% of the net annual benefit is expected to derive from the area
served by the IL canal and the remainder from that served by the 2L canal.

7.08      Project Costs.  In the economic analysis, taxes have been excluded
and local costs have been multiplied by the conversion factor for construction
(0.74). The total capital cost of the project, in economic accounting prices,
is B 1,370 million (US$68.5 million) in 1981 constant prices. The estimated
annual economic cost of O&M for the main system is B 300/ha or US$15/ha.
Costs of O&M for the tertiary system were included in farm production costs.
7.09      Development Period.  All works under the proposed project would be
completed by mid-1986 in time for the 1986 wet-season crop. Beginning with
the first crop grown under project conditions, farmers would achieve projected
full production levels over six years. Both project components would achieve
full development benefits with the 1991 dry-season crop.
7.10       Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and dis-
counting costs and benefits over a 30-year evaluation period, the economic
rate of return (ERR) for the proposed project is 23%. The ERR for the area
served by the 1L canal is 25%, and for that served by the 2L canal, it is 22%.
The net present value of the project is B 1,273 million (US$63.7 million)
which is 57% of the present value of the capital costs.
7.11       Sensitivity of the Economic Rate of Return.  Tests were carried out
to examine the sensitivity of the ERR to the assumed value of different
variables. As a measure, the crossover value was used, defined as the value
of the variable tested for which the net present value, using a 12% discount
rate, was zero. The crossover value may be interpreted as the value of the
variable tested beyond which the economic rate of return would fall below 12%.
The results are presented in Annex 4, Table 5 and discussed below:
(a) Project yields. The project is not very sensitive with respect to
yields. Even if yields were to be 30% lower than anticipated,
the rate of return would still be 12%;



- 33 -
(b)  Dry season cropping intensity.  In nonflooded areas, where there
will he some double cropping, dry season cropping is assumed for
20,O0o ha, or an average of 78% of the net irrigable area. The
ERR would fall to 12% if the cropped area were to be only 2,800 ha
in the dry season and this is deeemed very unlikely;
(c)  World market price of rice.  The f.o.b. price of rice (5% broken)
in Bangkok is assumed to be US$630/ton in 1990 at 1981 price levels.
The cross-over value would be US$400/ton, which would represent a
37% reduction from the forecast price in 1990 and a 26% reduction in
real terms from the present price. It is very unlikely that such
a reduction would occur;
(d)  Construction costs.  The costs of construction would have to
increase by 135% to reduce the ERR to 12%;
(e)  Development period.  The development period is expected to be
11 years and the cross-over value would be 23 years;
(f)  Cost of production.  The incremental costs of farm production
would have to rise by 165% to reduce the ERR to 12%.
7.12      Sunk Costs.  The relatively high ERR (23%) is due to the project
being an extension of existing infrastructure.  Between 1978 and 1980, RID
constructed 48 km of main canals and 24 km of laterals which will serve the
area of the proposed project (para. 2.06). The estimated economic cost of
these facilities, in 1981 prices, is $394 million (US$19.7 million). Includ-
ing these sunk costs in the analysis reduces the ERR to 17%. Thus, the
original decision to develop the Malaiman area was justified. No analysis has
been carried out including the sunk costs of the dams since the project is
only a minor beneficiary from these multipurpose investments.
7.13      Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the project.  The
risks normally associated with irrigation projects have been accounted for in
estimating yields, cropping intensities and rates of development, and the
sensitivity analysis shows that the viability of the project is not unduly
sensitive to these assumptions.
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, agreement was obtained from the Government on
the following principal points:
(a)  RID would maintain an account covering expenditures incurred
in carrying out the project and would furnish to the Bank such
information concerning the accounts and financial statements
of RID as the Bank shall from time to time reasonably request
(para. 3.18).



- 34 -
(b) a Project Director and a Project Manager would be appointed for the
proposed project, as would a Project Engineer who would coordinate
field operations in the project area (para. 4.02);
(c) BAAC would make available the additional staff and funds needed
to meet the credit requirements of farmers in the project
area (para. 4.09);
(d)  (i)  RID  would review the recommendations of the RID Organization
and Administration Study and by September 30, 1981, exchange
views with the Bank concerning the proposals and by January
31, 1982, send to the Bank a Plan of Action for strengthening
RID; and
(ii) the Government would review with the Bank RID's proposed Plan
of Action and would then take appropriate steps to implement
the plan in a timely manner;
(e)  (i)  RID would prepare and submit to the Bank for review and
comment, by June 30, 1982, proposals for the amount of O&M
fees to be levied on project beneficiaries and the mechanism
by which such fees would be collected (para. 6.14(a));
(ii) subject to (i) above, RID would impose and collect an agreed
O&M fee, commencing one year after completion of the tertiary
system in blocks of 1,000 ha (para. 6.14(b);
(iii) on the basis of data collected for project monitoring, RID
would assess the capital costs of the project and estimate
charges that would recover at least 50% of on-farm development
costs plus a portion of main system costs, over a period of
15 years, including a two-year grace period, with an interest
rate which would reflect prevailing rates for institutional
credit in the agricultural sector (para. 6.14(c)); and
(iv) subject to (iii) above, RID would impose and collect charges
for recovery of capital costs of the project, on terms and
under procedures satisfactory to the Bank, not later than
three years after completion of tertiary systems in blocks of
about 3,000 ha (para. 6.14(d)).
8.02      Appointment of the consultants for assisting in implementation of
the project would be a condition of effectiveness of the loan (para. 4.04).
8.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$57 million, with a 20-year maturity including a grace
period of five years. The Borrower would be the Kingdom of Thailand.
