PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA: MOMBASA AND COASTAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 1167-RE)
PREFACE
This report reviews the preparation, implementation and results
of the Mombasa and Coastal Water Supply Project for which L&an 1167-KE of
US$35.0 million was made in October 1975 to the Republic of Xenya.   Co-
financing of DM 37.0 million was provided by Kreditanstalt fur Wiedera*jfbau
(KfW).  The Bank loan became effective in January 1976 and was fully dis-
bursed; the final disbursement was made on March 18, 1982, 21 months after
the original closing date. The project was implemented by the Borrower's
Ministry of Water Development (MWD).
This Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared by the Water
Supply and Urban Development Division of the Eastern and Southern Africa
Regional Office on the basis of a completion mission which visited Tenya An            _
1983 and a review of the President's Report, the Staff Appraisal Report,
the loan documents and Bank files.
ln accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
COED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower, the Executing Agency, and the Co-financier for their com-
ments. The comments which were received have been taken into account in
preparing the filal report and they are reproduced as appendices to the PCR.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA: NOMBASA AND COASTAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 1167-KE)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The project was the first phase of a program to improve the water
supply to Mombasa and other locations along the coast by increasing pro-
duction and transmission capacities of the piped water supply system,
expanding the distribution system into new locations, improving existing
distribution facilities, and establishing and developing The Coast Province
Water Branch (CPWB) of the Ministry of Water Development (MWD). The proj-
ect also included technical assistance for the planning of new rural water
supply programs in Kenya and the improvement of MWD's technical training
facilities (paras. 2.10-2.13).
2.        Implementation of the project was difficult and prolonged (time
overrun of four and one-half years) and costs, expressed in local currency,
were nearly twice the appraisal estimates. The basic cause of the cost
overrun was the extended construction period during a time of high price
escalation, but, also, the project was appraised too early in the project
cycle which contributed to original underestimation of quantities and unit
costs and an unrealistic implementation schedule which distorted the
appraisal estimates. Changes in design, and contractor's claims due to
changes and delays were also factors (paras. 3.04, 3.05, 3.14-3.19 and
9.02).
3.        In spite of the difficulties, the project was successful in
increasing the reliable water supply in the intended service area by over
1OOZ, and the water supply situation was changed from one of chronic short-
ages to one where supplies are expected to be adequate until about 1992
(paras. 1.01, 3.04, 5.03 and 7.01). The project was successful also in
firmly establishing CPWB (paras. 4.11, 4.12, 5.01 and 7.03). However, the
institutional objectives were not met entirely and CPWB has a number of
serious problems remaining, including insufficient autonomy, the lack of a
well-organized and active training program, the need to improve its
accounting and its financial situation (paras. 4.13-4.15, 4.19, 4.20, 5.01,
6.03-6.09 and 6.13-6.16). Studies and planning relating to MWD's rural
water supply programs were carried out and improvement of MWD's technical
training facilities is underway, although these activities were eventually
financed from sources other than this loan (paras. 3.03, 4.16 and 4.17).
4.        The financial targets were not met and economic benefits (using
incremental revenues as proxies) were not realized (paras. 6.13-6.15 and
7.06). However, the financial situation is not beyond recovery and prompt
government action could result in a financially souad water supply opera-
tion in the Coast Province. Such action should be a prerequisite for any
future Bank Group operations in the Coast Province water sector.



5.        Among the difficulties encountered during project implementation,
and discussed in this report, were:
(a) responsibility for design and implementation was transferred
to a new ministry which was not yet properly organized to
administer an undertaking of this size (paras. 2.07 (e),
3.05, 3.06, 3.09, 3.27, 4.01, 4.02, 4.10, 4.15 and 4.16);
(b) unrealistic timetables, particularly in view of the above
(paras. 3.05, 4.12 and 4.22);
(c) inadequate advance planning of institutional development,
including training (paras. 4.16 and 4.19);
(d) unsatisfactory arrangements for project administration,
engineering and construction supervision (paras. 3.07,
3.26-3.28, 4.02 and 8.02 and Appendix B, page 4, item 5(d)).
(e) the awarding of separate contracts for equipment supply and
for related civil works which proved to be unsuitable
Cpara. 3.11, and Appendix B. page 5, item 5(e)).
(f) the lack of early attention to and coordination of planning
on CPWB's operating requirements and procedures (para.
3.12);
(g) delayed payments to contractors, suppliers and consultants
(paras. 3.05, 3.17, 3.23 and 3.28);
Ch) problems of CPWB in converting to a commercial accounting
system when its ministry uses a conventional government cash
accounting system (paras. 6.02-6.05); and
(i) constraints and frequent changes of staff in MWD (paras.
3.27, 4.02, 4.04, 4.14, 4.16, 4.19, 4.20 and 6.03).
6.        MWD has stated that other significant problems were:  some
difficult contractors; construction site conditions which were not dealt
with adequately during design; and time consuming Bank requirements for
procurement (Appendix B, page 4, item 5).
7.        A number of lessons result from the project experience.  They are
described in para. 9.04 and concern the following:
(a) arrangements for engineering design and construction
supervision;
(b) problems that can result from awarding separate contracts



- vi -
(d) need for more autonomy if staff problems are to be reduced;
(e) design of training components and diversion of funds for
training to-other purposes; and
(f) consultation with the government auditing agency before
drafting audit covenants.
8.        Assuming that there are no major adverse developments, the
future contributions of the project to Kenya's Coast Province should be
very good. However, sustenance of the project and its benefits requires
certain actions as described in para. 9.05, and commented upon by HWD in
Appendix B, pages 6 and 7, including:
(a) the preparation and implementation of a plan of action to
meet future water needs before the existing system is
overloaded, including a proper plan for utilization of
groundwater resources;
(b) the strengthening of CPWB through organized training, better
personuel management, including more control over its own
staff, and, preferably, the merging of CPrB and the Mombasa
Pipeline Board into a single satutory board;
(c)  the improvement of CPWB's commercial operations
(particularly its tariff levels and structure, billing and
collection system, accounting and auditing, and by gaining
increased authority with respect to financial management,
purchasing, etc.) before CPWB becomes a net drain on scarce
government resources;
Cd) the implementation of an adequate preventative maintenance
program; and
Ce)  the establishment of a program to monitor the quality and
quantity of water in the Sabaki River above and below the
intake at Baricho.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KENYA: MMNBASA AND COASTAL WAIER SUPPLY PROJECT
(LOAN 1167-KE)
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.01      During the 10 years between Kenyan independence and the start of
the preparation of this project, Mombasa and the area along the coast of
Kenya (the Coast Province) had experienced rapid economic growth with the
development of the port, industry and tourism and the attendant increase in
population, housing and tourist and recreational facilities. Water supply
systems for the fast growing urban communities and rural settlements had
developed much more slowly than water demand.  Water supply In the project
area in 1974 was inadequate to meet demands; during periods of the year
supply was restricted to 12 hours of service, and some parts of the area
were not served by any type of organized water supply system.
1.02      The institutional setup was poor. Operation and maintenance of
the Coast Province water systems was delegated to a provincial unit of the
Ministry of Agriculture's Water Department. The Provincial Water Engineer,
with a few assistants, in a disorganized office in Mombasa, reported both
to the Provincial Director of Agriculture and to a Deputy Director of the
Water Department in Nairobi whom he depended on for staff and technical
support. A water supply expert, provided by a bilateral aid agency to
review the situation in 1973, reported that the institution was poorly
equipped to handle emergencies and other major responsibilities.
1.03      The Government had been seriously concerned for some time about
the water supply situation in Mombasa, and, early in 1971, it requested the
Bank to assist with the financing of water supply developments in the
area. The Bank already had made a loan (Loan 714-KE in 1970) for a water
supply project for the City of Nairobi and had been involved in a study of
Kenya's water supply and sanitation sectorj ade by the World Health
Organization.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL AND LOAN PROCESSING
Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.01      Soon after the Bank was first approached to conslder assisting in
the financing of a Mombasa water supply project, the Mombasa Pipeline Board
(MPB), a statutory authority which was the principal bulk supplier of water



to Mombasa and a few other areas between its sources and the coast,l/
engaged a consulting engineering firm to carry out preliminary studies.
There followed a series of engineering reports as the scope of the studies
was expanded gradually to include water resources and requirements in more
of the Coast Province and to add distribution components in addition to the
water production and transmission elements which initially had been MPB's
primary concern.
2.02      Preparation of the engineering components proceeded satisfacto-
rily, although it proved necessary for the engineering consultants to
strengthen their organization and obtain the part-time services of outside
experts on water treatment and hydraulics. During this period, the criti-
cal and time-consuming decision was made to develop a new water source on
the Sabaki River rather than expand the existing supply from Mzima. Also,
at one point, the Government suspended the consultants' work for about
three months while it considered the consultants' project proposals (con-
tained in a preliminary loan application to the Bank dated December 1972)
and the Bank's response.
2.03      Following the preliminary engineering phase, the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA), which at that time was responsible for development of
water resources in Kenya, and the engineering consultants signed a new
contract (dated May 29, 1973) for the preparation of detailed designs and
tender documents and, at the option of MOA, for supervision of construc-
tion. At the time of the Bank's field appraisal in October/November 1974,
a preliminary design report, preliminary bills of quantities and economic
analyses of alternate transmission pipeline routes had been prepared and
the initial drafts of tender documents for the first major equipment supply
contracts were ready for review.
2.04      The planning of the institutional aspects of the project lagged
considerably behind the project engineering. Questions about the institu-
tional arrangements were raised many times by the Bank from the time of the
first reconnaissance mission in March 1972. However, it was not until the
end of 1973 that MOA took steps to engage a mnagement consulting firm to
study the situation, make recommendations and assist with their implementa-
tion. The management consulting contract was eventually signed in April
1974. This delay in arranging for the management consultants was the main
reason for a six-month postponement of project appraisal.
2.05      The main concerns of the Bank and the Government during project
preparation were:
(a)   the credibility of the water demand forecasts;
(b)   to establish that the project was the least cost solution;
1/   There were also provincial water supplies in many towns and rural
areas outside the MPB supply area.



-3-
(c)  the quality of engineering;
(d)   justification of the project as a whole as well as of some
of its individual components;
(e)   the high total cost of the project;
(f)   sources of finance other than the Bank;
(g)   cost recovery arrangements and cost to the consumer;
(h)   the possibility of providing more extensive water supply
services to rural areas in the Coast Province; and
(1) the institutional arrangements, including staffing.
2.06      All planning and studies up to detailed design were financed
solely by the Government and carried out under the direction of the Water
Department (CD) of HOA.2/ Bank assistance prior to appraisal was provided
mainly through several dissions and comments on reports and other docu-
ments. The Bank also helped the Government in contacting possible additio-
nal sources of finance; a number of bilateral and international financing
agencies were approached and the possibility of supplier's credits was
explored also. Early in 1974, Bank efforts led to a Government request for
assistance from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the Federal
Republic of Germany which agreed to consider lending for the project.
2.07      The field appraisal started Immediately upon receipt of the
Government's final loan application containing most of the project
details. KfW participated in the finAl stages of the appraisal. The
Bank's team also made a concurrent appraisal of a major component (sewer-
age) of an urban development project for Nairobi (Credit 543-KE and Loan
1105-KE). In addition to the complications of dealing with two projects at
the same time, the Mombasa appraisal team was hampered by:
(a) inadequate cost estimates and implementation schedules,
due primarily to the preliminary nature of the designs;
(b) the lack of Government decisions about
filling the financing gap, onlending arrangements
and water tariffs;
(c) last minute Government proposals for additions
to the project;
(d) vacancies in the key posts of the unit of WD
which would adminlister the project;
2/ Although the initial consulting agreement for preliminary engineering
had been with MPB (para. 2.01), WD had administered that contract.



-4-
(e) at the end of the field appraisal, the formation of
a new Ministry of Water Development (MWD) which took
over WD, formerly under MOA (paras. 2.03 and 2.06),
as its only department (para. 4.01); ahd
(f) the lack of confirmation by the Government that
the Coast Province Water Branch (CPWB) of WD,
which would be responsible for operating the project
and the existing water systems in the province, would
be established along the lines recommended by the
management consultants.
2.08      Following appraisal, outstanding questions concerning water
tariffs required to support the project, the joint financing arrangements
between KfW and the Bank, and the establishement of CPWB, required post-
appraisal visits to Kenya and to KfW in January and June 1975.
2.09      During the time between the initial reconnaissance mission (March
1972) and field appraisal (two years and seven months), the expected dates
of appraisal and of Board presentation were postponed 13 months each.
Also, the estimates of the total project costs increased from about US$40
million to about US$85 million as planning progressed, and the expected
amount and origin of Bank Group lending changed several times._/
Project Objectives and Description
2.10      The project as appraised was intended to about double the water
production and transmission capacities of the piped water supply systems in
the Coast Province, extend distribution into new areas and improve existing
distribution. The project objectives also included the improvement of the
management and efficiency of water supply operations in the project area,
including attainment of financial self-sufficiency, and introduction of a
tariff system where prices would reflect the long run marginal cost of
water supply in the Cost Province. The project wis scheduled to be com-
pleted by the end of 1978. Upon completion, it was expected to meet aver-
age water demand in the project area in mawimum months through at least
1982. With a much smaller follow-on projecL, the population served by the
Coast Province water supply systems would double to about 600,000 including
about 160,000 in rural and low-income urban areas, and demand through about
1987 could be met.
2.11      The major elements of the proposed project were as iollows:
(a) a control weir across the Sabaki River near Baricho
(40 km west of Malindi), with an irt2ke, pumping facilities
and transmission pipes to the treatment plant 0.7 km away;
3/ See also Appendix B, page 8, item ;'.09.



- 5 -
(b) a 54,000 m3/day treatment plant designed for ultimate
expansion to a capacity of 72,000m3/day;
(C) a treated water pumping station at the treatment plant and a
booster pumping station at Jaribuni, about mid-way to
Mombasa;
(d)  116 km of transmission main (600 mm to 750 m  diameter)
south to Mombasa and 60 km of branches to four separate
locations along the coast between Mombasa and Malindi;
(e) distribution storage reservoirs and new distribution systems
at various locations along the coastal strip, and
augmentation of existing distribution mains in Mombasa;
(f) a new headquarters building in Mombasa;
(g) the establishment of a new water supply agency, the Coast
Province Water Branch (CPWB);
(h) for MWD (paragraph 2.07), the evaluation of existing rural
water supply programs and the preparation of new rural water
supply projects; and
(1)  training, both for CPWB and MWD.
2.12      During project preparation three other components, which were in
the original project concept, were dropped.   Because of the urgency of the
water supply situation in Mombasa and the poor condition of the pipeline
from Mzima Springs, Mombasa's main source, the Government went ahead with
renewals of sections of that pipeline in advance of the main project. In
order to reduce project costs, a transmission main to Malindi was post-
poned,4/ and a branch transmission main to a rural area was deleted
because WD expected that less expensive means of supplying water could be
developed.
2.13      Two additional components to the project which the Government
proposed during appraisal were not included. One was the engineering for a
sewerage project for Mombasa which was eventually carried out with other
financing. The second was a small group of individual water supplies for
rural communities. Since planning of these was at a very early stage, and
since Kenya was experiencing problems with its rural water programs, it was
agreed that the Mombasa project would include provisions for an overall
evaluation of those programs and, then, a few rural water supply projec"t
could be prepared as part of the Mombasa project (item (h) of para. 2.11).
4/ This has since been included in a new water supply project for Malindi,
financed by KfW.



- 6 -
2.14      The estimated cost of the project at the time of the Issues Paper
totalled US$67.2 million equivalent including a foreign exchange component
of US$33.6 million (50%). The proposed Bank loan was US$35 million and KfW
was expected to lend DM 15 million (US$6 million equivalent). The esti-
mates were revised a number of times, after the field appraisal, and the
total cost of the project at the time the loan was approved was estimated
to be US$74.7 million equivalent, including about 50% foreign exchange5/.
The Bank loan remained at US$35 million but KfW increased its proposed
contribution to DM 37 million (US$15 million equivalent).
Negotiations and Approval
2.15      After the appraisal mission, a number of issues and outstanding
questions had to be settled, including:
(a) final agreement on the project content, cost estimates
and implementation schedule;
(b) establishment of a firm financing plan, including
cofinancing arrangements with KfW;
(c) acceptance within the Bank that the high-cost project,
with a comparatively low internal financial rate of return
(5% to 8%) was justified;
Cd) development of a tariff policy and reform schedule
acceptable to both the Government and the Bank;
Ce) acceptance by the Bank of retroactive financing of
consulting services, of possible local cost financing
and of possible advance contracting;
(f) action that should be taken or planned for the establish-
ment of CPWB; and
(g) provisions to be made in the project for
rural water supply and for training.
Also during this period, KfW was waiting for the Bank's appraisal report
which it was to use as a basis for the documents it would present to its
management.
2.16      Negotiations were held early in May 1975 and were attended by
representatives of MfW. Although most of the outstanding questions listed
in para. 2.15 had to be settled finally during negotiations, no major
issues developed and only minor changes to the draft loan documents were
5/ Both original and revised estimates were before interest and commitment
charges during construction.



-7-
required. The principal difficulty during negotiations was that cost
estimates and implementation schedules were being revised up to the last
minute. In addition, the proposed breakdown of major parts of the proj-
ect-the transmission mains, reservoirs and booster pumping station-into
contracts and the allocations of the proceeds of the KfW and Bank loans had
to be revised to accommodate KfW's strong preferences for the parts of the
project which it wished to finance.
2.17      Board presentation was on October 7, 1975 after water tariffs in
the Coast Province had been increased and after the project had been
approved by the Federal Republic of Germany for financing by KfW. It had
beer. agreed at negotiations that Board presentation would not take place
until the Bank received copies of agreements between MPB (para. 2.01) and
MWD concerning sale of water to CPWB, the transfer of certain assets and
related debts to CPWB. However, there was a delay and this requirement was
waived by the Bank upon receiving assurances from the Government that the
documents were on the way.
2.18      The points raised during consideration of the loan by the Board
concerned mainly:
(a) the number of CPWB positions (6) to be filled
in consultation with the Bank (para. 4.20);
(b) the realism of the dates set for filling these
positions (para. 4.20);
(c)  the political feasibility of implementating the
substantial tariff increases which were required; and
(d) the amount of local cost financing.
2.19      The Bank loan was signed on October 15, 1975, and was declared
effective on January 13, 1976.   The loan could have become effective
earlier, but certain dates in the Loan Agreement had passed, or would pass
soon, without being met, and new dates had to be agreed by the Bank prior
to declaring the loan effective in order to prevent an immediate condition
of default.  These dates were for filling three CPWB posts (item (b) in
para. 2.18), for having CPWB's commercial accounting system substantially
in operation, and for meeting the auditing requirements. KfW's loan was
declared effective on February 9, 1976.
III. PROJECT I&PLEKENTATION AND COSTS
Project Revisions
3.01      During detailed design and construction, revisions were made in
the cross-country route of the transmission main between Baricho and
Mombasa (para. 2.11 and map) because of terrain and other factors. The



only significant revision was in the downstream segment, which, originally,
was to go from Ribe Tank, under Tudor Creek and connect to Mombasa's exist-
ing distribution network at the Changamwe Reservoirs on the West Mainland.
Instead, the transmission main was constructed from Ribe Tank to the Nguu
Tatu Reservoir (formerly to be only a branch main) and then across Tudor
Creek on the new Nyali Bridge to connect to a reinforced distribution sys-
tem on Moimbasa Island. This last route probably would have been the origi-
nal design except that MWD and its engineering consultants had not been
informed about the new bridge until after construction of the transmission
main had started. (See also Appendix B, page 8, item 3.01.)
3.02      The concept for CPWB's new headquarters building changed consid-
erably.  At the beginning of the project a temporary headquarters was
erected to serve until a permanent building was constructed. However,
planning and desiLgn of the permanent headquarters-trne responsibility of
the Ministry of Works in consultation with MWD-took so long and grew so
sophisticated and costly that by the time the detailed structural design
was ready to start, it was clear that funds would not be available because
of cost overruns on other parts of the project. Therefore, the temporary
headquarters, which is of sound construction, was expanded, and while this
has met the immediate needs of CPWB, a permanent headquarters will be
required to satisfy future requirements (Appendix B, page 8, item 3.02).
3.03      The evaluation of MWD's existing rural water supply programs and
the preparation of new rural water supply projects (item (b) in para. 2.11)
were carried out, but without financing from this loan. The Swedish Inter-
national Aid Agency (SIDA) financed the evaluation, and the preparation of
new rural water projects is being financed by the Bank (Loan 1637-KE for a
rural water supply project) and other sources.
Implementation Schedule
3.04      The project was completed in July 1983, four and one-ha7f years
later than scheduled. However, certain critical components were substan-
tially completed much earlier, to the point where, with infiltration gal-
leries and temporary pumping facilities installed at the initiative of WD
engineers, the immediate project objective--elimination of water short-
ages--was achieved at the beginning of December 1980.  Although not
entirely finished, the project was officially commissioned on August 25,
1982. The scheduled and actual dates of key events for operational ele-
ments are shown below:6/

3.05      Execution of the project started well.  The format and content of
the tender documents were discussed during preappraisal and the draft pro-
curement documents for the first few contracts were reviewed during
appraisal and negotiations.  The invitations for tenders for the first con-
tracts-water treatment equipment, pumping equipment and the supply and
installation of transmission pipelines--were issued reasonably prompt.
After that stage, progress began to deteriorate. Evaluation of bids, con-
tract award decisions and the preparation and signing of the final contract
documents after award were extremely slow. Then there were changes in
final design details, problems with manufacturer's standards and details,
rejection and replacement of unacceptable work by contractors, contractor
walkouts and substantial claims and counter-claims between the contractors
and the client. Delayed payments by the borrower to contractors (and con-
sultants) was a particularly serious problem which began in 1979. There is
evidence indicating that late payments alone may have delayed project com-
pletion by 12 to 18 months. The original implementation schedule was not
realistic; it made very limited allowances for major procedural delays and
unexpected conditions. As it turned out, unexpected conditions, including
those at the intake site (Appendix B, page 9, item 3.05), did not hamper
progress as much as the procedural delays which compounded to become the
main cause of the extended construction period.
7/   Substantial completion.  Actual date not yet established because of
claims.



- 10 -
Procurement
3.06      All goods and services were procured according to World Bank
guidelines. All consulting contracts, the major construction contracts and
all of the supply contracts were awarded to foreign firms. A contract for
distribution mains and four minor contracts for construction of housing
were awarded to local firms. Local firms also participated as subcontrac-
tors for the installation of water treatment and electrical equipment.
Although the Loan Agreement provided preference for domestic manufacturers
and contractors, MWD did not elect to use this provision. However, in no
case would domestic preference have made any difference in the determina-
tion of the lowest evaluated bidder.
3.07      The procurement exercise and the results of the procurement were
not satisfactory in all cases. There was a delay in entering into an
agreement for detailed design with the engineering consultants who had done
the preliminary engineering (paras. 2.01 and 2.03). Then there was a much
longer delay in extending that contract to cover supervision of construc-
tion. Both of these delays were due mainly to the client's decision to
consider proposals from other consulting firms, something the Bank was not
informed about in either case until engineering activities had come to a
halt.8/ A result of the second delay was that the consultants were not on
site uatil about six months after the first major civil works contractors
began work. MWD staff did a creditable job in trying to cover during the
initial supervision period, but the lack of a full supervision establish-
ment before construction started caused problems which persisted through to
completion.
3.08      There were considerable delays in procurement between issue of
tender documents and authorization of suppliers and contractors to proceed
with the work after contracts were awarded. The implementation schedule on
which the project appraisal was based allowed from five to six months for
tendering and award of most contracts. The average actual time for the
major contracts was about 11-1/4 months.9/ The details are shown in
Annex 1.
3.09      There were a number of reasons for the long procurement periods:
lengthy evaluations and, in some cases, rather hesitant or poorly docu-
mented recommendations for award by the consultants; particular caution,
long consideration, internal disagreements and uncertainty by HWD; and poor
communication between the consultants, MWD and the Bank (and KfW). There
were only a few cases where the tendering period was extended. On the
other hand, the tender validity period on most contracts had to be extended
because of the delays in making the awards.

- II -
3.10      The time required for tendering and award, in addition to delays
in detailed design and preparation of tender documents-often interre.ated
because of the way the contracts were broken down between those for supply
of equipment and those for construction of civil works (para. 3.11)-soon
hopelessly fouled the project timetable which never attained the status of
a well-organized and well-managed implementation program.
3.11      The four contracts for supply and installation of major equip-
ment--water treatment, pumping, electrical and flow measurement/communica-
tions equipment-were tendered and awarded as prime contracts, separate
from and in advance of the contracts for civil works required to accommo-
date that equipment. While this is a common practice, particularly in
Europe and the UK, and is accepted by the Bank because it can work satis-
factorily, it increases the client's responsibility and liability for coor-
dination of activities.10/ In this project, where there were so many pro-
cedural problems, the results were unsatisfactory.  Detailed construction
drawings were held up while equipment details were settled, and, eventu-
ally, installation of equipment was held up by construction delays. In
contrast, the transmission mains and branches were constructed by a single
contractor responsible for both the supply of pipe and fittings and their
installation. En this case, the performance was good. The same good
results were experienced on the contracts for water distribution mains. In
both the above cases, however, there were still problems because of sepa-
rate contracts for supply of valves.
3.12      Tendering for the contracts for communications and flow measuring
equipment, for operator staff housing and for the new headquarters building
for CPWB were held up for long periods because, in part, recommendations by
engineering and management consultants on operating requirements and proce-
dures and on staff needs were not coordinated, and because MIWD and CPWB had
difficulty deciding on these requirements.l1/
3.13      While a number of contractor and supplier claims, and counter
charges by MWD, remain to be settled, no legal action is known to have
resulted from the project.11/
10/ In addition, this procedure greatly increases the estimated component
of the costs used in the financial evaluation of the bids for supply
of the equip, nt, and, where the civil works are major cost components
of the projecC, this procedure also can result in lending too early in
the project cycle as was the case in this project. See also Appendix
B, page 5, item 5(e) and page 9, items 3.08-3.12.
11/ See also Appendix B, page 9, items 3.08-3.12.

Project Costs
3.14      The estimated and actual costs of the project are compared in
Annex 2 (by project function) and Annex 3 (by contracts). The total proj-
ect cost was K[  52.7 million or 972 above the appraisal forecast         (K[
26.7 million). Most of the increase was in local currency costs which, at
KE 29.4 million (including an estimated K[  8.1 million in duties and taxes
on imported goods and services), were 136% above the appraisal figures.
However, the foreign exchange cost overrun of 63% also was considerable.
Expressed in US dollars at the average exchange rate during the actual
construction period, the total cost overrun was about 70%.
3.15      The final cost figures provided by MWD have been examined care-
fully and appear reasonably accurate. However, cost data and estimates
through most of the implementation period were a problem because of omis-
sions, double counting, inclusion of costs of other works in the Coast
Province which were not part of the project, a number of currency realign-
ments, the lack of adequate cost accounting and differences of opinion bet-
ween MWD and the engineering consultants. Consequently the history of
expenditures, with respect to amounts and timing, is uncertainand the
causes of cost changes and the effects on costs of various events which
occurred during implementation can only be determined in a general manner.
3.16      One basic cause of the cost overrun was the extended construction
period (para. 3.04) and the rates of escalation, particularly of local
prices, during the last four years of that period. The original allowances
for price contingencies over the original construction period were good;
recalculation of the appraisal cost estimates over the original construc-
tion period, but using actual escalation rates, results in total costs only
3% above the appraisal estimates. However, if the appraisal base costs
plus allowances for physical contingencies are spread over the extended
construction period, using actual escalation rates, the total project cost
would have been 30% above the total appraisal estimates. Because estimates
of base costs for many of the components of the project proved to be low
(paras. 3.17-3.19), the effects of escalation over the longer construction
period were made even worse.
3.17      Of the approximately 25 project contracts, the two largest--
construction of the river works and water treatment plant and the supply
and construction of the transmission pipelines-accounted for almost 75%
of the total costs of project contracts, and the eight lar0est contracts
accounted for about 90% of the total project costs. Examination of the
cost history of these principal contracts shows that the major causes of
the overall project cost overrun were:
(a)  underestimation of unit costs and total quantities;
(b) additions due to changes between preliminary and final
designs;
(c) additional works or supplies due to omissions in
the original estimates; and



- 13 -
(d) contractor's claims due to changes and delays,
including delays in receiving payments due.
3.18      It is virtually impossible to isolate the individual cost effects
of the above factors because: (i) there were several changes in currency
alignments over the project period; (ii) most contract awards were later
than forecasted so they already included some effects of price escalation;
and (iii) there were hundreds of variation orders which are not clearly
divided between those covering omissions and underestimates of quantities
and those covering true additional work. However, examination of the
available cost records reveals a number of points. As a whole, prices used
in the appraisal estimates were 15% to 20% below bid prices and the differ-
ence was much more in local costs than in foreign exchange. Part of the
difference may have been due to increases in quantities between those
used in the appraisal estimates, when final designs were not ready, and
those used in the bid documents, but most of the difference appears to have
been due to underestimation of unit prices. Estimates for the supply and
installation of pumping and water treatment equipment and the supply of
large valves proved to be good. However, the estimated unit costs of sup-
plying large pipes for transmission mains may have been underestimated by
as much as 30%. The contract prices for supply and installation of elec-
trical and communications equipment were underestimated, respectively, by
about 50% and 67%. In the case of communication equipment, however, much
of the difference between estimated and contract prices resulted from
changes in the goods to be supplied and the fact that the contract was
awarded about three years later than the date on which the appraisal esti-
mate was based. Except for the contract price for construction of the
transmission mains, which was below the estimates, all civil works contract
prices were underestimated from 15% to 35%.
3.19      The largest increase in costs came after contract awards.  Final
costs of all contracts were 62% above the original contract prices and 103%
above the appraisal estimates. Here again, two-thirds of the total
increase was in local costs. While a significant part of the increase was
caused by escalation over the extended construction period, the major part
was caused by underestimation of the quantities used in the bid documents
(excavation, for example), changes in design and the addition of items
omitted originally. It is clear from the history of the project that the
physical contingency allowances used for appraisal (maximum of 12-1/2%)
were entirely too low. However, physical contingency allowances as high as
40% to 50% of base prices-practically unheard of--would have been required
and the construction timetable used at appraisal would have had to be
doubled to bring the estimates close to actual final costs. All of this
underlines the fact that the project was appraised too soon in the project
cycle. (See also Appendix B, page 10, item 3.19).
Project Financing
3.20      The original financing plan and the actual sources of funds to
complete the project were as follows:



- 14 -
Funds Allocated (KE million)
_rigzinal            Actual
Source                            Amount w/IX         Amounit rYZ
IBRD loan (US$35.0 million)            12.5       47        14.6       28
KfW loan (DM 37 million)                5.4       20         7.0       13
Government contribution                 8.8       33        31.1       59
26.7      100        52.7      100
3.21      Under the financing plan, the project was to be entirely debt
financed, with the Bank and KfW financing about two-thirds of the total
costs (before interest during construction on the Bank and KfW loans).
Because of the cost overrun, the Government contribution to the project
increased by KU 22.3 million, covering almost 60Z of the total costs. For
accounting purposes and financial analyses, the Government contribution was
treated as a loan to CPWB.
3.22      Initially, it was agreed that the KfW loan would be used to
finance 100Z of the foreign exchange costs of pipe supply for the trans-
mission mains and 15Z of the total cost of construction of those mains.
During the course of the project, KfW agreed to finance the foreign ex-
change costs of the valves for the transmission mains rather than part of
the construction costs. Bank loan disbursements were initially intended to
finance 100% of the foreign exchange costs of all supply contracts except
for transmission pipe; 50% of the total cost of construction of the trans-
mission mains; 65% of the total cost of all other construction costs; 100%
of the foreign exchange costs and 25% of the local costs of consulting
services; and 65% of the total costs of other technical assistance. When
the magnitude of the probable cost overruns was determined, the Bank's
financing of all construction contracts was reduced to 40%.
Disbursements
3.23      A comparison of the appraisal estimates and actual disbursements
is given in Annex 4. Up until the quarter ending June 30, 1978, the rate
of disbursements was extremely slow, due in part to the delays in project
construction and in part to the procedures for processing withdrawal appli-
cations, which involved handling by eight to ten parties--mostly in MWD-
before dispatching to the Bank. In April 1978, the Bank sent a special
mission to assist the Government in streamlining its procedures for this
loan and others. This action and a similar one taken by the Treasury
enabled MWD to clear a large backlog of delayed applications for reimburse-
ments. After that, disbursements kept fairly close pace with the actual
progress of the project. It should be noted that, for this project, all
disbursements from the Bank loan, were reimbursements for payments made, a

procedure required by the Treasury to control movements of foreign ex-
change, but which, in the case of delayed applications for reimbursements
from the Bank, undoubtedly resulted in a loss to the Government.
3.24      The original closing date for the loan was June 30, 1980.  At the
request of the Government, it was postponed to June 30, 1982 and was fully
disbursed in March 1982. Effective August 16, 1979, the allocation of the
proceeds of the loan was amended (para. 3.22). The original allocations
and final disbursements by categories are shown in Annex 5.
Performance of Engineering Consultants
3.25      The final results of the project engineering, in terms of the
quality of the finished product, were satisfactory. However, there were
many problems with project design, administration and supervision (paras.
2.02, 3.05 and 3.07-3.10) which contributed to delays and cost increases.
The degree to which these problems can be attributed to the performance of
the consultants cannot be determined fairly because of the circumstances
under which the consulting assignment was performed.
3.26      In retrospect, the contractual arrangement between the consul-
tants and MWD was not suitable because of the way responsibility was
divided between the consultants and their client. The contract called for
MWD's Water Department (para. 2.06) to be the -Engineer.-  While many of
the rormal responsibilities of the Engineer were then delegated to the con-
sultants, the reins remained firmly in WD's hands. WD was responsible for
review and approval of all designs, tender documents and the many documents
that were produced by the consultants during administration and supervision
of the construction and supply contracts. Nor could the consultants estab-
lish supervisory positions or fill them without prior approval of WD. (See
also Appendix B, page 5, item 6(a) and page 10, items 3.25-3.30.)
3.27      This arrangement might have worked if both parties had been well
managed and experienced on this type of project and if there had been a
good working relationship between them. However, these conditions did not
exist generally. Although the consultants have a good reputatioa in other
sectors, their experience on water supply projects of this size and com-
plexity in developing countries was limited. Also, the firm appeared to
have difficulty adjusting to a lesser role, in terms of responsibility and
authority, than it was accustomed to on design/supervision assignments. On
the other side, through the critical first few years at least, WD generally
lacked the capacity for the expanded role it chose to play on this proj-
ect. Under the newly established kWD (para. 2.07), WD lacked adequate
administrative and accounting support. WD experienced frequent staff
changes and under-staffing and there were misplaced records and delayed
decisions and approvals, all of which caused endless frustrations and
contributed to the mutual mistrust and ill feelings which developed between
the consultants and the client. At one point, MWD considered engaging a
second firm of consultants to carry out some of WD's project coordination
functions, but this idea was dropped on economic grounds.



- 16 -
3.28      Early in 1975, just before the construction supervision phase was
about to start, and without informing the Bank or terminating the supervi-
sion component of the existing consulting agreement, HWD invited other
firms to submit proposals for undertaking the supervision function (para.
3.07). Eventually, MWD decided to stay with the original consultants but
to negotiate a new agreement. Negotiations were not completed and a new
agreement signed until June 1977. In the meantime (more than two years),
the consultant had been carrying on the  Supervision-in-Chief  functions-
tendering, evaluation of tenders, etc.-unacr the old agreement, with
payment deferred until the new agreement was signed. Therefore, the con-
sultants were, undoubtedly, in a tight financial position and probably used
design staff-some detailed design was still in progress-for supervision
purposes. If so, this had to have a poor effect on both design and super-
vision. Furthermore, during this period, the consultants were not in a
position to recruit site supervision staff which also had an adverse effect
on construction supervision (para. 3.07).
3.29      Considering the difficulties caused by the contract conditions
and their late arrival on site, the performance of the consultant's field
staff responsible for construction supervision was good most of the time.
Late in the project, however, serious staff vacancies developed because of
resignations and failure to renew cont;.acts.  This uvas due in part to
perceived better opportunities elsewvere, and the hardship in attracting
new staff in the late stage of the yroject.
3.30      Regardless of the reasons, the least satisfactory aspects of the
consultant's performance were:
Ca)  understaffing of office positions, and, especially a
shortage of in-house technical capacity on electrical,
mechanical, hydraulic and water treatment equipment design
and operation;
(b)  making recommendations for action which sometimes lacked
conviction and did not include all supporting data needed
for a decision;
(c)  making proposals or suggestions for major design
alternatives after bids were received or contracts awarded;
td)  design delays;
(e)  unreliable initial cost estimates; and
(f)  inadequate project management information systems; e.g.,
cost monitoring_and critical path analyses.



- 17 -
Performance of Contractors
3.31     The final products of the major civil works contractors were
good. The contractor for the transmission mains was particularly efficient
and reliable. On the other hand, the contractor for the river works and
water treatment plant, whose specialty was earth moving, was inltially
poorly organized and uncoordinated on construction and, in some cases, the
concrete work was so poor that it had to be demolished and replaced. On
two occasions he was instructed to vacate the site. Eventually, his work
and the final results were good, but he was claim conscious and almost
always in a state of dispute with the engineers and client. Of the six
local civil contractors, one on distribution and one on housing were good,
and two on housing were satisfactory. However, the remaining two local
contractors, both _= housing, were unsatisfactory; part of the work on one
of these contracts was cancelled and the other contractor was charged with
abandonment of the site.
3.32      The performance of most of the supply contractors was good.  How-
ever, there were some disputes and claims on those contracts involving
supply and installation because the related civil works were so late
(para. 3.11) and payments were delayed. This was true particularly of the
contractors for water treatment equipment and pumping equipment. Eventu-
ally the pumping equipment contractor received bonuses for pump operating
efficiencies which exceeded specifications. However, the supplier of the
treatment plant equipment refused to return to rectify various defects
because of payments due; eventually, when he offered to come back, WD
decided to have a local mechanical engineering contractor do the work and
to recover the costs from retention money.
Reporting
3.33      Reports on the progress of construction contracts, including the
costs of the individual contracts, were prepared by the engineering consul-
tants and submitted to MWD with copies to the Bank and KfW.  Reports on the
supply contracts were submitted irregularly as considered necessary by the
consultants. overall cost simmaries were supposed to be prepared quarterly
by the consultants but they were forwarded to the Bank irregularly.  Until
late in the project these simmaries were incomplete and often inconsistent
with data in the construction progress reports. Reports by the consultants
on the critical path analysis of the project were required quarterly, but
because they were never up-to-date and there were so many procedural delays
in project administration, the analyses were meaningless. Eventually, with
the agreement of MWD and the Bank, these were discontinued and a bar chart
system of reporting was adopted.
Compliance with Loan Covenants
3.34      Three special commitments by the Government in the Loan Agreement
pertain specifically to project implementation: (i) the preparation and
periodic updating of critical path analyses of the construction schedule;



- 18 -
(ii) the provision of power supply connections for the project as required;
and (iii) acquisition of land as and when needed. The requirement for the
critical path analyses did not produce useful results and was dropped by
mutual agreement (para. 3.33). The provision of power supply connections
to one of the sites was late and created problems with respect to other
contracts. And acquisition of land at several locations was late, which
interrupted the logical sequence of work and led to claims for delays.
(See also Appendix B, page 11, item 3.34.)
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
The Ministry of Water Development (MWD)
4.01      MWD, primarily through its Water Development (WD), was responsi-
ble for project implementation. The quality of MWD's project administra-
tion suffered from many problems, and,for much of the project period, was
not satisfactory. A major problem was MWD's newness as a separate minis-
try. It was established on November 1, 1974, with WD as its only depart-
ment (para. 2.07(v)), and with little advance preparation. This left MWD
largely dependent for the first few years on the Ministry of Agriculture
for administrative services, including personnel, finance and accounting,
procurement and general office services. This dependeucy and the lack of
clear lines of authority and responsibility within MWD severely hampered
MWD during its early years.
4.02      Project administration was particularly weak until the end of
1976. At that time new expatriate assistance was obtained for staffing the
Mombasa and Coastal Water Supply Project Coordinating Unit (MCS) of MWD.
But, while improvements began at that point, activities still were hindered
continuously by the lack of support staff and office accommodations,
inconsistent delegation of responsibility by the director of WD at that
time, inability to develop constructive working relationships with
consultants (paras. 3.26-3.28), poor communications (both internally and
with the Bank and KfW and poor records of past decisions), a lack of
control over staff assignments and transfers, and overdue payments to
contractors and consultants. In addition, there were conflicts between the
administrative/policy side of MWD (the Minister, the Permanent Secretary
and their staff) and the technical staff (the director and staff of WD)
over technical decisions and bureaucratic procedures. The adverse effects
of the poor administration capacity were amplified by the fact that WD had
taken the role of "Engineer' for a much larger and more complicated project
than it had ever had before (para. 3.26) and for which it was not yet
ready. (See also Appendix B, page 4, item 5(d) and page 11, item 4.01.)
4.03      In 1977, MWD engaged consultants to review Its organization,
management and procedures and recommend improvements. Although the Bank
was prepared to finance this study from funds in this loan allocated for
technical assistance to WD, the Government used other sources of finance.



- 19 -
The study was completed and the recommendations were to be implemented,
with the assistance of the same consultants, as part of the Rural Water
Supply Project (Loan 1637-KE). Implementation of the organization and
management reforms has not yet been wholly satisfactory, however, due
partly to resistance from within MWD where key staff believe, with some
justification, that the proposed changes are not workable.
4.04      Early in 1978 new problems arose when a series of drastic changes
in WD staff were made. WD's director was relieved of his duties, and the
Permanent Secretary acted temporarily in his place. All expatriates in
management positions were suddenly replaced by Kenyans. Most of these had
the required basic technical qualifications but some had not been adequate-
ly prepared for high-level managerial positions. Expatriates could still
hold lower positions, but many such posts throughout WD remained or became
vacant. These developments were particularly disruptive to WD, including
MCS.
4.05      The Kenyanization of MWD should be a good thing in the long-run,
although it could have been accomplished in a less disruptive fashion. The
counterpart training provided by MWD expatriates in the past had been
meager, either because they were not qualified to train or because, with
the inefficiency of the organization and the shortage of staff, there was
no time for adequate training. The Kenyanization of MWD put local staff in
a sink-or-swim situation. Provided that they are willing to consider
appropriate changes, including many of those proposed by the management
consultants, the institution could eventually develop satisfactorily.
There are already examples of good staff development. During the course of
this project, however, performance suffered. (See also Appendix B, page
12, item 4.05.)
4.06      One illustration of MWD's management problems from the time the
project was appraised through much of the implementation period, is the
manner ia which MWD dealt with ground water potential which may exist in
the vicinity of the Sabaki River from Baricho, the site of the river works
and water treatment plant, downstream toward Malindi. The groundwater
prospects first came to the 3ank's attention in 1977 when Bank staff
inquired about the q-tantity and quality of seepage into the deep excava-
tions at Baricho. File research by WD staff, all of which joined WD or
attained responsible positions after the project started, disclosed that
the ground-water potential was discovered late in 1973 during subsoil
investigations for the project. Tenders for exploration and testing of the
aquifers, based on documents prepared by the engineering consultants, were
received and an award was recommended to WD in 1975. However, no award was
made and the idea appears to have been abandoned by early 1976.
4.07      The planning of the groundwater investigation, the tendering and
the evaluation of tenders all took place during the project appraisal/loan
negotia.ion stages, but were never mentioned to Bank or KfW staff by either
WD or the consultants or, noted in any documents made available to the Bank
or KfW. The reasons for this are unknown. However, had the information



- 20 -
been known, the Bank probably would have delayed loan processing until
further studies were completed.
4.08      Even after WD staff tried to resurrect the idea in 1977, it took
almost a year before the Bank was given further information. The Bank then
took the position that regardless of what happened previously, and the
reasons therefore, it was inexcusable not to investigate the groundwater
fully and try to develop its potential if the quality and quantity proved
worthwhile. Although the amount of water from this source was not expected
to supplant the need for the river intake and treatment plant then under
construction, its use as a supplementary supply would reduce treatment
costs and could postpone the need for a second stage expansion of the
treatment plant.
4.09      MWD agreed to carry out the invesj0dation of the groundwater
source at Baricho, as well as another potential source closer to Malindi.
Unfortunately, the results of the explorations, carried out by a WD unit,
were not promising, although other WD staff have questioned the scope of
the study and the reliability of the conclusions.
4.10      The point of the case described in paras. 4.06-4.09 is that, at
the time, WD was not capable of following up on water resource development
possibilities which could have benefited the project. WD did not also
provide timely, full and complete information to the agencies which were
providing financial assistance. Certainly any further expansion of the
water supply systems for Mombasa and the coastal area north of Mombasa
should proceed only after a fully competent survey of groundwater potential
has been carried out. (See also Appendix B, page 12, items 4.06-4.10.)
Development of the Coast Province Water Branch (CPWB)
4.11      One of the most important project objectives was to establish an
agency to properly manage all of the water supply systems in the Coast
Province. Although much remains to be done to fulfill this objective to
the point where it approaches the expectations at appraisal, notable
progress was made during the course of the project. CPWB exists where
there was virtually no operating agency before the project (para. 1.02).
It has the framework required to successfully operate and maintain the
water supply systems in the province. It has some good key staff and has
proved itself able to manage day-to-day operations as well as to cope with
emergencies.
4.12      Performance in attaining CPWB's current position was exception-
ally good in many respects. Obtaining Government approval of the organiza-
tional structure of CPWB, of the required posts, of funding for those posts
and of staff to fill them, required an extraordinary joint effort by CPWB,
CPWB's management consultants (paras. 2.04 and 4.18), MWD and various other
Governmpnt ministries and agencies. However, this effort took much longer
than had been expected. During project preparation and appraisal, there
was no investigation-by MWD, the consultants or the Bank-of the steps and



- 21 -
time required and the difficulties that could be expected. Consequently,
although the actual performance in establishing CPWB was considered to be
record breaking, the appraisal timetable was grossly unrealistic.
4.13      CPWB's principal current deficiencies are largely beyond its
control, particu'arly since it is a branch of a ministry which itself was
unsatisfactory through much of the project execution period (paras. 4.01-
4.10). They include a shortage of competent staff at middle level tech-
nical, administrative and accounting positions; insufficient authority and
responsibility with respect to such things as personnel management, pur-
chasing and control of funds; deficient communications with MWD headquar-
ters; incomplete development of a satisfactory commercial accounting
system; unsatisfactory billing and collection systems; and an inactive
training program (paras. 4.18 - 4.20).
4.14      Staff constraints and personnel management problems are due
largely to shortage of qualified staff througkout MWD (and the country),
the Government's cumbersome and time-consuming recruiting and appointment
procedures and a shortage of adequate technical education and training
capacity. These problems are complicated and are made worse by the fact
that certain categories of staff, such as accountants and stores personnel,
are ultimately responsible to officials in another ministry (Treasury) who
decide on such things as appointments, promotions and transfers.14/ Fur-
thermore, CPWB staff are liable to be moved, - .r transfer to other posts or
training, with little, if any, advance warning to CPWB.
4.15      CPWB's lack of sufficient authority and responsibility for con-
ducting its own affairs frustrates efforts to improve operations (paras.
5.01 - 5.02). Aside from the external interference with personnel manage-
ment (para. 4.14), CPWB's performance is not helped by MWD's bureaucratic
system of control by restriction which is intended to prevent misdemeanor
but, in fact, restricts favorable action as well. Any future major devel-
opment of water supply systems in the Coast Province should be made only
after careful study of the possibility of establishing CPWB as a statutory
board (the term in Kenya for an independent parastatal organization). The
time was not right for the establishment of such a board when this loan was
made, mainly because the new water supply agency needed an institutional
umbilical cord to its parent, notwithstanding the parent's own weaknesses.
Now, however, the time appears right. (See also Appendix B, page 13, item
4.15.)
14/ MWD states (Appendix B, page 13, item 4.14) that such professional
ties probably are necessary for career development but need not be
inhibitive. Bank staff agree, but the fact is that the way in which
these ties were being used left CPWB without effective control of its
own staff.

Training
4.16      The project as described in the Loan Agreement included a small
component-total cost of KE 120,000 (US$500,000 equivalent) of which 70%
would be financed from the loan-for improvement of WD's in-house technical
training facilities and some external advanced training of staff for rural
water supply operations in Kenya. However, at the time the loan was
approved there was no specific plan of action for this component. A Bank
training officer visited Kenya shortly after the loan became effective in
an effort to promote the effective use of these funds within the comprehen-
sive training program which MWD was attempting to develop. However, his
recommendations in this respect were never implemented; at the time, MWD's
decisions about training came slowly, if at all, because MWD did not have a
full-time personnel officer and WD had no training officer or training
unit.
4.17      Eventually, as a training plan for WD was developed, it was
agreed that the training component for WD under this project would be
incorporated in the Rural Water Supply Project (Loan 1637-KE) and, par-
ticularly, in the Fifth Education Project (Credit 1107-KE). Advancedtrain-
ing for a number of WD staff was financed from various bilateral sources.
The loan funds allocated for this purpose were then used to help cover the
cost overrun on other parts of this project. In retrospect, it appears
that these funds, though small, could have been used beneficially for
training, even without the existence of a comprehensive training plan (for
obviously needed supplies, equipment and scholarships), but neither MWD nor
the Bank took the initiative. (See also Appendix B, page 13, items
4. 16-4.18.)
4.18      Staff training specifically for CPWB was designed as an integral
part of the plan for CPWB's establishment and development. Management
consultants engaged to assist with the establishment of CPWB were required
to provide staff who would be, or act as, senior executive officers of CPWB
while local counterpart staff, provided by MWD, were being trained by the
consultants to take over. In addition, ?MWD was to provide staff required
for operation and maintenance. The consultants also were required to make
a thorough classification of all jobs and positions, to identify recruit-
ment and training requirements and to prepare and manage formal training
programs.
4.19      The results of this exercise were mixed.  The classification of
jobs and positions and the approval of these posts and classifications by
the Government took much longer than predicted (para. 4.12). Furthermore,
for long periods, MWD was unable to fill a number of key senior positions
and many of the middle and lower level posts. Therefore, when the consult-
ing assignment ended, the consultants were able to leave behind only a
training manual, and, because of the lack of participants, no formal
instruction and training program was in operation. On the other hand, to
the extent possible, the consultants did manage a considerable amount of
in-service training which left CPWB with the nucleus for a potentially well



- 23 -
operating agency. Unfortunately, the weakest part of the organization is
in financial management (particularly the accounting base) and the techni-
cians operating the water treatment and pumping facilLties. Some assis-
tance in training the technicians was obtained through the equipmeni supply
contracts and even better assistance has been provided by one or two expa-
triates provided through bilateral aid programs. But the fact remains that
an organized and continuous training program for all levels of CPWB staff
is not active.
Compliance With Loan Covenants
4.20      The Loan Agreement included seven major commitments by the
Government with respect to the development and institutional performance of
CPWB. The underlying objectives of most of these obligations were satis-
fied. However, no objectives and target dates were met, although in some
cases, they were extended with the agreement of the Bank. CPWB was unable
to maintain staff, adequate in numbers and skills, to enable it to operate
efficiently,nor is there an active training program. Yet a training plan
which was prepared does meet the letter of the commitment, but it does not
satisfy the objective (para. 4.19). For one obligation, agreed procedures
were not followed; staffing of six key posts was supposed to be done after
consultation with the Bank, but in no case was the Bank consulted. How-
ever, the Bank did not make an issue of this breach since Bank staff were
not in a good position to give an objective opinion about the appointees in
advance, and, after the fact, the appointees appeared acceptable (see
para. 2.18).
Performance of Management Consultants
4.21      The management consultants engaged to assist MWD (para. 4.03)
carried out their assignment promptly and efficiently and their study and
recommendations appeared to be of good quality. The first stage of
implementing these recommendatlons, assisted by the same consultants, Is
part of the Rural Water Supply Project (Loan 1637-KE) and is in progress.
However, progress is slow because of internal resistance in MWD and the
results cannot be evaluated yet (para. 4.03). Indications are, however,
that the consultant's recommendation may have been over-ambitious, or that
implementation was started without adequate preparation (salesmanship or
indoctrination), or both.
4.22      The management consulLants for CPWB completed their work in
1978. In general, the results were below expectations because of difficul-
ties and delays in obtaining government authorization for CPWB staff posi-
tions and in filling those positions (paras. 4.12-4.15).  Nevertheless, a
great deal was accomplished and the Bank staff considers the work of the
consultants to be good. The only significant criticism is that the lmple-
mentation timetable adopted by the consultants was unrealistically short.

V. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
General
5.01      As far as CPWB's overall operations are concerned, the daily
activities required to supply water to customers are carried out with a
substantial degree of efficiency and initiative. For example, during the
period before water production from the project relieved severe shortages,
CPWB developed a rationing scheme based on house-to-house checks on storage
capacity. The rationing program was published and adhered to and quickly
reduced complaints about the unreliability of the water supply. One of the
main difficulties which CPWB has had-and continues to have-is the supply
of materials, parts and equipment required for operations, and maintenance,
including fuel. Government regulations require CPWB to purchase most items
from Government stocks even though these stocks may not be available when
needed, and CRWB can seldom get approval to buy urgently needed supplies on
the open market. Restraints presently governing procurement of materials
and parts-in fact, all purchasing-by CPWB should be relaxed to enable
quick response to urgent needs. During 1983, for example, routine pipeline
maintenance was practically non-existent; because of the lack of fuel and
transport, only emergencies were being dealt with.
5.02      Operation of the project itself improved considerably between the
time CPWB took over the facilities and mid-1983. However, it may take
years and much effort is required to devilop a first-class operation. The
improvements that have taken place appear to be due largely to in-house
training and guidance through resident advisory services provided by GTZ.
However, as for all of CPWB's other water supply facilities, major routine
maintenance was (in mid-1983) lacking to a worrisome degree. Due to MWD's
critical shortage of funds during the last half of the financial year,
maintenance requiring transport and materials was being restricted to emer-
gencies, and critical spare parts were not on hand. This also resulted
from an inadequate operating budget for CPWB for the financial year and
strict application of a government edict prohibiting supplementary budget
allocations. This is particularly disturbing to CPWB because the revenues
it returns to MWD are much greater than what it gets back for operations.
A shut-down of water supply from any one of its major sources, including
Sabaki, would be very costly in terms of revenue earned.
Water Production and Volume of Sales
5.03      The project definitely achieved the objective of eliminating
water shortages in the area of the Coast Province which it serves and of
providing reserve production and transmission capacity which should be
adequate for several more years. However, this objective was achieved
three years later than projected. Total water production by CPWB, which
had been increasing by only about 3% per year through FY80, jumped 16% in
FY81 when the project began to operate and another 27% in FY82 when the
project was operational for the whole year (Annex 6, Key Performance
Indicators). Actual production, which had fallen to 65% of the appraisal
estimate by FY80, reached about 88% of the appraisal forecasts in FY82, and
was within 10% of the forecast for FY84.



- 25 -
5.04      It should be noted, however, that the figures on the total volume
of water produced and the incremental contributions from the project, as
shown in Annex 6, are only estimates based on pump performance
characteristics and operating records, but they should be reliable within
5%. More reliable performance data should be available beginning in FY84
when installation of flow measuring equipment provided in the project has
been completed. On the other hand, no data on actual volumes of water sold
are available since CPWB's computerized billing system has yet to produce
usable consolidated data on sales volumes.
5.05      CPWB has had problems about tampering with air valves on the
transmission mains by the considerable population which has settled along
the pipeline road (originally constructed for installation of the pipeline
and now kept up for pipeline maintenance purposes) and which can get water
through those valves. CPWB has started to rectify the problem by instal-
ling water kiosks along the lines; a total of about 80 are planned. Also,
connections have been provided at intervals, from which small branch mains
can be taken to serve small local communities in the vicinity, and some of
these branches have been made.
Operating Covenants
5.06      Two commitments in the Loan Agreement relate to operation of the
project. Since the project could be affected adversely by substantial
changes in upstream water use and waste discharges, the Government agreed
tc take any control steps required to assure minimum flows of water of
acceptable quality in the Sabaki River at the Baricho intake. By the time
the project was completed, no specific action on this had been taken, other
than sampling river water at the intake, and no problems had developed.
River monitoring initiated after 1983 (para. 5.07) may satisfy the objec-
tives of this commitment.
5.07      The secoad agreement relating to operations was that MWD would
monitor river water quality downstream of the treatment plant to observe
the effects of discharges of sludge and filter wash water from the plant.
If remedial measures, although not expected, proved to be required, the
Bank was to be consulted about them.  Although the Bank urged MWD to act on
this commitment, no action was taken for three years after the plant
started partial operations.  MWD now reports that water monitoring stations
have been established before, at and after the Baricho intake, that data is
being collected on a regular basis and that no adverse quality conditions
have been detected as of June 1985.

VI. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
6.01      Financial performance of CPWB is difficult to assess because of
serious problems with the accounting system and financial reports. Never-
theless, some evaluation is possible and it is clear that financial perfor-
mance is substantially different from the appraisal forecasts.
Accounting
6.02      CPWB was set up as a self-contained accounting unit within MWD.
A commercially oriented accounting system, designed by management consul-
tants (paras. 4.12 and 4.22), and based on a pro forma opening balance
sheet, was to be in substantial operation by December 31, 1975, a commit-
ment in the Loan Agreement. Implementation started before loan approval
with the assistance of the management consultants, but the target date was
extended to July 2, 1976 with the approval of the Bank. In fact, installa-
tion of the new accounting system was completed in July 1976, and the
management consultants were retained to continue their assistance with
implementation until late in 1978.
6.03      Despite the initial progress and the consulting assistance, the
effectiveness of the commercial accounting system is not yet satisfactory.
A main reason for this is staff constraints. It has been difficult to
attract and retain-through the Treasury (para. 4.14)-personnel with ade-
quate qualifications, especially those with practical experience 'n commer-
cial account:ing, or even an appreciation of its concepts. Thus, there have
been excessive staff turnovers and shortages. At present, the accounting
staff may be adequate in numbers, but below the top level, the quality is
generally poor.
6.04      Other factors which contribute to the problems with CPWB's
accounting and financial records are, or have been:
(a)  conflicts between the Government accounting systems, used by MWD,
and the commercial-type system which CPWB is trying to maintain.
For example, CPWB cannot follow its manual in all cases because
general directives from the Treasury sometimes do not go along
with a commercial accounting system;
(b)  as reported by the Controller and Auditor General of Kenya, there
has been a lack of coordination between MWD headquarters and CPWB
in the maintenance of records and the recording ef expenditures
by each. This appears to be both a problem with timely transfers
of data and with differences in the classifications of costs and
revenues;
(c) a poorly operating computerized billing system which produces
data which often is unreliable and late (para. 6.06); and



- 27 -
(d) a lack of coordination between CPWB's operating and commercial
sections In reconciling data.
6.05      The results of the accounting problems are financial reporting
which is too slow to provide Information useful for management purposes,
and incomplete (and often unreliable) data for the purposes of either
accountability or financial analysis. CPWB's first financial reports were
those for FY77. The audit report on the FY77 accounts, along with those
for FY78 and FY79, was not issued until March 1982 (para. 6.10) and con-
tained a nunber of serious qualifications pertaining to internal checks and
controls and discrepancies. The annual accounts for FY80 were not submit-
ted for audit until August 1982 and then material adjustments were
required. The trial balance sheet for FY81 was adjusted by CPWB in 1983.
Since then, audit reports have been issued two to three years after the
close of the fiscal year. CPWB contends--with some justification--that it
cannot complete its reports until the audit reports for previous years are
issued, but the fact remains that adequate financial Information on CPWB
operations since June 30, 1982 is not yet available.
Billing System
6.06      As noted earlier, CPWB has had considerable difficulties with its
computerized bi'ling system.  Data is processed and the bills are produced
at the computer center in the Treasury in Nairobi, a service for which CPWB
is charged. Originally, the data was transmitted by telephone lines, but
this proved unreliable. Now, road transport is used to send the discs to
Nairobi and to return the computer printouts and bills to Mombasa, all at
an annual cost to CPWB of about KSh 0.25 million. There are many errors in
the bills and the computerized records. Many are due to Input errors, but
CPWB claims that many others are due to the computer program and
processing. Furthermore, according to CPWB, the billing has low priority
at the computer center and the bills often are late. The results have
compounded collection problems and, probably, have resulted in loss of
revenues.
6.07      The Bank has urged MWD to appoint a specialist on billing and
computers to review the system and recommend improvements. However, no
action has been taken.  In addition, CPWB states that it has requested
permission to use computer services available in Mombasa to prepare the
bills, but that the computer manager in the Treasury has refused--an exam-
ple of bureaucratic territorial protection. Until corrective action on the
billing system is taken, serious problems with CPWB's accounting and finan-
cial performance will continue.



- 28 -
Collections
6.08      Cash collections by CPWB have grown steadily as shown below:
KSh (million)
FY77     FY78      FY79     FY80      FY81     FY82
29.05    53.95    59.61    66.59    76.80    77.03
Figures for FY83 indicate that collections were about 12% above FY82.
6.09      On the other hand, the efficiency of CPWB's collection perfor-
mance is not good. Although this evaluation must be qualified by recogni-
tion of the billing and accounting deficiencies, it appears that accounts
receivable (even after provisions for doubtful accounts) has grown steadily
from about KSh 34 million in FY77 to about KSh 80 million in FY81, with a
peak of about KSh 114 million in FY80 (when total billings were about KSh
92.5 million). CPWB has taken steps to disconnect services for non-pay-
ment, with some success, but with the lateness and frequent inaccuracies of
the bills, this has proven to be very difficult.
Auditing
6.10      The Loan Agreement requires that CPWB's accounts be audited by
independent auditors and that the audited accounts be submitted to the Bank
within six months of the close of each fiscal year. The earliest tnat the
audit reports have been issued is 33 months after the end of the fiscal
year (for FY79). The reasons for this include CPWB's difficulties in
producing auditable accounts and staff constraints in the office of the
Controller and Auditor General of Kenya (CAG). In addition, a supervision
mission in 1978 discovered that the timetable for audits of CPWB accounts
had not been specifically pointed out to CAG, and, furthermore, that
Government commitments of this type in loan and credit agreements were
seldom made in consultation with CAG.
6.11      At the time the loan for this project was made, CAG's already
heavy commitments were recognized and it was understood that independent
auditors would be used. Also, the Government agreed that the appointment
of such auditors would be made six months before the end of the fiscal year
(para. 5.14 of Sta' Appraisal Report).  However, these understandings were
not spelled out in the Loan Agreement and no definition of independent
auditor' was given. During the course of the project the Bank accepted the
Government's position that CAG, which is ultimately responsible for audits
of all Government entities, should do the auditing. Since then, in view of
CAG's constraints, CPWB, with the encouragement of the Bank, has requested
a continuous audit by a private auditing firm. Thus far, CAG has not
agreed, although such arrangements have been made in connection with the
loan for the Second Nairobi Water Supply Project (Loan 1520-KE).

Financial Results
6.12      Because of the dearth of up-to-date reliable basic financial
data, particularly since the facilities added by the project began to oper-
ate, only an approximate assessment of CPWB's financial performance can be
made. A project objective was to ensure CPWB's financial viability and for
tariffs to reflect the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of water in the Coast
Province, which, for all practical purposes was the average incremental
cost of water supplied as a result of this project, namely KSh 5.1/m3 at
1975 prices. This LRMC objective was intended to eliminate subsidization
of services to urban centers and reduce the possibilities of misallocation
of resources and was to be reached gradually, raising tariffs in seven
steps (July 1, 1975 through July 1, 1981) until FY82 when the project was
expected to be fully utilized. In addition, to make sure that the finan-
cial viability of CPWB was maintained, the rate of return on net fixed
assets in operation (FRR) was to be at least 8% in FY80 and 10% each
fiscal year thereafter. Thus the tariff targets were a combination of
economic and financial objectives. Also, the tariff levels were based on
the assumption that the project would be fully operational in FY79. The
tariff and revenue convenants in the Loan Agreement were based on the above
objectives.
6.13      The four annual tariff increases from July 1, 1975 through
July 1, 1978 were made as agreed until average water charges were about
KSh 5.75/i3 for FY79 (KSh 3.74/m3 at 1975 prices), which took account of
the change in cost of living indices since FY74. No further tariff in-
creases have been made although CPWB, through June 1981, presented to MWB
annual calculations of the tariff levels required to meet the commitments
in the Loan Agreement. MWD's lack of action on these calculations was on
grounds that the supporting data was inaccurate and that, as of FY80, there
was little visible evidence of improvements in the water supply and, there-
fore, that political pressure prevented further tariff increases. There
was also the claim that studies leading to a national policy on water
tariffs was being prepared by MWD and that further action on CPWB tariffs
should await decisions on this policy. The Bank continually urged MWD
either to raise tariffs to the specific levels given in the Loan Agreement
or to propose an alternative by which the economic and financial objectives
of the revenue covenants could be met. To date, however, neither a nation-
al tariff policy nor an alternative to the revenue covenants has been
produced and the Government is in default on the agreements both as to the
specific average tariff levels since FY79 and the FRR covenant. (See also
Appendix B, page 14, items 6.01-6.16.)
6.14      The seriousness of the situation, with respect to meeting LRMC
objective, is demonstrated by the fact that, with no tariff increases since
the beginning of FY79, the real average charges for water supply have
fallen to only about KSh2/m3 by FY84, only about 40 Z of the LRMC. On the
other hand, it should be noted that the level of revenues has had little,
if any, direct impact on CPWB operations; revenues are channeled to MWD,
and CPWB, because of its lack of sufficient financial autonomy, has to



- 30 -
depend on MWD budget allocations for operating and development purposes
(paras. 4.13, 5.01 and 5.02).
6.15      Annex 6 provides some key indicators of CPWB's actual financial
performance (in view of the problems with financial data, no cffort has
been made to compare actual income and fund flow statements and baiance
sheets with the appraisal estimates). Because the first four tariff
increases were duly implemented, the operating net income while not reach-
ing SAR estimates, did in fact increase substantially over the FY77 through
FY80 period. During the same period the expected rapid increase in operat-
ing assets lagged substantially behind SAR estimates. Consequently the
buoyant net operating income on a very small operating assets base produced
a misleading better-than-expected rate of return on net fixed assets rang-
ing from 37% to 70%. However, when the FY81 accounts began to reflect the
new assets, the return dropped to 18% (compared to SAR estimates of
16.4%). Figures for FY82 and FY83 are not available but returns are
expected to be considerably below SAR estimates due to declining net oper-
ating income in the absence of tariff increases. Indications suggest that
the rate of return for both FY82 and FY83 is in the order of 5% or less.
6.16      Since data or reliable estimates on the volume of water sold is
not available because of accouuting problems (paras. 6.03-6.05), a compari-
son of water billings and average operating income has been based only on
the volume of water produced. On this basis, average water billings per
cubic meter of water produced, at about KSh 3.9 to KSh 5.4, were close to
appraisal estimates from FY77 through FY81 (Annex 6). Average operating
income per cubic meter of water production also was close to estimates, at
about KSh 1.3/m3 to KSh 2.7/m3, through FY80.  However, this faded to KSh
0.4/m3 in FY81, compared to KSh 3.50/i3 in the appraisal estimates, and
predictions are tnat this measure of performance will continue to fall
unless tariffs are raised or the ef-iciency of CPWB's operations increases,
or both.
VII. Justification
7.01      All of the physical objectives of the project have been met, but
with long delays. The project has increased the reliable water supply and
transmission capacity of the Coast Province Water Supply systr.ms by about
100% to about 105,000m3/day.15/  Water shortages, which had become chronic
when the project started, have ended except in areas where mor2 extensions
or improvements of the distribution network are required. The new supplies
should be adequate to meet the growing water needs of industry and commerce
along the coast until about 1992, particularly the port of Mombasa and the
tourist trade. When additional distribution works are carried out and the
transmission system is extended to Malindi (a project now being undertaken
with KfW financial assistance), a total of about 600,000 people will be
15/ CPWB expects that the increase will prove to be in the order of 170%.



- 31 -
served, including about 160,000 in rural and low-income urban areas. This
compares with about 330,000 people served-often poorly-when the project
was qtarted.
7.02      There is nothing to suggest that the concept of the project was
not the least-cost solution. However, it is possible that better explora-
tion of ground water potential in the coastal area and along the Sabaki
River could have led to reduction in capacity an%! cost of some of the water
treatment components (paras. 4.06-4.10). This potential should now be
followed up as a matter of urgency and developed, if possible, to reduce
project operating expenses and to help meet future water supply needs. MWD
reports (Appendix B, page 15, items 7.01-7.03) that this is its plan.
7.03      The institutional objectives for CPWB were not met entirely,
although, in fairness, it is clear that the institutional targets were not
realistic in a number of respects. However, much was accomplished. CPWB
was established where, for all practical purposes, no institution existed
before. Furthermore, despite its problems, CPWB has the makings of an
organization which can be further developed into an effective water supply
agency for the Coast Province (paras. 4.14, 4.15, 4.20 and 5.01-5.03).
Economic Rate of Return
7.04      At appraisal, economic rates of return (ERR) for the project were
calculated using incremental revenues from tariffs as proxies for bene-
fits. These revenues were those expected to result from annual increases
in tariffs until the average price of water reached KSh 3.74/m3 at 1975
prices in FY79 (when the project was expected to be fully operational) and
would match the long-run marginal cost of water from the Sabaki River (Ksh
5.06/m3 at 1975 prices) by FY82 when the project was expected to be fully
utilized (para. 6.12).
7.05      The results of the ERR calculations and risk analyses made at
appraisal showed that the ERR would be about 11%, dropping to about 6% if
benefits were 30% lower and costs were 20% higher than estimated.
7.06      In fact, the water tariffs have come no where near meeting either
the long-run marginal cost (para. 6.14) or the ERR objectives . Using the
same assumptions as the appraisal forecasts with respect to duties and
taxes and shadow prices (since available data is no better), converting
benefits and costs to 1983 prices, and assuming that average charges for
water are maintained at FY83 levels in real terms, the estimated ERR for
the project would be from abou: 2.5X to 2.7Z (Annex 7), depending on
whether water demand reaches the production capacity of the project facili-
ties by FY90 or FY88, respectively (the appraisal estimate was FY87). The
major factors that contributed to this low rate of return were:
(a) failure to raise tariffs after FY78;
(b) delays in project execution and consequently in delayed
benefits; and
(c) the increases in basic project cost.



- 32 -
If benefits were to be increased by about 100Z, resulting from an increase
in average tariffs of about 75 X in FY84 (highlv unlikely) and maintained
at that level in real terms, the estimated ERR would be about 7 Z.
VIII. BANK PERFORMANCE
8.01      Bank performance on this project is considered by Bank staff to
have been generally satisfactory. However, some evaluations made by the
Bank during the appraisal and early implementation stages proved to be
wrong and, in addition, steps could have been taken to improve the Bank's
contributions, albeit at additional cost to the Bank.
8.02      Initially, the Bank accepted unrealistic scheduling of both
physical and institutional components (paras. 3.05 and 4.12). This was due
in part to not fully appreciating the difficulties that could arise when:
(i) responsibility for project administration was shifted to a newly estab-
lished ministry during the time the loan was being processed (para. 2.07);
and (ii) WD assumed the role of Engineer for the project (paras. 3.26-
3.27). This led to overestimation of the borrower's implementation capa-
city. In retrospect, the Bank should have held back approval of civil
works contract awards until a firm agreement with consultants for construc-
tion supervision was in effect (para. 3.07)16/. This probably would have
delayed the start of some of those contracts, but many problems and delays
experienced later in the project might have been avoided.
8.03      The Bank was instrumental in establishing CPWB which is consid-
ered a major project accomplishment, especially considering the prevmous
situation (para. 1.02). However, the Bank could have pressed harder and
provided more assistance and follow-up on the implementation of regular
organized training programs; as it was, the funds for traiz.ing were eventu-
ally diverted to help cover the cost overruns (paras. 4.19-4.20).
8.04      The Bank did about all that could reasonably be done to persuade
the Government to take satisfactory action on the tariff issue (nara.6.13).
The attempted persuasion was not effective, however, for a variety of
reasons, including: (i) the lack of timely accounts (para. 6.02-6.07) and
other data to support convincingly the need for further tariff increases in
the face of preliminary figures indicating rates of return on assets of up
to 70 % in FY80 as compared to the coventanted 10 Z (para. 6.15); (ii) the
Government's repeated assurances that a national policy on water tariffs
would be ready for discussion soon; (iii) reservations about using average
water charges to reflect LRMC, while for Nairobi (Loan 1520-KE approved in
1978) the highest level in the tariff structure was used; and (iv) with the
16/ Because of the Mombasa experience, th's procedure was followed in a
subsequent water supply project in Kenya financed by the Bank.



- 33 -
delay in visible proJect benefits until 1981 and 1982, there was strong
political pressure to delay tariff increases after FY79. When persuasion
was not effecrive, some thought was given to suspending disbursement. Such
action was not caken, however, because by the time the Government ceased
tariff increases, the major contracts were underway and Bank staff believed
that suspension would do more harm than good by further increasing time and
cost overruns.
8.05      Staff continuity between project preparation and appraisal was
only fair. After that, however, continuity was good. On the other hand,
better staffing of supervision missions could-have improved the Bank's
contribution during implementation. In general, these missions were over-
extended by being too small whili working concurrently on four or more
projects in Kenya, especially considering the usual lack of data in useful
form about this project when missions arrived. None of the 17 supervision
missions had more than two Bank staff members, and nine missions had only
one staff member. As a result, mission field time was devoted mostly to
immediate implementation and institutional problems, such as accounting and
billing and it was not possible to give adequate attention to lobbying for
important Government action on such things as tariffs. Unfortunately,
better mission staffing did not occur because of staff and budget con-
straints. If it had been possible, the project also could have benefitted
by stationing a staff member in the Bank's Regional Mission in Nairobi to
assist with supervision for the first two or three years.
8.06      Bank staff consider that working relations with MWD and other
government officials were cordial, but that the productivity of these rela-
tions was constrained somewhat by frequent changes in NWD's key staff and
the guarded communication by some of that staff. (See also Appendix B,
page 15, items 8.01-8.06.)
IX. CONCLUSIONS
General
9.01      There is considerable uncertainty about the quantitive results of
this project because it has been in operation for little more than three
years at the time of this report and the tecords available to the Bank on
operations during that period are not adequate. Nevertheless, the project
as a whole appears to have been a marginal success and, assuming no major
adverse development, and satisfactory resolution of var'ous outstanding
matters, the future contributions of the physical components of the project
to Kenya's Coait Province should be very good.
9.02      Project objectives were sound, although there was a lack of
realism in the timetables for achieving those objectives. Implementation
was difficult and prolonged. Costs were much higher than expected because
of changes in design, delays and initial under-estimation of prices and
quantities, and because the project was carried out during a period of high



- 34 -
inflation, both in Kenya and abroad. Because of the cost overrun and
failure to complete a tariff reform program, the expected financial goals
and long-run marginal cost pricing objectives were not reached. Likewise,
the estimated internal economic rate of return, using incremental revenues
as a proxy for benefits, is only between 2.5 % and 2.7 Z which is far below
expectations. However, the present situation is not beyond recovery, and
prompt Government action could result in financially sound water supply
operations in the Coast Province, which should be a prerequisite for any
future Bank operations in the Coast Province water sector.
9.03      Institutional objectives were not entirely met, but, in retro-
spect, they were neither properly planned nor realistic. Much credit
should be given for the fact that CPWB has been firmly established from a
zero base (para. 1.02). With continued effort and assistance, and with
more authority to control its own affairs, it could develop into an effi-
cient public utility.
Lessons from the Project Experience
9.04      The major lessons emerging from the project experience are listed
below. Additional comment by MWD is given in Appendix B, page 15, item
9.04.
(a) Arrangements for engineering design and construction supervision
should avoid situations where the immediate responsibility for
design, construction supervision and project management is
divided between the consulting engineers and the client (paras.
3.26 - 3.27);
(b) The design and procurement practice of completing civil works
design and awarding separate civil works contracts for water
treatment plants after the water treatment equipment contract is
awarded can lead to many implementation problems. Furthermore,
such procedures increase the uncertainty of bid evaluations for
equipment supply contracts and also can lead to lending too early
in the project cycle (para. 3.11);
(c)  When a new institution is to be established, project preparation
should include a detailed investigation of the procedures, steps
and time that would be required for establishing the agency,
getting posts approved, obtaining funds (budget authorizations),
and staff recruitment (para. 4.12). The appraisal timetable
should be based on the results of this investigation;
(d) A public utility vhich is not allowed sufficient autonomy with
respect to appointment and training of staff and other aspects of
personnel management, either through regulation by government or
in the way such regulations are administered, can be expected to
have chronic staff problems (paras. 4.13- 4.15 and 5.01-5.02);



- 35 -
(e)  Training components of projects should be designed in detail
before the loan is made. In the event that this is not practic-
able, as was the case in this project, the loan documents should
make it clear that the amount of the loan allocated for this
purpose cannot be reallocated and would be cancelled if not
utilized (paras. 4.16-4.19);
(f)  When external audits are subject to the control of a government
auditing agency, that agency, prior to preparation of a loan
agreement, should be consulted about loan conditions pertaining
to audits (paras. 6.10-6.11); and
(g)  Financial covenants requiring specific tariff increases,
although based on valid LRMC concepts, may appear arbitrary and
difficult to Implement when it comes to hard politically sensi-
tive actions. It might be easier to impose tariffs based on net
revenue contributions to construction, with the contribution
being based on LRKC. Also, rate of return on assets requirements
should include works in progress to prevent severe distortions
during implementation periods.
Future Action: Unfinished Business
9.05      There are a number of actions which remain to be taken to maxi-
mize the benefits of this project and to prepare any future water supply
development projects for the Coast Province, including those listed below.
MWD's reactions to these suggestions are given in Appendix B, page 16, and
are generally in agreement.
(a)  A thorough investigation of groundwater potential (para. 4.10);
(b)  In addition to (a) consultants should be engaged to evaluate and
pull together all work done to date by others with respect to
water supply requirements and water resource development in the
Coast Province and to prepare a consolidated program of water
supply projects;
(c)  Organization and implementation of a continuous training program
for all levels of CPWB staff (para. 4.19);
(d)  Conversion of CPWB and the Mombasa Pipeline Board into a single
statutory Board with direct responsibility for implementing
projects and operation of its facilities under the general
technical supervision of MWD (paras. 2.01 and 4.15);



- 36 -
(e) Without limitations on the above, the water supply agency for the
Coast Province should be allowed to raise tariffs and take
necessary steps to satisfy the revenue covenants (Section 4.04)
of the Loan Agreement. Furthermore, the agency should be allowed
to retain revenues required for proper operation and maintenance
(Section 4.07 of the Loan Agreement), including; appropriate
authority to purchase parts and supplies as needed (paras.
5.01-5.02);
(f) MWD should, as part of its responsibility for managing water
resources, fulfill the obligations with respect to monitoring and
controlling of the quality and quantity of the Sabaki River water
as given in Sections 3.07 and 3.13 of the Loan Agreement (paras.
5.06-5.07);
(g)  Authorization should be given to CPWB to utilize private local
computer services for its billing operations and to engage a
specialist to review and assist with improvement to the
computerized billing program (paras. 6.06-6.07); and
(h) Authorization should also be given to CPWB to engage a private
auditing firm to provide a continuous audit and assistance with
implementation of CPWB's accounting system (paras. 6.02-6.05 and
6.11).

2.  The increase in cost between the Appraisal Project cost and final
construction cost was also due to the fact that project appraisal
costs were based on Preliminary Design Report costs which changed
when the final design costs were finally worked out. Thus the
cost over run would have been lower if basic cost base was more  Paragraph 2
accurate. It must be noted that the concept of implementing this  amended.
project without preparing detail designs was a mistake which lead
the project in a wrong footing.
The original Project period was too short and could have been much
longer if the likely project difficulties were allowed for.
3.  Project was successful. It increased water supply to Nlombasa by over
100% (nearly 70o%and this is estimated to be adequate until after 1992.
The Coast Province Water Branch was established firmly. Its major  Paragraphs 3
objectives were met and what is seen is the operational problems that   and 7.01
are bound to arise in any organization and which are being resolved with ameded-
time. Building of the institution is a continuous process and CPWB has
to contend with this. Training programme was prepared by Mlanagement
Consultant and its implementation followed after their departure.
It is not clear in what context lack of insufficient autonomy contributed   Covered in paras.
to serious problems. Full autonomy at this stage of CPWB Development 4.13-4.15; 5.01-
is not desirable especially since it has to rely on MOWID and Treasury    5.02 and 9.04(d).
for funding capital development.

the discount rate calculated before the major foreign exchange
adjustments (that obtained later) were realistic. Perhaps another
method of tariff calculation not based on LMC could be more
reidistic here.
Even though the ERR is below target it is still positive.
5.  To the list of difficulties given and before commenting on the items    New para. 6
(a) to (1) mentioned, the following difficulties were also experienced  added.
on the project.
1. There were some difficult contractors on site.
2. Intake site was a difficult site and it had several construction
problems which were not dealt witheompleteIyduring design.
3. The Bank procurement procedure that were followed, were often
lengthy and took consilerable time during the processing of
contracts. This added to time delay.
The comments on the "ifficulties enumerated under 5 (a) to (i)
are as follows:-
(a) The, Water Department has existed as a Technical Department  Para. 5(a)
of other Ministries as early as 1930ts and during this period  amended.
it had handled several large comperable projects e.g. Mzima
Pipeline, Mwea Irrigation Scheme etc. The change of name from
Department to Ministry should not have changed its Technical
ability in designing and implementing Sabaki Water Project.
(b) The time table was worked out jointly with Bank Officials and
Bank approved it, but implementation problems made it
become unrealistic.
(c) The timing for planning of institutional development and
training was overtaken by the Ministry's phenomenal high
growth at this period.
(d) As was the case with a previous, similar large project, the  Cross-reference
presence of MOWD project Administration Technical Staff in  to these co  ents
the project area would have made the project administration  added to paras.
on site much more effective. The issue of who is the Engineer    5(d) and 4.02.
would therefore not arise then. Under the project under
review, it is doubtful whether delegatbg the Engineer wholy
would have made much difference.

(e) The Principle of splitting equipment supply and Civil works
contracts is alright. But the arrangement for package       Cross-reference
contracts would have to be carefully considered to ensure   to these com-
proper grouping of equipment supply with related civil works  ments added to

on sub-contract basis.                                      3.11.
In this case the split was inevitable due to the design approach
adopted by the consultants. However, at the other end of the
scale, there was the Bank' s policy to encourage local
participation and this could only be achieved through splitting
of the contracts into smaller portions that would be within the
competence of local contractors.
(f) There had to be waiting time when Management consultants input
to be available to be incorporated into the Engineering Consultants
design. Since the two consultancies were running parallel there
was bound to be waiting time.
(g) The delayed payments resulted into difficulties during construction,
but these delays were as a result of existing financial procedures
for control of expenditure.
(h) The conversion of CPWB to Commercial Accounting as opposed
to cash accounting is a difficult issue which is being resolved.
(i) The project staff changed during the duration of construction.
This was inevitable and it is a problem the world over which
was difficult to prevent durig the project life.
6.  Comments on lessons resulting from the Project experience.
(a) Arrangements for engineering design and construction supervision
has to be made at the beginning of project with all design   Cross-reference
principles and limits agreed upon prior to commencing any work.   to these com-
Recognition must be given to Technical Departments in being  inents added to

staff stay on site.
Where Consultants have -to be engineers then the Consultant must
be good in the fiald in question and have good monitoring
capability. There must also be good working relationship between
the consultant and Employer (engineer becomes part of Employer)
Banks insists on use of Consultants and contractors on Bank
funded projects. The employer is required to build up its
Technical capability by the Bank. What work will they do then
under Bank financed projects. There is a potential conflict of
purpose here.

(b)    Awarding separate contracts for equipment supply and
civil works can cause problems.
(c) The context in which the advance planning is required for
establishment of a new institution is not clear. In the case of
CPWB, there was some Provincial Organization existing and this
was improved upon to become CPWB by Management Consultants.
(d) It is not clear what the report intends Autonomy to mean. The
issue in question is not one of autonomy but one of increased  Explanation
powers to handle most of its staff affairs. CPWB wil stil  covered in paras.
require MOWD and Treasury support in financing arrangements. 4.13-4a15, 59014
5.02 and 9.04(d).
(e) The issue of training should have been persued more vigorously
right from start if the training funds under the loan were to
be utilised. The Management Consultant left this till the
last part of their assignment and had no time to implement
it. Nevertheless after their departure many officers were
trained using other sources of funding.
(f)  The need for consultation with Government Agencies involved
with statute function is vital to avoid including clauses or
conditions in project plans or agreements that are at variance
with borrowers statute(s). This was the case with Auditing.
7.  Comments on Actions required to sustain CPWB and Sabaki Project.
(a) Preparation of future plans for supply area water needs    Cross-reference
before existing systems are overloaded is realistic. The   to these com-
question of groundwater needs more studies to be conducted.  ments added to
para. 8.
(b) Strengthening of CPWB t3hrough training and increased control
on personnel is vital. The issue of merging CPWB and MPB
as statutory body however depends upon whether it is being
considered in the context of bulk supply or Provincial supply.
In the case of Provincial supply, then this recommendation
will be difficult to implement.
CPWB is a Provincial supply and is not only a bulk supply
hence transformation into statutory Board will be difficult
under the current stage of development.
(c) The issue of subsidised tariff rates or non-subsidised
rates is a Government policy and CPWB has no authority over
it. With time CPWB is expected to perfect its biRling system,
revenue collection and evolve improved financial manz^gement.

(d) Issue of preventative maintenance by CPWB is vital. The
preventative maintenance refers to proper maintenance.
CPWB lays emphasis to proper maintenance, of plant at
projects and this is in force using resident Mechanical and
Electrical Staff supported with adequate supervision from
Headquarters.
(e) The programme to monitor Sabaki River Water quality and
quantity would have been much better if this was done earlier
before the project construction period. However, it is a needed
data source for future continued use of Project intake at
Baricho. Quantity and quality monitoring of Sabaki River
upstream and down stream of the Baricho Intake had already
been established and is being carried out on a continuous basis.
Introduction and Background

3.05  Wbilst delaved payments contributed to delayed project
completion, the unexpected condition at the intake site also
contributed to delay in completion of the project. Delays     Para. 3.05
in payments resulted from financial control measuees which    xmended.
came into force around 1979, and were never intended. The
contribution of unexpected site conditions should also not be
underestimated as cause of delay change in design, increased
cost and some of the claims.
3.07  Essentially the engineering consultant was procured by MEPB
and was paid for their services by MPB. Procedurally for the
MOA to adopt this consultant government procedures for        Para. 3.07 amended
selection and engagement of consultants had to be observed    and cross-
hence the lapse in time between the two assignments. As for   reference to these
the attempt to change the consultant for supervision, the     comients added.
expertriate staff who had hitherto handled the project management
upto this time left no records to show their reasons for desiring
this change.
It is rather ironic that the first major contract to be awarded
was that of the pipeline and whose initial supervision was handled
by Resident MOW]) staff turned out to be one of the most successful
contract. It is thought that the issue was not one of formal
supervision establishment but rather supervision staff strength
before start of construction.
3.08, 3.09, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
Thle issuing of instructions to commence work after award took  Cross-references
sometime because the contractors argued out their tender      to these comments
qualification/conditions to their satisfaction. The contractors  added to paras.
were not prepared to commence work till all their demands     3.08 and 3.11-
were satisfactorily met.                                      3.13.
The engineering consultants design approach dictated the spliting
of contracts in the manner described in this report. With
the difficulties experienced during construction, use
of one main contractor with equipment supply as sub-contractors
would have been much more easier to control or manage.
The issue of Telecommunications and housing contracts and
new headquarter building for CP@B was a case of to what
extent one would accommodate specific particular requirements
that are brought up at a late date when engineering design
and procurement of contractors is at an advanced stage.
Albeit engineering consultants ought to have obtained this
input from management consultants once the shape of
institutional build-up was established in terms of numbers

and levels of degree of service.
3.13  Invariably the claims brought up by contractors or against
contractors was bound to arise and had to be settled during
and after the end of project completion period. None of these
claims ended in court or Arbitration up to end of project
period.
Project costs
3.14 - 3.18 In general there were appreciable difference in costs of
bids accepted compared to either engineering consultant's
estimates or appraisal estimates. These increases and the
reasons thereof are adequately covered in these paragraphs.
3.19  The engineering design approach adopted did not come up with
complete requirements for proper completion of main contracts
especially that of intake and Treatment plant for example.   Cross-reference
This meant that additional instructions had to be effected   to these comn-
resulting from site conditions that were not adequately provided    ments added to
for either in the specifications and or quantities. These    para. 3.19.
additional requirements costs became considerable, but had
to be provided for the proper completion of intake works.
Project Financing
3.20 It is noted that Government financed about 60% of project cost
whilst World Bank and KFW loans financed about 40% of project
cost.
Disbursements
3.23 and 3.24
Since all World Bank Loan proceeds were disbursed there is no
further comments here.
Performance of Engineering Consultants
3.25 to 3.30  No further comments to the reported satisfactory
performance of the consultants except to add that whatever
the arrangement used, MOWI) would still have had to accept and  Cross-reference

1 v   INSrITUIIONAL PERFORMANCE
MINISIRY OF WATER DEVELOPMENT
4.01  It is doubtful whether what is termed abrupt setting up of
Ministry of Water Development could have been the cause of
the problems described in para. 4.01, 4.02. At this time the
project was being administered by expertriate staff some of       Paras. 4.01 and
whom are now Bank Project officers. U it is an issue of           4.02 anended
inexperience then those expertriate staff who actively handled    and cross-
the preparation of the project plans and bulk of engineering      refer.mce to
designs would have more to do with projects shortcomings than     thepe co. ent
the local staff who later were left with prepared project to      wided.
complete. Infact it is at this time when new expertriate staff
joined the new project administration that the strained relations
with consultants manifested itself including suspending the
consultants work during design.
Whilst there were some transitional adjustment problems that
MOWD faced from inception, these appear to be overstated to the
point where it borders on personality like or dislike. Under these
circumstances it is doubtful whether the remarks were directed
to the officer or the office.
Of course, WD had acted as Engineer on many previous contract

Technical ministries.
The issue here was that the Project Administration unit which the
Bank required to be distinct would have been more effective if it
was resident in the project area.

Really all Government institutions and infact every institution  EAPWU Division Notes
including the Bank have bureacratic procedures and this has to be
viewed in this perspective. This is a tradition of org anisatioii
wlhich should not be ignored or be taken lightlv, but considered

The issue of groundwater investigation was bound to delay
considerably the implementation of the project by as much as
at least 2 years whilst the aquifers were being investigated.
There should be no confution between water found in the river

prospective for point source small supplies. With this premise,
it is most unlikely that groundwater may play a major role in
bulk- water supply to Mombasa. Future bulk water supply for
Mombasa would therefore have to come from inland sources to
the SoutI, South West or West of Mombasa. Studies using
other sources of funds are already in progre:z.
Development of CP!B

in need of improvement and this is what resulted into CPWIB
through the project.

has to be up dated while being implemented.
Performance of Management Consultants
The time within which the management consultants work was
undertaken was such that the success achieved was realistic.
Continuity of the institution established would play great part
in establishing the success of the institutions thus set up.

The rates charged in Coast Province are higher than anywhere
else in the Republic and an attempt to raise them higher may
cause complaints from the consumers. It is therefore
necessary that steps be taken to supply more consummers
along the pipeline with water and make them understand the
value of water and proper usage before thinking of raising
the charges.

especially in reduced chemicals used in treatment.
CPWB as a Provincial water supply institution is expected to
continue to develop into an effective organization.
Economic Rate of Return
Certainly the changes in base cost assumptions from what was
predicted at appraisal has distorted the economic rate of return
to a figure lower than that calculated at appraisal whilst some
adjustment in water rates is expected to take place with time,
the acceptable or affordable levels to which such rates may be
raised are tnlikely to reach the ERR = 11% expected at time of
appraisal. Water projects are social in nature and it is always
difficult to achieve positive ERR as commercial projects.
BANK PERFORMANCE

identfying themselves with the project, considering the borrower
as um=of Bank funds, his needs and limitations should be considered
during the settling of such conditions.
It would appear that the economic or financial procedures available
were unable tD accurately accommodate changed project cost
thereby causing distortion in expected ERR during the post project
period.
FUTURE ACTIONS: Unfinished Business
9.05   On the recommended future actions the following comments are made:
(a) Investigation of groundwater should be done, and some work  Cross-reference
is already being done on this.                            to these com-
ments added to
(b) Whilst use of consultant is realistic, consideration for  para 9.05.
utilising a permanent planning team to constantly analyse
data and process demands and requires sources of supply
should not be ignored.
(c) There is a need for a continuous training programme to be
implemented.
ed) MPB is being wound up and CPWB is taking over its Bulk
supply systems.
(e) Adjustment of water tariffs as necessary is inevitable.
CPWB does have a limited authority to :thase spare parts
and supplies upto certain extent and it is the level of
authority that needs review from time to time.
if) Monitoring and controlling of quality and quantity of water in
Sabaki river should be continued.
(g) Other than using private local computer firms, consideration
of MOWD acquiring its computer should be considered
seriously to assist CPWB in billing.
(h) Engagement of private auditor or not is matter for the
relevant Audit Department to decide upon. Currently
that department has Auditors continuously auditing
CPWB accounts.
