BAHAMAS:  WATER SUPPIY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT FOR NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
(LOAN 1320-BM)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Water Supply arid
Sewerage Project for New Providence Island, for which Loan 1320-BM was ap-
proved in July 1976 in the sum of US$10.0 million.  linaL Disbursement was
made in March 1983. There were no cancellations.
The PCR waa prepared by the Latin America and Caribbean Projects
Department on the basis of the findings of a FebrLiary 1983 mission, docu-
ments contained in regional files arid information provided by various Bank
staff members involved with the project during its excecution.  The Borrower
(The Water and Sewerage Corporation - WSc) was most helpful in providing
information.  The Borrower's opinion is attached as Amnex 13 of the Project
Completion Report.
A project audit was not performed by the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED).
Following standard OED procedures, copies of the PCR were sent to
the Government and IISC for their comments.  Connents were receIved from TISC
and have been reflected in the final repoTt.  The coamments are also repro-
duced in Annex 14,

PROJECT CO?4PLETION REPORT
BAHAMAS:  WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT FOOR NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
(LOAN 1320-BM)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was the first Bank project in the Bahamas.   It was
designed to alleviate New Providence Island's severe water shortage and
sewerage problems, which, it was feared, would have an adverse effect on
tourism - the mainstay of the country's economy.   An equally important
project goal was to ensure the development of the Water and Sewerage Corpo-
ration (WSC) into a strong sector institution.   The design of the water
supply component was quite innovative in that it included barging cf water
to 'New Providence Island from Andros Island, 25 miles away.  The sewerage
component coaprised rehabilitation of the network serving Nassau's princi-
pal commercial and government area and construction of a sewage interceptor
at Prince George Wharf to handle raw sewage from cruise ships.   Financing
was also provided for coneultants' services for engineering and supervi-
sion, and for a training program.
Progress was very slow during the first two years of implementa-
tion when WSC's organization and powers of authorization were being de.-
fined.   Further delays were  caused  by insufficient preparation  (para.
3.05)-
Project content was substantially modified during execution.  The
findings of a UNDP hydrological survey led to the redesign of the water
supply component (para. 3.03).  Construction of the sewage interceptor be-
came unnecessary after international regulations requiring shipboard sewage
treatment and holding tanks were enacted  (para. 3.04).   The changes in
project design allowed cost overruns, particularly in the sewerage com-
ponent, to be absorbed without a significant increase in total project cost
(para. 3.07).
WSC's financial performance was poor during project execution.
Production    shortfalls    and    inability    to    significantly    reduce
unac'ounted-for  water  were  the  primary  reasons  for  WSC's  financial



(v)
problems.  As a result, rates of return were consistently below those co-
venanted (para. 5.01), even though water tariffs are among the highest in
the region.  A second major factor in the disparity between projected and
actual financial results is that Bank assumptions were overly optimistic
(paras. 8.01 and 8.02).
Despite the 3-1/2 years of delay in completion, the project was
successful in relieving New Providence Island's chronic water supply short-
age. The Borrower believes that most project objectives have been achieved
(Annex 14).  WSC has become a stable, well-run organization (para. 6.01),
with good prospects for improved performance. The Bank played a major role
in this evolution (para. 8.03).

WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT FOR NEW PROVIDENCE
ISLAND
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Project's main goal was to provide adequate water to New Pro-
vidence Island and to improve sewerage service in Nassau.   At appraisal,
the resident population of New Providence Island was estimated at about
120,000 (60Z of the country's total population) and was growing at about 3%
annually.   New Providence Island and the adlacent Paradise Island are the
country's main tourist centers; tourism accounted for 77% of GNP at ap-
praisal.   Nassau is the country's capital and main commercial center.
1.02        The country's water resources are limited.   Almost all potable
water is extracted from fragile fresh water lenses formed by seepage of
rain through the sedimentary limestone crust.  The limitation is particu-
larly severe on New Providence Island.   On the other hand, Andros Island
(about 25 miles west of New Providence Island) has abundant water resources
and few inhabitants.
The Sector
1.03        Until mid-1976, sector responsibility was divided between the
Ministry of Works and Utilities (MOWLI) and the Ministry of Public Health.
MOWU was responsible for the country's water and sewage systems, and the
Ministry of Public Health was in charge of solid waste disposal.  The New
Providence Island water system, the country's largest, served 90% of
Nassau's population through 22,000 residential connections and about 200
standpipes.
1.04       The main sources of supply were Government-owned well fields on
New Providence Island, purchases from privately owned well fields and a de-
salination plant.   Capacity had not kept up with  the increased  demand
caused by rapid expansion of tourism in the late 1960s and increased migra-
tion from rural areas.   The effects of insufficient capacity were com-
pounded by unaccounted-for water reaching 48% of production.  As a result,
water was being rationed even i- tourist areas.



- 2 -
1.05       The sewer system that served Bay Street and Shirley Street, the
island's principal commercial and government center, was in danger of col.-
lapsing.   In addition,  sewage  from cruise ships was  discharged without
treatment into Nassau Harbour.  Apart from the obvious potential health ha-
zards, it was feared that the sewage from the cruise ships 4ould foul near-
by, economically important beaches.
The Borrower and Executing Agency
1.06        The Bahamas Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC), the Borrower
and executing agency, was established in July 1976 (para. 2.02). It is re-
sponsible for providing water and sewerage services to New Providence
Island,   WSC is a statutory corporation,  wholly owned by the Government.
It is governed by a six-member Board of Directors, chaired by the Hinister
of Works and Utilities.   WSC's chief executive officer, the General Man-
ager, is appointed by the Board.  The initial organization is depicted in
Annex 1, page 1.
1.07        At appraisal, the water  tariff structure charged progressively
higher rates over three consumption levels. Although the charges were re-
latively high, they did not cover operating costs. A complicated sewerage
tariff covered about 15% of sewerage operating costs.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preappraisal and Appraisal
2.01       The Bahamas' urgent need for expanded water supply and improved
sewerage services first came to the Bank's attention during the October
1973 economic mission.  The Government of the Bahamas first approached the
Bank about obtaining assistance for a sewerage project in early 1974.
After a thorough review of sector issues, it was agreed that the project
would concentrate on meeting New Providence Island's most urgent needs in
water and sewerage. The Bank provided considerable assistance to the Gov-
ernment in identifying the most appropriate solution to the country's water
shortage.   Development  of the aquifer  on Andros Island and shipping of
water to New Providence Island was determined to be the fastest and least
expensive way of relieving the water crisis.  Installation of a new desal-
ination plant was also included, but was dropped from the project after the
appraisal mission in favor of developing additional well field and storage
capacity on Andros Island.
2.02        The establishment of an autonomous water and sewerage authority
had been of major concern since the earliest stages of project processing.
To encourage the Government to establish WSC, submission to the Bank of an
organization chart, draft budget and draft legislation, and appointment of
key staff were made conditions of negotiations. Implementation of a tariff
increase was also made a condition of negotiations.  Enactment of the leg-
islation became a condition of Board Presentation.



- 3 -
2.03        Appointment of top-level staff proved difficult.  There wore no
Bahamian nationals available to fill the positions and hiring of expatri-
ates had become a sensitlve issue.  In nddition, the Bank and the Govern-
ment had not come to terms on the tariff issue.  Rather than delay negoLta-
tions, the Bank made appointment of the WSC staff and implementatton of the
tariff increase conditions of Board Presentation.
Negotiations
2.04      Negotiations with representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the
Central Bank of the Bahamas and MOWU were held in Washington in mid-March
1976. Major topics of discussion Included the magnitude of the Lariff in-
crease and arrangements for cofinancing.
2.05         From the beginning it was understood that additional lenders
would have to be found to finance the project. By negotiations, the Carib-
bean Development Bank (CDB) had agreed to finance works on Andros Island.
Their US$3.2 million loan was approved in June 1976.   It was agreed that
the Government would obtain commitments from commercial banks to provide
US$6.0 million as a condition of Board Presentation.  Retroactive Bank fi-
nancing of up to US$1.0 million waE provided for consultants' services,
equipment and civil works.
Principal Oblectives and Description
2.06      The project was aimed at overcoming L'-e thireat to tourism caused
by severe water shortages and reducing health hazards and pollution caused
by inadequate sewerage.   An equally important gnal was the development of
WSC as a strong sector institut on.   Tables presenting the project compo-
nents and Loan covenants designed to meet these objectives are presented in
Annexes 2 and 3, respectively.
IIT. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01       Delays in fulfilling the conditions of Board Presentation caused
Loan approval to be postponed until July 27, 1976.  The Loan Agreement was
signed on September 10, 1976 and became effective on November 15, 1976.
The project was to have been completed by end-December 1978.
Projlect Revisions
3.02      An explanatory list of the major changes in project scope is pre-
sented in Annex 4.  A schedule of related changes in the allocation of Loan
funds is presented in Annex 5.
3.03      Hydrological investigations carried out by the United NaLions De-
velopment Programme (UNTDP) in 1974-78 led to a decision to develop the
wellfields on New Providence Island, reduce production and shipping from
Andros Island and drop rehabilitation of the costly and inefficient Blue
Hills desalination plant.  The Loan Agreement was amended to reflect these
changes in November 1978.



-4-
3.04        Increased reliance on water from the New Providence well fields
reduced the need to construct additional storage on New Providence Island.
In addition, new US Coast Guard and other i-.ternational regulationi requir-
ing shipboard sewage treatment systems and holding tanks had elipinatcd the
harbour's pollution. problem.   Roth components were therefore deleted from
the project.   A decision on WSC's  request to use the funds reloEsed by
these changes for the cross-island water transmission main and the Pay
Street sewerage works was deferred until WSC had taken action to improve
its financial position.  The reallocation was approved in September 1982.
Implementation Schedule
3.05        The physical components were completed by June 30, 1982, about
3-1 /2 years later than anticipated at appraisal (Annex 6). Initial project
exec.;ution was delayed for two years while WSC was being organized. During
this period, all civil works contracts, materials purchases and staff hir-
ing had to be approved by the Board.  Once this problem was resolved, the
construction of major project components was further delayed by inadequate
project preparation; pzeparation of consultants' terms of reference and up-
dating studies and designs took longer than expected.   In addition,  the
28-month implementation schedule formulated at appraisal was overly opti-
mistic, given the project's technical complexities and in view of the fact
that the Borrower and executing agency was not legally formed until two
weeks bef-ore Board Presentation.
Procurement
3.06          The Borrower procured  all  Bank-financed  goods  and  services
through international competitive bidding procedures, in accordance with
Bank guidelines. All large contracts were awarded to foreign firms. Smal-
ler contracts, which would not have been attractive to foreign firms, were
awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding and letters of invita-
tion.   Expansion of the New Providence Island well fields and replacement
of small pipes in the Nassau distribution system were carried out by force
account.
Costs and Disbursements
3.07       A detailed cormivarison of project costs as estimated at appraisal
and upon completion is presented in Annex 7. These costs are eammarized as
follows (in US$ million):
Appraisal Estimate                Actual

Project costs are not readily comparable because of the significant changes
in project scope.  Overall cost increases were minimized by the changes in
project design.   The Bay Street sewerage component encountered the most
significant cost increase.   This was the result of the consultants' under-
estimation of costs and the need to replace, rather than rehabilitate, the
pumping stations.   A cumulative schedule of disbursements is presented in
Annex 8.
Performance of Consultants and Contractors
3.08      But for one exception, W4SC staff were satisfied with the perform-
ance of consultants and contractors. The exception arose when the dredging
subcontractor  encountered  harder-than-expected  rock  in  the  harbour  at
Andros Island.  When WSC refused to accept a claim for higher costs from
the prime contractor, the subcontractor abandoned the site. Work was sus-
pended for seven months until arrangements were made to hire another sub-
contractor to complete the work.   After the work was completed, the orig-
inal contractor sued WSC for additional costs incurred.   WSC countersued
for special damages, including delay in completing the works, cost of ad-
ditional construction equipment and damage of vessels. B+th claims are aow
pending before the Supreme Court of the Bahamas.
Reporting
3.09       In general, required reports were submitted in a timely fashion
(Annex 3).
IV.  OPERATING PERFORMARCE
4.01      Because of the delays in completing the water supply components,
WSC was forced to ration water until 1982.  The impact of water rationing
was most severely felt by residential consumers.   Not surprisingly, water
production and sales during project implementation were substantially below
the projections made at appraisal.   Statistics for 1977-82 are given in
Annexes 9 and 10.
4.02      The low sales volume during project implementation reflects WSC's
inability to reduce unaccounted-for water from 48% in 1976 to the appraisal
target of 151 in 1983.  Despite numerous efforts, including leak detection
and repair, the achievement of full metering and substantial siystem reha-
bilitation, WSC has only been able to cut unaccounted-for water to 441.
The reasons for the continuing high levels of unaccounted-for water remain
unclear, and further investigation of and investment in the distribution
system are required.
4.03      The size of WSC's staff was reduced modestly to 337 employees by
the  end  of  1982.   Nevertheless,  the current  number  of employees  per
thousand connections (13.7) is comparatively high.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01      A comparison of financial results estimated at appraisal with ac-
tual results for 1977-1982 is presented in Annex 11. A comparative summary
of WSC's cumulative income and expenses and flow of funds during that pe-
riod is provided below (in US$ million):

Actual revenues were much lower than projected at appraisal because of the
shortfalls in production and higher-than-expected unaccounted-for water.
The production shortfalls and shutdown of the Blue Hills desalination plant
in 1977 also caused actual operating costs to be lower than those pro-
jected. Delays in project implementation, changes in project scope and the
unanticipated write-off of certain fixed assets caused depreciation expen-
ses to be lower than forecasted at appraisal.    The net result of these
changes was that instead of generating an operating surplus of US$8.3 mil-
lion during 1977-82, as anticipated at appraisal, WSC posted a cumulative
loss of US$6.3 million.  In addition, financing needs were US$10.4 million



- 7 -
higher than expected.  The Government provided the necessary funds through
a combination of equity contributions and grants.   As a result of these
factors, WSC's compliance with the rate of return covenant was poor:
Rate of Return (%)
1977    1978    1979    1980    1981    1982
Covenanted                 0.0      1.0     2.0      3.0     4.0      4.0

5.02      During project execution water tariffs were raised twice (October
1977 and September 1982) and sewerage tariffs, one- (October 1979).   Im-
plementation of the second water increase was delayed by Government for 10
months until after a new government had been elected and had taken office.
Nevertheless, revenues per thousand Ig during project construction remained
above those assumed for the financial projections prepared at appraisal
(Annex 11).  In 1982, the average tariff of US$2.43,/m3 was one of, if not,
the highest in the region.
5.03        Despite notable progress, WSC did not comply with the covenant
which reqi.ired it to reduce receivables to a level of 4.0 months of bil-
lings by year-end 1976 and maintain that level thereafter. Outstanding ac-
counts receivable were 12.5 months of billings by December 31, 1977.  This
level dropped to 4.5 months of billings by September 30, 1981, but rose to
5.5 months of billings as of Decem,ber 31, 1982, mainly because of a sharp
increase in delinquent Government accounts.
VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
6.01        WSC's initial organizational problems were overcome in mid-1978
when WSC was given sufficient authority to operate as a fully autonomous
corporation.   WSC has since evolved into a stable, well-run organization.
The current organizational structure (Annex 1, page 2) is considered satis-
factory. WSC's salary scale now allows it to attract and retain qualified
staff at all levels.  Its management team is experienced and competent, but
a shortage of qualified Bahamian candidates for key positions remains a
problem.  Except for the General Manager and one senior engineer, all upper
management and technical positions are filled by expatriates.
6.02      WSC was not able to establish a training unit until June 1978 be-
cause of initial problems in recruiting suitable Bahamians to fill training
vacancies.   Shortly thereafter, a Bank training specialist found that the
proposed program was overly elaborate and recommended modifications. These
changes and others based on technical assistance provided by the UNDP and
the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation were incorporated into the



- 8 -
training program.  In late 1982, WSC's training program suffered a serious
setback when a fire destroyed the training center and teaching materials.
WSC plans to rebuild the center after it secures the necessary funding.
VII.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01       The internal financial rate of return (IFR) was used as a proxy
for the economic rate of return at appraisal.   Without the project, water
production on New Providence Island would have declined substantially.
With the water produced by the project valued at 1975 prices, the IFR cal-
culated at appraisal was 12%.  Based on the tariff increase agreed upon
during negotiations, the IFR was expected to be about 18%.
7.02      The ex-post calculation of the rate of return was based on incre-
mental sales, revenues and costs (Ann-. 12).  This resulted in a recalcu-
lated IFR of 8%.  The lower IFR is explained mainly by lower incremental
sales   volume,   caused   by  project   delays,  and  higher-than-expected
unaccounted-for water.
7.03       Several project benefits that could not be quantified reliably
(improvements  in  public  health  and  the  environment,  enhanced  property
values, etc.) were excluded from the IFR calculations at appraisal and at
completion.
VIII. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
8.01      In retrospect, the original 28-month implementation schedule was
overly optimistic, as demonstrated by the 3-1/2 year delay in completion.
The recentness of WSC's organization and its staffing problems, with which
the Bank was thoroughly familiar, should have dictated a longer executLon
period. Moreover, the complexity of the project was underestimated, mainly
because of the lack of up-to-date technical information.   The most recent
of the available feasibility studies was prepared five years prior to ap-
praisal and there were no final designs.  Updating the studies and prepar-
ing the designs took 12-18 months to complete.
8.02        The dlsparity between the operating results forecasted at ap-
praisal and those achieved resulted in part from unrealistic Bank assump-
tions on the degree to which unaccounted-for water could be reduced and the
speed with which the project could be implemented.  In addition, the demand
forecasts prepared at appraisal were particularly uncertain because of the
difficulty of determining unrestricted demand without rationing and inter-
mittent supplies, and lack of information on the effects of significant ta-
riff increases on consumption and the extent to which the increases would
influence the use of private water sources.



- 9 -
8.03      The Bank's relationship with the Borro;wer was good throughout the
execution period.  In particular, the Borrower notes in its evaluation of
the project (Annex 13) its appreciation for the Bank's role in defining
changes in project Lontent.  Another particularly valuable contribution was
that of the Bank's training advisor in adapting the ambitious original pro-
gram to WSC's needs.   The Bank's influence was also a key factor in the
original establishment of WSC and the later delegation of auithority which
allowed WSC to become fully autonomous.   In later stages, the Bank played
an influential role in ensuring that counterpart funds would be provided,
that tariffs would be increased and that WSC would remain adequately staf-
fed.
IX.  COVCLUSIONS
9.01       The project was successful in relieving the chronic water supply
shortage on New Providence Island, but it did not accomplish this goal un-
til mid-1982, 3-1/2 years past the target date set at appraisal.  The de-
lays arose mainly because the Bank overestimated WSC's initial implement-
ation capacity and underestimated the time required to execute the proj-
ect.  The other major accomplishments of the project were the successful
transformation of WSC into a stable, well-managed autonomous organization
and the improvement of sewerage services in Nassau's nost important commer-
cial district.
9.02       The Borrower considers the shipping component to be one of the
weakest links in the project (Annex 13).  It appears that the vessels se-
lected were ill-adapted to the task of transporting water from Andros Is-
land to New Providence Island and that costs were underestimated. There is
still some question as to the optimum type and size of vessel.                      1/
9-03        WSC's financial performance during project implementation was
poor primarily because of inadequate production capacity due to project de-
lays and a failure to significantly lower unaccounted-for water.   Heavy
debt service payments, particularly for interest on commercial banks loans,
also had an adverse effect on WSC's financial condition.   Nevertheless,
with higher tariffs now in place and wvater production capacity continuing
to increase, WSC's financial performance should improve.
1/ WSC notes in its comments (Annex 14) that the 15,000 DWT tanker recom-
mended at appraisal would have been too large to maneuver safely irn
Nassau Harbour and the Morgan's Bluff Channel.  Subsequent studies re-
commended much smaller (6,000-8,000 DWT), specialized tankers.

Dear Mr. Costa,
LOAN 1320 EM - REVIEW OF OBJECTIVES
OF WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
General
The Water and Sewerage Corporation has found the success achieved
since 1975 in the implementation of the Water Supply and Sewerage
Project to be noteworthy indeed. When the Project was formulated
water service in many parts of New Providence was intermittent and
the 50-year old Bay Street sewerage system was presenting major
maintenance problems but now there is 24-hour water supply in
Uew Providence and the Say Street sewerage system has been
rehabilitated. The comments that follow will provide a qualitative
appreciation of the situation that engendered the success.
Institution Building
The Corporation was established on July 14, 1976 by an Act Parliaznent
and soon thereafter functional and staff Departments such as
Operation and Maintenance, Marine Operations, Engineering and Planning,
Accounting and Finance, Personnel, and Internal Audit were organized.
The Bank is already familiar with the Corporation's Organization
Chart. The incorporatinq Act scheduled most ordinary waterworks
plant and material as duty free but marine items were not mentioned
at all. This situation had made it necessary for the Corporation
to pay customs duty on all marine hardware and so far Management
has not been successful in getting the Act amendod. The transition
from a ministerial department to a statutory corporation has been
successful principally because the Chairman of the Board of

Mr. Rene Costa
The World Bank
Directors, sOme of the Directors and other key management personnel
have had experience in the management of statutory corporations.
The Bank also urged an autonomous organization.
Conservation Programme
Surveys have Leen carried out and there is no evidence that illegal
connections are a material contributing factor to the unaccounted-
for water problem. A system to facilitate the routine replacement
of malfunctioning meters is now in place and operating successfully.
Because the benefits of a one-time-effort in leak detection have
proven to be very ephemeral the Corporation has established a
Leakage Control Section and has introduced systematic leakage
detection.  In addition to the purchase of leakage detection
equipment and meters an inventory of pipe has been procured to
replace water mains which are in poor condition. Also items of
heavy plant have been purchased to carry out the necessary
excavation to lay the new water mains. In spite of the enlargement
of the conservation element of the Project the reduction in
unaccountea-for water has been disappointing and somewhat elusive.
Nevertheless, the Corporation is more aware now of what is necessary
to tackle this problem than at the start of the project. The Bank
has not been able to offer milch assistance naming cities
which had an unaccounted-for water problem and solved it. In any
case 15% unaccounted-for water is unrealistic.
Interim and Expanded Importation Programme
The items of shoreside work have been completed very much in accordance
with the Appraisal Report except that there is no need as yet to
expand North Andros Wellfield output from 3 mgd to 6 mgd.  The concept
of the shipping needs were very far from what has transpired.
Experience has shown that there is a limit to the size of the vessels
that only require 14 feet of water fully laden. The run between
Morgan's Bluff and Arawak Cay is such that a system of one tug and
several barges is not practicable nor does it appear to be easy to
graduate from a tug/'barge system to a self-propelled tanker-system
over-night" because of the dire shortage of trained marine
personnel in the country. The use of 15,000 dwt tankers is not a
practical proposition because neither the dock at Morgan's Bluff nor
the dock at Arawak Cay can accommodate suich vessels. Furthermore
the cost of the necessary dredginq at Morgan's Bluff will make it
prohibitively expensive. The Bank's appraisal of the shipping
element was poorly developed or even misleading thereby making the
shippirig element one of the weakest links in the whole Project and
severely under provided-for financially.

Distribution Improvement, Peak Load and Emergency Storage
The computer analysis of the distribution network has clearly indicated
where trunk mains and associated reservoirs will be required in the
future up to 1991 but the revelation of additional water resources in
New Providence has eliminated the need for the 30 mg emergency
storage especially because the New Providence aquifers act as a kind
of storage. The Bank contributed significantly to the technical
discussion that resulted in this decision.
Sanitary Sewer Rehabilitation
At the preliminary engineering stage the consultants concluded that
only the trunk sewers on Bay Street and five pumping stations could
be rebuilt with the budgeted sum. Of course it is well known that
the consulting engineers also underestimated the cost of this
element of the Project.   The trunk sewers on Dowdeswell and Shirley
Streets together with the laterals remain in poor condition.
Prince George Wharf Interceptor
Because certain international regulations plus the U. S. Coast Guard
rules made it compulsory for vessels to be equipped sewage treatment
facilities and holding tanks, this element was eliminated.
Wellfield Automation
This element has been completed and the anticipated benefits of
reduced staffing costs realized fully.
Blue Hills Desalination Plant
This plant has been abandoned because of serious doubts about benefits
that may accrue from any rehabilitation effort.
Staff Training
A training centre was established with the help of a World Bank
%raininq Officer and U.N.D.P. Expert but a serious setback occurred
s!en the building was gutted by fire in November 1982. It is planned
t) re-establish the Centre.. Also consideration is being given to the
1;,".'ration of an extension plan to encourage more Bahamians to
D- . ! civil engineering.

The World Bank
Resting of Wellfields
Abstraction at all wellfields is now at a rate within the design
yield on a field by field basis. After the execution of
rehabilitation works salinities are dropping and water quality
improving.
General Conclusions
Claarlv, the time frame set by the Bank for completion was unrealistic.
A principal reaaon for tha delay was that preliminary and detailed
designs by consulting engineers tvck between 12 months and 18 months,
much longer than the Bank's projected 2 mont'Lh  to 3 months.  Actually
the selection of consulting engineers took up to 4 months at times
after receipt of proposals.
The dredging at Morgan's Bluff was the only element that suffered
delay at the construction stage; the reason for this was that a
sub-contractor left the site after realizing that he was not properly
equipped for the task.
Changes to the Project were made only after much deliberation and
consultation with the Bank with the end result being a more effective
Project. The Bank's mission personnel have been particularly helpful
here.
Both Appraisal Report and the consulting engineers for the respective
projects have underestimated construction costs, excluding material
procurement. Fortunately it was possible to contain the cost
overrun situation by eliminating some elements of the project and
postponing others.
The $6 million loan from the consortium of six commercial banks, the
World Bank Loan and the Caribbean Bank Loan should not have been
"committed" before detailed engineering for the various elements of
the Project had been completed. In future there should be a "technical
assistance loan" to achieve this objective. The section of the Loan
Agreement dealing with rate of return has been very helpful in setting
financial goals for the Corporation and it may be useful to develop
this concept further.

Dear Mr. Kapur,
Project Completion Report on Water Supply and Sewerage
Project for New Providence (Loan 1320-BM)
The Corporation re-affirms that most of the objectives of the
Project have been achieved but the following components require
additional investment and/or investigation:
(a) Shipping - to increase reliability;
(b)  distribution system - to determine the
reason for continuing high levels of
unaccounted-for water; and
(c) private wells - to assess the long-term
impact on the financial strength of the
Corporation.
It is also necessary to comment specifically on certain paragraphs
as indicated'
3.05 It is much more accurate to say that some delay
was incurred during the initial period when the
Corporation was organizing its various functional
departments. Decisions on major contracts and the
appointment of senior staff are still subject to
Board approval. Most of the delays were due to
writing terms of reference for consultants and
their updating of studies and designs. See paragraph
8.01 of the Project Completion Report.

Mr. Shiv S. Kapur
3.08 The Corporation counter sued for special damages
including delay in completing the contracted Work, cost of
additional constructional plant,damage to vessels, and
other expenses.
5.02 Water Tariffs were raised twice during project
execution (October, 1977 and September, 1982) and
sewerage tariffs once in October, 1979.
6.01 The successful handling of the Corporatiofls.
initial organizational problems would have resulted
from Board decisions as the Government has not made
any subsidiary legislation (bylaws) which has impacted
the autonomy of the Corporation.
9.02 The fifteen thousand (15,000) DWT tankers suggested
in the Project Appraisal Document would hav's been too
large to safely manouver in the Nassau Harbour turning
basin and the Morgan's Bluff Channel. Subsequent studies
recommended 6000 or 8000 DWT tankers which would be
purpose built.
There is no doubt that once the problems in shipping have been
solved and unaccounted-for water reduced the Corporation will not
only be classed as being well-run but it will also be very strong
financially.
We do trust that the above comments prove to be useful.
Yours faithfully,
WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
