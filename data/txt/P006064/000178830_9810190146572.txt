THE BAHAMAS
APPRAISAL OF
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT OF NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
THE WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a US$32.00 million equivalent
project (US$37.0 including interest during construction) to improve the
water supply and sanitary sewerage services for the Island of New Providence.
This island includes the city of Nassau, which has over 60% of the total
population of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. Tourism generates upwards of
70% of the country's GNP, and since the existing water supply facilities are
insufficient to meet present demand, and are in danger of partial collapse, a
project is essential to the country's economy. A Bank loan of US$10 million
covering 31.3% of the estimated cost of the project is proposed.
ii.       The City of Nassau is the seat of the Commonwealth Government, and is
the Bahamas' principal tourist center, attra-cting ove-r amillion visitors per
year.  In addition, it is the main commercial market for the cotm-rv, and is an
important base for international banking and-investment institutions. -The
annual population growth rate for New Providence is approximatelv thr> percent
or one and a half times that for the country as a whole.
iii.      The net water demand on New Providence Island is estimated to be
5.5 mgd. At a loss of 20% of demand, a production capacity of 6.9 mgd would
be required to satisfy this present demand. Excessive water losses of 48% of
an existing production capacity of 5.2 mgd reduce the amount of water avail-
able to consumers to 2.7 mgd, or about 52% of actual estimated demand.
iv.       The project, whose primary goal is to increase the supply of water
for consumption, consists of an additional supply of up to 6.0 million gallons
per day (mgd) from wellfields to be developed on Andros Island and transported
by tankers to New Providence Island (see Charts 1, 2, 3). The project also
supports a water conservation program designed to reduce leakage and improve
distribution, as well as the rehabilitation of a sewerage system built in
1928, plus an interceptor for ship sewage which is presently polluting the
harbor (see Chart 4). The project envisages institution building and strength-
ening by converting the present ministerial department to a statutory corpora-
tion which would achieve financial viability, and would implement its own
staff up-grading and training program. Construction, engineering and adminis-
tration are estimated to cost US$31.6 million, and a training component is
estimated to cost US$0.40 million. The Bank loan would cover 31.3% (US$10
million); the balance would be financed through other external loans of 28.8%
(US$9.2 million), as well as a Government grant of 13.8% (US$4.4 million), a
Government loan of 20.6% (US$6.6 million), and a net internal cash generation
of 5.5% (US$1.80 million).



- ii -
v.        All materials and equipment to be financed out of the proceeds of
the loan, would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Contracts for civil works less than
US$500,000 may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding satis-
factory to the Bank. Consultant's services would be engaged in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines for such services. It is estimated that the
foreign component amounts to 67% of the total project cost.
vi.       The Borrower is the Water and Sewerage Corporation, an organization
created by a parliamentary act dated June 1976, and will be guaranteed by
the Bahamian Government. This authority will be formed from the present
Department of Water and Sewerage (DWS) in the Ministry of Works and Utilities.
vii.      The project alternative selected is the least-cost solution that
can avoid the economic and environmental damage likely to result from further
delays in augmenting the water supply. The project will meet the projected
requirements until 1983, and can easily be expanded if necessary.
viii.     Given the agreements reached during negotiations listed in Chapter
7, the project is suitable for a Bank loan for US$10 million equivalent, for a
term of 20 years, including a three-year grace period.



THE BAHAMAS
APPRAISAL OF
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT OF NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
THE WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
1.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of The Commonwealth of the Bahamas has requested a
Bank loan to help finance a program of water supply and sewerage rehabilita-
tion for New Providence Island, where the city of Nassau is located. This
would be the first project in the Bahamas to be financed by the Bank. The
Borrower would be The Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC), a statutory corpo-
ration supplying water and sewerage facilities to New Providence Island.
The US$10 million proposed loan, which represents 31.3% of the estimated pro-
ject cost of US$32.00 million, would cover 38% of the imported goods and
services and 20% of the civil works component, would be for 20 years including
3 years of grace, and would be guaranteed by the Commonwealth of The Bahamas.
1.02      The Bahamian Government has agreed to provide approximately 34% of
the total project cost through a combination of direct grants and loans to the
new corporation, plus a corporation contribution generated by higher tariffs
implemented during construction. The Government has requested the Bank's
assistance in developing outside co-financing.
1.03      The project would permit WSC to insure an adequate supply of potable
water for the inhabitants of Nassau, and the more than one million tourists
who annually visit New Providence Island. The project is essential to main-
tain the island's and the country's primary source of income--tourism--and
will raise the volume of water available to the resident population from 15
gallons per day to 40 gallons per resident per day. The sewerage portion of
the project will eliminate existing environmental problems resulting from
present harbor pollution, and will avoid potential serious problems in view
of the possible breakdown of the existing sewerage system which runs through
the heart of the city of Nassau.
1.04      In December 1974, a preappraisal mission visited Nassau to assist
the Government in project identification, and the Bank's consultant prepared
an integrated environmental program. Additional missions visited Nassau to
evaluate the progress of project preparation, and to work with the various
ministries concerned regarding the initiation of the institutional aspects
of the Project. A mission composed of Bank staff members J. Freedman,
M. Mason, R. Saunders, M. Southall, and C. Todd, as well as M. Lieberman,
consultant, and C. Oliveira of ILO, appraised the project in June 1975.
1.05      Following the review by the mission, project components were de-
fined, construction programs established, and cost estimates developed by DWS
and reviewed by the mission and its consultants. This report is based upon
this information, and the findings and studies of the mission.

2.   THE SECTOR
2.01      The public sanitation sector for The Bahamas is divided between
the Ministry of Works and Utilities (MOWU), who administers the islands'
water supply and sewerage services, and the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH),
who administers solid waste disposal, and in addition, is in charge of all
facets of public health. It is important to recognize the direct working
relationship between the two ministries while at the same time, restricting
further discussion to the role of- the MOWIJ, with whom the project has been
developed.
2.02      The MOWUI presently manages the water supply and sewerage services
for the islands through the existing Water and Sewerage Department of the
Ministry. This department operates 45 water systems on 13 islands, the
major system being for New Providence Island where the city of Nassau is
located. The rest are rural type systems. The Water and Sewerage Department
operates sewer systems only for N'assau. The other two principal cities
of Freeport and Eleuthera have privately operated sewer systems.
2.03      The principal water system, New Providence, serves approximately
90% of the 120,000 resident population of Nassau through 22,000 connections,
and some 200 standpipes serving the slum areas identified as "over-the-hill".
It also supplies water to the hotels, government offices, and business section
of the island. In the Nassau area there are two conventional gravity sanitary
sewerage systems which basically cover the major hotels and the downtown com-
mercial and residential areas. Four additional vacuum systems serve very
limited housing project areas. These sewer systems serve approximately 10%
of the populace of New Providence.
2.04      The major problems encountered in the Water sector, and particularly
on New Providence Island, have been that capacity has not been able to keep
up with demand created by the unusually high hotel construction and expansion
during the late 60's as well as the influx of rural (Family Island) migration
to New Providence. The production shortfall gradually widened, was resolved
through rationing, and is now at a critical stage where it is affecting
tourism--the mainstay of the economy.
3.   THE PROJECT
Existing Facilities
Water Supply
3.01      The present water supply is derived from groundwater sources, and
the output of a flash distillation plant. The wellfields have been producing
(1973-75) an average of 4.20 mgd, but only by pumping beyond the safe yield,
and now have sharply rising salinity. The desalination plant started



operation in August 1972, but has never reached its optimum production (annual
basis) of 90% of the rated daily capacity of 2.0 mgd. In 1974, due to corro-
sion and other problems that caused lengthy shutdowns, only 60% of rated
capacity was produced for a daily average of 1.2 mgd. Total water production
in 1975 averaged 5.26 mgd.
3.02      The present estimated unrestricted net water demand is 5.5 mgd.
The large shortfall in supply results in low system pressures and inter-
mittent service. Actual demand, however, is obscured by the fact that 48%
of the water delivered to the system is unaccounted-for.
Sewerage
3.03      The principal sanitary sewerage system was built in 1928 to serve
the portion of Nassau north of Nassau Ridge which includes the main commercial
and government centers of the city. The system is composed of approximately
3 1/2 miles of 22" to 12" trunk lines in Bay and Shirley Streets, laterals in
streets running north from the ridge, 6 pumping stations and a deep injection
well at Malcolm's Park for disposal. The total population served by the ex-
isting system is approximately 10% of the city of Nassau, and the Bay and
Shirley Street trunk lines are in imminent danger of total collapse. In addi-
tion, there are four self-contained vacuum sewer systems in operation in
fairly high income areas.
The Project
3.04      The basic objectives of the project are:
(i) To increase the water supply of New Providence to insure
maintenance of tourism, and to meet the needs of the resi-
dent population through 1983;
(ii) To rehabilitate the existing sanitary sewer system in old
Nassau; and,
(iii) To construct a new sewer line to Prince Georges' Wharf to
intercept the sewage from cruise ships that is presently
polluting Nassau Harbor and nearby beaches.
3.05      Details of the principal elements of the project are contained in
Annex 1, and are summarized below:
Water Supply
(i) A program aimed at reducing unaccounted-for water fron the
present 48% to an acceptable 15%. The program will con-
sist essentially of three activities: (1) the detection
and repair of distribution system leaks, (2) replacement



-4-
of malfunctioning meters, and (3) the location and elimi-
nation of illegal or unmetered connections.
(ii) Hydrogeological investigations of Andros Isiand have demon-
strated groundwater reserves capable of producing in excess
of 60 mgd (see Map 11841). An interim plan to import up to
3.0 mgd of water from Andros Island using a combination of
tug/ barges in 1977 and tankers thereafter, all to be
acquired by purchase. This plan will require the development
of a 6,000 acre wellfield on Andros and the installation of
storage, loading and unloading facilities on Andros and New
Providence. Since existing harbors at Morgan's Bluff on
Andros and Arawak Cay on New Providence can be used without
major modification and a pipeline from Arawak Cay to Blue
Hills can be easily built to conduct the water, the interim
plan could provide relief for the New Providence water sup-
ply within twelve months after the start of work. This
plan is underway, and is expected to be completed by
December 31, 1976. The Government has obtained agreement
from the present owners of Morgan's Bluff dock and shore
facilities (BAIL), providing for access to and utilization
of the dock and shore facilities on a priority basis by
WSC.
(iii) An expanded Andros water importation program to provide an
additional 2.0 to 4.0 million gallons per day. This will
require 6,000 more acres of wellfields on Andros, dredging
Morgan's Bluff Harbor tc 27 feet below mean low water from
the present 14 feet, the purchase of three used 15,000 DWT
tankers, and all necessary shore facilities including
storage, pumps, workshops and staff quarters.
(iv) Temporary closure and rehabilitation of the existing flash
distillation plant at Blue Hills during 1978.
(v) The construction of in-ground storage reservoirs on New
Providence with capacity of approximately 30 million
gallons. This would help to meet seasonal peak loads and
emergencies.
(vi) Automation of the Government weilfields on New Providence
Island to improve operations.
Sanitary Sewerage
(i) Reconstruction of the deteriorated portions of the sewer
lines in Bay and Shirley Streets and connecting laterals.
(ii) Replacement of structure, pumps and controls of all obsolete
and structurally unsound pumping stations of the system.



(iii) Construction of a 12-inch line from the rebuilt Bay Street
trunk sewer to Prince Georges' Wharf and the necessary
collecting pumps and pumping equipment to receive sewage
discharges from cruise ships.
Engineering
(i)  Leak detection and measurement survey of the entire water
distribution network.
(ii) Distribution network analysis to ascertain piping and
operating modifications, and storage requirement study.
(iii)  Wellfield design and construction supervision.
(iv) Design and construction supervision of transmission lines,
pumping equipment and other shore facilities on Andros and
New Providence needed for the transportation of water
between the islands.
(v)  Ship survey, dock and harbor improvements.
(vi) Design and construction supervision of the sanitary
sewerage component.
Training
(i) Establish a training unit within WSC, which will implement
a training program as outlined in Annex 12 or similar thereto
(see para. 5.04).
Sources of Supply
3.06      Existing and future sources of water in mgd are as follows:
1975    1978    1979    1983
Government wells on Providence Island        2.5     0.5      1.0     1.0
Private wells on Providence Island           1.5     0.5      1.0     0.0
Blue Hills Desalination Plant                1.2     0.8      1.6     1.6
Reverse Osmosis Plant                         -      0.4      0.4     0.4
Import from Andros Island                     -      5.1      4.1      6.1
Total Supply                                 5.2     7.9      8.1     9.1



6-
3.07      During the first full year's expanded operation of the import
scheme the New Providence Island wellfields will be rested to replenish
groundwater reserves and the desalination plant will be overhauled, re-
quiring the transport of 5.7 mgd from Andros Island. Thereafter, the New
Providence wellfields will be operated at 1.0 mgd and the desalination
plant at 1.6 mgd, requiring the import of 4.1 mgd in 1979 and 6.1 mgd in
1983.
3.08      In any water supply scheme, not only the adequacy, but also the
reliabllity of the supply must be considered. This Is especially true where
water is imported from another island, as in this case. The danger exists
that adverse weather conditions might prevent ships from plying the strait
between Andros and New Providence Island, or that an accident might put a
ship out of commission for a period of time. Records of the US Marine
Research Station on Andros Island show that Morgan's Bluff harbor was not
accessible for a maximum of up to five consecutive days on a few occasions.
During normal years, four to five storms close the harbor for up to four days
at a time. During the worst of the past ten years, the harbor was Inaccessi-
ble for four days on eight different occasions.  Statistics are similar for
Arawak Cay harbor (generally the same storms'affect both harbors, although
some storms affect one harbor more than the other). It is estimated that
during 35 days, the harbor could not be used (but never more than 5 days in
a row) and that ships would be out of service for 30 days a year for mainte-
nance and repair.
3.09      To avoid interruptions in water service, the project includes the
following components:
(i) reservoirs of 30 mgd capacity; and
(ii) three tankers, two in regular service, one for standby
(to be used at times of maintenance of other tankers and
to replenish storage after transport interruption).
3.10      In addition, the existing wellfield production capacity of 3.0 mgd
will be maintained so that during emergencies 3.0 mgd could be abstracted.
Because the periods of time during which water would be pumped at this high
rate would be few and short (4 to 8 times a year for up to 5 days), the well-
field could sustain such high pumping rates without damage. The following
table shows water supply capacity and number of days normal service could be
maintained under two conditions:
A    -    Without transport of water from Andros during adverse
sea conditions with (A-1) and without (A-2) desalina-
tion plant in operation; or
B    -    With two of three ships out of commission due to acci-
dent or maintenance, with (B-1) and without (B-2) de-
salination plant in operation.

3.11      The table shows that under the worst situation, i.e. no transport
and the desalination plant out of service, regular demand could be met for
six days at projected 1983 consumption. In the unlikely event that both the
desalination plant and the transport from Andros would be interrupted, water
consumption could be reduced by lowering pressure in the distribution system
and other means to prolong the period of supply although, as explained earlier,
historical evidence shows that the maximum number of continuous days of trans-
port interruption would not exceed five days. Nevertheless, the construction
of additional storage facilities early in the 1980's will be necessary to
keep pace with increasing water consumption.
3.12       In addition, the government should follow through on its earlier
proposal to issue tender documents for the construction of a sea water con-
version plant utilizing the distillation, reverse osmosis, electro-dialysis,
or other guaranteed process. The Bank would not object to any program the
Government could arrange whereby the plant were to be built, owned, and ope-
rated by the manufacturer, and the water produced purchased by the WSA at a
price equal to the average cost of water in the project. This would not
affect the project since the construction would not be completed within
the project period, and would not reduce the Andros wellfield requirements.

Additional Studies
3.13      The studies listed are not essential to, nor were considered a
part of the project, but are of great interest to the Bahamas for future
potential water source development as well as for protection of the envi-
ronment.

3.15      The costs are based upon price quotations and information from
suppliers and consultants for cost of ships, pipes, pumps, docks, etc. The
cost of the leak detection survey was taken from the completed contract.
Other cost elements were derived from present known construction costs
maintained by the Water and Sewerage Department personnel of on-going works.
Physical contigencies used were 15% for the sewerage portions of the project,
10% for the water portion of the project, and 5% on engineering, ships, and
dock facilities. Price contingencies were calculated on the foreign component
in accordance with current Bank guidelines, and 10% per annum was applied to
local costs which is based upon current price level increase in the Bahamas.
Amount of Proposed Loan
3.16      A loan of US$10.0 million equal to 31.3% of the total project cost
of US$32.0 million is proposed as a part of the total financing required.
Procurement
3.17      All pipe, pumps, meters, meter boxes, electrical equipment, chlori-
nators, and all accessory equipment and supplies to be financed out of the
proceeds of the loan will be procured through international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Contracts for civil works not ex-
ceeding $500,000 for each contract and of a type for which there are at least
three competent Bahamian contractors may be awarded on the basis of competi-
tive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with local procurement pro-
cedures that are satisfactory to the Bank; contracts exceeding US$500,000 will
use international competitive bidding. Submission of bids by international
contractors on contracts advertised locally shall not be precluded. All con-
tracts are reviewed, and approved, by the Government's Tender Board, and, if
the value exceeds B$250,000, approval rests with the Cabinet. In the evalua-
tion of bids the local manufacturers will be accorded the usual margin of
preference (15% of the cif price or the level of tariffs, whichever is lower).
Consultants would be engaged in accordance with Bank guidelines.
Disbursement
3.18      The Bank would disburse the loan against (i) 100% of the foreign
costs of the imports for the pumping stations, pipelines, and storage faci-
lities to be built on New Providence Island, and the equipment to be installed
for leak repairs, metering, and the automation of the existing wellfields
on New Providence Island; (ii) 100% of the foreign costs for the project
manager and the services of the consultants; (iii) 20% of the costs of the
civil works in the project; and (iv) 100% of the foreign cost component of
the training program. Any surplus of funds remaining in the loan account,
on completion of the project, would be utilized for priority items closely
related to the project, subject to the approval of the Bank. Due to the
urgency of the interim program, retroactive financing for consultants, equip-
ment and works may be required, but should not exceed US$1 million. The
Government has provided evidence of agreement in principle by all other proj-
ect lenders. An estimated schedule of disbursement is attached in Annex 3.



- 10 -
Supervision
3.19      The construction period for the project should be completed within
two years from the signing of engineering and consultants contracts. The
construction schedule is included in Annex 14. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that WSC will employ experienced consultants, on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank for the design and construction
supervision of the project elements to ensure their timely completion. The
total estimated cost of consulting service is US$1.03 million. Approximately
200 man months would be required at an estimated average cost of US$5,000 per
man month.
Monitoring Indices
3.20      Annex 13 contains full details of those factors required for proper
monitoring of the project and WSC operations. The principal factors are:
(i)  Quarterly verification of unaccounted-for water to bring it
to, and maintain it at, a reasonable level.
(ii)  Quarterly verification that the operating ratio does not ex-
ceed that specified in Annex 8, and with the ultimate goal of
reducing it to 70%.
(iii) Constant surveillance of meter installation and repair pro-
grams to insure that the maximum possible quantity of water
produced is sold.
(iv) A continued vigilance of receivables to avoid future cash
shortages during and following project completion.
4. JUSTIFICATION
4.01      Primary economic justification for the water project component rests
on the need to meet the demand for water of the resident population and the
tourist industry. Water supply to all customers, including the hotels, is
presently restricted, and the quality of water is deteriorating owing to
increasing salinity of the groundwater. The supply of water will gradually
diminish if no project is undertaken. The main justification for the sewerage
component is the actual critical condition of the main trunk sewers, as well
as protection of the city's adjoining beaches.
4.02      The water demand projection has taken into account that actual
demand is restricted because of present rationing and that predictions of
tourist traffic, and the effect on water consumption of higher prices, is
very uncertain. The incremental financial rate of return of the water project
with the water sold valued at the current average water tariff of B$2.97/1000
gallons is 11.9%. The actual tariff is therefore considered to cover the long
run marginal cost of water supply expansion. With the proposed tariffs, the
project has an incremental rate of return of about 18%.



- 11 -
4.03      Certain parts of the sewerage investment will be unrelated to the
volume of water consumed and disposed of and should therefore not enter into
the economic pricing decisions. The cost of these elements have not been
included when calculating the marginal cost of water supply and sewerage which
amounts to B$3.30/1000 gallons (at 12% discount rate). The average water
tariff of B$2.97/1000 gallons (the sewerage tariff is nominal) could therefore
be said to cover approximately the long run marginal cost of water supply and
sewerage disposal. In spite of this, current tariffs will not generate suffi-
cient revenue to cover the financial costs of WSA. Agreement was reached with
the Government that this deficit will be covered by tariff increases, the
first of which will become effective July 13, 1976.
4.04      As is usual in water supply and sewerage projects, important bene-
fits to public health and the environment are not reflected in the rate of
return and constitute an additional but non-quantifiable justification for the
project.
4.05      For additional details regarding this subject, your attention is
invited to Annex 5.
5. BORROWER
5.01      The Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC), a statutory corporation,
will be the borrower of the proposed loan, with a guarantee by the Govern-
ment of the Bahamas. The Corporation has taken over the functions of the
existing Water and Sewerage Department of the Ministry of Works and Utilities,
being responsible for, and having autonomy over, revenues and operational
matters on New Providence Island. All present Ministry water functions,
related to the Family Islands, will be handled by the new Corporation on a
cost recovery basis. The tariff structure averages 50% of that of New
Providence Island. The Government will continue to grant fund WSC for Family
Island operating losses.
5.02      The Corporation is a wholly-owned entity of the Governnent.  It will
be governed by a Board of Directors, consisting of the Ministry of Works and
Utilities (Chairman), one Director who will be a representative of the
Ministry of Finance, and four other Directors, appointed by the Minister of
Works and Utilities. The principal operating officers will be the General
Manager, Chief Engineer and Chief Controller. A detailed organization for
the Corporation is in Chart 15095R. The legislation for establishing the
Corporation has been enacted, and a General Manager, acceptable to the Bank,
a Chief Engineer, a Project Manager and Chief Controller have been designated.
Management
5.03      The present Water and Sewerage Department is badly understaffed at
the management and technical levels, and to some degree over-staffed at the



-- 12 -
operating levels. The principal cause of the former dilemma is a salary
structure within the Government framework, which was not competitive with
outside structures. Though this was partially corrected in July 1975 by
upgrading technical (engineering) salaries, true adequacy will be determined
by recruitment. Of the 11 top positions in the attached organization chart,
3 are currently filled.  The Government has sent to the Bank an adequate
organization chart, and a budget for Calendar Year 1976 reflecting financial
provision for salaries at a level to attract and retain qualified staff.
Training
5.04      Eventually the operation of the water utility should be in the
hands of Bahamian nationals at all levels. At present only non-professional
positions of superintendent to laborer are occupied by Bahamians. The pro-
vision of professional training and the actual experience for future managers
and engineers is a long-range program that will require foresight and finan-
cial support. Suitable candidates for management and engineering positions
will have to be selected for in-service training and university training
abroad. The planning and implementation of such a program should start as
soon as the Corporation is operational. Training for subprofessional posi-
tions should be a matter of continuing interest and support by the Authority.
It would be accomplished with the cooperation of the local trade schools and
consultants. See Annex 12 for details. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that within one year of loan signature, WSC will establish a
training unit, and thereafter, promptly implement a training program satis-
factory to the Bank.
Billing, Accounting and Financial Operations
5.05      Though the present billing system is computerized, it does not pro-
vide for statistical analysis of that billing into customer category and hence
does not provide volume usage within category. These provisions were being
implemented during the appraisal mission, and are expected to begin function-
ing in the final quarter of 1976. Aging of accounts receivable is available,
but due to lack of direction, collection efforts on overdue accounts was de-
ficient. It was agreed that WSC will have taken whatever action is necessary
to recover the outstanding payments due to it and that, with effect from such
date, it will take appropriate action to hold accounts receivable to 4 months
billing equivalent.
5.06      All accounting of revenues, costs, and capital expenditures is at
present handled for the division by the Ministry of Works and Utilities. It
is government style, cash-basis accounting, and the new Corporation will need
assistance from an external accounting group for implementation of an adequate
cost control, budget, and accrual accounting system. It was agreed that WSC
will hire accountants, or contract a qualified firm of chartered accountants
to establish the systems which should be installed and operating within one
year of loan signature.



- 13 -
Auditing
5.07      There are a number of internationally recognized accounting firms
with branches on New Providence Island, and additional international firms
which handle the Bahamas through offices located in Miami. It was agreed
that annual audits by certified public accountants acceptable to the Bank will
be made.
6. FINANCES
Introduction
6.01      Since the present Water and Sewerage Department operates at a finan-
cial loss, and since the project represents an expenditure equal to 170% of
the present asset base in the brief period of two years, the WSC will be
heavily dependent upon Government grants, loans and outside financing to com-
plete the project. Because The Bahamas is a relatively new independent
country, preliminary contacts with potential sources of funds indicate short
pay-back (loan life) terms, requiring tariff increases of up to 180% of the
current average tariff by 1983. In addition to the financing problems, little
historical data are available to extract trends and operating costs for the
present system.
Revenues and Financial Rate of Return
6.02      It is the government's objective that WSC should be established on a
sound financial basis and that WSC should achieve financial viability. Water
and sewerage services are now operating at a loss partly as a result of the
excessive unaccounted-for water for which no revenues are received, and partly
because tariffs are set too low to reflect the costs of production. With the
implementation of the leak detection survey and subsequent repair work, it
should be possible to reduce unaccounted-for water losses from 48% in 1975 to
21% in 1978, and subsequently to 15% by 1983. This should result in increased
revenues, but it is necessary to take action immediately to increase average
tariff levels and eliminate the present operating loss which amounted to $1.0
million in 1974. A tariff increase of over 100% would be required now to
achieve a break-even position in 1976. However, the government is reluctant
to implement an increase of this magnitude when there are substantial water
losses occurring through inefficiencies in the present operation of the
system, and when there is considerable rationing. It would therefore appear
reasonable to expect the new Corporation to break even by 1977 when water
losses will have been substantially reduced and some improvement achieved in
the present water supply situation. At the same time it would be desirable to
reduce the current operating loss by some increase in tariffs. The government
has decided on an increase of 40% in average levels, plus $1.00 per month
meter rental as of July 13, 1976. This action, together with an expected
reduction in unaccounted-for water should cover WSC operating costs. A



- 14 -
further tariff increase of 30% will be required at the beginning of 1977 to
reach a break-even position in 1977. During negotiations assurances were
given by the government and corporation that such an increase will be
implemented.
6.03      A 4% rate of return on net operating assets, revalued from time to
time, would provide sufficient revenue for the WSC to cover operating ex-
penses, meet debt service liabilities and make a reasonable contribution to
future investment. In order to allow a reasonable period for the WSC to
establish itself financially and improve the present totally inadequate water
and sewerage services, it is proposed that the 4% rate of return should not be
required until 1981 and thereafter. During the period until then, the
Corporation would be required to improve its financial position after breaking
even in 1977 by achieving a 1% rate of return in 1978, 2% in 1979, 3% in 1980,
and 4% in 1981 and thereafter. It was agreed during negotiations that the
Government and the Corporation will take all necessary action to achieve the
specified rates of return, and will use the method of revaluation and the
revaluation index used in the projections (see Annex 11).
Tariffs
6.04      The present average tariff of B$2.99 (water and sewerage) per 1,000
imperial gallons of water sold is derived from a three-step water tariff
structure, combined with a highly complicated sewer tariff, last revised in
1970 (see Annex 10 for details). As described in paragraph 5.06, historical
data by customer category was only available in the final quarter of 1975.
Concurrent with the customer data, a leak detection study was completed
(March 1976) which indicates that the seriously high unaccounted-for water
was from leaks, meters not recording and misuse of public faucets. The Water
and Sewerage Department is taking appropriate action to remedy the problem.
In addition, the Bank recommended and the Water and Sewerage Department agreed,
to select six city districts--two each of low, medium, and high income--to
repair and/or replace existing meters for usage monitoring. When all factors
are known, and when the pattern of demand is actually established, as opposed
to being assumed, as is the present case, then a proper combined water and
sewer tariff structure can be implemented. In the meantime, tariff increases
have been projected on the basis of the existing tariff structure. Neverthe-
less, such tariff structuring is only a temporary measure; a definitive scale
will depend upon study of usage patterns and demand. It was agreed during
negotiations, that this study will be completed by June 30, 1977, and, in con-
sultation with the Bank, a revised tariff structure will be introduced by
January 1, 1978.

in Annex 9, as at December 31, 1975.
(ii)  IBRD financing of B$10 million (US$10.0 million).  The Bank
loan is assumed to have a term of 20 years, including 3 years
of grace, and to carry interest at 8.9% per annum, and a
commitment fee of 3/4 of one percent.
(iii) Outside loans of B$9.2 million (US$9.2 million). This element
consists of two parts:
(a)  a known Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) loan of B$3.2
million (US$3.2 million) to have a term of 20 years with
3 years grace, carrying 8.0% interest per annum, a com-
mitment fee of 3/4 of 1% per annum. Additionally this
loan has a 3% management fee, repayable during the first
four years of the loan.



- 16 -
(b)  a consortium of private banks of B$6 million (US$6
million) which is estimated to have a term of 10 years,
including 3 years of grace, at 9.25% per annum, 1/ a
commitment fee of 1/2 of 1% per annum, and a commission
of 1/4 of 1% of the gross loan, payable at loan signature.
(iv) Government cash equity contribution of B$4.4 million (US$4.4
million); in addition, the Government indicated that it would
continue to service the existing long-term debt at date of
incorporation of WSC amounting to approximately B$1 million/
year through 1981.
(v)  A Government loan of B$6.6 million (US$6.6 million), to have
a term of 20 years, includinig 3 years of grace, and to carry
9.25% interest per annum, and no commitment fee.
(vi) WSC net internal resources of B$1.80 million (US$1.80 million).
(vii) The gap of US$1.26 million construction costs to be covered by
overdrafts from commercial banks.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Government will provide
the grant and loan funds described in (iv) and (v) above; will absorb the
existing external debt servicing at incorporation of WSC (iv) above; and have
provided evidence of formal commitments for the funds described in (iii) above.

Debt Service Coverage
6.08      Through 1975, debt service has been taken care of by the Ministry
of Finance, and the government agreed to continue that debt service. The
Corporation will have an adequate cash flow to cover debt service during the
life of the loan if proposed rates of return are achieved, and, from 1979
forward will generate excess cash annually, which funds could be utilized to
partially cover the cost of expanding water facilities to those areas then
likely to be under urban renewal. Except as the Bank shall otherwise agree,
the Borrower shall not incur long-term debt in excess of US$500,000 per year,
other than that foreseen in the project, during the project period.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Assurances were obtained from the Government, that the:
(i) Government has entered into an agreement with the present
owners of Morgan's Bluff dock and shore facilities (BAIL),
satisfactory to the Bank, providing for access to and
utilization of the dock and shore facilities by WSC on
a priority basis (para. 3.05 (ii));
(ii)  Legislation for establishing the Corporation has been
enacted (para. 5.02);
(iii) General Manager, acceptable to the Bank, the Chief Engineer,

WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT FOR NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
THE WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
THE PROJECT
I.   Existing Water Supply Facilities
Introduction
1.        The existing public water supply system on the Island of New
Providence has been gradually developed since 1928 in response to a growth
in demand created by an expanding resident population and visitor industry.
Periodic additions to the system have not been made in accordance with an
overall master plan. Demand growth has, however, tended in recent years to
outpace expansion of the supply resulting in chronic shortages, low pressures
and intermittent service.
Sources of Supply
2.        Up to the present water has been supplied from sources developed
on the Island. These resources consist of (a) the natural freshwater lenses
that occur in the porous rocks of the Island above a salt water base, and
(b) potable water produced from the distillation of seawater.
3.        The balance between the fresh water lenses and the underlying salt
water base is a fragile one and can easily be upset through improper extrac-
tion methods resulting in rising salinity or even complete inversion of the
lenses to sea water. To prevent the intrusion of seawater into the fresh-
water lenses, extraction must be at low pumpage rates from shallow boreholes
distributed over well fields of large acreage. There are at present appro-
ximately 4,000 acres of well fields operated by the Water and Sewerage
Department and in addition water produced in 2,200 acres of privately owned
well fields is purchased by the Government for the public system.
4.        Based on the long-term average replenishment of fresh ground water
from percolation of rainfall, the safe yield is considered for New Providence
to be 500 gallons per acre per day. The safe long-term daily extraction from
the 6,200 acres of well fields is 3.1 million gallons. For short periods,
particularly during the season of heavy precipitation, pumpage may safely
exceed 500 gallons per acre per day provided the normal lenses depth has been
maintained.

fields presently in operation.

6.        The distillation of seawater is accomplished by a multi-stage
flash evaporator with a rated capacity of 2.0 mgd. The plant is located
inland at Blue Hills and obtains its seawater supply from deep boreholes on
the site. Produced water is pumped into storage reservoirs at Blue Hills
where it serves to dilute the frequently unacceptable salinities of well field
water. The plant went on-stream in August 1972. Allowing for maintenance
shut-downs, the desalination plant was to have delivered on an annual basis an
average of 90% of rated capacity, 1.8 mgd. Due to corrosion and other oper-
ating problems the plant has had ntnierous outages with resultig decline in
performance. In 1973, the first full year of operation, the average daily
production was 1.48 mg or 74% of rated capacity. In 1974 average daily pro-
duction fell to 1.21 mg or only slightly over 60% of rated capacity. To
restore the plant to its optimum capacity will require a lengthy removal from
service for major modifications. This is not possible at present because of
demand pressures.
7.        With the failure of the desalination plant to produce its full quota
of water additional demand pressure was exerted on the already over-burdened
well fields. The average daily production from the well fields during 1973
and 1974 was 4.26 mgd, but this was achieved with an extraction rate consid-
erably above the 500 gallons per acre per day considered to be the safe yield.
As a result of the high pumpage rate salinities have increased beyond maximum
allowable limits in some fields.  The simultaneous reduction in the amount of
distilled water available for dilution has necessitated recent reductions in
pumpage or complete closures of some well fields.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
8.        The average amount of water supplied to the distribution system
fell from 5.86 mgd in 1973, to 5.58 mgd in 1974 and to 5.26 mgd in 1975.
The indications are that water production from existing sources will continue
to decline, in all probability at an accelerated rate, until the development
of new sources will permit resting of the well fields and shut-down of the
desalination plant for reconstruction with more corrosion resistant materials.
The Distribution System
9.        Water from the public supply is distributed throughout New
Providence, except to the few areas with private systems, by a network of
360 miles of pipe ranging in diameter up to 22 inches. The majority of the
mains are cast iron with some steel, asbestos cement, polyvinyl chloride and
ductile iron. Most of the network is in the northeastern part of the island
which includes the more densely developed Nassau area. The system has appro-
ximately 23,000 metered connections, 200 metered standpipes in areas where
houses are not connected and several hundred fire hydrants. Many old lines,
some only one and two inches in diameter, are still in service.
10.       The general condition of the existing distribution network may be
judged from the fact that during the first half of 1975, 48% of all of the
water delivered to the network was unaccounted for based on actual in and out
meter readings. This is a marked increase over the 35% unaccounted for in
1974. The loss was due to a combination of leakage and malfunctioning meters.
A leak detection survey carried out in 1976 detected leaks amounting to about
750,000 gpd and malfunctioning meters to which repairs are being made.
II.       The system has about 34 million gallons of storage in above ground
steel and pre-stressed concrete reservoirs. Under severe emergency curtail-
ment this could provide water for about 10 days provided the reservoirs were
full at the start of the emergency. Most of the storage is at the Blue Hills
and Windsor sites with minor service storage at 7 other locations (see Map
11840R attached).
12.       The water has good physical and chemical characteristics (except
for its high chloride content) and is chlorinated before delivery to the
distribution network.
Operation and Maintenance
13.       Working under the direction of the Senior Engineer for operations,
the system is manned by a staff consisting of a chief superintendent, 6 super-
intendents, 9 foremen and 141 artisans and laborers. General direction and
management functions for operation and maintenance as well as for extensions
and future planning are provided by a Chief Engineer and the Department
Director.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
14.        Except for meter testing and repair, the water supply system does
not have adequate shop services of its own and must in large part depend on
the general shops of the Ministry.
The Sanitary Sewerage System
15.        There is no unified sanitary sewerage system on New Providence and
only a relatively small part of the population is connected to public sewers.
Independent systems to serve six local built-up areas are operated by the
Department of Water and Sewerage. The first of these was built in 1928 to
serve Old Nassau Town north of Nassau Ridge. In 1943 and 1944 small systems
were built at Oaks Field and Windsor Field (Nassau International Airport) to
serve housing for RAF and American Air Force personnel. During the last few
years sanitary sewers were built to serve three Government housing estates
at Yellow Elder Gardens Phase I, Big Pond and Yellow Elder Gardens Phase II.
Old Nassau System
16.        The main concentration point for this system is at Malcolm's Park
on the Nassau Waterfront. Trunk lines 21" to 12" in diameter in Bay and
Shirley Streets run east from Malcolm's Park for a distance of 1-1/2 miles to
Montagu Beach and West for 2 miles to Clifford Park. Streets flowing north
from Nassau Ridge between Mackey and Nassau Streets are mostly sewered and
are intercepted by the main Bay and Shirley Street lines. Due to the flat
grades and difficult wet excavation, six pumping stations are used to lift
and concentrate the sewage at Malcolm's Park. After coarse screening the
raw sewage is disposed of through a 24" injection well 540 feet deep (see
Map 11842R attached).
17.        Except for a few sections of cast iron, the sewers are built of
locally made concrete pipe with cement joints. Neither the joints nor the
pipes are able to exclude ground water which exists above sewer grade for
most of the system. By today's standards this construction would be con-
sidered of very low quality. There have been a number of sewer collapses
in downtown Nassau during recent years causing serious disruptions to traffic
and hazards to public health. The pumping stations, except for those re-
cently reconstructed, are in very bad condition. An underground station at
one of the busiest intersections on Bay Street has recently been shored
against total collapse by steel column inserts. Rehabilitation of this
system is included in the proposed project.
Oaks Field Sewerage System
18.        This system serves only about a half square mile area.  It con-
sists largely of 6 inch diameter concrete pipe and two small pumping
stations. Sewage is collected from the old RAF housing and is disposed of
through soakage pits with waste from a slaughterhouse. The entire system
is overloaded and in an advance state of deterioration. It needs total



ANNEX 1
Page 5
replacement, but is not a part of the proposed project. It may be included
later if there is an unexpended balance of construction funds.
Windsor Field System (International Airport)
19.       This is a small system built during World War II to serve an air
force training base. It now serves the Nassau International Airport. It is
a standard gravity system with an Imhoff tank and final effluent disposal in
a subsoil percolation field. The system appears to be functioning satisfac-
torily.
Yellow Elder Gardens I and Big Pond System
20.       These are vacuum sewer systems serving small Government sponsored
housing estates on the south side of Nassau Ridge. The vacuum systems save
a considerable amount of water, but require careful operation. Final dis-
posal is by deep well injection.
Yellow Elder Gardens II
21.       This is a conventional gravity system with a package treatment plant
and deep well injection disposal. The system is designed to serve approxi-
mately 200 houses.
Operation and Maintenance
22.       The Senior Engineer for Operations has a staff of one senior super-
intendent, one superintendent and 31 artisans and laborers for the operation
and maintenance of the sanitary sewerage systems. The underground disposal
of raw sewage by deep injection wells has so far shown no indication of
environmental damage. However, surveillance of the possible effect of this
method of disposal is at present inadequate.
Future Trends
23.       Unification and extension of sanitary sewers by stages to cover
most of New Providence is proposed in a 1971 study by Howard Humphreys & Sons.
The plan also provides for treatment of the sewage before disposal at a plant
located on Harold Pond in the center of the Island. Because of the high costs
involved and the present ease and apparent safety of deep well disposal it
does not appear likely that the Humphreys plan will be implemented at an early
future date. Instead, a further installation of local systems may be expected
as sewer services are provided for areas desperately in need of sanitary drain-
age.

TI. Project Description
Objectives
1.        The primary objectives of the project are to improve the water
supply of the Island of New Providence, rehabilitate the 50 year-old sanitary
sewerage system in Old Nassau Harbour and remove ship pollution from Nassau
Harbour. The project components through which the objectives will be accom-
plished are:
(i) A conservation program aimed at reducing unaccounted-for
water in the present distribution system from 48% to an
acceptable 15%;
(ii) An interim program to import 3.0 mgd of water from Andros
Island;
(iii) An expanded program to provide up to 3.0 mgd of additional
water;
(iv) Improve distribution through pipeline network analysis and
the provision of peak load and emergency storage;
(v) Reconstruct the sanitary sewers and pumping stations in
downtown and East Nassau;
(vi) Build an interceptor sewer to Prince George's Wharf to
receive sanitary waste discharges from the docked ships.
Secondary objectives of the project include:
(i) Automation of existing government well fields on New
Providence;
(ii) Temporary removal of existing Blue Hills distillation
plant from service to permit major overhaul changes
designed to return the plant to 80% of full rated
capacity of 2.0 mgd;
(iii)  Resting of well fields with high salinities;
(iv) Establishment of a training program for managers, engineers,
foremen and operators.
2.        In addition the project should provide stimulation for the following
objectives that are not included in Bank and UNDP financing:



ANNEX 1
Page 7
(i) The installation of water and sanitary sewer services as
part of an integrated redevelopment program for the
depressed areas;
(ii) Development of a monitoring system designed to detect any
pollution of the New Providence well fields from the deep
well disposal of sanitary waste;
(iii)  Development of a monitoring system designed to detect any
beach pollution from the deep well disposal of sanitary
waste;
(iv) Encouragement to the conservation of fresh water by large
consumers such as hotels and apartment buildings through
the use of sea water and vacuum flushing systems;
(v) Encouragement to the conservation of fresh water through
the use of highly treated sewage effluent for lawn and
garden irrigation.
Description of Primary Project Elements
3.        (i)  Conservation Program:  This will consist essentially of
three activities: (a) the detection and repair of distri-
bution system leaks, (b) the replacement of malfunctioning
meters, and (c) the location and elimination of illegal or
unmetered connections. For leak detection the services of
a competent specialty firm with previous experience in New
Providence was engaged. The detection survey was followed
by repair teams and the larger leaks were repaired first.
Malfunctioning meters were located and will be repaired or
replaced. The project will support this effort through the
provision of meters and meter boxes plus additional testing
equipment, if necessary, for the existing meter repair shop.
(ii)   Interim Importation Plan:  A well field of approximately
6,000 acres to deliver 3.0 mgd will be developed by trench-
ing on Andros Island adjacent to Morgan's Bluff.  One tug and
several barges will be purchased and used to transport up to
3.0 mgd from the existing harbour at Morgan's Bluff to the
existing pier at Arawak Cay on New Providence. The project
will provide all piping, pumps, storage, access roads, commu-
nications, quarters, shops and other items necessary to make
the interim program a fully functioning component. A pipe-
line from Arawak Cay to Blue Hills must be built, making the
Interim Importation Plan the quickest way to provide water to
relieve the present shortage.



ANNEX I
Page 8
(iii) The Expanded Program provides for the dredging of MIorgan's
Bluff Harbour to 27' below mean low water from the present
14' or to construct a pier and breakwater at the existing 27'
depth level. The tankers contemplated for purchase for this
phase of the development are three 15,000 DWT. The well field
on Andros will be expanded by an additional 6,000 acres making
a total of 12,000 acres and providing 3.0 mgd. The new well
field will be developed as a closed system and provision is
made to convert the interim (emergency) open trench well field
to a closed system for sanitary reasons. All short installa-
tions and other ancillary equipment will be increased as needed
to accommodate the larger volume of water shipped from Andros
and received at New Providence Island.
(iv) Distribution Improvement, Peak Load and Emergency Storage:
Based on a computer analysis of the distribution network plus
a study of peak load and emergency storage requirements, some
modifications in piping and operating procedures may be re-
quired. An in-ground storage reservoir with perhaps 30 million
gallons capacity will be constructed to provide for peak load
and emergency conditions.
(v) Sanitary Sewer Rehabilitation: The existing sewer system in
Nassau was completed in 1928. It consists of trunk lines and
lift stations in Bay and Shirley Streets along the northeast
rim of the island together with a number of lateral lines run-
ning north from Nassau Ridge. Much of the system including
lift stations in downtown Nassau are in an advanced state of
deterioration. This component of the project will rebuild the
pumping stations, replace the trunk mains and laterals, and
install additional laterals.
(vi) Prince George's Wharf Interceptor: A 12-inch line will run
from the rebuilt Bay Street trunk sewer to the wharf where
sewage from cruise ships will be discharged into sumps and
pumped to the interceptor for eventual disposal in the
Malcolm's Park deep injection well.
Description of Secondary Project Elements
4.        Only two secondary elements are included for financing in the
project:
(i) Well Field Automation: The Governemnt-owned well fields on
New Providence would be provided with automatic controls to
reduce staff costs and improve operation.



ANNEX I
Page 9
(ii) Blue Hills Evaporator Overhaul: The nominally rated 2.0
mgd [lash distillation desalination plant has experienced
serious corrosion problems with resultant steady loss of
output. It needs to be withdrawn from service for an
extended period for major repairs and modifications. This
has not been possible until now because of demand pressures.
As soon as the expanded program is on-stream the work can
be undertaken to restore the Blue Hills Evaporation to its
originally rated productive capacity.
(iii) Staff Training Program: This would be a program for managers,
engineers, equipment operators, foremen, technical assistants
and sub-professional staff. It would be conducted in coope-
ration with local training schools.
5.        The remainder of secondary project elements are financed outside
of the project or require no special funding:
(i) Resting of Well Fields: After completion of the expanded
program well fields with high salinities may be rested for
recovery and then returned to operation.
Engineering Design and Construction Supervision
6.        The Department of Water and Sewerage in the Ministry of Works and
Utilities does not have enough technical staff to undertake project design
and construction supervision other than general overall direction, largely
administrative in character. It is also not anticipated that the proposed
Water and Sewerage Authority will have had sufficient time before the start
of work to recruit and orient new staff for design and construction super-
vision. Therefore, this work will be performed through negotiated contracts
by firms with specialized skills in the various fields required and pre-
ferably with previous experience in the Bahamas.
7.        The contracts are as follows:
(i) Leak Detection and Measurement. This contract has been
signed and the work completed. The company has pre-
viously carried out a limited but very successful leak
detection survey in New Providnce. The new survey covered
the entire distribution system and provided "pinpoint"
locations for all leaks discovered with estimates of their
relative size. Approximately 750,000 gallons per day of
leaks were located and are being repaired.
(ii) Distribution Network Analysis and Storage Requirement Study.
The water distribution system of New Providence has been
expanded as growth and land developments required without



ANNEX 1
Page 10
a specific overall plan. A network analysis bv computer
may indicate both structural and operational changes that
will benefit distribution and possibly result in operating
economics. The storage study will determine the benefits
that may be derived by being able to meet peak loads from
storage and what additional emergency storage would be
desirable. The study would indicate the preferred location
or locations for the additional storage. These studies are
so closely interrelated that it would be desirable to have
them performed by the same engineering firm.
(iii) Well Field Design and Construction Supervision. This is a
highly specialized undertaking in which prior experience and
knowledge of the terrain are of utmost importance. The staff
of the Department of Water and Sewers has long experience in
the operation and development of such well fields and will
select appropriate consultants. The basic hydrogeological
studies for the areas of Andros Island to be developed for
water extraction have been made by the Overseas Development
Administration. The construction of the well fields will be
performed in two stages of 6,000 acres each. The Interim
Program was started in October 1975.
(iv) Ship Survey, Dock and Harbour Improvement. The tankers or
other sea transportation equipment to be purchased will be
reviewed by an experienced and well recognized ship surveyor.
The report on this item will indicate the suitability of the
vessels, their physical condition, fair market price and the
cost of necessary changes, additions and reconditioning. The
dredging of Morgan's Bluff and dock improvements at both
Andros and New Providence will require the services of an
experienced marine and harbour firm. The Caribbean Develop-
ment Bank has undertaken to finance the harbor and dock
studies.
(v)  Sanitary Sewer Design and Construction Supervision.  The
consultant for this work should be familiar with general
practice in the interception of ship sewage and the tech-
niques for the rehabilitation of sewer lines in situ.
Studies
8.        No additional studies are contemplated for inclusion in the project
proper.  Corollary studies on which tlhe Bank should be kept informed for
coordination purposes and possible further interest are:

(i) The UNDP supported urban renewal studies.
(ii) The PAHO supported studies of solid waste collection and
disposal.
Estimated Project Costs
9.        The estimated costs in Annex IA have been developed from the prices
for similar work in The Bahamas, upgraded- for the effects of inflation, and
from the quotations of manufacturers, supplies and contractors. They are
deemed to be reasonably accurate and to incorporate recent market trends.

THE BAHAMAS
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE P'ROJECT FOR NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
THE WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
JUSTIFICATION AND INTERNAL FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RATES OF RETURN
The Present Situation
1.        Primary economic justification for the project rests on the need
to meet the demand for water of the resident population and that created by
the tourist industry for water. T'ourism is the country's principal economic
activity, contributes directly ancl indirectly approximately 55% of Bahamian
GDP and 77% of GNP, and accounts for 64% of foreign exchange earnings. In
1973, over 1.5 million tourists visited the Bahamas, of whom nearly 65% went
to Nassau. 1/ The rapid increase of tourism in the sixties put tremendous
pressure on New Providence Island's water resources and even though the rate
of tourism growth has slowed down significantly during the seventies, the
island is now facing a serious water supply shortage. During the past few
years, water production has been at a level of 5.2 mgd but is still not
adequate to meet average daily requirements, resulting in periodic water
rationing and intermittent supply. Every attempt has been made by the
Department of Water and Sewerage to provide sufficient water to the hotels,
which often meant severe water rationing for the residential population.
However, at the height of the tourist season (which coincides with the dry
season) hotels have often been subject to water rationing, as well as at
other times of the year when the clesalination plant has had to cease produc-
tion for maintenance or repair work (this is happening with increasing fre-
quency), resulting in tourist dissatisfaction. 2/ Another cause for complaint
is the deteriorating quality of water owing to increasing salinity of the
groundwater, as the pumping rate today exceeds natural replenishment.
2.        Sewage discharge from cruise ships threatens the environment of New
Providence by pollution of Nassau Harbor and adjoining beaches, and the col-
lapse of the existing sanitary sewerage system in the old part (downtown) of
Nassau is imminent. Prince George's Wharf and downtown Nassau are the most
heavily frequented areas by both visitors and residents.
1/   Figures reflect total foreign arrivals by first port of entry.
2/   See Dayton and Keenan Report, prepared for the Ministry of Tourism,
August 1973.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
The Demand Forecast
3.        The demand forecast has been estimated taking into consideration
the following:
(i) periodic water rationing and intermittent supply have been
prevalent on New Providence Island for the past few years
and as a result it is difficult to ascertain what the
current demand would be if adequate water were available;
(ii) the problem of predicting future tourist traffic owing to
variations in tourism since 1970;
(iii) uncertainty as to the effect of the high level of water
charges that will be imposed (para. 6.03) on the rate of
demand growth.
It is assumed that average residential per capita consumption would grow from
17 gd to be about 40 gd, and average per hotel room occupant consumption would
continue to be 150 gd. The rate of growth of tourism has been estimated at
2% p.a. and residential growth at 3% p.a. (based on population projections by
the Bahamas Department of Statistics). The project has sufficient flexibility
to accommodate any unforeseen increase in the demand for water.
Internal Financial Rate of Return on Investment
4.        For purposes of benefit measurement, additional water output attri-
butable to the project is taken as the difference between estimated water sold
without a project and estimated water sold with the project. This is parti-
cularly significant since, without immediate expenditures, water production on
New Providence Island will decline significantly. With the water produced by
the project valued at the current average water charge of B$2.97 per thousand
gallons, the internal rate of return is 11.9%. If it is assumed that the
opportunity cost of capital in the Bahamas is currently less than 11.9% in
real terms, then at the current average price of B$2.97 per thousand gallons,
consumers are paying a price which is at least equal to the real resource
costs of expansion, and an investment signal has been given, i.e., consumers
are exhibiting a willingness to pay the real costs of additional water supply
expansion, and therefore the water supply portion of the project is economic-
ally justified. At a minimum, the benefits of the project are equal to the
costs. In fact, the benefits of the project undoubtedly exceed costs since
taking revenues from water sales as the only benefit understates the total
benefits of the project in that it fails to account for consumer surplus and
externalities.
5.        It is not possible to adequately quantify the health and environ-
mental benefits of the sewerage portion of the project. In addition, exist-
ing prices for sewage collection and disposal do not allow consumers to



ANNEX 5
Page 3
indicate the value to them of system expansion.  Therefore, it is not possible
to calculate a meaningful internal economic rate of return on the sewerage
investment.
Marginal Costs of Investment
6.        The problems of sewerage benefit measurement highlight the need to
formulate a water supply and sewerage tariff policy which reflects the true
costs of supplying water and disposing of wastewater on New Providence Island.
The objective of this would be to assure that investment decisions can be made
with greater confidence as to their economic merit. If the price of water
supply and sewerage services is fixed at a level which approximates the long
run marginal cost of supplying those services, then it will be demonstrable
that increments in the consumption of water supply and sewerage services are
valued by consumers at least as much as the resource consumed in providing
those increments, i.e. approximate economic efficiency will be attained from
a resource allocation point of view.
7.        The average incremental cost (marginal cost) of water supply and
sewage disposal on New Providence Island is estimated to be approximately
B$3.11/1,000 gallons at a discount rate of 10%. If the oportunity cost of
capital is taken at 8% and 12% the incremental costs would be B$2.92 and
B$3.30/1,000 gallons respectively. In attempting to estimate the marginal
cost of supplying and disposing of water on New Providence Island, the aver-
age incremental cost calculations were carried out on incremental output and
on incremental capital and operating costs for the years 1976 to 2008.  The
water supply and sewerage capital costs used were only those which will be
affected through time by increased system usage. As a result, a portion of
the investment in sewage disposal and in the main sewage collectors was elim-
inated from the average incrementaL cost exercise since these costs, once
initially incurred, will effectiveLy be sunk costs and will not be affected
by, or subject to, replacement because of increased or decreased flow of
water or sewage. Because of this, they should not enter into the economic
pricing decision for water supply and sewage disposal.
8.        Current prices for water and sewerage will not generate sufficient
revenue to cover the financial costs of the water supply authority. In usual
circumstances, a situation in which the financial costs of supplying water
are greater than the real long-run resource cost (the marginal cost), a two-
part tariff would be proposed in which all water (except a minimum subsidized
amount for the low consumption, low-income population) would be billed at the
marginal cost price, and the deficit in revenues would be made up through
fixed monthly meter rent charges. However, available evidence suggests that
the demand of higher-consumption commercial users is probably inelastic, and
therefore charging a price significantly greater than the current marginal
cost price in these high-use categories will result in lesser resource allo-
cation distortions than a similar increase would if applied to domestic users
(see para. 6.02).

Economic Rate of Return on Investment
9.        The benefits of the project to the economy of The Bahamas are un-
doubtedly high, as without undertaking investment to increase, or even to
maintain, the present level of water supply, tourism will be seriously
affected. There are three possible approaches which might be used in estima-
ting the magnitude of such benefits but all involve the acceptance of certain
crucial assumptions or need information that is not available and would be
difficult to obtain. The different methods are discussed below.
Method 1
10.       Existing water sources on New Providence Island are being used in
excess of their maximum capacity and their yield will in fact decline from
1976 onwards if no further water supply investment takes place (see para.
4.09). Therefore, it would seem reasonable to assume that tourism will be
maintained at no more than 1974 levels as there will be insufficient water
supply to allow for growth. Benefits can be calculated by taking the volume
of the potential expansion in tourist traffic that will be lost, estimating
the amount of tourist expenditure which the loss represents, and taking as
benefits of the project that proportion of projected increase in tourism ex-
penditure that is of direct benefit to the economy.
1I.       This method involves the additional assumptions that:
(i)  From 1975 there will be a 2% rate of growth of tourism
on New Providence if there is an adequate supply of
potable water, therefore, this would represent the
volume of tourist traffic lost;
(ii)  No additional infrastructure or investment other than
the proposed project is necessary to accommodate a 2%
increase in tourism up to the time when the hotels reach
full capacity; 1/ thereafter, additional investment in the
hotel industry and other sectors will be needed to provide
for further growth in tourism. As far as can be judged,
no significant investment is necessary in other sectors
up to the time when hotels reach full capacity;
1/   Full capacity is extremely difficult to define owing to monthly peak
occupancy rates for hotels being much higher than the annual average
occupancy rate (in the case of Nassau in 1974 the annual average was
64% and the monthly (March) peak rate was 86%). Taking annual average
occupancy rates means that hotels will not reach full capacity until
1986, but it is more likely that after a few years of 2% growth there
would be several months of occupancy rates of over 80%, thus resulting
in the need for further hotel expansion.



ANNEX 5

(iii)  It assumes that other factors will not have any influence
on the growth of tourism, e.g. a decline in the number of
tourists owing to tourist dissatisfaction with the overall
declining quality of services, 1/ or a change in preference
for other Caribbean islands or entirely different regions,
or the effect of movements in the USA economy on tourism
in the Bahamas;
(iv) Hotels will not be able to obtain significant quantities
of potable water from other sources or to substantially
decrease the average room occupant/day consumption by the
use of water-saving devices;
(v) Tourists will not be diverted to other Bahamian Islands
in significant numbers. A costly investment program would
need to be undertaken to expand the existing infrastructure
on the Family Islands and Grand Bahamas in order to accom-
modate tourists who could no longer visit New Providence
Island. One of the major problems would be the relocation
of labor from Nassau to the other islands, involving addi-
tional investment in housing, public utilities and social
services. In addition, there does appear to be a marked
difference in consumer preference between Nassau, Grand
Bahamas and the Family Islands, as they do offer rather
distinct attractions, and it is questionable whether
those tourists who wanted to visit Nassau would wish
to go to the other islands.
12.       Any estimates made of the net benefit to the economy arising from
tourist expenditure are very tentative. According to the latest Bank Econ-
omic Report, 2/ the import component (a large percentage of which is comprised
of factor payments abroad) is approximately 39%, leaving a minimum direct im-
pact on GDP of 11% of tourist expenditure. Therefore, if the stopover visitor
spends an average of B$48 per day (1974 figure), the direct net benefit to the
economy (ignoring the multiplier effect) will be a minimum of 11% of B$48.
In order to simplify the procedure, expenditure of cruise visitors is ignored,
especially as it forms a small part of total tourist expenditure (approximately
6%). Taking a constant 11% assumes that (a) tourist expenditure will remain
constant over the life of the project, and (b) the percentage of tourist
expenditure which is of direct benefit to the econony will remain constant
over the life of the project.
13.       Taking average annual hotel occupany rates (see footnote 1 of page
2), and including as benefits of tle project that percentage (11%) of tourist
expenditure lost that is of direct benefit to the economy up to the year 1986,
1/   See Dayton and Keenan Report, previously noted.

Bahamas," No. 390a-BM.



ANNEX 5
Page 6
when additional infrastructure and hotel investment will be needed, the
economic rate of return is 24%. However, assuming that after five years of
2% growth in tourism additional hotel investment will be necessary because
of seasonal peak occupancy rates, the economic rate of return is 15%. Apart
from the validity of the assumptions made any estimate of the rate of return
using this method will depend on:
(i) the estimated component of tourist expenditure that
is of direct benefit to the economy;
(ii)  when it is considered that "full capacity" in the hotel
industry has been attained; and
(iii) estimated tourist expenditure.
Method 2
14.       A variant of the above method would involve the additional assump-
tion that tourism will not only cease to grow but will actually decline if no
additional water supply investment is forthcoming in the near future. Even
to maintain existing supplies of water, significant investment is required.
This method would involve all of the assumptions noted under Method 1, in
addition to the problem of estimating the number of tourists for whom there
would be an adequate supply of water. Such an exercise would also depend on
the water rationing program adopted by the Department of Water and Sewerage
as the result of a decrease in water supply; much would depend on the balance
maintained between hotels and residential consumers; possibly the latter
would have their consumption restricted even more than at present in order
to provide as much water as possible to hotels.
15.       Obviously the economic rate of return will be higher using this
method as opposed to Method 1. With water production in 1979 and thereafter
at only one-third of the 1974 level, tourism would have to decline, causing
a wholesale closure of hotels as they would be unable to continue to operate
for very long at low occupancy rates.
Method 3
16.       Conceptually, probably the least arbitrary method of calculating
benefits would be to take the difference between project costs and the cost
to consumers of supplying their own water, assuming they would be willing
to incur such costs. There is a problem of estimating the costs involved
to hotels, but undoubtedly they would be high as few would have access to
fresh water wells, and even those that do might have their pumping rights
restricted because of new Government policies. I/
1/   Legislation has been enacted to establish the Government's ownership
of all water resources in the Bahamas.



ANNEX 5
Page 7
17.       The Paradise Island Utility Company, which distributes water to
all the hotels on Paradise Island 1/ is now pumping the maximum amount of
brackish water technically feasible, and therefore would either have to ship
water from another island, or purchase a reverse osmosis plant which has a
membrane capable of distilling seawater. Such a plant is costly (around B$8-
B$10 per thousand gallons) and is very much in the experimental stage.
18.       Most of the hotels in Nassau would also be faced with either of
the two alternatives mentioned above, except that shipping would mean having
access to some kind of docking facilities (these already exist on Paradise
Island) and unloading and storage installations. Smaller hotels (less than
100 rooms) would suffer from increased costs per thousand gallons with re-
verse osmosis plants because of the increased costs of smaller scale plants.
Those hotels with access to brackish water would be able to purchase the
regular reverse osmosis plants which run at B$4-B$5 per thousand gallons
without taking into consideration costs of transmitting the water from the
wells to the plant and from the plant to the hotel(s) (in the event that one
plant served more than one hotel). Residential consumers could either supple-
ment the public water supply system by installing water catchment and stor-
age tanks in their homes or purchase "domestic" reverse osmosis plants where
brackish water was available--the Latter would be at high cost.
19.       The level and "mix" of tlhe above costs is difficult to calculate
owing to:
(i) the essentially experimental nature of reverse osmosis
plants distilling seawater;
(ii) the availability of fresh or brackish water to the various
hotels and residential consumers;
(iii) Government policy oni the private use of fresh water wells;
(iv) water-saving devices installed by hotels.
20.       An additional problem is the assumption that hotels will undertake
the necessary investment to supply their own water needs, as the costs per
thousand gallons will undoubtedly be higher than those of the proposed proj-
ect, and the initial investment could be so high as to be quite prohibitive.
1/   The Company purchases an amount of water from the Department of Water,
which represents approximately 45% of New Providence hotel annual water
consumption.

Summary of Justificaiton of Project
21.       As noted above, without the project the amount of water produced
in New Providence Island will actually decline, with disastrous effects on
tourism.
22.       The following table shows the overall decline in the supply of water
over the next 8 years if no project is undertaken:

/1   Plant out of operation.
/2   Reduction in wellfield production to control salinity.
Production in 1974 was 2.2 billion gallons of which 48% was unaccounted-for.
Therefore, in the absence of the Project and optimistically assuming a reduc-
tion in unaccounted-for water from 48% to 35% by 1976 and to 21% by 1978 by
improving operation and maintenance standards, there will be insufficient
water from 1975 onwards to attain even the amount sold in 1974 (1.2 billion
galions). This will mean more water rationing for both hotels and the resi-
dent population.
23.       The effect of water rationing on tourism is difficult to quantify,
but there is no doubt that it has detrimental effects as previous periods of
intermittent water supply to the hotels have resulted in expressions of
tourist dissatisfaction. By 1977 the amount of water available for hotels
on New Providence Island would be significantly less than that sold to them
in 1974, and thereafter it would be drastically reduced, forcing hotels to'
either completely or partially close down. Added to this would be the
deteriorating quality of water which, by 1976, would not meet WHO standards
which are more tolerant than the North American and N. European minimum
standards, and by 1979 would have an unacceptably high chloride content of



ANNEX 5
Page 9
1,000 ppm. 1/ A decline in touriLsm on New Providence Island will have detri-
mental effects on the economy of the country as a whole unless tourists could
be accommodated elsewhere in the Bahamas; however, substantial additional
investment would have to be undertaken on the other islands in order to cope
with such an influx of tourists. Such investments can at least not be justi-
fied until the excess capacity built up by the tourism industry on New
Providence Island has been fully used up. This is expected to occur at the
earliest in 1980 (see also para. 13). The internal financial rate of return
would only be marginally affected by not including increased revenues after
that date. This means that the project is justified even if future increases
in tourism would take place outside New Providence Island. Therefore, al-
though very difficult to quantify, the external benefits arising from the
project are considerable, since without the project the tourist industry would
be seriously affected leading to severe effects on the economy of the Bahamas.
24.       Other non-quantifiable benefits of the project stem from its effects
on the environment and health of the population. According to official
Bahamian statistics, water-associated diseases do not appear to be significant
on New Providence Island. However, periods of water shortage have the poten-
tial of creating problems for the local and tourist population by the spread
of water-associated diseases, partially through direct water transmission, and
partially because many of the service personnel and restaurant food handlers
undoubtedly reside in lower income areas which are usually among the first to
be affected by water rationing.
1/   WHO considers chloride content of 200 ppm acceptable, and 600 ppm as
maximum.

THE BAHAMAS
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT FOR NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
THE WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
FINANCING ASSUMPTIONS AND PLAN
6.1 Basic Assumptions
Project Costs - All elements of the project were projected at 1976
price levels; with the exception of construction costs, all dredging, equip-
ment, materials, and engineering and consultants, were considered to be
"foreign" costs.
Physical contingencies used were 15% on the sewerage elements of
the project, 10% on the water elements, and 5% on the ships and consultants.
Price contingencies were considered as being 10.6% for 1976, 9.6%
per year thereafter for the foreign cost elements, and 10.6% for local costs
during the project time frame.
6.2  Demand and Tariffs - Project demand, as previously stated, was estimated
on the following basis:
(i)  Tourists - The volume for tourist consumption was based
upon the 1973/1974 "stopover" and cruise ship passengers
in Nassau. The quantity of each category was assumed
to grow at 2% per year. Cruise ship passengers were
estimated to stay one day, and use 7 gallons of water
per day each; stopover visitors were (basis Ministry
of Tourism data) allowed 150 gallons per day, and were
assumed to stay 6-1/2 days.
(ii)  Bahamas Electric Corporation - Known volumes of water
sold in 1973 and 1974 were projected to grow by 4%
per year, based upon BEC's 15 year projection of its
growth in electricity sales. This same basis was
applied to sale of water to Government bodies.
(iii)  Resident Population - Historical data for 1973/74
comes from Department of Statistics census data. New
Providence population was: (a) assumed to grow at 3%
per year--historically it has grown faster, but due to
the recession and other factors preventing large scale
growth, the 3% factor was used; and (b) 20,000 people



ANNEX 6
Page 2
estimated to be obtaining water from standpipes, were
assumed to continue to use them through 1983--thus
allowing full population "growth" to be served. The
20,000 standpipe customers were allowed 10 gallons per
day; the balance of the population was given whatever
was left until sources of supply could provide them
with 40 gallons per person per day (1978 and thereafter).
Production was then the sum of the maximnm possible from
all existing sources through 1977, and thereafter pro-
duction was limited to that quantity of water consumed
plus lost water by varying the quantity delivered from
Andros Island by the large and small water tankers.
(iv) Tariffs - Tariffs were generated on the basis of a rate
of return on revalued fixed assets so that the Corporation
broke even in 1977; earned 1% in 1978, 2% in 1979, 3% in
1980, and 4% thereafter. An additional tariff increase of
38% effective July 1, 1976 was used, and a meter rental
charge was re-instituted effective July 1, 1976 at B$1.00/
month through 1978; at B$1.50/month from 1979 through
1981; and at B$2.00/month thereafter.
6.3  Operating Costs
(i)  Internal Inflation  was assumed to be 10% in 1976, 8.5%
in 1977-1979, and 7.5% in 1980 and thereafter. This was
based upon a mission decision that the components of the
Cost of Living Incdex in Nassau were inappropriate for this
purpose, and the rates suggested by the Bank were combined
to reflect local and foreign elements of operating cost.
(ii) Wages and Salaries - 1974 and 1975 actual data were reviewed
on a head-count basis. The proposed Authority was manned
on a theoretical basis; salaries were adjusted to the levels
paid by Bahamas Electric Corporation, and a factor of 20%
was added for pension fund, national insurance contributions,
overtime, etc. Manpower savings from the automation of the
Government wellfields on New Providence Island were con-
sidered to be effective in 1979, and represent a reduction
of 50 people.
(iii)  Chemicals - These represent a relatively minor part of the
total cost of operations, being primarily the acid used at
the desalination plant. Chemical costs were related to
desalination volumre produced for the purposes of these
projections.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
(iv) Power - This is a very substantial operating cost
element, and consists of both electric energy costs
at present wellfields and sewerage, plus the waste
heat/bunker fuel to operate the desalination plant.
The DWS officials prepared the basic costs for each
existing and projected operating source, and estimated
the diesel fuel to operate the New Andros wellfields.
(v) Ship Transport - WSC consultants (Jones and Bardlemeier)
prepared annual operating costs for varying sizes of
ships. These costs include full manpower, fuel mainte-
nance, insurance, dock stand-by, and sea operation; they
appear as "Other Water Costs" in the Income Statement,
Annex 8. For 1977, a tug/barge combination was used.
For 1978 through 1981, two 15,000 DWT tankers were used--
a third tanker was introduced in 1982.
(vi) Purchases of Private Wellwater - The Department of
Water and Sewer purchases water from the New Providence
Development Co. under a contract providing for a minimum
of 1.0 million gallons per day with an escalating price
clause. This contract ends in 1981. This water was
priced at $1.30/thousand gallons as at 1975, and was
inflated through 1981--when that supply was projected
to be suspended. The water produced by the reverse
osmosis plant is priced at $2.50 per thousand gallons
beginning on July 1, 1976, and ending on June 30, 1981.
For the reason given in 6.45, these costs are included
in "Other Water Costs".
(vii)  Taxes - the corporation is to be free of all duties and
taxes. Bunker fuel and diesel oil prices were reduced
in 1976 forward to reflect the elimination of duties.
(viii)  Other Costs - All other costs of maintenance, insurance,
stationery, etc., were derived by reviewing actual
operational data, and together with WSC personnel,
projecting the additional expenditures that expansion
of sources of supply require. Maintenance costs are
particularly susceptible to potential future savings
since many current costs are associated with purchased
services and excessive repairs to the desalination
plant.

ASSET AND DEPRECIATION REVALUATION
1.        Due to the rapid increase in cost over the past five years, and
the expectation that world inflation 1/ will continue for extended periods
of time, historical values of fixed plant investment are no longer adequate
as a basis of developing the true, or real rate of return on the utility's
investment. Therefore, a revaluation index is necessary.
2.        Indices available in Nassau are primarily of the cost of living
type which do not properly reflect those cost elements related to either
construction or capital replacement. Therefore, as a basis for considera-
tion, the Construction Cost Index from the U.S. Department of Commerce's
"Construction Review" has been selected as being more appropriate to utility
plant revaluation. 2/ The index base should be adjusted for the fact that
all material costs (cement excluded) in the Bahamas is imported--a factor
of +10% is suggested.
3.        Records of historical asset value (and depreciation) of DWS are
virtually non-existent. DWS, based on engineering records, calculated on
estimated value (1973 prices) and the remaining useful life of all existing
assets. Thus, the December 1973 index (from 2 above) has been chosen as being
equal to a base of 100%.
4.        The annual true or real rate of return to be achieved by the
Borrower, in any fiscal (calendar) year shall be on the basis of its average
net fixed assets in operation, and shall be calculated on the following basis:
(i) the real rate of return for the financial year in
question shall be computed by subtracting from the
operating income before depreciation 3/ the real annual
1/,  From IBRD "Commodity Forecasts" dated 27 May 1975.
2/   This index is a composite of many privately published indices, and is
prepared monthly by the U.S. Departent of Commerce, see sample page
attached.
3/   "Operating income before depreciation" shall mean the difference
between: (a) gross operating revenues accruing from the Borrower's
water supply and sewerage services; and (b) all operating costs of
the borrower's water supl  and,sewerage services i cludin  admnis-
trative expenses but exciui ng interest ana other cnarges on  e   .

depreciation, and dividing the result by the average real
value of the net fixed assets in operation in that year.
Net fixed assets in operation are the assets in use to
provide services by the Borrower and are "real value of
gross assets" less "accumulated real depreciation";
(ii) The real value of gross assets in operation is calculated
by increasing the historical costs of each asset by the
percetage increase in prices since its acquisition, or its
last valuation. The index to be applied to the historical
cost of the assets is the percentage increase in the Con-
struction Cost Index, Department of Commerce Composite Cost
Index for the financial year in question;
(iii) The accumulated real depreciation for the financial year
in question is the accumulated real depreciation at the
end of the preceding financial year increased by the
percentage increase in the Construction Cost Index,
Department of Commerce Composite Cost Index for the finan-
cial year in question plus the real annual depreciation of
that same year. The real annual depreciation for the fi-
nancial year in question is calculated by multiplying the
real value of each gross asset in operation at the end of
that year by its annual depreciation rate and by dividing
by 12 the number of months the asset has been in operation.
Depreciation rates are as specified in the attached sche-
dule, Aanex llB;
(iv) for determining the average of the net real assets in
operation in the financial year in question, the Borrower
will add the net real value of assets in operation at
the beginning and at the end of the financial year in
question and divide by two except that, at the option of
the Borrower it may, for any individual asset, determine
its average net real value of such asset by the number
of months of operation of such asset during such year;
(v) the Engineering Department will report all new assets
entering into operation with the same frequency as that
chosen for averaging the assets.
5.        Asset Classification and Depreciation life has been estimated
as described above. For future use, the table of asset life attached
(Annex 1lB) should be implemented; the table is from U.S. Internal Revenue
approved rates.

THE BAHAMAS
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT FOR NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
THE WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
RECOMMENDED TRAINING PROGRAM
Training Needs
1.        Managers and engineers are needed for the new corporation.  In addi-
tion, the Department of Water and Sewerage has about 300 persons most of whom
need training, particularly the supervisory and sub-professional personnel.
The present professional staff are managers and mostly expatriates. Since
there is no university in the country, future Bahamian engineers would have to
be trained abroad.
2.        The main training needs are:
-    management;
-    engineering;
-    administration;
-    water and sewage sample collection;
-    pumping plants and equipment including chlorinators;
-    pipe laying and jointing for water supply and sewerage
systems;
-    service and meter installation;
-    inspection and repair of water and sewer pipelines;
-    meter reading and replacements;
-    maintenance and housekeeping for buildings and grounds;
-    personal hygiene;
-    mechanical and electrical maintenance and repair;
-    maintenance and repair of tools and instruments; and
-    meter testing and repair.
3.        There are no water filtration plants or sewage treatment plants in
the Bahamas. The water is chlorinated. Sewage disposal is by deep well in-
jection.
(a) Occupational Classifications
Professional: A person employed to manage, administer, plan
design, estimate costs for works and facilities, and be in
charge of second level managerial and technical personnel.
Sub-professional employee: A person employed to perform a
function at a level below a professionally qualified person.
Technician: A person carrying out functions of a grade inter-
mediate between engineer on one hand and operating personnel on
the other.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
Supervisor: A person at first or second level of total
managerial structure who is in charge of a particular
area of operation.
Operative Personnel: Manual workers possessing various
degrees of skill and knowledge but having no managerial
responsibilities, for example: mechanics, electricians,
electro-mechanics, plumbers, etc.
(b) Training Levels:
-    Graduate courses in business administration, management
and engineering at universities;
-    Full courses in business administration and in basic
engineering at recognized universities;
-    Short courses for technicians in the waterworks field;
Short courses for supervisors in water works operation;
Short courses, mainly in the form of on-the-job training,
for specialized workers in their respective fields.
Training Situation and Facilities
4.        At present no systematic training program has been established by
the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage. The primary and secondary edu-
cation is adequate by and large to qualify candidates for employment in the
Department of Water Supply and Sewerage at the lower levels. However, this
basic education is not sufficient to erLable an employee to advance to higher
position levels. In-service specific training is needed which is not avail-
able in the Department. A training unit should, therefore, be created within
the Department to provide training on a systematic basis. This unit should
function in close relationship and collaboration with two institutions: the
CR Walter Technical College now called College of Bahamas and the Public Ser-
vice Training Center. Since there is no university in the Bahamas, training
for higher levels will have to be done abroad. The training unit would seek
out qualified Bahamians for a period of in-service training prior to being
selected for undergraduate and graduate training abroad.
5.        The College of Bahamas (Ministry of Education) is a well equipped
trade school with a good staff and training facilities such as classrooms,
workshops, laboratories, library, teach.ing material, visual aids, etc. It
has the following Departments: Applied Arts, Construction, Commerce, Hotei
Keeping and Catering, Mathematics, Science and Related Studies. It provides
two types of courses: full-time day courses for young people and evening
courses for adults. Several courses in building trades and construction
such as: electrical, mechanical, sheet metal, automobile repair, carpentry,



ANNEX 12
Page 3
masonry, plumbing and welding trades are of relevance for the Department of
Water and Sewerage. Although this college teaches the technical basis for
the water supply operative personnel, its courses are not tailored in accor-
dance with the task analysis for the different technical jobs existing in the
Department of Water and Sewerage.
6.        The Public Service Training Center (under Prime Minister's Office)
prepares people for government careers. It could be of great help in the
training of first and second managerial level personnel (technicians and
supervisors) of the Department of Water and Sewerage, if its courses were
tailored for them. Its staff consists of high level professionals (sociolo-
gists, psychologists and international consultants). All courses offered
are short term. Many of them are adapted from the "Training within Industry"
method.
7.        The Water and Sewerage Department possesses very limited training
facilities: a classroom and some teaching equipment for the training of
operative personnel. Additional facilities are needed as described below.
Training Organization Recommended
8.        Training Unit:  To be effective training must be carefully and
centrally controlled. It must have an effective administrative structure and
a training function which can be systematically developed. The training of
in-service "trainees" will permit the profitable operation of the Training
Unit. For identification of manpower requirements of the WSC, the Training
Unit should be in charge of:
-    measurement of current availability of departmental manpower,
including the number and categories of personnel, task speci-
fications and mobility;
-    inventory of training institutions and of their training
capacity;
-    estimate of future manpower requirements and of education
and training needs in the light of plans proposed by the WSC.
9.        The Training Unit should adopt the basic principles of organized
training which consist of taking the following steps:
-    job analysis to determine the skills and knowledge required
to carry out any operation or group of operations leading
to the preparation of a skills analysis;
-    selection and evaluation of candidates for managerial and
engineering training;



ANNEX 12
Page 4
preparation of training manuals and other teaching materials
for each operation or group of operations;
preparation of a training course, which will be in two parts:
(a) off-the-job training by a qualified instructor in a
training Center/College; (b) on-the-job training under the
guidance of a trained supervisor; and
-    preparation of an overall scheme of training which will
provide for the continuous development of the employee so
that he can steadily increase the number of operations
which he is competent to carry out.
10.       Chief Training Officer:  The Training Unit should be under the
responsibility of a Chief Training Officer. The Chief Training Officer should
have a senior grade and engineering and management experience.
11.       Instructors:  It is difficult to recruit instructors from the ranks
of existing waterworks staff. However they can be easily recruited from the
College of Bahamas and the Public Service Training Center to perform both
in-service training and off-the-job training.
12.       Methodology:  It is recommended that the methodology of the in-
service training/on-job training be based on modules of employable skills.
These modules should be designed in accordance with a careful analysis of
the skill requirements within an existing occupation. They should be built
up from a variable pattern of self contained teaching units which will pro-
vide the workers with the skills ancl knowledge required to carry out a useful
function within the occupation.
13.       Teaching Materials and Teaching Equipment:  Manuals should be com-
piled from the job analysis. They should be simple and profusely illustrated.
They should provide basic technical information. Audio-visual aids, parti-
cularly films and slides, are recommended for training any type of sub-
professional employee. The teaching, equipment for training sub-professional
personnel is the operational equipment existing in the wellfields, pumping
plants, distribution mains, etc., or in the Authority's Department Central
Store.
Training Assistance Needs
14.  (a)  Assignment of a Training Specialist.  A training specialist expert
to assist in the establishment of the Training Unit and for train-
ing of the Chief Training Officer should be assigned to the WSC.
Taking into consideration The Bahamas' membership in the British
Commonwealth and the proposed administrative organization of the
WSC, a training specialist from the Water Supply Industry Training
Board of the United Kingdom is recommended. The specialist should
have experience in developing vocational training programs in water



ANNEX 12
Page 5
supply and sewerage including the organization of in-service
and off-job training. He should possess a university educa-
tion with sanitary engineering degree or equivalent and ex-
perience in the training of water supply and sewerage sub-
professional personnel. He should be responsible to assist
in the establishment of overall programs of the Training Unit
and to assist in training at the Department level.
(b) Fellowships. A 6-month fellowship for the Chief Training
Officer in the Water Supply Industry Training Board of the
United Kingdom is recommended. The fellowship program should
be designed by the training specialist in collaboration with
the General Manager and the Water Supply Industry Training
Board of the United Kingdom.
(c) Scholarships. Four-year scholarships for 2 qualified candidates
to study administration and management and for 2 qualified can-
didates to study civil engineering with a sanitary option will
be established. Alternatively, students already enrolled in
management and engineering courses will be given an opportunity
to compete for these scholarships. One-year scholarships for
2 qualified candidates for graduate study in sanitary engineer-
ing and for 2 to study administration at recognized universities
will also be established.
(d) Equipment. The technical assistance and fellowship program
should be supplemented with materials and supplies such as:
-    Audiovisual aids to instruction (films, slides, etc.);
-    Projectors (movie and slide);
-    Ilanuals, books, etc.;
-    Vehicles.
(e) Budget. The cost of the program including contingencies is
estimated at about US$400,000.
Description of the Government Inputs
15.  (a)  Chief Training Officer.  A Chief Training Officer, preferably a
Bahamian engineer, should be appointed head of the Training Unit.
He should be the counterpart to the training specialist and should
have senior status in WSC.
(b) Instructors. Instructors should be provided as appropriate. All
appointments should be arranged in accordance with the training
needs.



ANNEX 12
Page 6
(c)  Administrative Support.  Adequate administrative personnel should
be provided for the effective functioning of the Training Unit,
such as administrative assistant, stenographer, typists, etc.
(d)  Equipment and Facilities.  Existing operational equipment such
as tools, pumps, pipes, taps, meters, etc., should be made
available as needed for the training program.
(e)  Classrooms.  Adequate space and utilities would be provided
in the Department.

ANNEX 15

THE BAHAMAS
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT FOR NEW PROVIDENCE ISLAND
THE WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
THE ENVIRONMENT SECTOR
Interdependence of Environment and Economy
1.        While the project is primarily for water supply, with a minor sani-
tary sewerage component, it forms part of a wider national program. This
appraisal has considered the impact and relationship of other environmental
factors on the public health, economy and general quality of life in the
Bahamas and on New Providence in particular. There is, especially on an
island of limited area, a high degree of interdependence between water supply,
health services, sanitation and urban renewal.
Effect of Water Supply on Tourism
2.        The tourist industry is the economic life blood of the Bahamas.  In
recent years visitor-related activities have been responsible for between 75
and 80 percent of gross national product. The effort to attract tourists has
been highly successful, but it should not be overlooked that the Bahamas are
in competition with other Caribbean resorts and Florida for tourist favor.
People seeking relaxation and recreation are not likely, at the prices charged,
to be sympathetic and understanding about an intermittent water supply. If
New Providence develops a reputation for chronic stoppages of water service,
the tourist industry will lose ground to its competition.
Urban Renewal
3.        A survey by the Department of Physical Planning in the Ministry of
Development found that on the basis of the 1970 census, about 47% of the
population of New Providence lived in depressed areas without adequate water
service and without sanitary sewers. Disposal of human waste in the depressed
areas is by exterior privy, many of which serve more than one house. Most
are in a state of extreme dilapidation and sanitary neglect. They are subject
to flooding during rains with cesspool contents floating to the surface.
The major portion of reported communicable diseases such as the dysenteries,
hepatitis and typhoid are from the depressed areas. Even a small number'of
typhoid fever cases can receive wide international publicity and seriously
decrease tourism for a number of years. Until a rehabilitation of these
can be carried out, the Ministry of Health should maintain its vigilance
through its health certification program (see para. 10).
4.        The Government has recognized the needs to carry out an urban re-
newal program in these depressed areas. The houses are of low value flimsy



ANNEX 15
Page 2
construction, randomly placed, and without access to streets. It is con-
sidered impractical to invest the necessary sums to provide them with modern
water supply, sanitary facilities and sewers. Accordingly the Government has
obtained the assistance of a UNDP team of experts to prepare a staged program
with plans and cost estimates tc improve the housing and redevelop the area.
The study will cost US$426,000 and take 3 years.
Beach Pollution Surveillance
5.        The beautiful beaches, and the pristine clear off-shore water of
the Bahamas, are its most important natural assets. It is necessary to main-
tain them in prime condition and remove any threat of pollution. At present
the only serious direct source of pollution is in Nassau Harbor from the large
number of cruise ships that dock there. The project provides for an inter-
ceptor sewer to collect the ship discharges. Some pollution also no doubt
exists in the yacht basins on both New Providence and Paradise Islands. The
control of discharges from hundreds of private cruisers and sailboats will
perhaps be possible by regulation. Any future threat to the purity of the
beaches is not likely to come from direct discharges into the sea, but from
the custom of disposing raw sewage through deep injection wells. The largest
of these wells has been operated by the Department of Water and Sewerage at
Malcolm's Park on the Nassau waterfront for several years. So far there is
no evidence of pollution caused by this operation and an effort to trace the
movement of the injected sewage with fluorescein dye was not successful.
There are a considerable number of other sewage injection wells operated by
hotels, apartment buildings and private establishments along the beaches.
Because there is no visible pollution from these sources, no regular
surveillance of their operation has been organized. The danger lies both
in the probability that eventually the injection wells will clog up causing
sewage to flow out on the surface and the possible free movement of sewage
through a rock fissure to the sea. The Water and Sewerage Department plans
to make further tests with radioactive particles, whose life expentancy is
substantially greater than the dye, and whose movements can be readily traced.
Pollution of Fresh Water Lenses
6.        A considerable number of deep sewage injection wells are also
operated inland in connection with sewage treatment plants and various private
systems. These are not located in close proximity to any of the operating
wellfields and there is no visible evidence of pollution reaching these
important water resources. However, since there is no surveillance of the
injection wells, no effort made to trace the underground movement of sewage,
and no bacteriological examination made of wellfield water before chlorina-
tion, such evidence is not conclusive. Another potential source of pollution
both to wellfields and private wells is from the dumping of solid wastes at
Big Pond. The radioactive tracer program will also provide data for solu-
tion of this problem.



ANNEX 15
Page 3
Water Supply Component
7.        A safe and adequate water supply is the first line of defense in
the environment battle. New Providence at present does not have an adequate
supply. The supply is subject to the risks inherent in intermittent supply,
shortage of professional operating staff and dependence on imported chlorine
for disinfection. In addition, the water supply of a very large segment of
the population is highly vulnerable to pollution because it is carried in
open receptacles from public standpipes. The execution of the project,
described in Chapter 3, and in more detail in Annex 1, together with fulfill-
ment of its attendant organizational changes, will provide the high water
supply capacity initially to better serve the poor, and subsequently the less
costly distribution system can be extended for individual connections. It
will also eliminate the intermittent service.
Sanitary Sewerage Component of the Environment Sector
8.        The satisfaction of a modern water supply demand creates a parallel
volume of waste water the proper disposal of which is as important for the
protection of the environment as the supply itself. The effluent from the
sanitary sewer systems on New Providence Island (see Annex I for more detailed
descripticn) is disposed of underground without treatment and with no apparent
environmental damage. The major areas where potentially dangerous sewage
pollution occurs are in Nassau Harbor from the discharges of cruise ships and
in the depressed areas from overflowing cesspools. The Nassau-System will be
rehabilitated as part of the project and pollution will be removed from the
harbor by an interceptor sewer to the wharves. These are vital public health
measures since the areas affected are heavily frequented by practically all
residents and tourists. Elimination of the serious pollution problem in
the depressed areas and the water supply improvements, can be undertaken with
the urban renewal program in the future.
Solid Waste Disposal
9.        The collection and disposal of solid wastes on New Providence
Island is the responsibility of the Departmental Services of the Ministry of
Health. It is operated by a small untrained staff and a recently appointed
sanitary engineer. No fees and charges are made for the collection and
disposal services. To collect the wastes, a fleet of 24 trucks is used,
5 of which are in poor condition. The island is divided into 14 collection
districts which receive service once a week. The dock, commercial, restaurant
and hotel areas receive service daily or several times a week. In spite of
this systematic collection there is considerable littering and indiscriminate
dumping on New Providence. Disposal is by means of trenching and covering
with earth at Big Pond, close to the most densely populated part of Nassau.
The operation is poorly organized and supervised. Fly and rodent breeding
are often rampant and there are frequent fires.  It is estimated that about
125 to 150 tons of refuse per day reach the disposal area and that the site
will be exhausted in 5 years. Under the auspices of PAHO/UNDP a solid wastes
expert is preparing a study dealing with the collection, disposal, management,
