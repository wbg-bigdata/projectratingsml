REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BAHAMAS WATER AND SEWERAGE CORPORATION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE BAHAMAS
FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Bahamas Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC) with the guarantee
of The Bahamas for the equivalent of US$10.0 million to help finance a water
supply and sewerage project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, includ-
ing three years of grace, with interest at 8.90% per annum. Parallel financing
amounting to US$9.24 million would be provided by the Caribbean Development
Bank (CDB) and commercial banks.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report (No. 390a-BM) entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of The Bahamas" was distributed to the Executive Directors on
June 3, 1974. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I to this report. A
small Bank mission visited The Bahamas in December 1975 to update our informa-
tion on the economy, giving particular attention to the fiscal position of the
country, bearing in mind that the proposed water supply and sewerage project
would require a substantial amount of domestic financing. Based on the
findings of this recent mission, a summary of the economic situation and
prospects appears below.
3.        In many respects the Bahamian economy occupies a very special posi-
tion amongst developing countries. Overshadowed by the massive presence of
its neighbor, the United States of America, The Bahamas has sought to capital-
ize on its unique position by an open-door policy with respect to foreign
capital, tourism and commerce. Capital inflows from abroad, attracted by the
promotional activity of both government and private groups, underpinned an
average annual growth rate in GDP of 12% throughout the 1960s. By 1972, The
Bahamas had achieved a level of GNP per capita of about $2,240 and by 1975
this had increased to $2,600 (in current dollars), which is among the highest
in the Western Hemisphere. Within the special context of the Bahamian economy,
however, the conventional definition of GNP may be a misleading indicator of
living standards. Some 15% of the population consists of foreign residents,
with a large number of them occupying top management positions in banking,
insurance, real estate and tourism businesses. Foreigners receive 30% of the
country's personal disposable income, and only the balance of 70% goes
to the Bahamian population. Moreover, the cost of living is exceptionally
high in The Bahamas so that money incomes are a poor indicator of living
standards. It has been estimated that, due in part to a high level of
import duties, and in part to a high level of transport and distribution
costs, the price of essential consumer goods is 50% higher in Nassau than

in Washington, D.C. Taking these factors into consideration, a figure of
US$1,200 per capita in 1972 would probably reflect more accurately the pur-
chasing power of Bahamians.
4.        The Bahamas has been precluded from entering the Caribbean Common
Market and the wider Caribbean Community (CARICOM) by virtue of its special
open-door policies with respect to international commerce and by virtue of its
traditional status as a "tax-haven". Yet although The Bahamas is not involved
in the mainstream of the Caribbean integration movement, it nevertheless main-
tains close contact with other countries of the Commonwealth Caribbean and
participates in some regional institutions the most important of which is the
CDB. It would appear from the present perspective, however, that The Bahamas
will continue to structure the main thrust of its development policy with a
view to the world beyond the Caribbean including, particularly, the United
States.
5.        Of overriding importance to the development of The Bahamas has been
its proximity to the U.S. Ease of access to the excellent beaches and benign
climate of The Bahamas prompted tourists to visit the islands in increasing
numbers throughout the sixties and tourism became established as the dominant
sector of the economy, accounting directly or indirectly for 77% of GNP. More
than 80% of tourists have always come from the United States so that the indus-
try is particularly sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy and the recent
recession has had its impact. In recent years, the tourist sector has also
suffered from high labor costs and from management difficulties, but it never-
theless remains the major avenue for growth in The Bahamas. A large tourism
potential still exists, but its development hinges upon a satisfactory provi-
sion of basic infrastructure services to the tourist sector. In this respect,
there can be no doubt that the present severe water shortage in New Providence
Island constitutes a major obstacle to further growth and, if it is allowed to
continue and become more serious,even the maintenance of the present level of
tourism would be jeopardized.
6.         Proximity to the United States has also played an important part in
the large-scale development of banking and other offshore financial services.
Financial institutions have frequently located in Nassau in order to be close
to the North American market, while at the same time not being subject to U.S.
financial regulations and restrictions. Equally important for the development
of this sector, however, has been the stable local political climate, the gov-
ernment's tax-haven policy, relative freedom from exchange control regulations
and legal safeguards to protect the confidentiality of financial transactions.
The bouyancy of this sector during the early 1970's undoubtedly helped to sus-
tain the Bahamian economy at a critical time when tourism was flagging all over
the Caribbean. On the other hand, the future of this sector is by no means
secure especially in view of the government's restrictive immigration policy
which sometimes makes it difficult for the foreign business community to hire
qualified expatriate personnel. The position of Nassau as a center for off-
shore banking is very sensitive, moreover, to any relaxation of financial
policies by metropolitan countries, and to competition from other states which
may adopt tax haven policies.



- 3 -
7.        In contrast to The Bahamas' well developed service sectors, its
commodity producing sectors are of limited scope. Industry is, for the most
part, capital intensive and export-oriented. There are few linkages with the
rest of the Bahamian economy, with the result that its net contribution to
national income is quite small. Agriculture has only a limited potential not
only because of the high cost of labor but also due to the high cost of land
preparation which has negative implications for the competitive position of
the sector.
8.        At the present time the Bahamian economy is experiencing a period
of transition. The boom years of the sixties have given way to a period
in which GNP is estimated to have declined in real terms by some 9% between
1970 and 1975. The government has been reassessing its development strategy
in recent years, and Bahamianization of the economy has emerged as an impor-
tant policy objective. The public sector is expanding rapidly and is actively
participating in many branches of the economy which have hitherto been the
exclusive reserve of the private sector. In part, this reflects an explicit
attempt on the part of the government to shape the future course of the
country's development. Thus, for example, the establishment of a national
airline in 1973 reflects a determination to incorporate the outer islands
into the mainstream of Bahamian development by providing them with a regular
and reliable transport link to New Providence Island. Similarly, the recent
measure to establish a Development Bank is in accord with the emerging new
development strategy.
9.        Direct government participation in the economy accelerated when, as
a result of economic recession, a number or private sector enterprises found
themselves in difficulties. In order to prop up employment, the government felt
obliged to buy three large expatriate-owned hotels which threatened to go into
liquidation in late 1974. As a result, the government is now a major partici-
pant in the tourist industry, owning 20% of the hotel rooms in Nassau/Paradise
Island. The public sector has also acquired assets in agriculture with the
purchase in early 1975 of a large chicken and dairy farm on the island of
Eleuthera -- another operation which was salvaged by the government to avert
the threat of liquidation. It is planned that an Agricultural Corporation will
be established within the public sector to manage the Eleuthera farm, and to
implement a plan of action with respect to the government's declared objective
of increasing food production in The Bahamas.
10.       The recent government initiatives mentioned above, together with the
costs of water and sewerage development which the country must provide to main-
tain its tourist trade, have significant implications for the public finances.
In order to be able to support an investment program of the scale presently
contemplated, it has been estimated that public sector savings should attain
a level equivalent to at least 4% of GNP during the next few years. This com-
pares with an annual level of rather less than 2% in the previous five-year
period.



-4-
11.       The government finances have come under considerable pressure in
recent years as a result of the slackening pace of economic activity in The
Bahamas. A heavy dependence upon import duties (which account for between
50 and 60% of central government recurrent revenues) makes the fiscal situa-
tion particularly sensitive to changes in the external account. In 1975, the
yield of import duties actually declined in nominal terms because of the much
lower level of imports. The fiscal situation has been kept in hand only by
virtue of the government's tradition of restraint and discipline in controlling
recurrent expenditures. Since 1972 the recurrent expenditures of the central
government have risen by only 8.8% annually which, when set against a rate of
inflation averaging 9.6% annually, is indicative of a falling level of current
expenditures in real terms. However, the current income of the central govern-
ment has risen at an even slower pace (some 6.7% annually in nominal terms)
over this same period so that the surplus of the central government on current
account has been steadily eroded.
12.       A number of new tax measures were introduced in the 1976 budget with
a view to consolidating the fiscal situation. These included removal of the
preferential (lower) rate of duty on imports from Commonwealth countries, es-
tablishment of a business license fee, higher fees for alien work permits, and
some new property taxes. The additional revenue from these new sources should
more than offset the anticipated 18% increase in wages and salaries of govern-
ment employees so that central government savings are expected to improve sig-
nificantly over 1975. Assuming that the government continues its prudent fiscal
policies it is projected that central government savings will average 2% of GDP
over the next quinquenium.
13.       Other public sector institutions have an even greater potential than
the central government for generating savings in the medium-term future, how-
ever. Of particular importance in this respect is the recently established
National Insurance Fund (NIF) which has already extended health and social
security coverage to all the employed work force and will soon embrace also
the selfemployed. The NIF generated a surplus on current account of more than
B$10 million in 1975 and should continue to generate surpluses of a greater
magnitude in the medium-term future. With this in mind, and viewing the
public sector as a whole, it is projected that public sector savings may
average close to 5% of GNP over the period through 1980 even without any major
change in the government's basic philosophy with respect to taxation.
14.       The ability of the public sector to generate an adequate level of
savings is closely related to the strength of the external account and, in
particular to the performance of the tourism industry. Between 1972 and 1975
the volume of tourism, as measured by the number of tourist arrivals adjusted
by the length of stay, declined and the rise in tourist expenditures per day
did not keep pace with inflation. This was probably the most important single
factor contributing to the squeeze on the Bahamian economy in recent years. A
flagging tourism sector was reflected in a declining trend of retained imports
which, prior to 1975, was masked by a high level of imports associated with



- 5 -
major sector investments in oil refining and transshipment facilities. In 1975,
however, after the completion of these major investment projects, the low level
of domestic demand was clearly revealed in a 25% decline in the nominal value
of retained imports within the space of one year.
15.       Prospects for tourism in 1976 and beyond are encouraging.     The
economic recovery of the US is likely to be a key factor in this respect.
Preliminary figures for the first quarter of the year suggest that stopover
tourist arrivals may reach 950,000 in 1976 compared with only 902,000 in 1975.
This would indicate a reversal of the declining trend of stopover tourist
arrivals during the previous three years. Even more encouraging is the appa-
rent jump in daily tourist expenditures to $57 compared with $48 in the
corresponding period of 1975. Hotels have raised their prices significantly
after several years of comparatively stable rates and it appears that the
volume of tourism is not suffering. A recovery of tourism will probably re-
sult in a higher level of imports during 1976 both to service the tourist
sector and to supply a reflated level of domestic expenditure. A small
deficit on the balance of payments is projected for 1976 but this can easily
be accommodated by the existing level of foreign exchange reserves which, at
end 1975, were sufficent to cover 3.8 months imports.
16.       Provided economic recovery in the US continues smoothly it would
appear that the current cautious optimism of the Bahamian tourist industry is
well founded. An additional impetus may be given to the growth of tourism in
the medium term by new regulations of the US Civil Aviation Board which will
permit a significant expansion of low priced charter flights. In these cir-
cumstances it is projected that revenues from tourism may grow at 4-5% per
annum in real terms in the longer run if the present water crisis on New Provi-
dence Island is resolved and if the tourism potential of the outer islands is
fully exploited. The achievement of this target should provide sufficient
foreign exchange earnings to underpin a growth in GNP of about 3% per annum.
17.       External public debt increased from about US$23 million in 1968 to
US$70 million in 1974, but it is still quite low by the standards of many
developing countries. The debt service ratio is estimated at slightly less
than 3% of exports and nonfactor services and is projected to remain in the
3-4% range on the assumption that foreign private capital will continue to
finance a major part of investment in the future. However, given the openness
of the economy, other indicators may prove to be more significant in assessing
the ability to repay the external debt of the economy. The debt service is
about 20% of gross national savings, and 10% of 1974 government tax revenues.
All of these indicators point to a manageable debt situation that should not
present problems in the foreseeable future provided the Bahamian authorities
continue to pursue sound policies which stimulate growth in an environment of
relative stability and provided public sector management yields savings
equivalent to 4% of GNP.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE BAHAMAS
18.       The Bahamas became a Bank member in 1973.    The proposed water supply
and sewerage project would be the first Bank lending operation in this new
member country. Despite The Bahamas' high per capita income, there are
special circumstances which justify Bank assistance. As already noted,
the national income data tend to substantially overstate the level of economic
and social development of the mass of the population. Furthermore, the
economy rests on a narrow and very vulnerable base. The tourism sector--
which accounts directly or indirectly for 77% of GNP--is treatened by water
shortage and inadequate sewerage facilities on New Providence Island. There
is a danger that pollution of water and beaches could result in epidemic
disease which would seriously disrupt the tourism industry. Even short of
such a catastrophe, the present water shortage is a cause of hardship for the
local population as well as tourists. The government has tried to maintain a
steady water supply to the hotels at the cost of sacrifice by local popula-
tion, but for some time, hotels in Nassau have periodically been subject to
water rationing. Unless remedial action is taken the situation will deterior-
ate resulting in tourist dissatisfaction and a fall in tourist arrivals. An
expansion of tourist trade in Nassau, which is the main tourist center,
requires a speedy resolution of the inadequate water supply and water pollu-
tion problem.
19.       The proposed project is a major undertaking which, in terms of size
and complexity, outstrips any public investment previously undertaken by the
Bahamian government. In addition to making a relatively modest contribution
to total project costs, the Bank would play a particularly valuable role in
assisting the government in dealing with a variety of technical, organizational
and financial issues which the execution of an integrated investment will en-
tail over the next few years. The overall costs of the project will neces-
sarily be high and its implementation will require major institutional improve-
ments and policy changes on the part of the government. The Bank has already
lent support to the government in establishing an important new institution,
the Bahamas Water and Sewerage Corporation (WSC). The Bank has also supported
government efforts to secure adequate financial resources for the project both
in The Bahamas, through better mobilization of domestic savings, and also from
abroad, through contacts with potential bilateral and international
lenders.
20.       Looking beyond the proposed project, The Bahamas will need to improve
and expand its water supply system to meet increasing demand and at the same
time further improve and extend its sewerage facilities. This will entail a
considerable financing requirement; however, it is expected that, once the
base is firmly laid with the assistance of the proposed Bank project, the
government--with financial support from other lenders--will be able to carry
out the program without direct Bank involvement and lending. We do not plan,
therefore, to have further lending in The Bahamas in the near future in this
or any other sector.



7-
PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
21.       The Bahamas consists of 29 major islands and close to 700 cays
with a total land area of 5,380 square miles and a total population of about
205,000 (1975). The island of New Providence, where Nassau is located,
accounts for only 1.5% of the country's total land area, but for some 60% of
the country's total population. New Providence has a population density of
about 1,268 persons per square mile, one of the highest in the Caribbean. In
addition, about 65% of the one million or more tourists who visit The Bahamas
each year stay on New Providence Island where tourism infrastructure is well
developed. Andros Island, about 25 nautical miles to the west of New
Providence Island, has low population density (3.8 persons per square mile)
and is endowed with rich underground water resources. Hydrological investiga-
tions have demonstrated that groundwater reserves capable of producing in
excess of 60.0 million gallons per day (MGD) are available on Andros Island.
22.       There are no rivers or freshwater lakes on the islands and water
is obtained mostly by tapping the underground reservoirs formed by seepage of
rainwater through the limestone crust of the land surface. On New Providence
Island, the supply from groundwater sources is inadequate and a flash-type
distillation plant has been in operation since August 1972. The present water
demand is about 5.2 MGD. The well fields have been producing about 4.0 MGD
but only by pumping beyond the safe yield resulting in increased salinity.
Owing to frequent shutdowns, the desalination plant has never reached (on an
annual basis) its annual average rated capacity of 2.0 MGD, and currently
yields only about 1.2 MGD. The water supply problem of New Providence has
been aggravated by very high percentage (48%) of water whose use is un-
accounted for, due to distribution leaks and malfunctioning meters. A recent
leak detection survey, located leaks of about 750,000 gallons per day, and
these are being repaired. Thus, the actual supply sold to consumers in 1975
was limited to about 2.7 MGD (as compared with a production level of 5.2 MGD).
The shortfall in the supply has resulted in the maintenance of low system
pressures and severe rationing. With a growth in water demand of 3 to 4% per
year and a decrease in supply from the overpumped well fields, there will be a
widening gap between supply and demand unless supplementary sources of water
are developed.
23.       The Nassau sewerage system, built in 1928, is in an advanced state
of deterioration. Potentially dangerous sewage pollution occurs in Nassau
Harbor from sewerage discharged by cruise ships. The low-income areas of
Nassau (accounting for about 47% of the population) are unsatisfactorily
served by exterior privies. Considering that a large number of the inhabi-
tants of the low-income areas are employed in tourist service and food hand-
ling jobs, the risk to the health of visitors as well as Bahamians is serious.
Rehabilitation of these low-income areas is needed to reduce the health
hazards. Towards this end, the government, with the assistance of UNDP, is
preparing a pilot program for urban redevelopment which should be ready within
the next two years.



- 8 -
24.       Solid waste disposal is by means of trenching and covering with
earth at Big Pond, close to the most densely populated parts of Nassau. There
is a risk of beach pollution and pollution of freshwater lenses from deep
sewage injection wells. The Ministry of Public Works and Utilities has been
trying without success to trace the movement of the injected sewage with
fluorescein dye and will make further tests with radioactive particles, whose
life expectancy is substantially greater than the dye, and whose movement can
be readily traced. Under the auspices of PAHO/UNDP, a solid waste disposal
expert is completing a study dealing with the collection and disposal of the
solid waste; the findings will guide the Ministry of Health to improve these
services.
25.       Until recently, the Water and Sewerage Department of the Ministry of
Public Works and Utilities was the principal agency responsible for the pro-
vision of water supply and sewerage services to New Providence and the outer
islands. The Department, which formed part of the Civil Service structure,
suffered from acute shortages of well-trained staff at the management and
technical levels; it also operated at a financial loss and without having
to meet stated financial objectives. The recently established Water and
Sewerage Corporation (WSC), a statutory corporation, has taken over the
functions of the Water and Sewerage Department, and will opelate as a finan-
cially viable entity.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The project, identified and prepared bv the Bahamian authorities
with the help of consultants and the Bank staff, is designed: (i) to provide
water supply to New Providence to meet its needs through 1983; (ii) to rehab-
ilitate the existing sanitary sewer system in old Nassau; (iii) to construct a
new sewer line to Prince George's Wharf designed to collect the sewage from
cruise ships; and (iv) to extend technical assistance to the WSC so as to
have the entity to function on a sound financial, technical and managerial
basis. The project was appraised in June 1975. Negotiations for the proposed
loan were held in Washington in March 1976. The government's delegation was
led by Mr. Reginald Wood, Permanent Secretary, linistry of Finance. A report
entitled "The Bahamas - Appraisal of the Water Supply and Sewerage Project
for New Providence Island" is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. The main features of the loan and the project are summarized
in Annex III of this report, and maps of the project are appended thereto.
Project Components
27.       The main components of the proposed project are:



- 9-
Water Supply to New Providence
(i)  a water conservation program Including metering improvement,
leak detection and, where necessary, repairs, to reduce
unaccounted-for water from the present 48% to 20% by 1978;
(ii)  an interim program to develop water resources on Andros
Island and transport up to 3.0 MGD of water from Andros to
New Providence (25 nautical miles) by end of 1976, using
a combination of tugs/barges;
(iii)  an expanded Andros to New Providence water program requiring
dredging works at Morgan's Bluff Harbor (Andros) and using
shallow draft tankers, to provide an additional 2.0 to 4.0 MGD
of water by the end of 1977;
(iv)  ground storage reservoirs of approximately 30 million gallons'
total capacity to meet seasonal peak loads and provide for
supply interruptions from Andros;
(v)  an automation program to improve operation of the well fields
in New Providence; and
(vi)  rehabilitation of the existing desalination plant at Blue Hills
(New Providence).
Sanitary Sewerage System of Nassau
(i)  reconstruction of deteriorated portions of existing trunk mains
and connecting laterals;
(ii)  replacement of pipelines, manholes, pumps and controls of
obsolete pumping stations; and
(iii)  construction of a 12-inch line from the rebuilt Bay Street
trunk sewer to Prince George's Wharf and the necessary
collecting sumps, and pumping equipment to receive sewage
discharged from cruise ships.
Engineering
(i) leak detection survey of the entire water distribution net-
work (completed in March 1976);
(ii) distribution network analysis and storage requirement study;
(iii) well field design and construction supervision;



- 10 -
(iv) design and construction supervision of transmission lines,
pumping equipment and other shore facilities on Andros and
New Providence as needed for the delivery and reception on
the two islands;
(v) dock and harbor improvements; and
(vi) design and construction supervision of the sanitary sewerage
component.
Technical Assistance
(i) establishment of a training unit for the WSC for staff
training (including in particular professional staff).
Project Execution
28.       The WSC would execute the project over a two-year period and will
appoint a Project Manager who would be responsible for project execution.
Engineering design related to water supply, sewerage and shipping would be
prepared by consultants under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
29.       The cost of the project (net of duties and taxes but including con-
tingencies) is estimated at about US$32.0 million. The proposed Bank loan of
US$10.0 million would finance 46.5% of the foreign exchange costs estimated
at US$21.5 million, or less than a third of the total project costs. Most of
the balance of the foreign costs would be financed by external loans totalling
US$9.24 million under parallel financing arrangements. The latter would con-
sist of two parts: (a) The CDB Board has approved a loan from the CDB's
Venezuela Trust Fund of US$3.24 million for 20 years inlcuding three years'
grace at 8% interest per annum, 3/4% per annum commitment fee and a manage-
ment fee of 3% payable during the first four years of the loan; (b) A consor-
tium of private banks in The Bahamas has agreed to participate with a loan of
US$6.0 million for ten years including three years of grace, at 2% interest
per annum over the London Interbank Offer (LIBO) rate adjustable every six
months plus a 1/4% commission paid in advance and a commitment fee of 1/2%.
The participating banks are: The Bank of Nova Scotia, The Royal Bank of
Canada, The Bank of Montreal, The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Barclays
International, and The City Bank, each to provide US$1.0 million loan to the
Corporation on approximately similar terms. The execution of the agreements
for the CDB and private bank loans would be additional conditions of effect-
iveness of the Bank loan (draft Loan Agreement, Sec. 7.01). The CDB loan
would be used to finance the development of water resources on Andros Island
and the study for developing Morgans Bluff Harbor. The Bank loan would be
used to finance mainly the developments on New Providence Island (the items
mentioned in paragraph 32 below). Remaining project costs estimated at 12.8
million would be financed by a government cash equity contribution of US$4.4



million and a government loan of US$6.6 million to the WSC (for 20 years
including 3 years of grace, at 9-1/4% interest), and WSC's internally generated
revenues (US$1.8 million).
Term of Bank Loan
30.       Although loans to high-income countries (i.e., those whose per
capita GNP was above $850 in 1972) do not normally exceed 15 years, a 20-year
term is recommended for the proposed loan in view of the special project
and country circumstances involved. The project entails an extremely large
and "lumpy" investment for so small a country as The Bahamas, and the servic-
ing of the loans required for its financing will pose a heavy cash drain on
WSC, while significantly adding to The Bahamas' external debt service burden.
These problms are exacerbated by the fact that the term of the commercial
bank financing is relatively short for such a project. A Bank loan of 20
years would not only significantly ease the debt-service problem, but would
also be consistent with the character of the project. About 90% of the assets
to be financed out of the proposed loan would have an estimated life in excess
of 25 years; in fact, a good portion of the assets, i.e., the reservoirs, sewer
and water lines, and harbor installations, could have a life of over 50 years.
Procurement
31.       All equipment and supplies to be financed out of the Bank loan would
be procured through international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines. In the evaluation of bids local manufacturers will be
accorded the usual margin of domestic preference (15% of the c.i.f. price of
such goods if the customs duties exceed 15% of the c.i.f. price of such
goods). Contracts for civil works exceeding US$500,000 will be awarded after
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank's Guidelines.
Contracts for civil works not exceeding US$500,000 for each contract and a
type for which there are at least three competent Bahamian contractors avail-
able may be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and
in accordance with procurement procedures that are satisfactory to the Bank.
Submission of bids by international contractors on contracts advertised
locally would not be precluded. All contracts are reviewed, and approved by
the goverment's Tenders Board, and, if the value exceeds B$250,000, approval
rests with the Cabinet.
Disbursement
32.       The Bank loan would be disbursed over a three-year period against:
(i) 100% of the foreign costs of the imports for the pumping stations, pipe-
lines, leak repairs, metering, and storage facilities to be built in New
Providence Island; (ii) 100% of the foreign costs of the Project Manager and
the consultants' services; and (iii) 20% of the cost of the civil works, and
(iv) 100% of the foreign cost component of the training program. Due to the
urgent need to increase water, the government proceeded to procure essential
equipment for the interim scheme for supply from Andros. It is proposed that
retroactive financing not exceeding $1.0 million be allowed from the proposed
Bank loan for expenditures on consultants, equipment and materials after
October 1, 1975 and before loan signing.

The Borrower
33.       The WSC has taken over the functions of the Water and Sewerage
Department of the Ministry of Works and Utilities relating to New Providence
Island and to Andros Island. The Corporation, a wholly owned government statu-
tory body, is governed by a Board of Directors consisting of the Minister of
Works and Utilities (Chairman), a representative of the Ministry of Finance,
and four directors appointed by the Minister of Works and Utilities. Its
principal officers are the General Manager, Chief Engineer and Chief Controller.
It is expected that, until Bahamians are trained, most of the senior positions
at the WSC will continue to be filled by expatriates. The WSC will give par-
ticular attention to training (including in-service training) of its future
managers and engineers. Training for subprofessional positions will be
secured in cooperation with the local trade schools and the assistance of
consultants. It has been agreed that, within one year of the loan signing,
the WSC will establish a training unit and implement a training program in a
manner and in accordance with a timetable satisfactory to the Bank (ref.
Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement).
34.       The government's billing system at present does not provide a
basis for collecting the necessary statistics for analysis of water usage
data by customer categories. Measures are currently being taken to remedy
this. Data on aging of "accounts receivable" are available, but collection
performance on overdue accounts is less than satisfactory. As of December
31, 1975, about US$2.2 million remained more than 120 days overdue. The WSC
has agreed to take appropriate action by December 31, 1976, to collect these
accounts as they become overdue for payment (Section 5.05 of the Loan Agree-
ment) and hold accounts receivable to four months' billing equivalent. The
Ministry of Works and Utilities conducted its accounting on a cash basis. The
WSC will need assistance in improving its cost control, budgeting, and accrual
accounting systems. WSC will hire accountants or will contract a qualified
firm of chartered accountants to assist it in improving its accounting proce-
dures and will, within one year of loan signing, establish the new systems.
Annual audits of the WSC by certified public accounts will be carried out on a
regular basis (Sections 5.02 and 5.04 of the draft Loan Agreement).
Financial Evaluation
35.       Before the takeover by the WSC, the Water and Sewerage Department
had been incurring financial losses. It is the government's objective that
the new Corporation should attain financial viability with regard to the
provision of water and sewerage services on New Providence Island. Financial
losses on water and sewerage services have been due partly to the excessive
unaccounted-for water losses for which no revenues are received, and partly to
the tariffs which are set too low to reflect the costs of the service. With
the implementation of the leak detection and repair program, it should be
possible to reduce the unaccounted-for water losses from 48% in 1976 to 20% in
1978, and 15% by 1983; this should, in due course, result in increased revenues.



- 13 -
So as to eliminate the operating loss on water and sewerage services for New
Providence Island, which amounted to about $1.0 million in 1974, and approxi-
mately $500,000 in 1975, the government has introduced a 40% tariff increase
with effect from July 13, 1976, and a meter service charge of $1.00 per month.
In the longer term, a 4% rate of return on net operating assets, revalued from
time to time, would be required to provide sufficient revenue for the Corpora-
tion to cover operating expenses, to meet debt service and to make a reasonable
contribution to future investment. To allow a reasonable period for the new
Corporation to establish itself, reduce unaccounted-for water losses and
improve its water and sewerage services, the 4% rate of return would be
achieved progressively by 1981. The government will take all necessary action
to permit the WSA to achieve the specified rates of return (Section 5.06 of
the draft Loan Agreement and Section 2.03 of the draft Financing Agreement).
During 1976 and 1977 the additional revenues needed by the Corporation to meet
its cash requirements will be provided by the government in the form of a
grant. This seems appropriate in view of the unusually high water losses at
this time which it would not be justifiable to ask the consumer to finance.
In addition, the government will provide grant funds to the WSC to cover
any deficit which the Corporation may incur on its water supply and sewerage
services to the Family Islands, which are sparsely populated, largely rural
and poorer areas (Section 2.04 of the draft Financing Agreement).
36.       The present average tariff of $2.99 (water and sewerage) per 1,000
imperial gallons of water sold is based on a three-step water tariff struc-
ture, combined with a complex sewer tariff. The tariff needs to be restruc-
tured, but in order to do this reliable information is required about customer
usage of water. Historical data or water usage by customer category has
become available only recently. However, the leak detection study indicated
that the high current level of unaccounted-for water is due to leaks and
faulty metering plus a substantial quantity of water being delivered through
public stand pipes, but not recorded. The WSC will select six city districts--
two each from low, medium and high-income brackets--to repair and/or replace
existing meters for usage monitoring. When all factors are known and demand
and usage pattern are established, a revised tariff structure could be con-
sidered. It has been agreed that a tariff studv will be completed by June 30,
1977, and its conclusions discussed with the Bank; based on the study a
revised tariff structure will be introduced by January 1, 1978 (Section 5.09
of the draft Loan Agreement).
37.       The debt incurred in the past by the Water and Sewerage Department
for water and sewerage investments would continue to be serviced by the govern-
ment. Prior to the proposed loan Closing Date, the WSC will not make any
investment, other than the carrying out of the project, which would result in
estimated capital expenditures exceeding $500,000 in any fiscal year unless
the Bank is satisfied that such investment or undertaking will not adversely
affect the financial condition of the Borrower or the efficiency of the
Borrower's management and personnel or the carrying out of the project
(Section 5.07 of the draft Loan Agreement).

Project Benefits and Risks
38.       The water shortages and rationing in New Providence have been caus-
ing hardship for the resident population and tourists. Past attempts by the
Department of Water and Sewerage to provide sufficient water to the residents
and the hotels have not been successful and the position is deteriorating as
a result of a growing gap between water supply and demand. Frequent shutdowns
for repairs of the desalination plant has been an aggravating factor. The
height of the tourist season coincides with the dry season in The Bahamas.
In addition, a matter of serious concern is the deteriorating quality of water
owing to increasing salinity of the groundwater, as the pumping rate exceeds
natural replenishment. The natural sources of freshwater in New Providence
have been developed to the limit and increased supply can come only from
desalination, catchment, cloud seeding, or solar evaporation. All of these
techniques require considerable time for development while the need for new
supply is urgent. Independent studies and comparison of alternative tech-
niques indicate clearly that importation of freshwater from Andros Island will
take the shortest time and is the least cost of any alternative. The recon-
struction of the deteriorated portions of existing major sewer lines is essen-
tial for prevention of serious health hazard and damage to the environment.
Construction of a new sewer line to intercept sewage from cruise ships is
justified on similar grounds.
39.       The incremental rate of return on the proposed investment is about
18.0% if benefits are measured by incremental revenue attributable to the
project and financial costs are adjusted for taxes, internal transfers, etc.
Although very difficult to quantify, the external benefits arising from the
project are considerable, since without it the tourist industry would be
seriously affected and this, in turn, would lead to severe losses to the
economy of The Bahamas. In addition, important benefits to public health and
the environment are not reflected in the rate of return. There are no unusual
engineering or technical risks in the implementation of this project. WSC's
lack of experience with ship operations could cause delays in regular supply
of water, but this risk would be minimized by the provision of consultants to
assist and train Bahamians in these operations.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUtMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The Loan Agreement between the Bank and the WSC, the Financing
Agreement and the Guarantee Agreement between The Bahamas and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Special features of the project are highlighted in paragraphs 29, 33, 34,
35, 36 and 37 of this report.



- 15 -
41.       Additional conditions of loan effectiveness are the execution of
the loan agreements between the WSC and the CDB and between the WSC and the
commercial banks for the parallel loans to finance the project (paragraph 29).
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       1 recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
