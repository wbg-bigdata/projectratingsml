MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNA-IONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A IOAN AND CREDIT
TO INDIA FOR THE VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan and
credit to India is submitted for approval. The loan would be for US$30.0
million equivalent and would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace with a standard variable interest rate. The credit, for SDR 189.2
million (US$250.0 million equivalent), would be on standard IDA terms. The
loan and credit would help finance a Vocational Training Project.
2.      Background.  Since 1985, substantial policy reforms undertaken by the
Government of India (GOI) have resulted in significantly higher growth rates in
manufacturing, and above-average performance in the industrial sector. While
GDP growth in 1987/88 is expected to be about 3.6%, mainly due to a severe
drought, industrial growth is expected to reach 6.5%. Growth of manufacturing
has averaged nearly 9% in the last three years, and manufactured exports have
surged in the last two years. This is a significant departure from the 1960s
and 1970s, when the performance of manufacturing did not generate the growth,
employment, and foreign exchange that the economy required.   The recent high
growth rates in manufacturing need to be maintained if India is to achieve the
minimum 5% growth rate which is needed in order to improve living standards,
provide productive employment for the growing labor force, and reduce poverty.
3.      It has also become increasingly evident that the overall quality and
relevance of India's manpower development programs have not kept pace with
recent technological innovations and changing occupational requirements.
Average productivity levels are significantly below those which can be attained
with the newly installed technology, and there are emerging shortfalls in
specialized skill areas such as electronics and computers, especially for semi-
skilled and technician levels.
4.      Higher quality and more relevant training for skilled and semi-skilled
industrial workers is needed to sustain economic growth, and to increase their
prospective lifetime earnings and employability in the organized sector. The
National Vocational Training System (NVTS) provides technical and vocational
training for workers at different levels, which helps to increase their
employment and earnings prospects, while at the same time addressing the issues
of the lew level of industrial productivity and poor quality of manufacturing
output. The proposed project will constitute an important step in assisting
India in its efforts to modernize vocational training, and, ultimately, improve
the productivity of skilled and semi-skilled industrial workers.
5.      Previous Bank Group Experience.  Bank iroup experience in the education
sector has been limited to a Credit (Cr. 342-IN) of US$12 million in FY73 for
support of university-level agricultural education in Delhi, Bihar, and Assam.
The project was implemented over 10 years, compared with 7 years planned at
appraisal, due to: late appointment of staff, shortage of construction
materials, and price disputes with contractors. The Project Performance Audit
Report (No. 5668, dated May 23, 1985), recommended better institutional
assessm *t, more explicit statement of project objectives, and increased



realism in setting conditionality. Apart from the work done on the project
noted above, the Bank Group and the Government have had limited discussions
concerning education and training over the last decade. However, since mid-
1988 a dialogue has been reopened on the education and training sector. In
addition to collaborating on the proposed project, discussions are underway
concerning possible Bank Group assistance for technical education and primary
education.
6.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Bank Group involvement in this project
will promote industrial development by supporting improvements in the quality,
efficiency, and relevance of vocational training for men and women and
increasing access to modern sector skill training for women. High private and
social rates of return to apprenticeship and craftsmen training support further
investments in vocational training. From a distributional and employment-
generation point of view, these investments are also well-justified, as
trainees at these levels tend to come from the lower income groups. The
project should also assist the Government in implementing its program for
improving vocational training and in accelerating and strengthening State
capacity for implementing vocational training investments. Moreover, it will
enhance the focus of concerned authorities on the issues of the long-term
financing of vocational training, recurrent finance for equipment maintenance,
and incentive systems for retaining high quality instructors. The project will
also have a positive impact on the quality of private Industrial Training
Institutes (ITIs) by providing equipment on a grant basis to selected private
ITIs which meet overall minimum performance criteria. The project fits in well
with the Bank Group's country strategy for India which aims to promote
industrial growth and enhance the level of development of India's human
resources.
7.      Prolect Objectives.  The proposed project will be the first in
vocational training in India to be assisted by the Bank Group. Its long-term
objective is to improve the efficiency of industry by providing workers who are
trained in a high quality manner in relevant skill areas. It will seek to
achieve this objective in three ways. First, it will improve the quality and
efficiency of training for craftsmen and apprentices. Second, it will expand
the scope and relevance of advanced skill training programs. Third, it will
strengthen the planning and management of vocational craining at central and
State levels. Toward these aims, it will support the re-equipping and
refurbishing of training institutes, the introduction at training centers of
new trades, the creation of some new training centers in key fields, and the
improved training of teachers for the vocational training system. A special
feature of the project is that it will pay particular attention to promoting
training for women in modern sector and high-tech trades. It will support the
expansion and upgrading of training for women at the craftsmen and advanced
levels, and related teacher training. It will aim over the life of the project
to increase the share of women in these training programs from 5% to 10% and to
have a major impact on enhancing the job prospects for women in emerging growth
fields.



8.      Project Descrigtion.  The project is national in scope and will be
implemented under the overall direction of the Directorate General of
Employment and Training (DGET). The DGET will be solely responsible for
implementing the central training schemes covering the advanced skill training
areas and Central Staff Training and Research Institute management and
instructor training programs. These represent about 40% of the total cost of
project investments. The participating States and Union Territories will be
responsible for implementing the ITI modernization scheme under the guidance of
the DGET, which accounts for about 60% of proposed investments. About 80% of
the ITIs assisted under the project will be located in 15 large states. All
major procurement will be conducted in a centrally guided manner by the DGET on
behalf of, and with appropriate representation from, the States and Union
Territories.
9.     'T'he project will have three major components: (a) modernizing craftsman
and apprenticeship training through re-equipping about 400 selected ITIs and
developing related training systems, extending trade coverage of the National
Apprenticeship Training Scheme at about 24 Bac'c Training Centers and 44
Related Instruction Centers, and increasing women's access to modern sector
training by constructing about 100 new ITIs for women and adding about 19 new
trades in about 72 existing women's ITI wings; (b) expanding the Advanced
Training Programs by establishing about 32 new Advanced Vocational Training
System Centers and extending existing Centers, and developing one new High-
Technology Training Center for electronics, computers and robotics; and (c)
improving NVTS management and planning at the DGET and corresponding State
Directorates of Training through the development of a monitoring and evaluation
system, improving testing and certification processes, reorienting management
and supervisory training, and strengthening research on vocational training.
The estimated project cost is US$429.8 million, including contingencies,
resulting in a proposed IDA credit of US$250.0 million equivalent and a Bank
loan of US$30.0 million equivalent. Retroactive financing of US$10.0 m.^llion
equivalent (or about 4% of the total Credit amount) will be allowed for costs
incurred in purchasing ITI equipment for the start-up period of the project.
The estimated project costs and the financing plan are given in Schedule A.
The procurement method and disbursement schedule are provided in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank operations in
India are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 7530-IN is being distributed separately.
10.     Part of the proposed project vill be carried out in the State of Jammu
and Kashmir, which includes areas over which India and Pakistan have been in
dispute since 1947. In making the proposed loan/credit to India, the Bank does
not intend to prejudice the final determination of the claims of the parties
involved.
11.     Agreed Actions.  During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances that: (a) it will maintain a Central Project Implementation Unit
during the life of the project which will carry out project coordination,
monitoring, supervision, and evaluation; (b) the equipment maintenance system
will be adequately funded and maintained throughout the life of the project;



- 4 -
(c) it will continue under the project its ptlicy of strengthening links
between training institutions and industry through the establishment of local
level advisory boards and the appointment of industry liaison officers for each
Industrial Training Institute assisted under the project; (d) it will review
annually with the Bank Group the project implementation plan for the next year,
including staffing and training plans, evidence of land acquisition and plans
for further acquisitior, and financial, procurement, and construction plans;
(e) it will furnish the Bank Group with studies, performed in accordance with
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank Group of the self-employment schem%
and a sample study of ITI instruction by December 31, 1994; of the application
of accreditation standards by July 31, 1995; and of a tracer study of the
employment of ITI certificate holders by September 30, 1995; and (f) it will
carry out a mid-term review of the project under terms of reference acceptable
to the Bank Group and it will furnish the outcomes of such a review to the Bank
Group for discussion no later than December 31, 1994.
12.     Each State and Union Territory participating in the project must have
submitted a letter of undertaking to GOI covering the implementation,
procurement and coordination arrangements which the States and Union
Territories will be expected to follow. Such letter will also deal with
maintenance of equipment and facilities and provision of progress reports and
will ensure that overall project arrangements are properly executed. Letters
of undertaking must be satisfactory to the Bank Group and their submission to
the Bank Group will be a condition for disbursement in any State and Union
Territory. Twelve States, in which about 50% of the proposed ITI investments
would be made, have already submitted letters of undertaking to the Government
of India and the Bank Group.
13.     Benefits.  The main benefit of the proposed project will be the
provision to the industrial sector of more relevant and better trained skilled
and semi-skilled manpower. The NVTS will also be rejuvenated and more closely
linked to industry and better able to respond to current and projected needs.
The proposed project will also increase modern sector training opportunities
for women. In addition, it will result in a strengthened planning and
management capacity for vocational training, particularly at the State level.
14.     Risks.  The major risk likely to face the project is the potential
delays in implementing a national effort. Other concerns are: (a) the fact
that the MOL has not previously worked with the Bank; (b) the general
inadequacy of industry-training establishment linkages; (c) difficulties in
implementing improved maintenance programs; and (d) constraints on establishing
enhanced incentives for instructional staff. These risks are being addressed
in a number of ways. First, the project builds upon an ongoing GOI sponsored
scheme for the modernization of ITIs. In addition, 40% of the project is under
a single entity. Second, a procurement plan has been prepared and generic
bidding documents were approved during negotiations.  Third, the DGET will have
some flexibility to shift funds from one ITI/State to another based on
implementation performance, which should considerably limit the implementation
delays by any given State on the project as a whole.  The additional risks
mentioned above will be addressed through the implementation of well-prepared
project components aimed directly at improving: monitoring and evaluation,



5- 5 
maintenance, staff incentives, and the strengthening of ITI industrial advisory
boards to improve industry-training establishment linkages.
15.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit will
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and of the Association, and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and credit.
