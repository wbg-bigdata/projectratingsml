Which safeguard policies are triggered, if any? Re$ PAD D.6, TechnicalAnnex 10
Key issues related to the Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies triggered by this
project include environmental impacts such as soil erosion, soil, water and air pollution, loss o f
vegetation; and social impacts such as loss o f land or livelihoods, impacts on public health due to
asbestos removal from facilities to be rehabilitated; and an increase inwater-related diseases due
to standing waters inborrow pitswhich are usedas sources o f constructionmaterials. An
increase insolid andliquidwastes would further exacerbate the afore-mentioned impacts.

OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment

To enable project implementersto identify and mitigate potential environmental and social
impacts, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was developed bythe
Borrower and cleared with IDA and the local stakeholders.

OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement

To enable project implementers to mitigatepotential social impacts due to landacquisition, the
Borrower has prepared a Resettlement PolicyFramework (RPF), which outlines the principles
andprocedures to be followed inthe event that land acquisitionis required. The RPFwas
developedby the Borrower and cleared with IDA and the local stakeholders.

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE

1. Country andsector issues

Malawi remains one o f the poorest countries inthe world with an income o f approximately
US$170 (2003) per capita andwith a relatively small 2 billion dollar economy within a tight
fiscal framework. Inaddition, the country i s geographically small with insufficient arable landto
allow 11millionpeople to advance above prevailingpoverty levels. The naturalresource base i s
predominantly agriculture; it i s mainly concentrated on the export o f tobacco and, as such, the
country i s highlydependent on prevailing international tobacco prices.

Further constraints are experienced because o f recurrent droughts, a highincidence o f HIV/AIDS
(25% prevalence rate among women) and chronic malnutrition (49%). Concurrently, incomes
remain decidedly inequitable with more than 70% o fthe population defined as poor. Inthe long
term, any possible per capita growth i s dependent on increasingthe land size o f farmers but to
achieve this, a highnumber o f farmers will have to move out o f agriculture. The government will
have to improvethe quality o f education at all levels ifit i s to develop the industrialand service
sectors sufficiently to absorb the increasing number o fworkers.

Education sector

Improved access; Followingthe introduction of Free Primary Education (FPE) in 1994,
enrollment inprimary increased dramatically from 1.9 million in 1993/94 to 2.9 million the
following year. Similarly, enrollment insecondary was substantially expanded as a result o f the
introduction in 1998 o f Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSSs). Thus, the government has
been successful inprovidingaccess to the majority o f school-age children. However, because
bothFPE andthe establishment o f CDSSs were largelyunplanned, a highnumber o f untrained
primary and secondary teachers were recruited and this has impactednegatively on learning
outcomes, retention and completion rates.

Key issues in the education sector: Educationoutcomes and quality canbe viewed as a
production function with various interacting inputs and their combined impact on achievement
under abudgetconstraint. Three major issues affect educationquality inMalawi andthese are
outlined below. Each i s critical but neither can be addressed separately: only a combined
remedial strategy to reduce their negative impact on the quality o f educationwill prove effective.

This project was preparedas an urgentresponse to the crisis inthe educationsector. As
identified inthe Government's Letter o f Sector Policy, the project, a bridgingoperation, will
support the consolidation and implementation o fkey educationpolicies across the sector to pave
the way for a broader sector program. The project will complement existing government and
donor financed projects, primarily to address the teacher capacity and management o f teachers,
externalities affecting retention and learning andbuild capacity to undertake the implementation
o f a sector wide program.




                                                   5

Issue 1:A high number of untrained teachers; limited capacity of the teacher education system;
uneven secondary school standards as a result of high number of untrained teachers and
inequitable deployment of teachers contributing to a decline in quality and low student retention:

The number o f untrained primaryteachers increased from 16% to 40% as a result o fFPE.At
secondary level, the number o f untrained teachers at CDSSs grew to 64%. As a consequence, the
average pupil qualified teacher ratio (PqTR) at primary level rose from 82:1to 123:1between
1994 and 2000 (this ratio i s approximately 3 times higher than the 40-45 pupilsper classroom
recommended for effective instruction). Furthermore, capacity inteacher training colleges and in
universities providing teacher education i s inadequate to meet the highdemandfor both teacher
trainers and student teachers for primaryand secondary education. This situation has contributed
to a deterioration inthe quality o f teaching inMalawi and has resulted inderisory learning
outcome: the recent Southern Africa Consortium for the Measurement o f Educational Quality
(SACMEQ, 2000) study indicated that less than 1percent o f grade 6 pupils achieve `desirable'
levels inliteracy and a mere 20 percent reach `minimum' levels.

Efficiency is also low. This i s exemplified inthe highrepetition and drop out rates -repetition is
presently at 25% for primary as a whole and 40-45% for grade 1pupils.Despite the fact that in
excess o f 95% o f all Malawian children commence school, less than 4 out o f 10pupils complete
grade 8. The lack o f an effective secondary education system with a highnumber o f untrained
teachers, inturn, impacts negatively on the caliber o f students enrolling inteacher education
colleges or following higher education courses to become teacher educators. The supply o f
higher educationgraduates, especially inthe area o fteacher development, is also affectedbythe
fact that with only 4,000 students enrolled inuniversities, higher education enrollment per
 100,000 inhabitants i s one o f the lowest inAfrica.

The secondary education sub-sector is also extremely inequitable. While the bulk o f secondary
students enroll inCDSSs, the unit costs o f these schools i s about one fifth o f the per student costs
o f their counterparts, the Conventional Secondary or Grant Aided Secondary Schools.
Furthermore, a number o f conventional secondary schools fully staffed with trained teachers are
hamperedinthe deliveryo fteachingby a severely dilapidated environment and infrastructure.
Halfo f the CDSS structures and facilities are considered inadequate to provide acceptable levels
o f teaching and learning and since the secondary sub-sector provides the stock o f candidates who
will subsequently enroll inteacher education, university education, or inthe private andpublic
 sectors, uniformity andconsistency inquality, especially o fteachers, are critical ifthe overall
education system i s to improve.

Issue 2: Weak capacity, combined with centralized service delivery and lack of prioritized
strategy; limitedfiscal resources, combined with lack of implementation plans or expenditure
framework, contributing to inefficient service delivery:

A hrther challenge across all levels o fthe system (at centralMinistry, regional anddistrict
levels, and at primary, secondary and tertiary levels) i s the weak capacity to supervise and
implement activities and reforms - including donor projects. This phenomenon arises partly
because o fhighnon-salary recurrent costs, presently estimated at the level o f 510% (salaries
consume more than 90% o fbudget), staff shortages and a lack o fperformance incentives or



                                                   6

accountability procedures. Furthermore, a strategy to improve teacher development through a
clear national teacher development strategy has beenboth ambiguous and undecided for the past
two years. At primary and secondary school levels, the provision o ftextbooks and science
equipment has been inadequate and unpredictable and, inaddition, pedagogical and school
management procedures remain unsatisfactory and invariably fail to ensure the efficient use o f
scarce resources. Finally, inview o fthe limitedand constrained fiscal resources, the scope for
expanding the number o f qualified teachers without IDA or donor support remains limited.

Issue 3: Externalities: Parental poverty and limited community involvement, HIV/AIDS and
malnutrition contributing to absenteeism and unsatisfacto y retention levels:

The above two issues are firther compoundedbythe impact o fthe HN/AIDS pandemic: it
contributes to increased teacher attrition andhighteacher and pupil absenteeism levels and it
impacts directly on teaching processes because o f frequent andprolonged teacher illness.
Absentee rates are firther raised, learning outcomes reduced and enrollment delayedbecause
approximately 50% o fthe Malawian population i s currently chronically malnourished. The
problem i s exacerbated due to limitedresources at school level, the high direct cost on parentso f
leaming materials, and limitedcommunity involvement ineducation.

All o fthe above weaknesses inthe Malawian education sector are compoundedby inefficient
andinequitable delivery of education services acrossthe system andthe use o fhuman and
financial resources ina manner inconsistent with defined government policy objectives. In
summary,Malawi is far from reachingthe targets set inthe Policy andInvestmentFramework
for education (PIF) and inachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

GovernmentStrategy

Education Sector Policy Framework: The government's poverty reduction strategy' identified
the development o f the education system as a key priority. The education sector Policy
Investment Framework (PIF) and other policy documents2 outline the specific policy targets for
the sector until2012. The PIF addressesboth the need for improving the quality o fbasic
education and the need to improve quality and access to post-primary levels. For basic education,
the focus is onproviding asufficient supply of qualiped teachers and essential teaching and
learning resources to achieve improved learning outcomes and reduce dropout and repetition
rates. At post-primary levels, the objective is to produce more graduates inorder to provide the
number o f teachers required at other levels o f the education system and to meet the demand for
qualified labor from other sectors o f the economy.

Recent experience with MIITEP, the in-service primary teacher development program, has
contributed to increased disquiet about the relevance o f investinginthis mode o f teacher
development. However, well-trained, qualiped teachers are key determinants to improved
learning outcomes and higher completion rates. As such, it i s acknowledged that focusing on the
conditions necessary to bringthis about i s a priority and the recent Joint Sector Review (JSR,


  Malawi Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP) and Vision 2020.
  Education Sector Policy Investment Framework (PIF) 2000-2012, the Malawi Education For All paper (MEFA
(draft)), andNational Strategy for Teacher Education and Development (NSTED).

2004) reiteratedthe need for Government to develop a strategic planthat will provide a blueprint
for implementation o fthe PIF and the stimulation o f a sector wide approach (SWAP).

National Strategyfor Teacher Education and Development (NSTED) and Fiscal Sustainability:
Duringthe pre-appraisal mission, February2004, the MinistryofEducation(MOE) reaffirmed
its commitment to improve the pupilqualified teacher ratio (PqTR) inprimary schools from
123:l3  in2000 to 60:1by2012 - a goalconsistent withthe PIF. Furthermore, Ministryevaluated
the options recommendedinthe National Strategy for Teacher Education andDevelopment
(NSTED) and communicated to the Bank its decision on a newprimary teacher-training mode
(Annex 1). The preferred option seeks to improve the quality o f education by strengthening
teachers' pedagogical skills byproviding a longer period o f teacher training while at the same
time maintaininga highoutput from the teacher education colleagues byincreasingtheir existing
capacity.

The selected training mode is a "1 plus 1" system: a one year residential course followed by one
year o f supervised teachingpractice inschools. This innovationwill be complemented by
continuous professional development for teachers andthrough upgrading and training o fteachers
andteacher trainers for post-primary levels. It is expected that the newteacher-training model
will be launched inJanuary 2006.

To move towards the target o f a 60:1PqTR, the Ministrywill undertake the following: (i)
increase enrollment capacity inthe 6 existing TTCs from 2,730 to 4,000 students; (ii)   construct
1-2 additional primary teacher training colleges with an enrollment capacity of 500-1,000
studentseach. GTZ is providing finance to implement the former, andthe current Bankproject
will finance one o fthe new TTCs. Finally, onthe conditionthat all TTCs are usedto full
capacity, GTZ may finance a second new TTC. These two measures will bringtotal capacity to
at least 5,000-6,000, and the expected output from teacher training to an expected 4,500 to 5,400
(assuming a pass rate o f 90%) which will increase the number o f qualified teachers following the
expansion inthe capacity o f the TTCs. Additional demand for teachers, ifany, will be met by
implementingdistance educationutilizing existing college capacity.

The fiscal sustainability analysis (Annex 9) has shownthat, given the most likely growth
scenarios, Ministryis unlikelyto be capable o fhiringmore than approximately 4,000 new
teachers each year until2012 - to make up for teachers lost through attrition (approximately
3,000 per year) and to gradually increase the total stock o fteachers. According to the simulation
model used for the preparation o f this project, 4,000 new teachers per year would ensure a
PqTRof 67:l by 2012. As the existing6 TTCs can enroll 4,000, one additionalTTC with a
capacity o f 500 students would be sufficient to generate 4,000 graduates, assuming a pass rate o f
about 90%. The number o f new teachers required to reduce the PqTRto 60:l by 2012 i s
approximately 5,000 per year - assuming that the population o f school-age children grows at
about 2% per year and improvements inrepetition and dropout rates ensue as a result o fbetter
quality. However, such a scenario appears fiscally unattainable at the moment, as the government
will have difficulty inhiringthe new teachers.




  According to preliminary EMIS statistics, this ratio was 95:1in2003.


                                                           8

Secondary andhigher education teacher development will also have to expandto accompany the
expansion at primarylevel andto ensure that a suficient number of secondary school teachers
and teacher trainers are available. To achieve this, the GoM will expand university level teacher
development, including facilities and staff development, and complement the on-going
Secondary School Teacher Educationprogram (SSTEP), presently supported by CIDA. CIDA is
likely to expand the support to the secondary education sub-sector, which inaddition to the
higher education sub-sector i s likely to be the prime focus o f IDA support inthe next operation.

As aresult o fthe above policies, the total number o fteachers inprimary and secondary will
expand; this will impact on existing fiscal expenditures: government will need to allocate a large
share o f their recurrent expenditure for education (about 4% o f GDP or 17-18% oftotal recurrent
spending). At the same, government will need to be extremely prudent inmanaging spendingin
the education sector. Inthe case o f secondary education, enrollment grew sharply up to year
2000 (245,000 inpublic secondary); while in2001-03, enrollment seems to have declined a little.
Still, the sector remains seriously under funded, inparticular the CDSSs, and produces only
about 10,000 upper secondary graduates (MSCE) per year. Duringthe pre-appraisal mission, the
Bank suggested to Ministrythat enrollment inpublic secondarybelimitedto 245,000 students
while simultaneously focusing onproducingmore graduates by increasingper student funding,
particularly for the CDSSs. IDA'Sproposed ceiling for enrollment inpublic secondary schools,
however, will not exclude expandingprivate secondary education but even with a cap on
enrollment, the share o fthe education budget allocated to secondary education may still needto
increase to ensure equitable perpupil spending. The current project, while addressing the
shortage inthe number o f trained secondary teachers will pilot alternative financing and
management mechanisms ina few selected schools.

Based on the Malawi Country Status Report (CSR) findings, the Bank proposes that enrollment
inthe university sub-sector beincreased from the existing4,000 students to about 8,000 over the
next 10 years but that this be achieved within the existing budget envelope. This increase could
be achieved by (i) existing staff and facilities more efficiently, (ii)
                    using                                                 introducing shorter
degree programs (diploma, certificate and bachelor degrees), (iii)  increasing enrollment o f
parallel fee paying students and, (iv) generating budget savings through out-sourcing o fnon-
academic services. Ineffect, the universities inMalawi will need to radically improve their
existingresources, lower the current extremely highper pupil spendingandeliminate the
subsidies provided to studentsthrough free food andhousing. The share to higher education o f
the total education budgetshouldalso bereduced but expansion beyondthe improvementsinthe
efficiency and per student spending will need to be based on economic growth and labor market
demand. These undertakings will have to be elaborated ina strategy plan for higher education
including the financing o fhigher education.

Decentralization and decentralized service delivery: Issues o f accountability, discipline, control,
inspection, quality assurance and monitoring across the system are central elements inimproving
efficiency. These will needto be addressed withinthe framework o f decentralization, community
involvement and through redefining the roles o f the Ministryanddistricts inimproving overall
service delivery.




                                                   9

On March 8, 1999, the Local Government Act for the National DecentralizationPolicy became
effective. The policy has five main features: (i)  devolution o f administrative andpolitical
authority to the district level; (ii)
                                   integration o f governmental agencies at the district and local
levels; (iii)transformation of implementationresponsibilities to the districts; (iv) assignment o f
hnctions andresponsibilities to the various levels o f government; and (v) promotion o fpopular
participation ingovernance and developmentinthe districts. As the budget for the management
of teachers under the Government's DecentralizationPolicy i s transferred to the District
Assemblies, a unique opportunity arises for MOE to address some o f the variance inteacher
deployment and to improve accountability and service delivery. Currently, MOE i s preparing a
planfor the implementation o fthe act.

Another significant policy that will improve service delivery, and possibly impact positively on
leaming outcomes, i s the National Strategyfor Community Development. It lays out the key
policies andmechanism for reactivating the School Management Committees - these committees
exist inmore than 98 percent o f schools and seek to improve the involvement of communities,
parents and teachers. However, although a number o f donors are already funding various pilots
andprojectsinsupport o fcommunity involvement andeducation, a significant block inthe
realizationo f the National Strategy for Community Development has beenthe absence of
fundingto make the initiative operational. The IDA supportedDirect Support to School will
address this issue by strengthening the social contracting and by providing conditional cash
transfers to the communities to be usedfor educationpurposes and inputs. This intumwill
lower household opportunity costs and strengthen parents and community involvement.

Externalities HIV/AIDS and nutrition: The govemment, supported by its development partners,
has developed a national strategy for HIV/AIDS and it i s currently supported through the MAP
project. Inaddition, a 10-year national healthprogram i s beingimplemented. Through the
operation, outlined here, the Ministryo f Educationwill seek to ameliorate some of the adverse
effects on learning and attendance through a nutrition intervention initiative. Inaddition the
M O E has indicated its intention to pursuethe issue o fmalnutrition and food-insecurity within
government.

2. Rationale for Bank involvement

Although Malawi has made significant progress towards the achievement o funiversalprimary
enrollment, it will be difficult for the country to achieve the Millennium Development Goal o f
universal primary completion. Meeting this challenge will require increased internal and extemal
funding for education and a closer collaborationbetweenGovernment, developmentpartners,
NGOs, and other stakeholders. Much o f this additional fundingi s envisioned to be channeled
through a sector wide program, once the MOEhas finalized its plans.

This project has beendesigned based on extensive sector work (Malawi Education Sector
Country Status Report No. 78) andthrough a collaborative process to address a limitednumber
o f strategic areas within the government's policy framework. Furthermore, Government and
other development partners have designed this project to complement existing interventions; the
development partners focus mainly on basic education, but the Bank seeks to support the
education sector inits entirety as a system, particularly inrespect to teacher education. Thus, the



                                                   10

activities supported through this project i s intended to complement existing programs andfill any
gaps, while supporting the strategic direction and implementation o fpolicies ina fiscal
sustainable manner.

This project will also provide key support to strengthening government capacity inorder to
prepare it for subsequent implementationo f a broader sector wide program. To facilitate this
process, the project will further emphasize donor collaboration andthe settingup o f a small, but
scaleable-pooled hnd, with a view toward harmonizing fiduciary procedures andmoving
towards a better-integrated sector program. Here, Government, development partners andthe
NGOshave underscored the Bank's technical capacity and leadership inpolicy issues inorder to
move the education sector forward. As a result o f Bank interaction and Government leadership,
there are, andhave been, a number o f encouraging andpositive recent developments such as
further progress inthe finalization o f the NSTED.

3. Higherlevel objectivesto which the projectcontributes

The MPRSP, PIF andthe Bank's 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) acknowledge that
human capital i s the key to poverty alleviation inMalawi andthat education yields bothbroad
and economic benefits. A healthy and educated population leads to higher productivity, better
income distribution and general improved standards o f living.

Byrealigning education policies to overall fiscal resources andby emphasizing quality
throughout the system, the project will assist the government inimproving the education sector
inMalawiandstrengtheningthe supply and quality ofits humancapital. Thusboththe MPRSP
and the PIF place emphasis on the improvement o f access, quality, relevance and equity at all
levels o f the education system as way o f alleviating poverty inMalawi.

B. PROJECTDESCRIPTION

1. Lendinginstrument

The lendinginstrumentfor this operation i s a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) Grant. An
Adaptable Program Loan (APL)was considered pre-mature because the long-term elements o f
the program require further work. The duration o f the project is 5 years.

2. Programobjectivesandphases

At the request o fthe government, the project has beendesigned to provide immediate financing
to support the education sector inMalawi. This financing will be complementary to existing
donor financed projects or programs to either fill a gap or complement these to generate a higher
returnonthe overall investment.

The project also supports some preparatory activities to enable government, and the main
development partners, to enter into a sector wide program within a few years, andlikely before
the conclusion o f this project. As such, the project i s considered a bridgingoperationthat will
assist ina move towards a sector program supporting the implementation o f the government's



                                                   11

Policy and InvestmentFramework (PIF) and the National Strategy for Teacher Education and
Development (NSTED).

These two documents outline the government's long-tem education sector development
objectives and are perceivedas goals that cannot be achieved by means o f some targeted inputs
provided on a once-off basis. Rather, they require that interventionsbeprovided in accordance
with awell-phased plan so the necessary implementationcapacity is gradually developed across
all administrative levels.

Insummary, the projectis designedto consolidate existing sector policies andimplementthese
ina fiscal sustainable manner setting theoverall directionofthe education sector as articulated
and established inthe Government's Letter o f Sector Policy. The project will complement on-
going activities thereby reinforcing these on-going activities with a priority given to teacher
development and management, externalities and activities that will support the development o f a
SWAP and improve learning outcomes inthe longrun.

3. Projectdevelopmentobjectivesandkey indicators

The project will improve education quality by improving the conditions andprocesses o f
teaching and learning at the school level, and the capacity for education service delivery across
the education system by: (i) increasingthe number o f qualified teachers, (ii) improving the
capacity and the quality o f education service delivery by fostering community participation and
by strengthening the management o fhuman and financial resources at district andprimary
school levels, and (iii)improving learning outcomes at all levels byproviding enhanced
conditions for school effectiveness that will contribute to changes inthe behaviors o fteachers
and students.

The causal effect generatedbythese interventions -addressing the number o f qualified teachers,
improving the learning environment and addressing prohibitive externalities will inthe longer
runimprove learning outcomes, retentionandthe completionrateandthus the move towards the
MDGsandgovernment's goals.


The following development indicators will be applied:

D.O. indicator 1:
Improve the PqTRinStandard 1-8 from 123:l in2000 to max. 80: by closing date (67:l by 2012)

D.O. indicator 2:
Improvethe PqTR inCDSS from 102:l in2000 to max. 65:l by closing date (58:l by 2012)

D.O. indicator 3:
As aproxy for improved conditions andbehavior change at the pupillevel: Deliver effective
school health and nutrition intervention to at least 80% o fprimary school pupilsunder the age o f
10by closing date.




                                                 12

D.O. indicator 4:
As a proxy for improved conditions andcapacity for service delivery at the school level: Provide
DSS Grants: (a) within the first quarter o fthe school calendar year to some primary schools by
March 31,2007; and (b) to at least 2,000 primary schools by closing date.

4. Project components

The following components and sub-components have been agreed upon for financing. The
limitedscope o fcomponent 2 was basedon anegotiated agreement to finance a few selected
dilapidated conventional secondary schools on the condition o fpilotingnew financing and
management interventions. Detailedcomponent descriptions are included inAnnex 4. The
complementary nature o f each component and how its fits within existingprograms and
activities i s described inthe matrix inAnnex 2.

Component 1: Teacher Capacity Development (IDA allocation of US$15.5 million at base
cost): The component will complement government and donors' efforts to improve quality and
expand capacity o f teacher development andtraining at all levels: (i) Refurbishment o f
EducationFaculties at Chancellor College, Malawi Polytechnic, and new works at Mzuzu
University relatedto additional needs o f secondary teacher education; (ii)Construction o f a new
primaryteacher trainingcollege; (iii) developmentoflecturers at tertiary, secondary and
                                        Staff
primary teachers colleges; and (iv) Student assessment surveys to establish a baseline against
which student achievement can be measured.

Component 2: Quality Improvements and Inputs(IDA allocation of US$3.7 million at base
cost): Improve the conditions o f learning at selected secondary schools staffed with trained
teachers or newly trained teachers: (i) refurbishment o f four Government secondary schools, and
(ii)provision o f additional textbooks for graduating CDSS teachers (complementary to CIDA
financed SSTEP).

Component 3: Mitigating externalities affecting the quality of education (IDA allocation of
US$3.0 million at base cost): Provide a School Health andNutritionpackage to all primary
schools, which will include the following cost-effective interventions: distribution o f vitamin A
and iron-folic acid to school children under 10 years old, de-worming, treatment o fmalaria and
fever, andthe promotion o f good health andnutrition practices.

Component 4: Direct support to primary schools - DSS (IDA allocation of US$3.7 million
at base cost): Supply basic learning materials directly to schools while strengthening the
participation o f communities inschool management. The component will provide grants directly
to about 50% o f all primary schools twice per school year, finance media campaigns, and
provide training for MOE staff at all administrative levels andto communities. School
committees will manage the grants, which must be usedto purchase basic learning materials for
the school.

5. Lessonslearnedand reflectedinthe projectdesign

    0    Limited capacity: The two previous discrete Malawian education investment operations,
         the Primary EducationProject (rated unsatisfactory at closing) and the Secondary
         EducationProject (previously ratedunsatisfactory but currently rated satisfactory)
         experienced difficulties because o f (i)limited capacity inBank procurement processing,
         (ii) ofcounterpartfunding,and(iii) andinsufficientGovernmentoversightand
             lack                                  weak
         supervision. Inrecent years, however, implementation capacity has improved and the
         present project places a specific emphasis on training staff associated with the project. In
         addition, the proposedgrant i s halfthe size o f the previous Secondary EducationProject.

     0   Limited policy impactfrom stand-alone projects: It i s difficult to achieve policy reforms
         for Malawian projects that focus on discrete activities. Accordingly, decisions about
         sector wide policy issues cannot be separated from programmedactivities andtheir
         associatedresource requirements.

     0   Lack ofplanning and consistency in policy execution: BothFPE andthe expansion o f
         secondary education were costly and unplanned policy decisions and appear to have been
         taken without sufficient regard for resource constraints inprovidingquality education.
         This lack o fproper planningemphasizes the priority o fundertaking comprehensive
         analytical work to ensure a coherent andwell-defined program - and one that fully
         addresses implementation issues at the outset. The PPF i s intendedto ensure that most o f
         the preparatory work i s completed upfront inorder to reduce delays inthe initial
         implementation of the project. Further, continuation o fthe EDMUinthis project, allied


                                                   14

      to the experience it gathered duringthe SEP, will also contribute significantly to a timely
      commencement o fproject implementation.

      Sustainability: The importance o f sustainability i s acknowledged. It has resulted ina
      comprehensive review o fpolicy issues butrealistic selectivity inthe choice o f activities.
      However, it i s also noted that inlight o fthe state o fthe Malawian economy and other
      associated factors, the education sector will require assistance for some time to come.
      The Ministryis also taking steps to ensure the sustainability o ftextbook provision by
      seekingto resuscitate the textbook revolving fund - started by DANIDAbefore it
      withdrew from Malawi. Inaddition the ministryhas agreed that it is necessary to limit its
      expansion o fpublic secondary education, dependinginstead on the private sector for
      future expansion.

      Delayed site selection: Questionable SEP site selection decisions resulted indelays in
      completion and also contributedto unnecessarily increased construction costs. As such,
      due attentionhas been paidto the selection o fthe site for the proposedteacher training
      college, which has been acceptedby IDA.

       Contractor management: The questionable caliber o f selected contractors and
       supervisory consultants, contributed to poor workmanship and resulted innumerous
       defects that must now be addressed duringthe liabilityperiod. As such, contractors and
       consultants who performed poorly inprevious assignments will not be considered for this
      project.

       Weak ownership: The key to successful implementation o f the project i s government
       ownership that i s allied to strong stakeholder collaboration. This has beenaddressedby
       ensuringGovernment, through the Ministry ofEducation, assumed a leadership role in
       identification and design o fthe project. At all stages o fthe project cycle, Bank missions
       involvedrelevant ministries and government departments, various development partners
       andrelevant NGOs.Inaddition, the Steering Committee that will oversee implementation
       o f the project, will comprise all the above key stakeholders; local communities will
       equally be involved inthose components where their input and collaboration i s required
       (for example, the DSS component).

       The use of Citibank proved problematic inthe implementation o f the SEP. Bank
       statements were not supplied on time and this ledto delays indisbursement. It has now
       been agreed with the Ministry o f Finance and the Reserve Bank inMalawi that for this
       project, EDMUopen foreign Bank accounts with local banks inMalawi.

6. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection

The two previous IDAprojects were traditional investment operations inthat they focused on

textbook provision or buildingnew schools - i s unlikely to radically alter the nature o f education
simple and single components. However, a project targeting single components - such as

inMalawiandwill certainlynot contribute to system-wide capacity. Onthe other hand, the
government does not have the necessary systems, or the capacity, to manage a full sector wide
program. Therefore, a full SWAP was considered premature.


                                                 15

However, a more comprehensive approach appearedmore appropriate and this was endorsed by
both government and development partners alike. Accordingly, the approach i s basedon the
government's overall policy framework and reflects existing operational implementation
capacity. It also takes a broad view on the entire system and it's financing with the emphasis on
strengthening government capacity andit will complement major policies andpolicy issues,
programs, and activities implementedby other development partners andNGOs. The specific
IDAinvestmentwill bebasedon anarrow selectivity inpriorities andcomponents that will
complement, or fill gaps, inthe overall government program while spearheading a move towards
a better integrated sector wide program andpooling o f funds.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1. Partnershiparrangements

Donor collaboration inthe education sector is strong and i s reflected incontinuing partnership
aroundkey policy issues, such as NSTED.Current donor interventions (see Annex 2) by
USAID, GTZ, JICA, DFID,ADB, UNICEF, WFP, UNESCO, CIDA, theNetherlands and
UNFPA target the primary education sub-sector, notably: teacher education, Teacher
Development Centers (TDCs), provision o f learning materials andtextbooks, classroom-based
assessment, curriculum development, district capacity building, school mapping andmicro-
planning,primary school construction, nationaltraining of staff, HIV/AIDS and EMIS. In
addition to the World Bank, JICA and CIDA are supporting secondary teacher training (SSTEP)
and in-service teacher training andADB now intends to commence financing rehabilitation o f a
number o fCDSSs. Inaddition, a core group on teacher developmentis beingreconstituted.

The Bank, incollaborationwith donors and other stakeholders and select NGOs, i s endeavoring
to (i)consolidate efforts, (ii) a sharper focus for policy interventions that are inline with
                              provide
overall resources, and (iii) an increased dynamism for a more integrated sector wide
                            create
approach. Further, it is evident that the development partners welcome the Bank's leadership
role inencouraging a SWAP, especially as the Bank i s currently the sole donor adapting a
comprehensive review o f the entire education system. A successful SWAP, however, needs to be
built on strong ownership by Government, teachers andparents andto include apredictable
public financial flow and, here, the recently completed Country Status Report will help chart the
way forward. Inaddition, the Bank project will support the overall objectives of the Malawi
Country Assistance Strategy (2003), the MPSRP and other sector policies articulatedunder the
PIF. The operationwill complement sector issues addressed inthe SAC, Health Sector Reform
Project and MAP.Furthermore, this project i s the first ina series o f expected interventions to
support education over a 15-20 year period.

As an initial step towards better integration, the IDAwill propose to set up a small, but scaleable,
pooled fund around the Direct Support to School (Component 4) and to encourage other donors
to join this pool. These discussions have advanced, but more work will be required. Furthermore,
the Bankwill initiate work inrelationto preparing a more consolidatedexpenditures framework.
To achieve such closer collaboration, further progress towards development o f a SWAP is
desirable and, here, the recent JSR has continued to build, albeit slowly, on earlier work towards



                                                  16

finalization o f a Memorandum o fUnderstanding.Phase one o fthis process has leadto
formulation o f a Code o f Conduct for implementationo f a sector strategic plan; it indicates a
fi-amework for the relationships between Ministryandthe cooperating partners intheir efforts to
develop the sector. When signed, it will constitute a basis for introduction o f the formal
Memorandum o f Understanding, which will ensure closer synergy and less duplication o f effort
across the entire education sector.

2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

The mainimplementation agency for the project will be the Ministry o fEducation(MOE); it will
act on behalf o f the Government o fMalawi. A Project Steering Committee (PSC), chairedby the
Minister (or Deputy Minister), will oversee project implementation and provide overall
guidance, particularly on policy activities. It will ensure that the overall objectives o f the project
are met and facilitate resolution o fproblems arising duringimplementation. The PSC will
comprise the Directors o f Departments and Institutes, heads o ftertiary institutions, including the
universities, a representative o fthe Secretary o fthe Treasury, development partners and other
stakeholders, co-opted for special issues as the need arises.

A Technical Committee, chaired bythe Permanent Secretary o fMOE, will meetregularly (at
least once every two months) to review implementation o f the various components and sub-
components and to facilitate resolution o f any practical problems that might arise duringproject
execution. Ad hoc meetings will be called ifandwhen necessary. The Technical Committee will
comprise all component managers, representatives of institutions executing the project
components and subcomponents, and EDMU.

Component Managers have already beenappointed for each component; they are responsible for
managing andmonitoring implementation of the respective components. The Component
Manager for Component 1i s responsible for liaising with the two Universities and for
monitoring implementationo f their components. The component managers will be supported by
technical specialists hiredas consultants. The annual Joint Sector Review (JSR), organizedby
the Ministry,the development partners and NGOs to the education sector, will also review
overall progress on implementation, particularly the achievement o fthe project objectives.

Procurement o f civil works, goods and services for the project will be undertakenby the EDMU;
ithas developed the capacity andexperience inprocurement and financial management through
its SEP involvements. Inaddition, the two universities involved inthe ESSUP have a degree of
expertise inprocuring goods and also some executing and supervising capacity for small works,
mainly repairs. However, inrecent years none o f the institutions have managed major civil works
activities or complex goods and services procurement o f the type and size to be provided under
the ESSUP and, as such, it i s envisaged that the procurement process will be managed by
EDMU.Nevertheless, itis essential that the institutions be involvedinall stagesofprocurement
inorder to enhance ownership oftheproject, improve understanding andtransparency of
procedures and strengthenoperation andmaintenance capacity within the universities.

Accordingly, it i s firmly proposedthat a working group be set up for each o f the three
institutions (Mzuzu University, Universityo f Malawi Chancellor College and Polytechnic) to



                                                   17

implementthe civilworks, goods andservices aspects o fthe respective components; the groups
will beheadedby a senior EDMUtechnical staffmemberandsupported byrelevant technical,
costing andprocurement specialists (EDMUand/or hiredconsultancy services).

Under the DSS component, distribution o f funds at the school level will be undertaken through
the District Education Offices. Implementationo f this component will be carried out at the
divisional, district and school levels, and will include the school committees, selected by the
local communities. Since the project will needto develop capacity for new responsibilities at
divisional, district and schooVcommunity levels, it will include funds for relevant training
activities.

The School Nutrition andHealth component will be implementedthrough twice-yearly
campaigns and other routine activities at primary schools developed by M O E and other
Ministries.

The proceeds o fthe IDA grant will beplacedina special account ina local commercialbank and
be replenished on the basis o f statements o f expenditures or by direct payment o f suppliers on the
basis o frequiredwithdrawal applications. The following Bank accounts will be maintained for
project funds: (i) Special Account: to serve as the mainproject account into which project
implementation funds from IDA are deposited, denomination inU S dollars; and (ii)       Project
Account: government counterpart funds are deposited inthis account, denominationinlocal
currency. The chart inAnnex 7 illustrates the proposedbankingand fund flow arrangements.

3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomes/results

Project performancewill be monitored through the Development Objectives Indicators and key
performance indicators, detailed inAnnex 3 - all indicators are based on statistical data collected
on a yearly basis by M O E and on data containedinEDMUprogress reports. Because o f
difficulties indata collection insome areas, however, the project will conduct annual surveys and
reviews o f specific sub-components, such as the Direct Support to Schools andNutrition
components. The project will also finance two learning achievements assessment studies; these
will be carried out twice duringthe life o fthe project - an initial study, financed by GTZ, is
scheduled for 2004. These studies will provide feedback on pupils' learning achievements and
indicate the degree of progress inlearningoutcomes directly attributable to the project. The
PlanningDepartment o f MOEwill be responsible for computation o f the indicators and these
will bepresented inthe semi-annual progress reports issuedbyEDMU.

4. Sustainability

The proposed project is closely aligned with the PIF and complements government and donor-
financed activities. The objectives, focus and components reflect government decisions arising
from discussions with bothBank and cooperatingpartners. As such, there i s clear ownership.
Furthermore, it was agreed that this project be used as a stimulus for the development and
implementation o f a number o fpolicies, such as the recent decisions on NSTED.Finally, while
the development o f education inMalawi will continue to require external funding, this project
will assistMOEinaligning their policies withprevailingfiscal resources and consistent with the

overall teacher development strategy. As such, it will improve boththe sustainability and
implementation of policies and strategies andresult inincreased effectiveness inpolicy
execution.

5. Critical risks and possible controversial aspects

The overall risk rating o f this project i s medium (Substantial-Modest). The macroeconomic
environment i s improving and fiscal discipline i s being instilled, good governance is being
enforced due to the change inGovernment following the Parliamentary elections o f May 20,
2004.

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY

1. Economic and financial analyses

Annex 9 outlines the economic andfinancial underpinningsfor the proposed operation. Careful
simulation o fthe proposedteacher development strategy, its feasibility and its impact on fiscal
resources were carried out and these form the basis for the proposed strategic direction supported
bythis operation.

2. Technical

The technical design o f the project is basedprimarilyon the limitedministry capacity to
implementactivities and execute policies and, as such, has emphasized simplicity and clear
objectives, where feasible. Furthermore, the proposed technical design and implementation
arrangements reflect experiences gained inthe two previous operations.




                                                  21

Civil works are based on a review o fvarious alternative designs and implementationoptions
considered and derived from the experience accumulated under the two previous operations.
Goods and services, and their costs and alternatives, have been reviewed with a view to cost
efficient purchases. The Direct Support to School component i s built on similar and successful
experiences inTanzania and Mozambique, has been adapted to the Malawi context andbuildson
strong incentives. The Nutritioninterventioni s using existing on the ground capacity (Save the
Children, UNICEF, WFP andNGOs) and experiences from other countries (Madagascar and
Senegal). Procurement o fmicronutrients will be implementedthrough the UNICEF procurement
office.

3. Fiduciary

EDMUhas put inplace adequate fiduciary arrangements andwill manage thenew project. An
assessment o f the financial management arrangements andprocurement arrangements are
included. See annexes 7 and 8.

4. Social

When this operation i s successfully implementedit will ensure enormous benefits to the
Malawians. Directly, it will benefit 3 million pupils and 50,000 teachers - or approximately 30%
of the population. Inaddition to improvingthe health andnutritional status o f school age
children, it will have a significant impact on the quality o f education and attendance levels.
Furthermore,the capacity buildingthrough decentralized service deliverywill improve the
efficacy and efficiency o f the system.The project will not pilot any new intervention; rather it
endeavors to reach every possible beneficiary. Finally, the project was closely prepared in
consultation with the development partners, local and international NGOs, teachers andteacher
unions.

5. Environment

Inrecognition ofthe potential environmental and social impacts that are likelyto result from the
planned construction and rehabilitation o f educational facilities, the Borrower has prepared an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy
Framework (FWF).These documents are required because the precise locations of the
educational facilities to be rehabilitated or constructedare not known at this time, thus making it
impossible to identify specific impacts and to recommend appropriate mitigation measures.

Therefore, the project will use a Screening Process - the ESMF.The ESMF outlines an
environmental and social screening process, which will enable project implementers to identify
the likelyenvironmental andsocial impacts, andto develop appropriate mitigationmeasures at
the planningstage o f the construction and rehabilitation activities. The screening process
includes a requirement for public consultations and disclosure o f their outcomes, to ensure that
the concerns o fallrelevant stakeholders, includingpotentially affectedpersons, havebeen
addressed appropriately prior to the commencement o f construction and rehabilitation activities.
Potential environmental impacts are likely to include soil erosion, water, soil and air pollution,




                                                  22

and loss o fvegetation; increases insolid andliquidwastes are likely to contribute to these
impacts.

The environmental and social screening process will also enable project implementersto identify
potential social impacts such as loss o f land and/or livelihoods, traffic accidents, asbestos-related
health problems, or an increase inwater-related diseases due to standing water inborrow pits
which serve as sources o f constructionmaterials. To ensure that social impacts relatedto land
acquisition (loss of landand/or livelihoods) are mitigated appropriately, the RPFprovides
guidance with regard to the principles and procedures to be applied inthe event that land
acquisition i s requiredunder the project. Measures to mitigate potential impacts on the health o f
the surrounding population will be devised at the planning stage andimplemented as appropriate.

In light of the planned construction and rehabilitation activities, it is vital that appropriate
measures are taken duringproject implementation to ensure that the public's health is protected
from environmental risks and pollution. The effective implementation o f the ESMF and the RPF
will contribute towards this goal.

6. Safeguard policies

The project's safeguard screening category is S2, and its environmental screening category is B
due to the planned construction andrehabilitation activities. As a result, safeguard policies 4.01
and OP 4.12 have beentriggered. Since the precise locations o fthe educational facilities to be
rehabilitated or constructed are not known at this time, an ESMF and a RPFhas beenprepared
bythe Borrower. These documents includerequirements for consultations, and appropriate
measures will be taken to ensure that the Borrower has the capacity to implement these
frameworks effectively. The ESMF and RPF were disclosed prior to appraisal.

                     MALAWI: Malawi EducationSector SupportProject1

The education sector inMalawi is experiencing a serious crisis o f low quality, low efficiency,
limited capacity and a shortage and inequitable distribution o f humanand financial resources. As
a successful outcome o f the 1994 implementationo fFree Primary Education (FPE) -which
increased enrollment from 2 millionto 3 million-most Malawian children, including the
poorest, now enroll inschool. Regrettably, the combination o frelatively low public spending on
educationper pupil, inadequate numbers of qualifiedteachers, poor leaming conditions and
externalities affecting both teachers, parents and children has resultedina deterioration o f
leaming outcomes.

Against this picture a stark reality confronts Malawi: it i s a small country with only 10million
people and with a natural resource base that i s limitedto agriculture and highlydependent on the
export o f tobacco. Inthe next decades, the Malawian economy i s likely to remain characterized
by a dominant traditional sector and arelatively small modem sector. The education sector needs
to providethe type o fhuman capital that will meetthe demand o fboth sectors, while
simultaneously helping the economy to move from its traditional to its modem sector,

Macroeconomic Context and Education Expenditures
Throughout the 1 9 9 0 Malawi's economy grew by approximately 3 percent - or slightly less
                         ~ ~
than 1percent above population growth. GDP per capita was approximately US$175 inyear
2001 and Malawi remains one o f the poorest countries inthe world. By the end o fthe nineties,
recurrent education expenditure as a proportion o f GDP inMalawi was somewhat below
countries like Uganda (3.2%) and Kenya (6.3%) - countries that are also expanding enrollment as
a result o f a free primaryeducation policy. However, inthe past couple o f years, recurrent
spending on educationhas increased, reaching 3.6% o f GDP inthe financial year 2001/02.

Inter-sectoral budget allocations. One notable feature inMalawi i s the fact that the share o f
recurrent expenditures allocated to higher education (15- 20 percent) i s higher thanthe share
allocated to secondary education (10-15 percent). This i s significant because approximately
245,000 pupils are enrolled inpublic secondary educationwhile only about 4,000 students are
enrolled inhigher education institutions.

Perpupil spending. The unit cost at the university level i sbetweenUS$2,500-3,000, while it i s
aroundUS$10 inprimary compared to around US$35 inother SSA countries, androughly
US$40 insecondary as a whole. The latter is affected by the very low unit costs (approximately
US$20) and under-fundedCommunity Day Secondary Schools (CDSS) where the bulk o f
secondary students are enrolled. Incomparison, the spendingper student inthe traditional
Conventional Secondary Schools (CSS) i s approximately US$lOO.

Huusehold Financing. Despitethe abolishment o f primary school tuition fees in 1994,
households still bear a considerable share o f education financing. In2001, the majority o f

families reported paying for textbooks anduniforms and approximately half reported
contributing to the school development fund. Inprimary, meanhousehold expenditures on
education average approximately 80 percent ofper pupilpublic expenditures. These household
expenditures are regressive andthe poorest households contribute more o f their income to
educationthan the wealthiest. The relative highlevels o f expenditures o fpoor households are
possibly important determinants o f dropout, particularly inprimary.

Primary Education
Inprimary education, the leaming environmentis underminedby avery highpupilqualified
teacher ratio (PqTR) (123: 1 in2000) as a result o f a shortage o ftrained teachers and the limited
capacity o f the teacher training system; inadequate learning materials and school infrastructure;
overcrowded classrooms; and a teacher deployment systemwhereby teacher numbers vary
significantly across schools and grade levels andbetween urban and rural areas. To compound
the problem, the HIV/AIDSpandemic is killing teachers andparents, raising absenteeism rates
of both teachers andpupilsbecause o f illnesses and the need for more help inthe household.
Withmore than halfthe populationchronically malnourished, especially duringthe hunger
period from January to April, absentee rates are further raised and leaming outcomes reduced.
The poor leamingconditions, the HIVIAIDSpandemic and chronic malnourishment has resulted
inveryhighrepetitionanddropoutrates. Despitethefact that morethan95 percent ofall
Malawian children eventually begin school, only about 60 percent complete standard6 and some
4 out of 10pupils (40 percent) complete standard 8.

Repetition, dropout, survival and completion. Although more than 95 percent o f all children
enter primary at some point, most repeat several grades. The level o frepetition i s high
throughout primary, and i s significantly higher inlower primary than inupper primary, with the
exception of standard 8. The average i s about 25 percent, while 40 percent o f all children repeat
standard1.The MonitoringLeamingAchievement (MLA, 1999) study for 11Afkican countries
recorded the highest repetitionrates of all countries inMalawi inthe first four grades o f primary.

The highnumber ofrepeaters andover-age pupilshas increasedthe GER. The GER for standard
1-4 i s 167percent (1999/2000), but is only 70 percent for standard 5-8. While repetition levels
are highinthe early school years, dropout rates are modest inthe lower grades, but by the end o f
standard 6, about 40% o f the pupilshave dropped out, and at the end o f standard 8, about 60%.

The survival rate, or probability that a grade 1student will still beinschool by standard 8, has
actually diminishedsince the beginning o f the nineties prior to the introduction o f FPE.
However, due to a higher intake of students to primaryschool thanbefore, more children in
absolute numbers andas a percentage o f school-age children, do complete primary.Thus,
Malawi i s on the right track byhaving hugelyimproved primary coverage and to a lesser extent
completion, but needs now to focus on reducing dropout andrepetitioninprimary.

Learning outcomes. Learning outcomes are negligible: the Southem Africa Consortium for the
Measurement o f Educational Quality (SACMEQ) study revealedthat less than 1percent o f
pupilsinstandard 6 reach a desirable level inreading (20 percent reach a minimumlevel). Given
the limited leaming outcomes and the low grade attainment, the wastage o f resources are evident
and the room for efficiency improvements enormous.

Learning environment. As indicated inthe Table below, there i s a significant discrepancy inthe
PTR between lower grades and higher grades. This complicates the conditions for effective
teaching and learning especially inthe lower grades. As canbe seen the average PTR instandard
one i s 100, but many schools andclasses exceed this number.

Further, there are significant differences inpupilto teacher ratios between schools, particularly
between urban andrural schools. An analysis o fthe allocation o fteachers to schools shows that
schools with 1,000 pupils canhave anywhere between 5 to 40 teachers. Similarly, inschools
with 40 teachers enrollments varybetween500 and 3,800. These data corresponds to 34 percent
`randomness', one o f the highest in SSA.

Externalities. InMalawi externalities plays a significant role inthe demand and supply o f
education services. Absenteeism o fpupils and teachers i s a particular contributing factor to poor
learning achievement. Teacher absenteeism inMalawi is reported as chronic but the frequency
varies widely. Insome schools, a teacher's time-on-task was as low as 1-2 hours each day.
Geographic location o f schools also presents a challenge. While 64 percent o f children inurban
areas live within 15 minutes o fthe nearest school, this i s only true for 33 percent o f rural
children.

Malnutrition. Prevalence and consequences o f malnutrition affect the opportunity costs o f
education. Malawi has one o fthe highest levels o f stuntinginchildren inEastern and Southern
Africa; almost halfthe children under 3 years o f age are stunted. From the Demographic and
Health Survey (DHS) 2000, it i s apparent that many children enter standard 1either short or
underweight for their age - 57 percent o f children 4-5 years o f age are stuntedand an alarming 28
percent o f children are severely stunted. Stunting and micronutrient malnutrition are associated
with reduced capacity to learn, delayed school enrollment, decreased school attendance, and
dropout - especially duringthe hungryperiod from November to April. Families keep children
out o f school duringthis period so childrencan earn money to buyfood or look for food. In
addition, hunger and fatigue are so severe that many children do not have sufficient energy to
walk to school.

Impact of HIV/AIDS. In2001 the official number o fprimaryteachers that died was 900. In
addition about 700 left the primary education systemowing to normal attrition. Because
HIV/AIDS will continue to affect the mortality rate o fteachers and the system will continue to
expand, the replacement o fbothprimary and secondary teachers as a result o f deaths caused by
AIDS will likely increaseto approximately 3,700 teachers a year. HIV/AIDS will also
increasingly affect attendance and retention o f both teachers and students.

Secondary Education
Insecondary education, approximately 60percent ofthe studentsenrolled inForm 1proceed to
Form 4 (grade 12). Repetition, and early and late entry, fbrther negatively impact onpedagogical
processes because o f the broad range o f skills andmaturity ineach class. By addressing the wide



                                                 27

 age-range o fpupils, the system could improve efficiency, lower repetition and dropout rates and
 thus increase survival andcompletionrates. However, these arenot the only determinants
 affecting attainment inMalawi. Other issues like gender, geographic location and type o f school
 determines the levels o f achievement and attainment.

 Insecondary educationaparticular inequityarises fiom the type ofschoolinwhich apupil
 enrolls. Inthe Community Day Secondary Schools (CDSS), inwhich close to 75% o f the
 students are enrolled, the pass rate inthe Malawi School Certificate o f Education (MSCE) final
 exam in2002 was less than20% while inall other types o f schools, the pass rate i s between 40
 and 60%. The low pass rate inthe CDSSs i s not surprising since, ingeneral, the CDSSs are
 under-fundedand staffed by unqualified teachers (and the expenditures per student are about
 one-fifth o f the expenditures inConventional Secondary Schools (CSS)). The inequitable access
 to good secondary education and the acute shortage o f trained secondary teachers become
 evident when the enrollment bytype o f school, PTR andpercentage o f qualified teachers are
 considered as shown inthe Table below. While there i s no major difference inthe PTRratio
 across the types o f schools, it i s clear that the majority o f students inCDSS do not have access to
 sufficient number o f qualified teachers.

 University Education
 Relative to the size o f its population, Malawi has close to the lowest proportion o f students
 enrolled intertiary education inthe entire Sub-Saharan region. Universities inMalawi enroll
 about 4,000 studentsintotal. The small scale o f operation and the significant spending on non-
 core functions, inparticular boarding and feeding, have created a low degree o f efficiency inthe
 sector. Thus, both student to lecturer ratio (7: l),well as the student to support staff ratio
                                                       as
 (about 9:1) are among the lowest inSSA, leaving ample room for adding students without
 necessarily increasing costs.

Implementation Arrangements for the Malawi Polytechnic, Chancellor College and Mzuzu
University
The institutions have some expertise inprocuring goods and some executing and supervising
capacity for small works, mainly repairs. Inrecent year, however, they have not managed major
civil works activities or complex goods and services procurement of the type, and scope, to be
provided under ESSUP1.As such, it i s intended that the procurementprocess be managed by
EDMUbutto enhance ownership ofthe project, improve understanding andtransparency of
procedures, and strengthenoperation andmaintenance capacity within the institutions, it i s
essential that each be involved inall stages of procurement. Accordingly, it i s proposedthat a
working group be set up, headed by a senior EDMUtechnical staff member, and supported by
relevant technical, costing and procurement specialists (inhouse EDMUand/or hired
consultancy services) to implement the civil works, goods and services aspects o f this
component.

A detailed description o fthe procedures is contained inthe Project Implementation Manual.The
institutions will provide regularreporting to the Ministryandto EDMUon the implementationo f
the project sub-component, in accordance with the overall implementation structure and
procedures o f the project.

ImplementationArrangements
Itis envisaged that the procurement process be managed byEDMU. Executionwill be overseen
byEDMUbyhiring consultancy services for construction management. It is proposedthat a
working group be set up within MOE/DTED, headed by a senior EDMUtechnical staff member,
and supported byrelevant technical, costing and procurement specialists (inhouse EDMUand/or
hired consultancy services) to implement the civil works, goods and services aspects o f this
component. Inorder to improve the quality o fworks and ensure participation inpost-delivery
inspection o f goods, it is further proposed that senior staff o fthe new college be involved inthe
final stages o f construction and goods delivery.


1.3     STAFF AND TEACHER        DEVELOPMENT

Specific Obiectives

1.4     STUDENT ASSESSMENT SURVEYS

The specific objectives o fthe PrimaryAchievement Sample Survey (PASS) are (i) establish
                                                                                      to
the baseline against which student achievement canbemeasuredand(ii) identify the factors in
                                                                            to
the school andhome environment, which significantly affect learning achievement and are
significantly affectedbypolicy interventions. The survey would consist o f standardized testing
inmathematicsofa smallrepresentative sample ofstudents who arenearingcompletionof
Standard 3 and Standard 6 andbe followed by interviewing the students, their parents, teachers,
andschool administrators. The test items and interview questions would be adapted from World
Bank instruments,which have been successfully employed ininvestigations inmany countries
around the world. The assessment would be done twice duringthe project implementation period
to enable MOE to analyze the data as a base for possible policy interventions. An expert
education evaluation consultant would lead a team o f local consultants to collaborate with the
MOE testing unit for adaptation andpilot testing ofthe test instruments, the development o f
sampling and analyses plans, the recruitment and training o f test administrators, test .
administration, and data processing and interpretation. The evaluation consultant would prepare
a report, which would be discussed with relevant officials o f the MOE, education stakeholders,
the donor partners, and the Bank. The project would support the international and local technical
assistance needed to carry out the assessment as well as the attendant costs related to test
preparation (including validation o ftest items and printing o f computer-readable test
questionnaires), test administration (short-term hiringo f test administrators, transportation, per-
diems) and data processing, and data analyses and report preparation. As a salient stimulus
toward formulation o f sector-wide strategies, PASS would be developed for compliance with
national testing and evaluation policies and practices, supported by other development partners.



                                                 45

The findings o f PASS would be compared to those countries o f similar levels o f economic
development, where the Bank has also assisted insimilar assessments.


COMPONENT 2: QUALITY IMPROVEMENTSAND INPUTS

This component will improve the conditions o fleaming at selected secondary schools staffed
with trainedteachers or newlytrained teachers and include: (i)    refirbishment o f four
Government secondary schools, and (ii)    provision o f learningresources for newly graduated
teachers who will be assigned to CDSS,


2.1     REFURBISHMENTOF FOURGOVERNMENT               SECONDARY SCHOOLS

Specific Obiectives
The objectives o fthis sub-component are to improve teaching and learning conditions infour
secondary schools, which have enrollment o f above 500 students each. The proposed schools are
Dedza Secondary School, Lilongwe Girls Secondary School, Blantyre Secondary School and
Mzuzu Government Secondary School.

One o fthe schools i s a girls secondary school, which provides classes also for visually impaired
students,with a specialized teacher. Almost all teachers are filly qualified. MOEhas accepted
that the conditions for refurbishing the schools are: i)that the schools can retainthe fees (or part
o fthem) at the school (this condition has been acceptedby the Minister o f Finance), ii)that the
retained finds will constitute a "school maintenance find" to be usedfor a regular maintenance
of the school premises and equipment, and iii)that the boarding facilities will be usedby the
students on a full cost recovery basis (no government's subsidies). This last measure constitutes
also a condition for the disbursement o f HIPIC funds to the government.

Activities
The project will finance the following activities:
        a)      civil works (refurbishment o f classrooms, kitchen and dininghalls, dormitories,
                laboratories, ablution areas, some teacher houses. Special attention will beplaced
                on installing security measures, such as iron gates at the entrance of the buildings,
                burglar barson windows, and meshes where needed, to stop the rampant
                burglaries and vandalisms presently occurring;
        b)      fumiture and equipment
        c)      teaching and learning materials
        d)      textbooks and reference materials for the school library (MOEwill promote
                measures to allow longer accessibility o f the library to students).


2.2     PROVISIONOF REFERENCEMATERIALSTO NEWTEACHERSOF CDSS

To ensure that the quality pre-service training o f the new teachers can make the expected impact
inthe CDSS classroom, the project wouldprovide to all graduating secondary levelteachers
(about 250 over the period o f the project) a package, complementary to the CIDA-financed



                                                 46

SSTEP, o f materials consisting o fbasic references, best practices inclassroom management,
effective pedagogy, and classroom-based assessmento f student progress.

Specific Obiectives
The specific objective o fthis sub-component is to improve the conditions o flearning and
teaching inthose CDSSs where newly graduated secondary teachers will be posted. They will
have the possibility to applywhat they have learnedduringtheir pre-service training. By
inference, this sub-component will improve the learning outcomes o f CDSS students.

Activities

The project would provide textbooks and teachers' guides for about 250 graduating secondary
teachers over the period o f the project.

COMPONENT 3: MITIGATINGEXTERNALITIESAFFECTINGTHE QUALITY OF
EDUCATION(SchoolHealthandNutrition)

Backnround
As a result of poor food intake before the age o f three years, more than halfthe children in
Malawi are stuntedwhen they reach school age. Stuntinginchildren delays their enrollment in
school because parents assume they are too small to walk to school. When children finally enroll
inschool, many arenot only stuntedbutare also underweight anddeficient inmicronutrients and
this furtherreduces schoolperformance andattendance. For example, bothironandiodine
deficiencies compromise ability to learn, andvitaminA and zinc deficiencies increase the
severity of certain illness, such as malaria, thus increasing the amount of time pupils spend away
from classrooms.

Obiectives
To address the poor health andnutritional status o fprimary school children and its negative
effect on the education system, this component will provide a health andnutrition package o f
cost-effective interventions through the primary school system. This activity will result ina
reduction o f school absenteeism, particularly at the lower primary grades, and better learning
performance.

Activities
There are three major activities inthis component: (a) buildcapacity o fMinistryo f (MOE) and
other relevant ministries to plan, implement and evaluate school health and nutrition programs;
(b) increase support for, and coordinationof, school health andnutrition interventions among
relevant Ministries, donors and civil society; and (c) ensure the effective delivery o f a school
health and nutritionpackage o f cost-effective interventions to children attending primaryschool.

School health and nutrition has been an area o f concem inMalawi for some time. A School
Health andNutrition (SHN) policy i s indraft and in 1998MOE created the post o f S H N
Coordinator. S H N activities are being supportedand implemented by a number o f different
organizations, with support from MOE, throughout the country, but there i s currently no program
available for all children attending primary school. This component will support building
capacity inMOE and other relevant ministries to plan, implement and evaluate a national S H N


                                                  47

program. The component will also support capacity buildingthrough selected training and study
tours that will increase awareness and knowledge about implementing S H N programs. Activities
on the S H N component will be reported on a regular basis to the Task Force on Nutrition-the
group responsible for coordinating and sharinginformation on nutrition activities inthe country.

The school health and nutrition package has been refinedthrough consultations with
government, donors and civil society. It will be deliveredto primary school children inMalawi
and includes the following:

        Control o f helminthinfections through twice-yearly de-worming
        Control o f bilharzia infection through twice-yearly treatment
        Control o f vitamin A deficiency through twice-yearly distribution
        Control o f anemia byproviding iron-folic acid supplementsweekly
        Treatment for malaria
        Treatment for fever and headache
        Behavior change communications to promote good health and nutritionpractices (e.g.,
        improve sanitation and food intake and decrease infectious disease transmission).
    a   Twice-yearly school testingfor iodine insalt to promote the use o f iodized salt by
        families

Implementation Arrangements
The Ministryo fEducation(MOE) will leadand implement the component but other relevant
Ministries (e.g., Health, Gender, Agriculture, Economic Planning and Development) will be
involved inthe planning and implementation activities. A school health and nutrition component
manager (CM) will be hiredbyM O E to lead and coordinate this activity. Civil society will be
involved through the village head and school management committees.

The package o f interventions will be delivered through twice-yearly campaigns and through
routine activitieshervices at schools throughout the school year. Relevant representatives from
government, donors and civil society will be oriented on the component, andtrainers ineach
district will identify teachers to train to deliver the package duringcampaigns and duringroutine
services. Teachers will be assisted during campaigns by staff from the Ministryo f Health and
duringthe school year through supervision visits from staff from Ministries o fEducation and
Health.

Social mobilization will be conductedbefore each campaign to raise awareness about the
campaign and encourage parentsto send their children to school on the day o f the campaign.
Social mobilization will be conducted through mass media messages and by community-based
organizations, where they exist. Behavior change activities (e.g., nutrition education messages)
will beused throughout the program to promote dietary improvement o f school children and
their families.

Itis anticipated that procurement ofmedications andmicronutrients will bethroughUNICEF; it
can provide competitive prices for drugs and nutritionsupplements but further investigation
regarding this i s needed. Delivery o f the medications andmicronutrients to the district level will



                                                    48

take place twice yearly, several weeks before each campaignto District hospitals and then to
health clinics throughout the district.

Monitoring and Evaluation
As a proxy for providing a school health and nutrition package and improved health and
nutritional status o f primary school children, the following Development Objective was
identified: Effectively deliver a school health and nutritionpackage to at least 80% ofprimary
school children under the age of 10years by 2010.

This component will be evaluated for changes inthe health and nutritionstatus andschool
performance (e.g., attendance) of primary school children. Since all schools will receive the S H N
package, there will be no control group for the program and change will be measuredusing
cross-sectional baseline and end-line surveys. M O E and Ministry o f Healthwill take the lead in
planning, designing, organizing, and executing the baseline survey before project effectiveness.
Activities for this component also will be monitored byteachers andtheir supervisors (e.g.,
coverage o f students receiving the package during the campaigns, children treated for malaria
throughout the school year, etc.).

The project will finance:

        a) the cost o f the nutrition package delivered to primarypupils
        b) capacitybuildingthrough training programs for MOE staff andpersons involvedin
            the execution o fthe component
        c) study tours to observe similar programs inother countries o fthe region
        d) sensitizationandinformation campaigns
        e) workshops and seminars


COMPONENT 4: DIRECT SUPPORT TO SCHOOLS CDSS)

Specific Objectives
The Direct Support to Primary Schools Programhas two main objectives: i)to support the
decentralisation o fthe management o fprimary education, with direct involvement o f schools and
communities, inline with the decentralizationpolicy o f the Government, and ii)to improve the
quality o fprimary education at the school level by supplyingbasic learning materials to students,
teachers and schools.

It is widely documented that the direct involvement o f school administration andcommunities in
managing their own resources leads to improved results and increases the accountability and
sustainability o f educational programs. Inthe case of the DSS program, the objective i s also to
improve the quality ofprimary educationby supplyingbasic learning materials directlyto
schools. The schools and communities (the last through the school committee) are responsible
for deciding which materials to purchase . The list i s restricted to basic materials inorder to
focus on providing schools with essential learning materials, not widely available (and to reduce
the private costs to parents), for example, blackboards, chalk, pens, pencils, exercise books,
maps, etc.



                                                  49

Activities
Inorder to implement the DSS Programanumber ofactivities needto take placeprior, and after,
disbursement o f funds.

Insummary, the following activitieswillbefinancedundertheproject:

       a) Technical assistance for the design o f information and campaignmaterials (examples:
            manuals, brochures, radio andnewspapers spots, calendars, posters);
       b) Technical assistanceto coordinate implementation o fthe program during its initial
            years;
       c) Printingand distribution o fthe information materials;
       d) Training o f staff at central, division anddistrict level;
       e) Media campaign inthe newspapers andradio;
       f) Disbursement o f a grant per primary school and district office twice each year (average
            200 USDper schools);
       g) Contracting and undertakingan independent process evaluation o fthe progam after
            each stage of its implementation.

Implementation Arrangements
The programwill be introducedat national level intwo phases. The first phase, financed under
the project, will cover about 50% o f all primary schools within the boundaries o f the 34
education districts o fthe country. The districts are responsible for submittingto the Ministry
criteria for selecting schools that will receive the grants. Some donors have expressed some
initial interest inpooling funds to extend the grants to more schools. This pooling arrangement
could assist the Ministry incovering additional schools beyond the targets o fthe project.
M O E has the overall responsibility for implementation o f the Direct Support to Primary Schools
Program. However, the various administrative institutional levels have differentresponsibilities
interms ofits implementation. At centrallevel, MOEis responsible for: i)preparingthe detailed
list o f eligible schools, according to criteria decided for allocating these resources; ii)deciding
on the type and scope o f the information campaign andpreparing the materials necessary for the
campaign, implementation o fthe program and contracting the necessary technical assistance; iii)
settingup the financial management reporting system; iv) providing training for the required
participants at division and district levels; and v) contracting anindependent evaluation after
each stage of program implementation.

The division education office i s responsible for distributing the implementation materials to the
district level and monitoring the programwithinthe context o f other monitoring activities.

The district education office is responsible for: i)opening the bank accounts and sendingthe
relevant information to the Ministry;ii)informingthe schools about the program and distributing
the information materials; iii)issuingthe checks to each school; andiv) keeping the financial
records for each school and monitoring implementation o f the program inthe context of other
monitoring activities.




                                                    50

The primary schools andthe communities are responsible for decidinghow to use the funds, for
withdrawing the funds andpurchasingthe materials. Inaddition, they are responsible for keeping
a record o f the materials purchased, together with the approved forms used. Detailed
implementation guidelines are shown inthe Project ImplementationManual (PIM).

Monitoring, and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluation activities will comprise; a) aprocess evaluationundertaken by an
independentcompany; b) aregular monitoringby the Ministry andits decentralized offices; and,
c) a financial auditing which will be part o fthe general financial auditing o f the project. A
complete and systematic process evaluationo f each implementation stage o fthe program will be
conducted by an independent company, contracted by MOE according to Bankprocurement
guidelines. The main objective o f the process evaluation is to assess how the different steps
required for implementing the program were followed by the different stakeholders, andthe level
of satisfaction with the program. The various administrative levels o fMOE will integrate the
monitoring o fthe program inthe context o f other monitoring activities beingundertaken during
the year. Finally, the financial auditing will be undertakeninthe context o f the financial auditing
o f the project and the results will bepresented inthe progress reports preparedby EDMU.

                    MALAWI: MalawiEducationSector SupportProject1


The Ministryo f Education(MOE) will be the mainimplementation agency for the
project, on behalfo f the Government o fMalawi. A Project Steering Committee (PSC)
chairedby the Minister (or Deputy Minister), will beresponsible for overseeing project
implementation, andprovide overall guidance, particularly onpolicy issues and activities.
The PSC will comprise the Directors o fDepartments and Institutes, heads of tertiary
institution including universities, a representative o f the Secretary o f the Treasury,
development partners and other stakeholders who will be co-opted for special issues as
needed.

A Technical Committee, chaired bythe Permanent Secretary o fthe Ministry, will meet
regularly (at least once every two months) to review indetail the implementation o f the
various project sub-components, andto facilitate the resolution o f any practical problems
that might arise duringproject implementation. The Technical Committee will comprise
all component managers, representatives o f the institutions involved inthe execution o f
the project, andEDMU.

Component Managers have been appointed for each component; they are responsible for
monitoring the day-to-day implementation o fthe respective components. The component
manager for Component 1i s responsible for liaising with the two universities and for
monitoring the implementation o f their sub-components. The annual Joint Sector Review,
organized by the Ministry, all development partners andNGOs to the education sector
will also reviewprogress implementation and, particularly, the achievement o fproject
objectives.
                   $


Procurement o f works, goods and services for the project will be undertakenby the
EDMU,which has developedthe capacity and experience inprocurement and financial
management through its involvement inthe SEP. Inaddition, the two universities
involved inthe ESSUP have a degree o f expertise inprocuring goods, and also some
executing and supervising capacity for small works, mainly repairs. However, inrecent
years none o f the institutions have managed major civil works activities or complex
goods and services procurement o f the type and size to beprovided under the ESSUP.
Thus, it i s envisaged that the procurement process will bemanagedby EDMU.
Nevertheless it i s essential that the institutions be involved inall stages o fprocurement,
inorder to enhance ownership oftheproject, improve understandingandtransparency of
procedures, and strengthen operation and maintenance capacity within the universities.
Accordingly, it i s proposedthat a working group be set up for each o f the three
institutions (Mzuzu University, University o f Malawi Chancellor College and
Polytechnic) to implement the civil works, goods and services aspects o f the respective
sub-components. The group will be headed by a senior EDMUtechnical staff member,
and supported by relevant technical, costing and procurement specialists (EDMUand/or
hiredconsultancy services).

Underthe DSS component, distributionof funds at the school levelwill beundertaken
through the District Education Offices. Implementationo f this component will be carried
out at the divisional, district and school levels andwill include the school committees
selected by the local communities. Since the project will need to develop capacity for the
implementation o f this component andfor the related new responsibilities at divisional,
district, school and community levels, it will include funds for all the relevant training
activities.

MOEwill leadand implementthe SHN component. Other relevantMinistries (e.g.
Health, Gender, Agriculture, Economic Planning andDevelopment) will be involved in
planningandimplementation activities. Civil society will also be involvedthrough the
village head and the school management committees. The package o f interventions will
be delivered through twice-yearly campaigns, and routine activities at the school level.
Trainers in each district will identify teachers to be trained to deliver the package.
Teachers will be assisted by staff from the Ministry o f Health andMOE.

Details on flow o f funds for the project are contained inAnnex 7.

Summaryof FinancialManagementCapacityAssessment

The Malawi Education Sector Support Project will be implementedina medium to highrisk
environment, Whilst this project i s a follow up to the Secondary School EducationProject
implementedby the EducationDevelopment Management Unit (EDMU) which hadrobust
financial management systems and excellent accounting staff o frequisite capacity to implement
a project o f this nature, the grant component to schools at district and community level is what
increases the risk to funds made available for this project. The two colleges o fthe University o f
Malawi (Chancellor College andPolytechnic) and the MzuzuUniversity, which are beneficiaries
o f the project, pose another risk inthat they have rudimentary accounting systems andincertain
cases weak capacity too.

At national level, the 2003 CountryFinancial Accountability Assessments(CFAA) andthe 2001
Public Expenditure Review(PER) outline problems o fbudget execution inensuringthat the
allocated resources are utilized efficiently for the intendedpurposes andinobtaining comfort
that value for money has been achieved. Inadequate linkages between policies andbudget
processes have made it impossible to measure outputs from activities where resources have been
utilized. Lack o f compliance with established financial regulations have renderedineffective all
forms o f intemal control inthe public sector making the existing systems even weaker.

A financial management capacity assessment o f EDMUwhichis the mainimplementing and
coordinating agency o fthis project, andthat o f Chancellor College, The Polytechnic andMzuzu
University were carried out inApril 2004 usingBank Guidelines issued by the Financial
Management Sector Board on October 15,2003. No attempt was made to carry out a financial
management capacity assessment o f sample schools which would be eligible for grants inany
district as the results o f doing so would have been obvious-weak capacity. The capacity o f the
EDMU,themainBank interlocutor onthe project, was assessedas acceptable thoughthe number
o f staff and their levels and structure o f the accounting department does not fit the
implementation o f a project o f this nature.

The major risks arising from the assessment include low capacity for accounting at school and
community level to properly account for such funds. This will be further exacerbated by some
flexibility inthe fund usage at school level, which may subject such funds to abuse. Owing to
lack o f identities inMalawi, the paying bank may pay to fraudulent people who may wish to
disguise as a representatives o f the Parents and Teachers Association (PTA) where the school i s
not careful with chequebook storage. Another major risk may be accountability o f funds at
school level where some level o f arrears on different expenditures have been accumulated owing
to inadequate hnding from the Ministryo f Education andproject funds at school maybe subject
to usingthem for clearing the arrears as funds are fungible. While the Malawi Savings Bank
(MSB) has branches inall districts and has been chosen to maintain school bank accounts, it
mustbe appreciated insome district it uses the Malawi Postal Corporation (MPC). Owingto
cash problems the MPC faces, it uses some o fthe deposits made to it by MSB customers which
inthis casewould include school accounts.




                                                    61

The following actions are necessary to mitigate some o f the risks outlined above:

   0   PTA and the school should keep simple memorandum accounts for all their expenditures.
       All such expenditures shouldbe authorized bythe School Committee.

   0   An attempt shouldbemadeto ensurethat all members o fPTA and School Committee
       have simpleidentitycards for presentation to Banks. Once a member has beenremoved
       such identity should be withdrawn. Where possible such membersshould compliment
       their identity cards bytheir passports.

   0   Each expenditure should bemade by check and should be signed at each time by one
       member ofthe School Committee and by the headmaster or his deputy.

   0   The Ministry o f Education shouldhave a Memorandum o fUnderstanding with the
       Malawi Savings Bank preventing its agent, MPC, from misusingschool funds.

   0   Besides the mitigation factors outlined above, the following steps should be undertaken
       to facilitate appraisal and subsequent processes o f the project cycle:

   0   Developing a specific chart o f accounts for the project inits FinancialManagement
       Accounting Handbook (currently inplace) andto reflect this particular project's
       transactions, BudgetCodes to reflect project expenditures through IDA and government
       contribution.

   0   Reviewthe current structure o fthe accounts department o fEDMU,upgrade some o fthe
       people therein, and determine expansion.

   0   Develop terms o f reference for a project internal auditor to work on project issues and in
       close collaboration with the internal auditors o fthe Ministry o f Education.

   0   Develop terms o f reference for a Finance Sub-committee o f the Project Steering
       Committee.

   0   Develop terms o f reference for the auditor o fthe project.

InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements

The implementer of the project i s the Ministry o f Education throughthe EDMU.A Project
Steering Committee (PSC) has been set up chairedby the Minister (or DeputyMinister) and
comprising the directors of departments and Institutes, heads o f tertiary institutions including
universities, a representative o f the Secretary to the Treasury, development partners and other
stakeholders who will be co-opted for special issues as needed. Implementationo f the
components will be done by the various entities involved inthe project but disbursementswill be
done at EDMUlevel. The PTA will provide oversight functions over the school feeding
program as well as the direct support to schools component by holding the committees
responsible accountable for fund usage.

Budgetary andAccountingSystem

The Budget structure for the government o f Malawi i s divided into recurrent and development.
The budget is operatedon a cashbudget system. Guidance for its formulation is currently
govemedby the PublicFinance Management Act assistedby Treasury circulars. The Act
stipulates various accounting requirements from government entities which are vote centers and
government-managedprojects ingeneral. The instructions define reporting requirements,
responsibilities and level o f authority within each Ministryand the types o fbooks to be
maintained for purposes o f accountability relating to budgetimplementation. The Treasury
instructions and circulars require all government ministries to submit monthly expenditure
retums which are used as a tool for monitoring budget execution. The report outlines
expenditures incurred duringthe month, against budget, variance from budget, commitments
made and cash balances intheir holding accounts at the Reserve Bank o f Malawi at the end o f
such months.

The recurrent budget preparationcycle formally begins whenthe Ministryo fFinance issues a
Treasury circular advisingministries to start preparing their budgets. Overall themes and
priorities for the budget are communicated inthis and subsequent Treasury circulars. Budgets are
revised, aggregated and merged into one document, and final adjustments are made before
presentationto Parliament.

The development budgetis a summary o f investment expenditures, comprising mostly o f capital
and supporting operating costs. It accounts for close to forty percent o f national budget. Most o f
development budget inMalawi i s donor funded.

The preparation o findividual ministrybudgets is supposed to be done through Activity Based
Budgeting(ABB).ABB was introduced as part o fthe MTEFreforms inorder to facilitate the
implementation o f prioritization bythe MTEFprocess and to enable improved monitoring o f
expenditure. ABB i s intendedto reflect the new output focus o fpublic expenditure management.
Inaddition, ABB allows for abottom-up approach to budgetingsince individual activity based
budgetsare preparedby cost center managers.

The draft budget document i s sent to Parliament for further review, approval and the passing o f
the Appropriation Act authorizing government to draw funds from the Consolidated Fund.
Treasury consolidates and draws up the approved budget. The Minister o f Finance issues a
General Warrant authorizing the Controlling Officers to incur expenditure on the approved
budgets.Ifpassing o fthe Appropriation Act is delayedbyParliament, the Minister o fFinance is
allowed to issue a Special Warrant authorizing Controlling officers to incur limited expenditure
on their budgets up to three months subject to the passingo fthe Appropriation Act. Whenthe
Appropriation Act i s passed, a General Warrant supersedes the Special Warrant.

FundsFlow

The Project will use financial management, disbursement andreporting arrangementsthat are
consistent with the guidance provided inthe "Financial MonitoringReports" guidelines issued by
the Operations Policy and Country Services inNovember 2001 for the entire life o f the project
and the World Banks DisbursementHandbook inconjunction with the Financial Reporting and



                                                  63

AuditingHandbook, (FARAH)issuedin 1985for the first year o fthe project. EDMUhas
agreed on producing Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) from the start o f the project which
will beusedas abasis o f disbursements. These reports havebeenreviewed andconsidered
satisfactory.

The flow o f funds for this project has been agreed as follows:

    a) Funds to the Malawi Government under this project will be maintained ina grant account
        at the World Bank. They will bemaintained inSpecial DrawingRights. Such funds will
       be accessedthrough a special account maintained at a local commercial bank inMalawi.
        The size of the special account will be determined bythe projects cash flow forecast for
        the period.

    b) The funds obtained from the grant through the special account will flow into aKwacha
        operational account where the foreign currency will be converted into local currency at a
        rate o f exchange ruling on the day ofthe transfer.

    c) Funds from an operating account will be disbursed; i)for expenditures o fvarious
        categories o f a number o f components for the project paid at EDMU; and ii)grants to
        schools will be paid direct into school account at a Malawi Savings Bank o f the district.

    d) A small pool account to which a number of donors will disbursetheir contribution for
        direct support to schools (and eventually school nutrition) could also be opened ina local
        commercial bank. This account will be opened inforeign currency. Disbursements into
        the foreign currency account will be made on a quarterly basis bythe pool donors.
        Transfers will be made from the pool account into a Kwacha account out o f which
        disbursements to schools and other supported activities will be made. Beneficiaries from
        this pool account will have to submit quarterly returns as part o fthe FMRs as a measure
        o f accountability on the usage o f funds. Disbursements for foreign purchases will be
        made from this account.

InternalAudit

The MOEhas an internal audit function whose mainobjective is to assist management improve
the level o f internal control inthe ministry. The capacity o fthe unit was assessedand found to be
inadequate. More staff needs to be employed to fillthe more than 80% vacancy rate init and
perform its program on a risk-based approach. Inthe circumstances and the nature o f
transactions that will transcend the schools, it i s suggested that a qualified internal auditor be
engaged for the project. H i s terms of reference were developed and shared with the head o f the
internal audit unit inthe Ministry before negotiations.




                                                   64

FinancialReportingFormats

Theproject will prepare andproduce quarterly FinancialMonitoringReports (FMRs).These
reports will comprise a financial, output monitoring andprocurement reports. They will also
provide information on the progress o fthe project interms o f financial activity, key output
measures andprocurement for the relevant period. As for the financial reports, they shall include
statement showing for the period and cumulatively cash receipts by sources and expenditures by
main expenditures classification, beginningand ending cash balances o f the program, and
supporting schedules comparing actual andplannedexpenditures. The reporting line items inthe
FMRswill follow theprograms chart o faccounts. The cumulative FMRsover theproject year
will be consolidated andused as the project financial statements. This will result ina more cost
effective reporting.

As for output reports, the programwill include anarrative write up and output indicators linking
financial information with activity indicators andhighlight issues that require attention. In
procurement reports under the FMRs, such reports will provide information on the procurement
o f goods.

The currency o f the FMRswill be the Malawi Kwacha with the equivalent indollars as a parallel
column. This will become beneficial since the books o f accounts for the project will be kept in
Kwacha, those o f the special account will be indollars, which will give rise to issues of
translation. The FMRpreparation and submissionwill be done on a quarterly basis. These FMRs
will be used as a basis o f disbursements. The reports will be submitted to the Task Team Leader
within45 days o fthe reporting period. Ifsuch FMRs are notprovidedtimely, the Task Team
Leader will follow this up with the project unit at EDMUto determine the reason for the delay
andplanneddate for submission. Late submissionmayresult inthe application o f legal remedies
for non-compliance.

CounterpartContribution

There are no counterpart contributions required.

Audit Arrangements

Audit o fPublicEnterprises which include government ministries, programs andprojectsis the
responsibility o f the National Audit Office inMalawi as articulated inthe Constitution o f the
Republic and the Public Finance Management Act. The National Audit Office uses International
Organization o f Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) standards when carrying out its audits.
Annual and semi-annual audits o fthe project will be carried out by a private auditor acceptable
to IDA and other cooperatingpartners participating inthe small pool. The draft terms o f
reference for carryingout the two types o f audits should be submitted to IDA for review. The
annual audit will assess whether; i)the information infinancial statements i s fairly presented for
the specifiedperiod and cumulatively; ii)reported disbursements were made inaccordance with
the Grant Agreement; and iii)whether expenditures as reported are appropriately supportedby
adequate related documentation.

Owingto the number of components andthe number o fplayers (especially the participation o f a
number o f schools at district level), it shallbe arequirement that separate semi-annual audits be


                                                  65

carried out for the Health and NutritionandDSS components. Regular internal control checks
should be carried out to ensure compliance with financial covenants, operation o f special
account, efficiency and effectiveness o fmanagement inachieving the objectives o fthe project,
budgetary control systems andperformance o f the management o fthe finance, accounting, and
an evaluation o fhow the several cost centers inthe way o f schools and communities are
managing finances and exercisingrequisite internal controls within their unit. These semi-
annual audits will be carried out for respective six months periods as agreed with the IDA and
the cooperating partners for poolparticipants, and audit reports will be furnished to the
cooperating partners no later than two months after the end o f the relevant six month period.

DisbursementArrangements

MOE shall open two-dollar account. Onewill be a Special account and another dollar account at
a local commercial bank to be calledproject pool account. Upon satisfying quarterly release
requirements, IDA will disburseinto the Special Account to be maintained ina local commercial
bank and a portion o fthe funds required for the quarter will be released into a pool account to be
maintained at a local commercialbank. The Government's o f Malawi quarterly release will also
be made into a separate local operating account, and another portion o f its contribution into a
local operating pool account before the cooperatingpartner release o f their portion. A pooled
local account will also be opened into which funds will betransferred from the pool dollar
account for disbursementsfor various uses.

SpecialAccount

The project will havetwo Special Accounts (SA) which will be opened through the Ministryo f
Finance ina local commercial bank o f its choice. All requisite disbursement documentation,
whether relating to reimbursementthrough statement o f expenditures, direct payments, special
account replenishments, or special commitments documentationwill be initiated andkept by
EDMU. IDA shouldbe informedo fthe special account opening inthe commercial bankand
will deposit funds with the account once the project is declared effective.

Withdrawal application for reimbursement, direct payment instructions, and other disbursement
requests will originate from EDMUandbe endorsed by the Ministryo f Finance (MOF) Claims
Unit,who will sendthemto IDA. Paymentinstructions direct to supplierswillbe sent through
the same route through commercial banks, as pursuant to IDAinstructions.

Uponreview and approval o f submitted withdrawal applications, or payment instructions, the
IDA'STreasuryDepartmentwillpaygrant funds beingreimbursedinto the project's Special
Account at a commercial bank. Such funds will thenbe transferred from the Special Account.
The bank where the project accounts are maintained, shall submit a letter o f comfort on Bank
funds from its headquarters to IDA.For the pool account, releases into it will be done on a
quarterly basis based on the financing plan o f the activities to be undertaken and the level o f
accountability.

Uponreceipt o f such funds bythe commercial bank from IDA through the Special Accounts, the
bank shall immediately notify the Ministryo f Finance about the receipt. The Ministry o f
Finance shall immediately issue a note called Credit Ceiling Authority (CCA) to the project's



                                                 66

bankstotaling the sums received. The purpose o fthe note is to informthe local commercial
bank that the project i s allowed for the period to issue out checks not exceeding the amount
advised, pending receipt o f some more h d s which would necessitate issuance o f another credit
limit increasingthe limit for expenditure for theproject.

Payments paidthrough the local accounts and all related documentationwill be maintained by
EDMUfor review by auditors andIDAimplementation support missions. Uponreceipt ofthe
commercial bank statements, the project accountant shall reconcile the bank accounts before
submittingthe FMRto be also usedas a withdrawal application to the Ministry ofFinancefor
onward transmission through the commercial bank to IDA.

The SAs will be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDAwhich would be appointed
prior to grant effectiveness based on an audit scope as contained interms o f reference acceptable
to IDA. The audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank six months after the end o f each
fiscal year from review. One opinion shall be issued on the FMRs consolidated for the project for
the year.

Malawi's ProcurementEnvironment

1.       Malawi is inthe process o fprocurement reforms. A new Public Procurement Act became
effective inAugust, 2003. The main considerations guidingthe provisions inthe Act are transparency,
efficiency and economy; accountability; fair opportunity to all bidders; prevention o f fraud, corruption
and other malpractices; and to promote local capacity. The final version o f the Public Procurement Act i s
assessed as a good UNICTRAL-based procurement law. The Act will be supplemented by regulations,
desk manuals and standardprocurement documents. The final version o f the procurement regulations i s
being reviewedby the government legal department. The Standard Tender Documents are yet to be
prepared. The Act defines methods o fprocurement and conditions for their use; the mainprinciples and
procedures for methods o fprocurement; the establishment o f the Office o f Director o f Public
Procurement with oversight for public procurement; the establishment o f Internal Procurement
Committees (IPCs) ineach Ministry,Department and Para-statal; andreview procedures. The Director o f
the Office o fPublic Procurement was appointedinMarch2004. Other DoPP staff are expectedto be
appointed from July 1,2005 onwards following Ministryo f Finance confirmation. The Act i s generally
consistent with good public procurement practice and includes provisions for: (i)   effective and wide
advertisingo f upcomingprocurement opportunities; (ii)    public opening o fbids; (iii)pre-disclosure of all
relevant information including transparent and clear bid evaluation and contract award procedures; (iv)
clear accountabilities for decision making; and (v) an enforceable right o f review for bidders when public
entities breachthe rules. A draft Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) was discussedat a
workshop from M a y 12-13,2004 and the Final CPAR with the Action Plans agreed duringthe workshop
was finalized by June 2004. The key action o f the CPAR, the implementation o f the Public Procurement
Act, operationalization o f the Public Procurement Institutions (Office o f the Director o f Public
Procurement, Internal Procurement Committees, Specialized Procurement Units)are part o f the triggers
for the Fiscal ManagementProgram and Accelerating Growth ProgramProject which was approved by
the Board inApril 2004.

Use of WorldBankGuidelines
2.       All works and goods financed under the IDA grant will be procured inaccordance withthe
Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,May 2004. Consultants will be selected in
accordance with the Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers,
May 2004. NationalCompetitiveBidding(NCB) procedureswill beinaccordancewiththe Public
Procurement Act and will include; i)anexplicit statement to bidders o fthe evaluationand award
criteria; ii)national advertisingwith public bid opening; iii)award to the lowest evaluated responsive and
qualified bidder; and iv) foreign bidders would not be precluded from participationinNCB. Registration/
Classification o f contractors may be used for establishing bidder qualification or for preparing a list for
use under price comparison procedure but not as criteria for bidding.With the exception o f complex
information systems, the merit point system shall not be used as the basis o f bid evaluation. "Bracketing"
or rejection o fbids outside a range or "bracket" o fbidvalues shall not be permitted.

3.       The IDA'SStandard BiddingDocuments (SBD) will be used for all International Competitive
Bidding(ICB) and, with appropriate modification, for allNCB untilacceptable national standardbidding
documents become effective. The IDA'SStandard Request for Proposals (SRFP) would be used for all
consulting assignments. The EDMUshould ensure that each time they are usingthe most current version
o f the appropriate SBD or SRFP and standard forms o f evaluation. Less competitive biddingand selection
procedures should not be used as an expedient to by-pass more competitive methods and fractioning o f




                                                     68

large procurements into smaller ones should not be done solely to allow the use o f less competitive
methods or to avoid IDA review.

Advertising

4.      A General Procurement Notice (GPN) i s mandatory and will be published inthe UN
Development Business as provided under the Guidelines. The GPN would show all I C B and all
consulting services estimated to cost USD 100,000 or more. Specific Procurement Notices (SPN) will be
required for contracts to be procuredunder ICB and NCB procedures and for consultant contracts
(estimated to cost U S D 200,000 or more) to obtain expressions o f interest (EOI) prior to the preparation
of the shortlist. The SPNs will be published ina newspaper o f wide national circulation. All ICBs and
Consultant contracts estimated to cost USD 200,000 or more shall be advertised inDevelopment Business
online and inDevelopment Gateway's dgMarket. Sufficient time would be allowed (not less than six
weeks for ICB and not less than 30 days for NCB and 14 days for EOI) to allow adequate time for bidders
and consultants to obtain documents andrespondappropriately.

Procurement Capacity

5.      MOEthrough EDMUwill carry out procurement under this project. EDMUhas been carrying out
procurement for the Secondary EducationProject (SEP) since 1998 to date. An update o fthe procurement
capacity o f EDMUwas carried out inMay/June 2004. Duringthe period o f SEP implementationEDMU
has had at least three procurement Officers who have since left and it now has one Procurement Specialist
who i s being assisted by two engineers. This Procurement Specialist joined EDMUinMarch2004 even
though he was once part o f the EDMUstaff two years before. The Procurement Specialist i s adequately
qualified and has several years procurement experience. However the work load inthe new project may
be too heavy such that he would needhelp to ensure that the project has adequate procurement capacity.
An Independent Procurement review (IPR) o fthe ongoing Secondary EducationProjecthas also been
conducted inM a y 2004. Some o f the key findings are: i)Recordkeeping for consulting services i s
inadequate; ii)Delays incivil works contract implementation; iii)Delays ingoods contracts
implementation especially textbooks; and iv) Delays inevaluation and award of contracts.

Withregardto mitigating procurement capacity deficiency, EDMUwill require to ensure the following: i)
The Procurement Specialist should get training inprocurement o f textbooks; ii)One o fthe two engineers
who have been helping on procurement will take full responsibility for procurement o f works and
selection o f consultants; iii)The two engineers handling procurement o fworks and consultant services
should undergo advanced works procurementtraining; and iv) The project will recruit a Junior
Procurement person to support the procurement specialist and maintain good procurementrecords.

Procurement Plans

6.      MOEprepared a procurement planfor the first 18 months o fthe life o fthe project which was
approved by IDAbefore negotiations. The procurementplan shows individual contract packages, their
estimated cost, procurement methods, whether domestic preference will apply or not, pre or post-
qualification and estimated bid opening dates. Once approved the procurementplan shall be updated
regularly (at least once a year). As a result o f the delay inpresenting this project to the Board, the
procurementplan was updated inMarch 2005 following IDA no objection. Immediately upon approval
of the Project, with the borrower's agreement, the plan will be published on the website, inthe Project's
data base and Bank's extemal web-site. Main ICB and consulting contracts expected during the first 18
months o f Project implementation are summarized inthe tables below.

Contract ManagementandExpenditureReports

7.       As part o f the FMR, EDMUwill submit 6-monthly reports to IDAnot more than three calendar
months after the end of every semester. The FMR should include the status o f (i)    implementation o f the
procurementplan, and (ii)   contract management and expenditures on contracts.

ScopeofProcurementandProcurementmethods

8.       Contracts for civil works estimated to cost individually USD 600,000 or more will be procured
usingICBprocedures. Works estimated to cost the equivalent o fUSD 50,000 andbelow USD 600,000
equivalent per contract; may be procuredusingN C B procedures. Very small contracts estimated to cost
less than USD 50,000 equivalent may be procuredby way o f soliciting quotations through written
invitations from not less than three qualified contractors. RegistratiodClassificationo f contractors may be
used to identify contractors for such very small contracts. The invitation shall include a detailed
description o f the works, basic specifications, the required completion date, a simple form o f agreement
acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings. Inall cases the award o f contract shall be made to the
contractor who offers the lowest price for the requiredwork, and who has the experience and resources to
successfully complete the contract within the contract period taking into consideration all current/future
commitments. EDMUwill be required to carry out due diligence and verify that the qualification
informationprovided by the contractor recommended for the works i s accurate.

9.       To the extent possible, goods would be grouped into contract packages, andpackages estimated
to cost the equivalent o f USD 250,000 or more would be procuredunder ICB procedures. Procurement o f
goods packages estimated to cost more than USD 30,000 but less than U S D 250,000 may be procured
usingNCB procedures. Goods packages estimated to cost less than USD 30,000 may be procuredby
shoppingon the basis of comparison o f quotations from at least three eligible and qualified suppliers.
Requests for such quotations will include a clear descriptionand quantity o f the goods, as well as
requirements for delivery time and point o f delivery.

10.      Consulting Services and Training will consist o f various studies including architectural design
work, construction supervision and technical assistance for civil works management, policy studies to be
carried out by both national and international consultants. A s a rule, consulting firms for all assignments
estimated to cost the equivalent o f USD 100,000 or more will be selected though Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCBS) methodology. Alternatively, Selection Under a FixedBudget (SFB) or Least-Cost
Selection (LCS) procedures may be usedprovided the assignment meets the requirements o f paragraph
3.5 inthe case of SFB and paragraph 3.6 inthe case o f LCS. Assignments estimated to cost the
equivalent o f USD 100,000 or more would be advertised for EO1inDevelopment Business online
(UNDBonline), Development gateway's dgMarket and inat least one newspaper o fwide national
circulation. Inaddition, EO1for specialized assignments may be advertised inan internationalnewspaper
or technical magazine. The shortlist o f firms for assignments estimated to cost less than U S D 100,000
may be made up entirely o f national consultants ifat least three qualified firms are available at
competitive costs inMalawi. However, foreign consultants who wishto participate shouldnot be
excluded from consideration. Consultant services estimated to cost the equivalent o f USD 100,000 or less
may be contracted by comparing the qualifications o f consultants. Auditors would be selected usingLCS
procedures. Incase of assignments requiring individual consultants, the selection will follow the
procedures stipulated in Section V o f the Consultants Guidelines.

11,      Training programs and workshops would be packaged inthe project's work plans and budget and
items therein procuredusingappropriate methods. IDA will review and clear any training packages.




                                                       73

12.      Contracts under DSS sub-component, which meet the requirements o f paragraph 3.15 o f the
Procurement Guidelines may be procuredusingCommunity Participationprocedure.

IDA Review

13.     All works contracts estimatedto cost USD 300,000 or more and goods contracts estimated to cost
U S D 200,000 or more will be subject to the Bank's prior review in accordance with the procedures in
Appendix Io f the Procurement Guidelines. Any amendments to existing contracts raising their values to
levels equivalent or above the prior review thresholds are subject to IDA review. All contracts awarded
on basis o f direct contracting will require prior review and clearance o f IDA.

14.      All single source selection will be subject to IDApriorreview. Consultancy contracts with firms
with estimated value ofUSD 100,000 or more, and consultancy contracts with individuals estimated
value o f more than U S D 50,000 will be subject to prior review by the IDA inaccordance with the
procedures inAppendix Io f the Consultants Guidelines. Training/workshop programs will be subject to
IDAreview prior to implementation.

15.      Contracts which are not subject to prior review will be selectively reviewed by the Bank during
project implementationand will be govemedby the procedures set forth inparagraph 4 of Appendix Ito
the relevant Guidelines. Monitoring and Evaluationo f procurement performance would be carried out
duringIDA supervisionmissions and through annual ex-post procurement audits. At a minimum,20% o f
the contracts will be subject to post review. Annual independent technical audits (ex-post procurement
audits) would: i)verify that the procurement and contractingprocedures and processes followed for the
projects were inaccordance with the Development Grant Agreement (DGA); ii)verify technical
compliance, physical completion and price competitiveness o f each contract inthe selectedrepresentative
sample; iii)review and comment on contract administration and management issues as dealt with by
participating agencies; iv) reviewcapacity o f participating agencies inhandling procurementefficiently;
and v) identify improvementsinthe procurement process inthe light o f any identified deficiencies.

PublicationofResultsandDebriefing
 16.     Publication o fresults o fthe biddingprocess will be required for all ICBs,NCBs, L I B s and Direct
Contracting. Publication should take place as soon as the no objection i s received, except for Direct
Contracting and NCB, which may be done quarterly and ina simplified format. For selection o f
consultants, disclosure o f results i s also required. All consultants competing for the assignment should be
informed o f the result o f the technical evaluation (number o f points that each firmreceived) before the

 Background

 This annex presents the economic and fiscal impact analysesthat havebeen guidingthe
 preparation and appraisal o f the Malawi Education Sector Support Project 1.The annex includes
 three parts: a) Selection of a teacher training strategy; b) Analysis of the fiscal sustainability, and
 c) Cost-benefit analysis summary.

 SECTION A: SELECTION OF TEACHER TRAINING STRATEGY

 Inthe early stages of project identification, asimulationmodelwas developed incooperation
 with the Ministryto makeprojections for enrollment andteacher needs inprimaryand secondary
 education inMalawi. The analyses presented inthe following are based on this simulation
 model.

 Teachersfor Primary Education.The modelwas usedto analyze options for achieving the
 government's policy target6 of moving towards a pupilto qualified teacher ratio o f 1:60 by 2012,
 and 1:40 inthe foreseeable future. This analysis is basedon certain assumptions about
 population growth, pupilrepetition and dropout, and teacher attrition. As indicated inTable 1,
 enrollment is expected to grow at a somewhat slower pace than school-age population. This i s
 due to the assumption that the current highrepetition rate will decline over time, as teachers
 become increasinglyqualified, so that pupilswill move faster through the grades. It i s also
 assumed that dropout will decline over the projection period.


,As shown inTable 1, Malawiwill needto train substantial numbers o fprimary schoolteachers
 inthe coming years inorder to meettheir 2012 target. In2003, there were only about 32,000
 qualified primaryteachers, and this number would need to rise to 54,000 by 2012 to meet the
 target.

          Teacher attrition is assumedto be 6% per year for primary teachers.
          It i s assumed that grade repetitionwill decline from about an average of 17% per grade in2003 to 11% by 2012 (15%
          inStd. 1and 8, and 10% inthe others). Similarly, it is assumedthat student dropoutwill decline from 8% per grade in
          2003 to an average of 5% per grade by 2012.

The simulations show that the numberof graduates from primary teacher educationneeds to be
increased from the current about 2,000 per year to at least 4,000-5,000 per year inorder to reach
the policy targets by or soon after 2012. This can be achieved through a combination o f
improving capacity usage of existing colleges, increasingthe pass rate o f students, and
expanding college capacity.

Duringthe pre-appraisal mission inFebruary2004, the Government decidedto move forward
with the Option 4 presented inTable 2 (and referredto ina letter from GoM inAnnex l),                                 which
combines a pre-service teacher educationprogram for new teachers, with a distance-training
program for upgrading existing un-qualified teachers inthe system. With this option, the model
projects that the target of a qualified teacher pupilratio will be reached by 2011.This option
includes an expansion of college capacity of up to 2,000 bedspaces by 2007.

Option 2, which represents a more prudent scenario from a financial sustainability viewpoint,
would lead to 92% of teachers having receivedproper trainingby 2012, or a pupil qualified
teacher ratio o f 65:1.Inthis case, 60: 1would be achieved by 2014. The fiscal viability o fthese
teacher education strategies is analyzed in SectionB.

Teachers for Secondary Education.For secondary education, the policy targets -as expressed
inthePolicy InvestmentFramework (PIF)- areto reacha Gross Enrollment Rateof30% ofthe
primary school graduates (this target was accomplished soon after the preparationo fthe PIF) and


                                                                 78

to expand private secondary education to about 25% o f the total number o f secondary school
students (currently around 10-15% o f students are enrolled inprivate schools).
Data on enrollment insecondary school has varied significantly over the past few years; from
275,000 in2000 and295,000 in2001, to only 140,000 in2002 and 167,000 in2003. For the
purposes o f this analysis, an enrollment o f about 200,000 i s usedfor 2003 increasing graduallyto
300,000 by 2012. This corresponds to about 21% o f 14-17 year-old in2000 increasingto 26% o f
the same age group by 2012. Inthe simulation model, it is also assumed that enrollment in
private secondary reaches 25% o ftotal enrollment by 2012.

Teachers for TTCs. Qualified teachers are also needed for the existing and future primary
TTCs. Assuming a student teacher ratio o f 30:1,the total need for qualified teachers at these
colleges will be about 300 includingthe planned expansion o f 1-2 new TTCs.

Total need for teachers for secondary schools and TTCs. The simulations show that about
900 graduates from secondary teacher education are needed every year until2012, inorder to
reach a student qualified teacher ratio o f 40: 1insecondary schools and inorder to supply new
teachers to TTCs. After 2012, about 500 graduates are needed every year, unless further
expansion o fthe secondary school system will take place.

Sensitivity analysis: Impact of HIV/AIDS on Teacher Attrition. The annual attrition rates
usedinthe model are 6 percent (3 percent death related, 3 percent retirement and drop-out
related) for primary school teachers and 5 percent for secondary school teachers. These attrition
rates may be inthe lower end considering the HIV prevalencerate inMalawio f around 20
percent. According to the study "The Impact o f HIV/AIDS on Primaryand Secondary Schooling
inMalawi: Developinga Comprehensive Strategic Response", evidence fromthe HIV/AIDS
pandemic inUganda and Zambia suggests that the annual teacher attrition rate due to death could
increase to as much as 8 percent.

SECTION B: ANALYSIS OF FISCALIMPACT

The implementationof the selected teacher training strategy has an impact on the recurrent costs
of education intwo ways: a) the recurrent costs o f teacher training increase as more new teachers
are trained; b) the salary envelope for teachers grows as qualified teachers are paidhigher
salaries than un-qualified teachers. Inaddition, as the number o f school-age children i s expected
to grow over the projectionperiod, the need for teachers and thus the recurrent costs will
increase further.

ReducingInefficiencies.Hiringmore qualified teachers willbe costly for Malawi. Before
adding new teachers to the payroll, it should be made sure that existingresources are well spent.
Fortunately, the MoE -with the support o f donors- has beenconfronting the problem o fwastage
and inefficient spendingthrough improving the tracking o f resources throughout the system. An
illustration o f the results o fthis work i s that there i s now a good fit between the number o f
teachers on the payroll (based on payroll data) andthe number o fteachers reportedby schools
(basic education statistics); both are around 45,000-47.000 teachers. This means that there i s
probably not a significant wastage inthe teacher payroll; however, absenteeism o f teachers due
to poor accountability systems has beenwidely reported to be a problem, and this reduces the
effectiveness o f the public spendingon education.

Scenario "PolicyTargets": Table 4 presents an estimationofthe recurrent costs associatedwith
the teacher education strategies presented inSection A. The recurrent costs grow due to the need
for hiringmore teachers to accommodate the demographic growth andreduce the pupi1:teacher
ratios. The Table presents the costs o fboth Options 2 and4 o f Table 2.

Itappears that, due to a significant increase inthe teacher salary envelope, the recurrent
expenditureon education would needto increase to between4.2% (option 2) and 4.7% (option 4)
of GDP inorder to meet the policy targets. This corresponds to between 26% and 29% o f the
discretionary public budget (Le. minus interest on debt, andpension & gratuities), assuming the
discretionary recurrent budget is 16% o f GDP throughout the projectionperiod.

Scenario "Fiscal Sustainability":

Table 5 presents a fiscally sustainable scenario for expansion of the teaching force, definedas a
scenario, which does not exceed a recurrent cost for education o f 4% o f GDP inany year. The
scenario illustrates how much the pupilteacher ratio canbe improved within the fiscally
sustainable spending envelope, and how manyteacher graduates can be hiredevery year.




                                                                  81

Table 5:        EstimatedImpact on Recurrent Costsof Education: Scenario"Fiscal Sustainability"




Table 5 shows that, giventhe most likely growth scenarios, the Ministryi s unlikely to be capable
of hiringmore than approximately 4,000 new teachers each year until2012 - to make up for
teachers lost through attrition (approximately 3000 per year) andto gradually increase the total
stock o f teachers. According to the simulation model used for the preparation o f this project,
4,000 new teachers per year would ensure a PqTR of 67:l by2012. The number ofteachers
required to reduce the PqTRto 60:l by 2012 is approximately 5,000 per year - assuming that the
population of school-age children grows at about 2% per year and improvements inrepetition
anddropout rates ensue as aresult o fbetterquality.

Even inthe fiscally sustainable scenario, the total number ofteachers inprimary and secondary
will expand; this will impact on existing fiscal resources: government will need to allocate a
large share of their recurrent expenditure for education (about 4% o f GDP or 25% of the
discretionary recurrentbudget).At the same, government will need to be extremely prudent in
managing spending inthe education sector.

Table 6 and Table 7 provide more detailed projections ofnumber o f teachers trained each year in
the fiscally sustainable scenario, resulting improvements inpupil: qualified teacher ratios, and
ensuing recurrent costs o fprimary and secondary education, based on the simulation model.

SECTIONC: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS SUMMARY

The project i s expected to yield a series of benefits as the quality o fthe education systemi s
improved. Specifically, the following quantifiable impacts are expected:

          a) A highernumber o f children are expected to complete Primary School due to better-
              qualified teachers (result o f Comp. 1) the provision o fbasic learning material (Comp.
              4) and a higher extent ofparent involvement inschool management (Comp. 4). This


                                                   84

            cost-benefit analysis quantifies as a project benefit:the increased lifetime earnings o f
            children, who would otherwise not have completedprimary school.

       b) As a result ofthe project, it is expected that a numberof school-age childrenwill
            avert iron-deficiency. This analysis quantifies as a project benefit: the increased
            lifetime earnings o fthese individuals, as they avoid the lower productivity and
            intelligence inadulthood associated with iron-deficiency inchildhood (Comp. 3.)

The first o f these two types o fbenefits will come about as a result o fnot only ESSUP, but of a
widely supported government strategy to improve the quality o f education, o fwhich ESSUPis
one part. This benefit i s therefore comparedto the total costs o f implementingthis wider
strategy, i.e. government recurrent expenditure, ESSUP, and other investment costs.

Other Benefits not Quantified: Some out-of-school benefits from education accrue to society as a
whole rather than to individuals: public goods or externalities. InMalawi, some o f these benefits
may be: better income distribution, health and nutritional benefits o f educating particularly girls,
reduction ininfant and maternal mortality, reduced fertility. These benefits have not been
quantified inthis analysis, but could be significant.

Cost-Benefitof Components1and4: "Higher CompletionRatefor PrimaryEducation".
As the quality o fprimaryeducation is improved, it is expected that pupilswill advance faster
through the grades of primary as their leaming attainment improves. Thereby, more pupilsare
expected to complete primary rather than dropping out o f school. The steps involved in
quantifying this benefit are:

    a) Project how the pupilto qualified teacher ratio (PqTR) will improve as a result of the
        intervention (this i s already done inthe simulation model analysis inSection A and B o f
       this Annex.

    b) Assess how the completionrate depends on the pupilto qualified teacher ratio (PqTR),
        i.e. estimate the elasticity o f the completion rate to improvements inPqTR (linear
        regression).

    c) Estimate the increase inlifetime earnings o f individuals with or without completion o f
       primary school.

    d) Calculate the total benefit stream, andcomparewith costs o fthe intervention.

a. Projectionsof Impacton Quality.As a result o fthis intervention, the simulation model
showed that the pupilqualified teacher ratio can be assumed to improve from 95:1in2003 to
67:l by 2012.

b. LinearRegressionof CompletionRateas a Functionof Quality.A linear regressionbased
on most recent statistical data for 55 low-income countries was carried out to analyze the
dependency o f the primary completion rate on the average number o fpupils per teacher in




                                                   85

comparable countries'. For all 55 countries, the elasticity was about -1.0, indicating that when
the pupilteacher ratio improves by one point, for example fiom 61 to 60, the primary completion
rate improves 1point, e.g. from 38 to 39. A similar regression analysis based on the 33 African
countries inthe sample yielded a somewhat lower elasticity o f-0.6, indicating a lower
responsiveness inthese countries to the pupilteacher ratio. The apparent lower sensitivity to the
pupilteacher ratio inAfrican countries may indicatethe presence o fmore other factors affecting
the quality o f education, including poverty, malnutrition, HIV/AIDS, etc. For the purposes o fthis
analysis, an elasticity of the primary completion rate on the average number o fpupilsper teacher
of -0.6 i s usedinline with the above regression for the African countries.

c. EconomicBenefit of each AdditionalGraduate.This i s the increase inearnings for a
student holding a primary school leaving certificate compared to a personwith no completed
education. Inthe study "The Determinants of Poverty inMalawi, 1998" *,the 1998 Integrated
Household Survey was analyzed for, inter alia, linkages between education level and household
consumption, The study found that higher levels of education do consistently provide higher
levels o fwelfare for the household inevery region o f the country: it concluded that, for every
increase o fthe level o f education by one step (no education, standard 4, standard 8, JCE,
MSCE), per capita consumption o f an adult increased by 22% inthe rural south, by 19% inthe
rural central, by 11,5% inthe north andby 17% inurban centers. For the purposes o f this
analysis we estimate that a standard 8 graduate earn on average 30% more than a personwith no
completed education. Inthis analysis, this has beentranslated into an average annual earning o f
primary school leavers o f 2.8 multiples of GDP/capita compared to 2.2 multiples per capita for
persons with no completed education, for the duration of their working life (assumed to be 25
years).

d. BenefitStream.The benefit stream cannow be estimated as the product o ftwo factors: the
increase inindividual productivity for each additional graduate, and the increase inthe number
ofprimary school graduates. Table 8 presents the benefit stream o f the intervention to improve
the teacher training supported by the project.

Thus, the expectedimprovement inthe primary completion ratewill yield a socio-economic
benefit o f about 200m US$. This must be compared with the project costs, andthe expenditure
requiredby the Government o fMalawi, and contributions by other donors (see Table below).

The recurrent cost increment takes into account a cost saving to the educationsystem, because of
the lower repetitionrate that will result from a better learning environment. This cost savingmay
well amount to several million US$ per yearg,but as it i s already included above, it has not been
estimated separately.

Cost-Benefitof Component3: "AvertedIron-Deficiency".A cost-benefit was carried out o f
the iron supplementation part o fthe health andnutrition package (Comp. 3). This analysis
attempts to quantify the greater productivity o fthe individuals receiving the healthandnutrition
package, and thus averting iron-deficiency, as they become adults.

This analysis thus does not estimate the benefits o f other parts o fthe package (vitamin A, folic
acid, deworming, treatment for malaria, bilharzia, etc.), which are expected to have significant
positive impact on attendance inschool. These interventions, for example vitamin A
supplementation, have beenproved inother settings to be highlycost-effective.

There i s knownto be a negative impact o f iron deficiency - the most common nutritional
deficiency - on the cognitive abilities inchildren. InMalawi, according to the report on the
National Micronutrient (and Nutrition) Survey (NMS), conducted from September to October
2001, iron deficiency prevalence among school children is about 23%. For the purposes o f the
cost-benefit analysis, we are thus making the simplifying assumptionthat the project will avert
iron deficiency and this cognitive depairment in23% o f the target population (all school children
under 10 years o f age). However, this may be a very conservative assumption, as Save the
Children found an anemidiron-deficiency prevalence o f about 48%. Component 3 will finance a
baseline study and an on-going evaluation o f the effectiveness o f the intervention; this will
provide more reliable data on the iron-deficiency prevalence, and allow for an ex-post
calculation o fproject cost-benefit.


 For example, ifrepetition inthe Malawi studentpopulation of 3mprimaryschool pupils drops from an average of
25% to about 20% as a result of the project, the savings would amount to a total ofUS$2mannually.


                                                         87

Additional assumptions o fthis analysis are provided below. These are consistent with recent
research to estimate the economic implications o f iron deficiency":

              An irondeficient child(older than2 years) scores on average halfa standard
              deviation lower on intelligence tests than a non-deficient child. The decline in
              cognitive function has beenfound to be reversible following the repletion o f iron
              stores.
              The intercorrelation between IQ              scores at age 6-8 with those at age 17 i s about 0.62.
              Ithas beenfound that aone-half o f a standard deviation decrease inscores on various
              tests o f cognitive achievement i s associated with at least 4% decrease inhourly
              earnings.
              Thus, it can be assumed that childhood anemia i s associatedwith a drop inwages in
              adulthood o f2.5% (=4%*0.62).
              Improvement incognition associatedwith iron status requires maintenance o f iron
              status throughout the first 15 years o f life. A simplifyingassumption is therefore, that
              each year inwhich the child i s not anemic locks inone-fifteenth o f the 2.5% increase
              inwages inadulthood.

The ESSUP project will finance the delivery o fthe school healthandnutritionpackage for four
years, after which time we assumethe component will be continued with other funding. As
indicated inthe Table below, the iron supplementation will target all school children under 10.

           Dear Mr.Schafer,

                                     MALAWI EDUCATION SECTORPOLICY
                                                 -
                    IamwritingonbehalfoftheGovernmentofMalawitorequestaCreditofUS$32.2
           million equivalent from the World Bank in support o f the EducationSector Support Project. The
           project is intended to improve access and quality at all levels o f the education sector inMalawi
           as outlined inthe Ministry o f Education Policy and Investment Framework (PIF) and the Malawi
           Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (MPRSP).

                    In addition, the project will facilitate the formulation of a Sector Wide Program (SWAP)
            for the Education Sector, building on the objectives of the Government's Policy and Investment
            Framework (PIF), and o f the National Strategy for Teacher Education and Development
            (NSTED). These two documents outline the govemment's long-term education sector
            development objectives which are basically to increase access, improve quality and efficiency,
            and to develop institutional and financial capacities.

                    The project will address these sector development objectives in the education sector by
            increasing the provision of teachers and leaming and teaching resources across the sector,
            institutional capacity building and improving the health and nutritional statuses of pupils in
            primary schools. It will also support appropriate measures on HIV and AIDS prevention and to
            mitigate the impact of the pandemic on education personnel and pupils. The objectives will also
            be achieved by developing the relevant policies that are crucial to the development o f the
            education sector in Malawi and align the sector strategy to available financial resources.



                                                            98

Planning for the Education Sector

         The Govemment o f Malawi will develop an Education Sector Strategic Plan which will
be the vehicle for implementingthe Policy and Investment Framework. The Sector Strategic Plan
will include an integratedplan for higher education development. The Strategic Sector Planwill
facilitate the development o f a SWAP in the education sector which will bring about a better       -
coordinated and efficient use o f all resources in the education sector inthe medium to long term.

Financing of the Education Sector

         The Government o f Malawi is committed to increasing the share of the total budget
allocated to education from the current level o f approximately 15% to about 20%, with the share
provided for primary education being maintained in the region of 60-70% during PIF target of
65% by December 31,2007.

         In order to improve financing at the secondary school level, it is Government's intention
to allow secondary schools to retain the tuition fees paid by students, instead o f remitting these to
the Ministry of Finance, once the appropriate financial management systems are in place at the
Secondary Schools.       Government has further decided to provide funding directly to the
secondary schools and to strengthen human resource capacity at the schools so as to ensure that
there is proper accounting o f funds. This exercise will commence inthe 200415 fiscal year. The
retained fees will be used by the institutions to carry out refurbishment and maintenance works
and provide additional learningand teaching materials.

         In addition, the Govemment will develop a policy for the financing o f the higher
education sub-sector. This policy will take into account the need to increase access to higher
education within the existing resource envelope by considering and introducing measures such as
cost sharing and cost recovery and targeted student support where needed.

National Strategy for Teacher Education and Development

         Through the Ministry of Education, the Government has developed a draft National
Strategy for Teacher Education and Development (NSTED). Government will therefore finalize
this strategy and adopt it for implementation before the beginning o f the school year in January
2005. The strategy will provide for an efficient teacher education system that will produce
 teachers who are urgently needed in the system and also provide for the continuous development
 If teachers in order to prepare adequately for the needs of the sector. In order to effectively
 ichieve the implementation o f this strategy, Govemment will revamp the structure of the
  lroposed Department o f Teacher Education and Development and staff it fully.

          Associated with the development o f teachers is the efficient utilization of this scarce
    source in Malawi. Inthis regard, govemment will address the current inequitable distribution
   *teachers which i s in favour of urban areas. This will be done through the creation o f and strict
    herence to the teacher establishment of each school and the provision of incentives for those
    IO opt to teach inremote and disadvantaged parts ofthe country. As part ofthe Government's
    rv wage policy, the Government has reviewed and revised salary scales for all civil servants,



                                                                                                      2

                                                  99

including those o f teachers and other Ministry o f Education staff, with effect from 1'' October
2004. It is envisaged that future reviews will include incentives for rural teachers, and this is a
must if we are to retain trained teachers in these areas, and will make decentralization and
deployment of teachers more effective.

Decentralization

        Consistent with the commitment made by Government in the Financial Management and
Accelerating Growth Program (January 2004) Government will decentralize primary education
management, by transferring the associated funding of these activities from the Ministry of
Finance directly to the Local Assemblies. To this end, the Ministry o f Education, working
closely with the Decentralization Secretariat in the Ministry o f Local Government and Rural
Development, will develop the necessary devolution policy and guidelines for the effective
transfer o f the management o f primary education to Local Assemblies, including the efficient
and equitable management of teachers inall the districts o f the country.

Secondary Education

        The secondary education sector plays an important role in the overall development of the
education sector in Malawi since this i s the sector that prepares students for skills training and
entry into higher education. This sector o f education consists o f community day secondary
schools where the majority o f students are enrolled and government conventional secondary
schools, most o f which require rehabilitation. Lack o f financial and human resources has made it
difficult for government to improve the quality o f secondary school education.

        In order to address these problems and create a more uniform quality secondary
education sub-sector, as well as finance the increasing number o f trained secondary teachers,
government will;

        (i)     allow secondary schools to retain fees at the school level for minor repairs and
                acquisition o f teaching and leaming materials;
         (ii)   rehabilitate some conventional andcommunity day secondary schools;
         (iii)  increase the number of qualified teachers incommunity day secondary schools;
         (iv)   encourage cost recovery and cost sharing at all government secondary schools;
                 and
         (v)     promote the expansion of quality private secondary education in a well regulated
                 environment.

         The HIPC completion trigger number 3 for the education sector requires the phasing out
 o f government funding for boarding facilities for secondary students and the reallocation o f the
 freed resources to learning and teaching materials. However the Ministry of Education has
 raised some concerns about the lack o f adequate private accommodation close to secondary
 schools. The increasing incidence of HIV AIDS and orphans is also a serious concern and, here,
 the absence o f adequate girls' hostels can exacerbate these social problems. The Ministry o f
 Education will, therefore, continue to provide facilities but with the outsourcing o f their
 management and on a full cost recovery basis where applicable.



                                                                                                   3



                                              100

Efficiency InTertiary Education

       Government will take steps to improve efficiency in the utilization o f scarce resources
through the outsourcing o f non-core activities, particularly those associated with the housing and
feeding of students. In order to counteract the negative effects, such an arrangement may have
on the well being o f students, government will also develop and implement a viable and
sustainable student funding policy. In this regard Government will introduce bursary and
scholarship schemes for disadvantaged students.

       Noting government's inability to increase resources allocated to tertiary education in
Malawi, cost sharing and cost recovery measures will be introduced and promoted in tertiary
education. The University o f Malawi Act will also be amended to facilitate the enrollment of
fee-paying students at the University o f Malawi. In addition, other tertiary institutions will also
be encouraged to run parallel fee-paying programs. The objective o f these measures is to
enhance the revenue o f these institutions and reduce their dependence on subvented allocations
from Central Government.

       The implementation o f these measures will necessarily require the retrenchment of
employees who are providing the services associated with the non-core activities. Government
will provide resources to the affected institutions in order to enable them to retrench the
redundant employees.

Implementation and Monitoring

       The Government of Malawi is committed to the successful implementation of the
Education Sector Support Project (ESSUP) and other Government programmes being
implemented with financial assistance from other development partners.             The Ministry of
Education will be the implementation agency for the Project, on behalf o f the Government of
Malawi. The Project will be managed by a Project Steering Committee (PSC) that will be
chaired by the Principal Secretary of the Ministry and comprising o f Directors o f Departments
and Institutes, heads o f tertiary institution including universities, the Secretary to the Treasury,
the Secretary for Health, the Secretary o f Human Resource Management and Development, the
Secretary for Economic Planning and Development, the Secretary for Labour and Vocational
Training, the Accountant General, theSecretary for Local Government and Rural Development,
 the Solicitor General and Secretary for Justice, Development Partners and other stakeholders,
 who will be co-opted for special issues as needed. Local communities will equally be involved
 inthose components where their input and collaboration will beneeded.

 Conclusion

        The Government o f Malawi remains committed to the overall policies as indicated inthe
 Policy and Investment Framework and to achieving the MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)
 and the Education for All (EFA) goals through a collaborative effort with Malawi's development
 partners. The approval by the World Bank to provide the Govemment o f Malawi with the
 requested Credit will assist the Govemment to achieve these goals and objectives for the
 bettennent o f Malawi.
