Appraisal of the Sixth Power Project
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the fourth and fifth thermal
power units (200 MW each) of the Muara Karang steam power station, the engi-
neering design for a proposed 200 MW steam unit in Semarang and the engineer-
ing services for a Java high voltage interconnection. The Muara Karang units
are of the reheat type and oil fired. They will initially supply the Jakarta
and West Java area through a network of 150 kV lines, presently under con-
struction, and will be connected to the Java high voltage interconnection
system after its completion in the early 1980's. The total cost of the
Project is estimated at US$241.82 million equivalent, of which US$149.33
million equivalent represent the foreign exchange component. A Bank loan of
US$116 million equivalent is proposed to finance.
(a) the total foreign cost of unit No. 4 with the
exception of that portion of the engineering
services which are being financed from Loan
1127-IND;
(b) the down payments and ocean freight for major
equipment of unit No. 5;
(c) the foreign cost of minor equipment, general
construction, and engineering and construction
supervision for unit No. 5; and
(d) the total foreign cost of engineering services
for the Semarang unit No. 3 and the Java
interconnection.
Bank financing would cover 48% of the total Project cost.
ii.       The Project cost estimate for Muara Karang 4 and 5 was prepared by
PLN with consultants' help. The cost of major equipment is based on actual
bids received whereas the estimates for general construction and site develop-
ment have been computed on the basis of experience gained with units 1-3.
Physical (5% on equipment and 10% on civil works) and price contingencies
(overall 19.1%) have been included to allow for unforeseen events and future
price increases. Bidding for major equipment has been concluded and contract
awards will be made after Board approval of the Loan.



- ii -
iii.      PLN invited bidding with options for major equipment of unit No. 5,
including financing offers. Attractive financing terms have been received
which, together with the Bank's willingness to finance the excluded down
payment and ocean freight, provide optimum financing. To assure that the
financing pian for unit No. 5 is complete, disbursements will be withheld
for expenditures on this unit until satisfactory financing arrangements with
the suppiiers of major equipment have been made.
iv.       Some participation by Indonesian equipment manufacturers is envi-
saged, in which case a 15% domestic preference on the c.i.f. price, or the
prevailing duties, if lower, wili be applied in bid evaluation. Over the past
several years Indonesia has developed local construction industries which are
capable of performing civil works construction similar to that required for
the Project. Consequently, the documents include the 7.5% preference for
domestic civil works contractors for which Indonesia qualifies on the basis
of its low GNP per capita level.
v.        The growth opportunities of PLN's market are large, particularly
in the industrial sector where many captive plants exist. It is estimated
that in Java, where more than 80% of PLN's sales take place, PLN is serving
only about 50% of the underlying demand and this proportion is probably
similar in other areas. Depending on the assumption of how quickly PLN is
able to catch up with its obligation to serve electricity, annual growth rates
of up to 40% per year could be expected. However, due to financial and
project implementation constraints this would be an unreasonable assumption.
Consequently, the report assumes peak demand increases of 15% - 22.5% per
year during the next 6 years.
vi.       The Muara Karang scheme is an essential element in the provision of
urgently required economic base load capacity in Java. Its alternatives would
be either installation of equivalent capacity in the form of hydro or a
thermal combination involving gas turbines. The hydro alternatives in West
Java, although under study, cannot be developed by the time the Project is
required. The comparison between the Project and the best thermal alternative
involving gas turbines has proved that the Muara Karang units are more economic
for discount rates of at least 20%. The internal economic return on the
Project is about 21%.
vii.      All past Bank power lending operations included provisions for
management improvement and, starting with Credit 399-IND, a comprehensive
consulting effort was initiated within the framework of a financial recoverv
plan. PLN's improvement under the Plan is encouraging; there has been
excellent progress in accounting and finances, very good results in the
field of system operation and maintenance, recent acceptable progress in
construction management but, unfortunately, iittle success in system
planning and budgeting. Proposals to tackle planning are included in this
operation.



- iii -
viii.     Present loan documents do not yet include specific long-range
financial covenants. Instead, the Financial Recovery Plan included in
earlier documents envisages full cost coverage through revenues in FY
1979 with interim targets of 80% in FY 1975 and 90% in FY 1977. The 80%
target was actually surpassed and preliminary results indicate that the
FY 1977 requirement will also be reached. A system of more conventional
financial covenants is presently under discussion and will be introduced
after recovery.
ix.       The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$116 million. It would have a term of 20 years including 4.5 years
of grace, and the interest rate would be that prevailing on the date of
circulation of the President's Report to the Executive Directors. It would
be made to the Government which in turn would relend the funds to PLN on
terms equivalent to the Bank loan; however, the Government would finance
interest and commitment charges during the grace period of the Loan which
would avoid debt service payments during the remainder of the recovery
period. In accordance with Indonesian policy, the Government would bear
the foreign exchange risk during the Loan repayment period.

Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN)
Appraisal of the Sixth Power Project
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested the Bank to help finance
a Project consisting of the fourth and fifth 200 MW units for the oil-fired
Huara Karang station in Jakarta, engineering consulting services for the
design of a proposed 200 MW No. 3 unit at the Semarang station in Central
Java, and engineering services for a Java high voltage interconnection.
The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$241.82 million equivalent
of which US$149.33, or 62% represents the foreign exchange component. A
Bank loan of US$116 million is proposed to cover the foreign exchange cost
of the Project excluding 80-85% of major equipment for unit No. 5-suppliers'
credits will be arranged for these items--and excluding that portion of the
Muara Karang consulting services which are being financed from funds of Loan
1127-IND. It would finance 48% of the total Project cost. The Loan would
be for a term of 20 years including 4.5 years of grace. Following a request
by the Indonesian authorities, the Loan would, as in the past, be made to
the Government which would onlend the funds to PLN, the Beneficiary, on
Bank loan terms.
1.02      The Loan would be the sixth Bank Group operation in the power sector
with PLN the beneficiary in all cases. The first two credits and the latest
loan (165, 334 and 1259-IND) were made to help finance a large distribution
rehabilitation and expansion program in the Jakarta and West Java areas. The
third credit (399-IND) and Loan 1127-IND are financing part of the foreign
exchange cost of the first three 100 MW units of the Muara Karang steam station.
1.03      In its power lending operations the Bank has been promoting a
balanced program between generation and distribution which is important for
the development of an organized power system. Furthermore it has provided
funds for extensive engineering and management consulting services as well as
training of PLN's personnel. These efforts have, on balance, been successful
and the progress achieved is encouraging. The financial target of 80% revenue/
cost ratio in FY 1975 was reached and the prospects for reaching the 90%
target in 1977 and the 100% target in 1979 are excellent.
1.04      This report was prepared by Messrs. J. Carver and K. Stichenwirth
in cooperation with Messrs. C.K. Chandran and H. Maeda and is based on infor-
mation obtained during missions to Indonesia in May and November 1976.

II. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
2.01      The public power sector is synonymous with PLN, a Government-
owned enterprise, responsible for generation, transmission and distribu-
tion of electricity throughout the country. PLN was created in 1965
through the merger of three nationalized utilities which had succeeded
Dutch-owned private electricity corporations.
2.02      Although PLN has the exclusive right to generate, transmit and
distribute electric power, companies or individuals are allowed to build
and operate generating stations for their own supply if PLN is unable to
provide service. In special cases, these auto-producers may distribute
electricity to consumers in surrounding areas.
2.03      Inadequate and unreliable public power supply has resulted in
many captive plant installations, amounting to an estimated 40% of the
total installed capacity (public plus captive). These installations
represent uneconomic investments, as small captive generating stations
cannot compete either in capital cost or operating efficiency with larger
central stations. Also, advantage cannot be taken of diversity in demand
so that more capacity must be installed in captive plants than would be
required in an interconnected system.
Existing Public Power Facilities
2.04      PLN's total installed capacity on March 31, 1976, was 1,183 MW
(including the 125 MW Juanda hydro plant owned by the Jatiluhur Authority
from which PLN purchases the output). Including Juanda, it consisted of
37% hydro, 21% steam, 24% diesel and 18% gas turbine capacity. These
installations are scattered throughout the country in small units and
stations, with the largest plant, the 150 MW Tanjung Priok steam station
in Jakarta, composed of 2x25 MW and 2x50 MW units. Details on installed
capacity are given in Annex 1 and on peak demand, generation and sales in
Annex 2.
2.05      Transmission and distribution facilities are inadequate.  Major
load centers are not interconnected, resulting in high production costs
and poor reliability.
The Power Market
2.06      In the past, Indonesia's overall economic growth has outpaced
the country's public power sector development which has suffered both
financial and implementation constraints. This has resulted in suppressed
demand and power shortages. For instance, it has been estimated that for
the island of Java, where the proposed Project will be located, the follow-
ing condition existed during the fiscal year ending March 31, 1975:



-3 -
MW          %
Supplied by PLN             447          50.0
Voltage Restriction          110         12.3
On-Peak Restriction          105         11.7
Waiting List                  58          6.5
Self-Supplied               175          19.5
Underlying Demand /a        895         100.0
/a   Demand PLN would have served if its installations had been adequate
and all self-supplied installations had been served by PLN.
The above table shows that PLN was able to supply only about 50% of the
potential demand in 1975.
2.07      The poor state of sector development is further illustrated by
PLN's high system losses (station consumption plus transmission and dis-
tribution losses) which at present account for 25.6% (FY 1975/76) of
generation plus purchases. Although slightly decreasing--losses of 26.9%
were registered in FY 1974/75--they are still high and substantial decreases
can only be expected through system development which in turn is directly
linked with economic investments.
2.08      PLN's distribution of energy sales among the various consumer
classes is unusual as the following table indicates:
Customers and Sales
(FY 1974/75)
Number of            Sales            Percent Sales
Customers            (GWh)               of Total
Residential                  969,481            1,217.5                 49.8%
Commercial                    108,816             426.2                 17.4%
Industrial                     6,828              737.8                 30.2%
Street Lighting                   980              62.5                  2.6%
Total                 1,086,105           2,444.0                 100.0%
Sales to industrial consumers account for only 30% as compared to about
70% in Malaysia and Taiwan and about 50% in Pakistan. This indicates that
PLN's foremost task is to develop its capability to serve economically and
reliably existing and future industries. Consequently, it will have to carry
out a large, well balanced investment program and to pursue a prudent tariff
policy designed to attract industrial consumers rather than having them
continue to build and operate their own generating plant. It is on this
account that the covenants dealing with PLN's development plan and budget are
proposed (paras. 2.12 and 2.13).



- 4 -
2.09      It is difficult to project PLN's future electricity sales because:
(a)  the past is an unreliable indicator due to PLN's
low level of development. Annual increases of
between 4% and 21% occurred between FY 1967 and
1976; and
(b)  future sales will largely depend on PLN's capability
to implement expeditiously its investment program
and to connect customers.
The forecast as included in Annexes 3 and 4 takes a cautious approach. It
assumes steadily rising growth rates from about 15% (actual) in FY 1976
to a peak of 22.5% in FY 1982 and slightly lower growth thereafter. This
assumption is rather more cautious than that included in the lower growth
projection of the Java System Development Study (para 2.11). It was chosen,
however, because it was felt prudent to take a pessimistic rather than
optimistic approach to PLN's future earnings position (Chapter VI) and also
because there are still doubts that PLN in fact can carry out its large
investment program in time, particularly in distribution.
Sector Development
2.10      Past sector development was largely determined by the foreign
assistance available. Consequently, it was carried out in a somewhat
haphazard manner concentrating on isolated areas with little regard for
later interconnection. To establish guidelines for future power develop-
ment in Java as well as an appropriately balanced investment program, the
Bank provided funds from Credit 399-IND for a Java System Development Study.
The study was started with the help of consultants (Preece, Cardew and
Rider (PCR) of the UK) in November 1974 and the final report was issued
recently.
2.11      The Java System Development Study examines two load forecasts:
(a)  an upper projection, assuming that the underlying
demand of 895 MW in FY1975 will increase at an average
annual rate of about 15%, but that PLN will be able
to satisfy this demand only in 1984. The resulting
peak demand on the PLN system will increase at 26%
per year for the period 1975-85; and
(b)  a lower projection, assuming a three-year continuous
lag in PLN's ability to satisfy the underlying demand
during the decade FY 1975-1984. This lag is based on
the assessment of PLN's implementation capabilities
and takes into account the fact that certain captive
installations will always exist. The peak demand on
the PLN system will increase at about 20% per year
during 1975-85.



2.12      After reviewing the reports of the consultants it is felt that the
lower load forecast (para 2.11 (b)) represents the most feasible alternative
from a technical, economical and financial point of view and future system
development for Java should be based on it. Consequently, the Government and
PLN have agreed during negotiations:
(a) to adopt the lower projection of PCR's Java System
Development Study as a guideline for power generation,
transmission and overall distribution development in
Java until FY 1984 (end of Repelita III); and
(b) to review with the Bank annually potential changes
in load growth and variations of the expansion program
for Java which may become necessary.
2.13      Experience has shown that shortage of Government budget funds
frequently resulted in cutbacks of PLN's investment budget. These cut-
backs affect mostly distribution, more specifically service connections,
because this type of investment lends itself more readily to reductions
than generation and transmission or such distribution projects as are
connected with foreign assistance. This has led to the unfortunate situa-
tion where, in spite of an originally balanced plan, distribution invest-
ments (particularly 20 kV subtransmission lines) lie idle due to lack of
service connections. 1/ To ensure that in future PLN's investment budget
and implementation will conform to the power investment priorities agreed
for Java, and to provide a balanced development between generation, trans-
mission and distribution throughout the country, the Government and PLN
have agreed during negotiations on an annual joint review with the Bank
of PLN's investment budget before it is finalized by the Government.
Capital Expenditures
2.14      The lower load forecast (para 2.11 (b)) still requires a heavy
investment program with the following estimated financing requirements for
FY 1977-1984 (price basis early 1976--for details see Annex 11):
1/   The mission observed this situation in the Jogjakarta and Semarang
areas but it can be assumed that it is prevailing throughout the
country.

To gain an appreciation of the finances required in an inflationary environ-
ment, an attempt has been made to show the investment program in current
prices by revaluing the annual capital expenditures (for details of the
indices used see Annex 11). Instead of US$4.4 billion equivalent on the
basis of 1976 price levels the total capital expenditures FY 1977-1984 are
estimated at US$7.3 billion equivalent on the basis of current prices.
2.15      The above investment program would add about 3,800 MW in genera-
tion capacity to PLN's system together with the necessary transmission and
distribution facilities to market the output. It also includes part of the
cost of another 2,600 MW of generating capacity to be commissioned after
FY 1984.
Availability of Electricity
2.16      Indonesia is among the countries with the lowest per capita elec-
tricity consumption in the world and is likely to improve only very slowly as
the following table on public power supply indicates:

No reliable data are available about the capacity of captive plant.  Assum-
ing that captive installations are equivalent to 40% of Indonesia's total
installed capacity, per capita installed capacity and sales would not have
been more than 13 watts and 30 kWh respectively in FY 1975. The low level of
eiectrification is further indicated by the high ratio of inhabitants per
customer. On a developed system with rural electrification completed, the
ratio would be between 5 and 10.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
3.01      Although created in 1965, PLN's corporate existence is based
on the 1972 Electricity Act which was issued as Presidential Decree No.
18/1972 (Annex 5). In addition, a number of decrees interpret or amend
the basic Act. They are not only used to clarify issues not sufficiently
treated in the existing laws but also to regulate managerial and opera-
tional responsibilities.
3.02      The Electricity Act, which was drafted with the assistance of
SOFRELEC, PLN's management and distribution engineering consultant, was
originally aimed at creating an autonomous public utility which would
have been fully responsible for all its activities. This was considered
important because PLN functioned as a Government agency reporting to the



- 8 -
Directorate General of Electric Power, a Department of the Ministry of
Public Works and Electric Power. PLN's responsibilities were ill-defined
and, in fact, consisted only of day-to-day operations. Important matters
such as system planning, construction, procurement and finance were the
responsibility of tho Ditectorate, relegating PLN's management to a sec-
ondary role.
3.03      However, during the discussions on the Act it became clear
that the Government preferred a partially rather than fully autonomous
entity since total autonomy would have been inconsistent with its policy
of controlling important sectors of the economy. Consequently, it was
agreed that the Government would retain responsibility for matters affect-
ing the national economy--for instance tariffs and approval of investment
plans--and it would exercise control over other matters it considers
important such as evaluation of bids and decisions on contract awards for
investments financed through the Government budget. PLN would be charged
with the responsibility for executing power development, drafting develop-
ment plans for Government approval and all aspects of operation. The
Directorate General of Electric Power was abolished.
Legal Status and Responsibilities
3.04      PLN is a public enterprise (Perum). It is the executing agency
of the Ministry for power development throughout the country, carrying out
its objectives within the National Development Program in accordance with
Government policies.
3.05      PLN reports to the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power.
The Minister determines its policy and exercises general control over its
activities. He is assisted by an Advisory Board consisting of the Ministers
of Finance, Industry, and National Development Planning (Chairman of BAPPENAS)
in making decisions on important matters.
3.06      PLN is responsible for construction and operation of power facil-
ities throughout the country, drafting of power development plans, drafting
of regulations on standardization, safety and licensing of captive plant,
and entering into contracts for purchase or sale of electricity. It is also
in charge of research activities in the field of electric power and for
organizing personnel training. Its draft regulations must be approved and
made public by the Government to gain legal force.
Organization and Management
3.07      Effective September 9, 1975 PLN adopted a new organization scheme
(Annex 5) 1/ which introduced three operational levels:
1/   Decree No. 13/PRT/1975 of the Minister of Public Works and Electric Power.



-9-
(i) leadership level;
(ii) supporting services; and
(iii) execution level.
The leadership level, comprising the management together with the deputy
directorships, is responsible for overall planning and guidance, data
collection, and central accounting and budgeting. It also maintains
contact with all Government agencies. In the field of construction it
reviews the bidding documents and proposes contract awards for major
projects. The supporting services consist of the power research center
and the training center. The execution level includes the regional offices
which are responsible for all activities within their respective areas,
including minor construction, and offices for major construction, called
Special Projects. Special project units ate established as and when the
need arises to carry out projects too large or too important to be handLed
by the regional offices.
3.08      PLN's management (Board of Directors) consists of a President
Director and at least two other Directors. In addition to the President
Director, there are presently five, responsible for planning, operation,
construction, finance and administration (including personnel). The members
of the Board are appointed and dismissed by the President of Indonesia upon
the recommendation of the Minister. They normally serve a five-year term,
but may be reappointed. The President Director is responsible to the
Minister and the Directors report in their respective fields to the President
Director.
3.09      PLN's middle management (deputy directors, and chiefs of regional
offices and special projects) is appointed by the Minister upon the recom-
m.endation of the Board of Directors. The deputy directors are responsible to
the directors in their respective fields whereas the chiefs report to the
entire Board of Directors.
3.10      The organization appears effective in placing the responsibility
for day to day operation and construction implementation on the regional
managers. This is particularly important in the light of the large area
PLN has to cover and the long distances involved. However it places a
large work load on the Board of Directors who are collectively responsible
for solving the problems brought to their attention. Before the latest
reorganization, matters of lesser importance were "filtered" through deputy
directors who could deal with them within their own sphere of influence.
However, in general, the organization seems appropriate for PLN considering
the limited reservoir of qualified staff available.
3.11      As of March 1976 PLN had a total staff of about 21,000.  Although
the number of employees is high in comparison with its activities, a severe
shottage of qualified personnel still prevails. For instance, PLN's per-
sonnel upgrading program would require more civil and electro-mechanical



- 10 -
engineers annually than are presently graduating from all the technical
universities in the country. PLN is endeavoring to overcome this problem
through in-house training, fellowships and overseas training (in part
financed from Loan 1127). However, because of the magnitude of the task
involved, slow progress must be expected.
Management Improvement Effort
3.12      At the time of the Bank's first involvement in the power sector
(1969) PLN was in a chaotic state. Management and finances as well as PLN's
legal basis were so unsatisfactory that, without a special effort, the
company's very existence would have been in jeopardy. Consequently, the
Bank was faced with the choice of either delaying financial assistance until
PLN had reached a level of financial and managerial competence where lending
to a public utility is normally considered, or helping PLN to improve with
the assistance of consultants even though it was accepted that this might
take about a decade. After intensive discussions it was decided to follow
the latter course of action and the French firm of SOFRELEC was selected.
SOFRELEC was assisted in accounting matters by Peat, Marwick and Mitchell of
the UK.
3.13      It took time before SOFRELEC could formulate recommendations with
respect to PLN's problems. Records had to be reconstructed and assets physi-
cally identified; large outstanding consumer accounts had to be verified and
means found for their settlement; tariff levels and structure had to be studied.
The initial phase of the consultants' work took about three years and involved,
to a considerable degree, essential fact finding. The main accomplishments
during the period included:
(a) draft of the Electricity Act;
(b) recommendations on a new structure and level
of tariffs;
(c) preparation of an accounting system and
recommendations on cash management and control,
inventory control, consumer administration,
mechanization and budgeting;
(d) physical identification, classification
and revaluation of assets;
(e) recommendations on personnel regulations
and administration, job analysis and job
structure; and
(f) design of a comprehensive training
program.



- 11 -
3.14      In late 1972 (appraisal for Credit 399-IND) PLN's problems
were identified and recommendations for their solution were available
(see Annex 6 for a summary of the consuitants' recommendations and their
status of implementation). Consequently, a "recovery plan" designed to
improve PLN's management capabilities and to overcome its financial
weaknesses over time was agreed on. Its main features include:
(a)  a detailed plan of activities designed to
improve PLN's operations and, as a consequence,
its financial position;
(b)  annual programs of the activities to be taken
towards improvement. These programs are
discussed with and supervised by the Bank
staff; and
(c)  improvement of PLN's finances to the point
where by FY 1979 all operating expenses
would be covered through revenues. In
addition agreement was reached on interim
targets of 80% revenue/cost coverage in
FY 1975 and 90% in FY 1977.
3.15      The progress achieved so far can be summarized as follows:
(a)  Accounting and Finances:  Unexpectedly good and fast
improvement has been registered in the field of account-
ing and finance. Financial control systems have been
introduced, a reporting system has been designed and
reports are now excellent and on time, and mechanization
is progressing on schedule. PLN's capabilities with
respect to accounting and fund management is comparable
to other utilities in the area. For results in achieving
the financial targets see paragraph 6.04.
(b)  Operations:  Very good results have been achieved in
system operation and maintenance where manuals and
up-to-date maintenance procedures have been developed
and are being implemented throughout PLN. Overall
efficiency has improved over the past several years.
During FY 1972-1976, installed capacity per employee
has increased by about 63% (from 31.5 kW to 51.4 kW)
and sales per employee by about 52% (89,715 kWh to
136,117 kWh). The number of customers per employee
has risen from 46 to 55 (about 20%). As a conse-
quence of thermal operation training, specific fuel
consumption has shown a decreasing trend. Between
FY 1973 and 1974/75, fuel efficiency in diesel sta-
tions has increased by about 5%.



- 12 -
(c)  Construction:  Efforts to improve the management of
construction activities have unfortunately shown less
favorable results. Causes for concern are not so much
weaknesses in procurement--satisfactory improvement has
occurred in this respect--but delays in construction and
erection. This is not entirely PLN's fault since the
reason for delays was often lack of Government budget
funds for financing the local component of investments.
In addition, complex and cumbersome Government regulations
on budget approval, customs clearance and government pro-
curement procedures have in the past delayed project imple-
mentation. During the past year, however, reassignment of
personnel and better management have resulted in encourag-
ing progress.
(d)  Planning:  Progress in this difficult field is
unfortunately slow, mainly due to lack of experienced
personnel. A number of reassignments of personnel
have occurred during the past year and it is expected
that improvements will materialize in due course.
(e)  Training:  An extensive training program has been
initiated by PLN with the assistance of the Bank
and the results so far have been encouraging
(for details see Annex 7).
3.16      At the end of 1976 the consultants have phased out their acti-
vities.  PLN, SOFRELEC and the Bank consider that after about 6 years of
intensive involvement, completion of all reports and recommendations, and
extensive supervision of implementations of the recommendations as well as on
the job training, it would be appropriate for the consultants to withdraw from
the scene. PLN must now get used to being self-reliant. To facilitate the
transition period, PLN will employ management advisers who will be attached to
the various departments (financing provided from Loan 1127-IND). One such
adviser has recently been employed.
IV. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
4.01      The proposed Project consists of:
(a)  constructon of the fourth and fifth thermal power
units (200 MW each) at the Muara Karang power
plant;
(b)  engineering and design, including the preparation
of bidding documents and evaluation of bids for the
third unit (200 MW) at the Semarang Harbor steam
electric station; and



- 13 -
(c)  provision of engineering services for a Java
interconnection system including detailed
design and preparation of bidding documents
for phase I of the interconnection.
4.02      The Muara Karang site, located in the northwest outskirts of
Jakarta, will have an ultimate capacity of 700 MW consisting of 3 x 100 MW
and 2 x 200 MW units. The first two 100 MW units are being partially
financed by Credit 399-IND and the third 100 MW unit by Loan 1127-IND.
They are expected to enter into service in 1978/79. Units No. 4 and 5
(200 MW each-the Project) are planned for commissioning in 1980 and 1981.
They will be re-heat, oil-fired units and will initially supply the Jakarta
and West Java area by 150 kV transmission lines presently under construction.
After completion of the Java high voltage interconnection (para 4.04), esti-
mated by 1983, the Muara Karang station will be part of the all-Java power
system.
4.03      The Semarang Harbor site, located at Semarang in Central Java,
has under construction two 50 MW oil-fired units being financed by the Agency
for International Development of the United States. These are expected to
enter into service during 1978. The engineering and design of the third
unit (200 MW), similar to that at Muara Karang, has been included in the Pro-
ject. The Semarang Harbor site will supply the Central Java area by 150 kV
transmission lines that will connect to the West Java system by 1979 and with
the East Java system by 1980. Similar to Muara Karang, Semarang will be
connected to the Java high voltage interconnection system after its comple-
tion.
4.04      The Java System Development Study (paras. 2.10 and 2.11) indicates
that the system development in Java will require an island-wide high voltage
interconnection in the early 1980's which would ensure optimum utilization
of installed power facilities and enable future expansion of PLN's generating
capacity to be planned in accordance with the needs of an integrated power
system throughout the island. The scope of the engineering services would
be to assist PLN in planning, design and construction of the system. Speci-
fically it would. cover:
(a)  system engineering, based on the Java System
Development Study, including selection of line
routing, voltage level and number of circuits,
basic insulation level, establishment of a
reliable protection scheme, and determination
of an optimum implementation program divided
into two or three phases; and
(b)  line engineering for the first phase, including
detailed route survey, line and substation
design, cost estimate, construction schedule,
and preparation of bidding documents.

4.06      The cost estimate for Muara Karang No. 4 and 5 was prepared by PLN
with the assistance of Black and Veatch International (BVI) of the USA, the
consultant retained for the first three units at site. The cost of the
major equipment is based on actual bids received. The estimate for general
construction and site development (including piling) is based on experience
gained with units 1-3. A physical contingency of 5% on equipment and 10%
on construction, site development and piling has been included in the esti-
mate and should be adequate. Price contingencies have been applied to all
items with the exception of major equipment (firm quotations have been re-
ceived) and engineering (firm prices can be expected) at the rate of 8%
per year on foreign and 15% per year on local costs. The overall price
contingency amounts to 19.1% of the basic cost of Muara Karang 4 and 5 in-
cluding physical contingencies, of which 6.3% are for the foreign and 12.8%
are for the local component. The estimated cost of the two units is US$486
per kW on the basis of early 1977 prices and US$579 per kW upon completion
of the project (unit No. 4 in late-1980 and unit No. 5 in late-1981).
Procurement
4.07      Equipment and materials to be financed through funds of the proposed
Loan will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Since the Bank does not propose to
finance major equipment for Unit No. 5 (boiler, turbine generator, electrical
equipment, and transformers), bids for these items have been invited on a
cash basis for unit No. 4 with options for an identical No. 5 unit, but with
financing offers. Response to the invitation to bid was excellent. Bid eval-
uation has been concluded and awards will be made after Board approval.
4.08      Some participation by Indonesian equipment manufacturers is
envisaged, in which case a 15% preference on the c.i.f. price, or the prevail-
ing duties, if lower, will be applicable. Over the past several years Indonesia
has developed local construction industries which are capable of performing
civil and structural works similar to those required for the Muara Karang
plant. One such contractor is presently undertaking the civil construction
for units 1-3 and performing satisfactorily. Consequently, the documents of
the proposed Loan include the 7.5% preference in bid evaluation for domestic
civil works contractors for which Indonesia qualifies on the basis of its
low GNP per capita level. This local preference provision will be included
in the bidding documents for construction of civil and structural works.
Financing of the Project
4.09      The Project will be financed through funds of the Bank loan, sup-
pliers' credits, Government loans and contributions, and PLN's internal cash
generation. The proposed Loan of US$116 million would cover (for details
see Annex 8):

(a)  the total foreign cost of unit No. 4, with the
exception of that portion of the engineering
services for Muara Karang which are being fi-
nanced from Loan 1127-IND (US$2.56 million).
The amount involved is US$67.07 million
equivalent;
(b)  down payments (between 15% and 20% of the contract
values) and ocean freight for major equipment of
unit No. 5. The amount involved is US$7.67 million
equivaient;
(c)  the foreign cost of minor equipment, general
construction, and engineering and construction
supervision for unit No. 5. The amount involved
is US$33.26 million equivalent; and
(d)  the total foreign cost of engineering services
for the Semarang unit No. 3 and the Java
Interconnection amounting to US$8 million
equivalent.
The Loan would finance 48% of the total Project cost and would be for a term
of 20 years including 4.5 years of grace. The interest rate prevailing on
the date of circulation of the President's Report to the Executive Directors
would apply.
4.10      As mentioned in paragraph 4.07, PLN has invited bidding on options
for major equipment of unit No. 5 including financing offers. Attractive
financing terms have been received which, together with the Bank's willingness
to finance the excluded down payments and ocean freight, provide optimum fi-
nancing for PLN.  Government loans and constributions as well as PLN's internal
cash generation will finance the local cost of the Project, equivalent to about
US$92 million.
Disbursements
4.11      The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed against the following items:
Unit No. 4                 Unit No. 5
(a)  Major Equipment: 100% of foreign expenditures  100% of foreign expen-
for directly imported goods,  ditures of down pay-
95% of the ex-factory cost    ments, erection and
for locally manufactured        field services (up
goods, and 65% of the total   to 20% of total cost),
expenditures for imported       and ocean freight.
goods procured locally.



- 1 7 -
(b)  Minor Equipment:         100% of foreign expenditures for directly
imported goods, 95% of the ex-factory cost
for locally manufactured goods, and 65% of
the total expenditures for imported goods
procured locally.
(c) General Construction
(i)  Civil Works:        67% of total expenditures (representing
the estimated foreign cost).
(ii) Mechanical and
Electrical Works:  100% of foreign expenditures.
(d)  Consultants' Services:  100% of foreign expenditures.
No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior to Loan signing.  To
assure complete financing of unit No. 5, disbursements will be withheld for
expenditures on this unit until satisfactory financing arrangements with
the suppliers of major equipment (para 4.10) have been concluded. Surplus
funds remaining after completion of the Project will, with Bank agreement,
be used for related works. The estimated schedule of disbursements and the
implementation schedule are attached as Annex 9.
Engineering and Construction
4.12      The consultants (BVI) are responsible for:
(a) designing Muara Karang units No 4 and 5;
(b) preparation of bidding documents;
(c) assisting PLN in bid evaluation and contract
award; and
(d) construction supervision of Muara Karang units
4 and 5 and the training of PLN's work force in
the operation of 200 MW steam units.
The foreign cost for the activities under (a), (b) and (c) is US$2.56 million
and financing is provided from funds of Loan 1127-IND. The personnel input
is estimated at 626 man-months, with 550 man-months required in the consul-
tant's home office and 76 man months in the field. The man-month cost of
the salary/overhead/fee component is expected to be in the region of US$4,100
(US$3,884 in the home office and US$5,855 in the field). The direct expenses
are negligible. The foreign salary/overhead/fee cost for (d)--to be financed
from funds of the proposed Loan--is estimated at US$3.37 million, and is based
on a man-month requirement of 550 (75 man-months in the home office and 475 in
the field) averaging US$6,122 per man-month. This is higher than the design
and bidding document preparation component mainly because of the different
spread of home office versus field time requirement. In addition there are



- 18 -
direct expenses of about US$830,000 which include about US$350,000 for train-
ing. These raise the engineering man-month cost for construction supervi-
sion and training to US$7,636. The man-month cost (foreign) of the entire
consulting effort is estimated at about US$5,750, within the range of expen-
ses for similar consulting jobs.
4.13      An amendment to the existing contract between PLN and BVI (items
(a), (b) and (c) referred to in paragraph 4.12) to cover consulting services
for item (d) (para 4.12) will be necessary. Bank approval of this amendment
will be required and signing is a condition of effectiveness.
4.14      The man-month requirement for the engineering design services of
the 200 MW unit at Semarang is estimated to 550 at an overall unit cost of
about US$5,500. The foreign exchange cost of the engineering services for
the Java Interconnection has been estimated at US$5 million for 773 man-
months. This is equivalent to a man-month cost of US$6,500. Both estimates
are considered reasonable.
4.15      During construction of the first three Muara Karang units, site
fill, auxiliary buildings and the intake canal will have been completed for
the ultimate capacity. Bids for major equipment for this Project--boiler
and turbine-generators--were requested on a supply and erect basis whereas
minor equipment will be tendered on the basis of supply only and the gen-
eral contractor will be responsible for their installation.
Ecology
4.16      Since Indonesia has not yet ruled on matters of environmental
quality, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards have
been used as design criteria. Maximum particle concentration at ground
level due to exhaust gases will be below EPA standards and a mechanical
precipitator will be sufficient to remove solid particles from the gas.
However, space is provided for the future installation of electrostatic
precipitators, should they become necessary. Stack height will keep the
sulfur pollution below EPA ambient air standards even for high-sulfur mid-
eastern oil which may be used instead of the more valuable Indonesian low-
sulfur oil. Consultants have carried out and will continue to carry out
surveys of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions and the flora and
fauna in the vicinity of the Project area so that conditions before and
after the plant installation will be on record.
V. JUSTIFICATION
Power Market in Java
5.01      The demand on the Java system during 1975/76 was 491 MW with an
installed capacity of 870 MW and an estimated firm capacity of 519 MW after
discounting non-firm hydroelectric installations and spinning and maintenance
reserves. However, this demand does not reflect the system potential demand



- 19 -
because of voltage and peak load restrictions and because PLN has followed the
practice of restricting connections by either requesting extremely high con-
nection charges or refusing service completely. With the commissioning of
Muara Karang No. 4 and 5, the installed capacity available at the end of
1981/82 will be 2,744 MW and the firm capacity approximately 2,000 MW, suf-
ficient to meet the maximum demand until further capacity is commissioned.
5.02      PLN plans to have the West, Central and East Java systems inter-
connected by a 150 kV double-circuit transmission line during 1979 and
1980. Because of the distances involved this interconnection has limited
transfer capabilities (approximately 100 MW) between regions and it will
be necessary to install an interconnection at a higher voltage soon after-
ward. The Java System Development Study (PCR) recommends 400 kV double-
circuit lines for this interconnection and the expansion program developed
in Annex 4 assumes that the above interconnections will be constructed.
This expansion program is similar to the Java System Development Study (lower
forecast) except that more realistic installation dates for generating units,
especially hydro plants, have been used. The expansion program indicates that
the interconnected systems at the end of 1979/80, the year before commission-
ing of Muara Karang 4, will consist of 38% steam, 35% gas turbine and 27%
hydro power, neglecting the small contribution made by diesels. This heavy
dependence on gas turbines which consume more fuel and more costly fuel than
large steam units indicates the urgent need for base load steam power. The
proposed Muara Karang No. 4 and 5 units will supply this base load function
and can be in service some four years ahead of any hydro alternative such as
Jatigede or Saguling.
Economic Justification
5.03      In the course of the comprehensive Java System Development Study
(para. 2.10) PLN's consultant examined all practical alternatives and has
recommended the least cost sequence of expansion of electricity generation.
New hydroelectric projects cannot be commissioned in time to meet the growth
of demand by 1981/82. Further, the recommended generation is more economical
than the best thermal alternative involving gas turbines for all discount
rates up to at least 20%. The study concluded that (a) installation of
Muara Karang units 4 and 5 is the next step in the least cost sequence and
(b) both units should be in service in 1981/82 if the actual load growth
follows the lower of the two demand forecasts made (para. 2.11). The above
conclusions are acceptable. Sensitivity studies also confirmed that the
most economic pattern of generation indicated will not be affected within
the wide limits of the upper and lower demand forecasts.
5.04      The economic value of alleviating power shortages cannot be fully
quantified and therefore cannot be expressed directly as a return on invest-
ment. The extensive use of captive generating plant and the long list of
pending applications for electricity connections clearly demonstrate consumer
willingness to pay for power supply. An estimate of the economic return on
investment was made by comparing costs attributable to the project (excluding



- 20 -
duties, taxes and depreciation) but including the associated costs for trans-
mission and distribution, to the additional revenues from consumers. However,
this considerably understates the benefits because consumer surplus is ignored.
For this analysis, the world market price of oil was used rather than the
Indonesian subsidized price. The estimated rate of return on the Project and
associated installations of transmission and distribution is about 21% (Annex
10).
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance
6.01      PLN's past financial performance has been closely linked with
the management consulting effort and the Financial Recovery Plan (paras.
3.14 and 3.15). As mentioned above (para 3.14), the objective of the
plan is to achieve full revenue/cost coverage in FY 1979, with interim
targets of 80% in FY 1975 and 90% in FY 1977. Revenue/cost coverage is
defined as revenues from sales of power plus other operating revenues
divided by operating expenses consisting of expenses for fuel, operation,
maintenance and administration as well as depreciation, allowance for
bad debts, and interest and similar charges on debt, if any. Furthermore,
it was agreed that all funds provided by the Government 1/ would be in the
form of equity or borrowings on terms not requiring debt service payments
on the part of PLN during the recovery period FY 1974-1979. This was
considered appropriate because burdening PLN with debt service requirements
at a time when it was hardly able to meet its cash expenses would have had
a retarding effect on its recovery process.
6.02      For evaluating PLN's past financial performance, the accounting
records were used on a historic (as recorded) as well as revalued basis.
Revaluation was considered particularly necessary because the period under
review coincided with heavy inflation throughout the world and even more
so in Indonesia where it reached annual increases of up to about 40% (for
details of the inflation used see Annex 11). Following is a summary of
PLN's financial situation as it developed over the past several years
(see also Annex 11).
1/   In practice all Government-owned enterprises in Indonesia are only
permitted to borrow through the Government which raises the funds on
their behalf. The interest provision in the revenue/cost coverage
clause was included as a precaution in case PLN should borrow minor
amounts of short-term funds from local banks.

/_   Investment records for 1971 are unreliable.
6.03      Although the data used are not fully reliable prior to 1973, they
nevertheless provide an appreciation of the unfavorable financial situation
prevailing before initiation of the recovery plan. Even in the absence of
any debt service, internal cash generation covered only slightly more than
cash expenses and the apparently high ratio of investments financed through
internal sources was due to a small investment program. Assuming a debt/
equity ratio of about 70/30 and what at that time would have been considered
a normal level of debt service (6.5% interest and 20 years repayment period),
a fitancing gap of about Rp 25.8 billion (US$62.2 million equivalent) would
have occurred during FY 1971-1973.
6.04      From 1973 onwards PLN's financial situation improved to a level
cn -which normal financial viability can be built. The Government and PLN
have performed remarkably well in meeting the financial targets. In
FY 1975 the 80% revenue/cost target was exceedLd and 84% (on the basis
)f revalued assets) was reached. Between FY 1973 and 1976 tariffs were
increased by 145%. Preliminary results of FY 1976 (not a test year under
the financial recovery plan) indicate a revenue/cost ratio of 97%, very
close to the break-even point required to be reached by FY 1979 in the
past Loan and Credit documents.



- 22 -
6.05      As described in paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15, PLN's recovery plan was
in the first place based on managerial improvements and stepped up invest-
ments which would lead to increased sales and, consequently, financial
viability. Subsequent tariff increases were meant as a further vehicle for
improving PLN's finances. It is now recognized that PLN's quicker than
planned recovery has been predominantly due to a vigorous tariff policy
aimed at maximizing internal cash generation, and also to management improve-
ments in operation and maintenance of existing plant. The investment aspect,
however, has not yet had its intended effect which is attributable to the
long lead time as well as PLN's still prevailing deficiencies in investment
planning and implementation (para 3.15 (d)).
Financial Targets after Recovery
6.06      Bearing in mind that the revenue/cost targets of the recovery
plan are of a temporary nature and PLN could well recover before 1979--in
fact it is likely to do so--a covenant was included in Loan 1259-IND re-
quiring PLN to develop, in consultation with the Bank, a system of more
conventional financial targets to apply after financial recovery had been
achieved.
6.07      After initial discussions with the Indonesian authorities, a
"Memorandum on Financial Criteria and Performance Tests" was sent to
Indonesia, and is attached as Annex 11. It discusses the Bank's approach
to determining and measuring financial viability of a power utility and
tries to demonstrate the effect certain assumptions have on PLN's finances.
Over the next several months it will be thoroughly discussed with the
Government and PLN, and will later, probably in the next lending operation,
form the basis for conventional covenants.
6.08      Preliminary calculations made to get an appreciation of future
financial trends for PLN (for details see Annex 11) indicate the following
targets:
(a) gradual phasing out of dividend free equity input
by the Government;
(b) a debt/equity ratio of not more than 70/30;
(c) a debt service coverage of about 1; 1/
(d) a gradually increasing rate of return on revalued
average net fixed assets in operation from about
2% to about 14%; 2/ and
(e) self financing of about 302 of the investment program.
1/   Maximum future annual debt service covered by the gross internal sources of
the actual twelve-month period prior to debt incurrence.
2/   The high return would apply after 1984.



- 23 -
For illustration purposes the following is a summary of the projected finan-
cial results based on the above targets. As shown in detail in Annex 11,
the indices have been prepared on the basis of current prices (revalued
alternative) as well as 1976 prices (non-revalued alternative) to illustrate
the impact future estimated inflation may have on PLN's financial indices.
Some of the above-mentioned targets will, of course, be reached only after
FY 1984:

Financial Covenants in Loan Documents
6.09      Although it is likely that PLN will reach the financial breakeven
point (revenue/cost ratio of 100%) earlier than expected, the financial
covenants contained in the documents of Loan 1259-IND have been repeated.
They are:
(a)  the financial recovery plan;
(b)  the "reasonable financial contribution"
requirement to apply after recovery
(Section 4.03 Project Agreement);



- 24 -
(c) PLN's debt payment requirement (Section
4.04 Project Agreement);
(d) the debt service coverage requirement
(Section 4.05 Project Agreement); and
(e) the three-month billing limit (Section 4.06
Project Agreement).
Financing Plan
6.10      Observing the above criteria and using constant (1976) prices
as well as current price bases (for details see Annex 11), the following
financing plans covering the period FY 1977-1984 ensue:

6.11      During the period FY 1977-1984, net internal cash generation
is expected to finance 30% of the investment program of which the project
represents about 4%. PLN's gross fixed assets are estimated to increase
by about 700% (revalued alternative). Despite the expected earnings
improvement, the equivalent of US$5.3 billion will have to be raised
through bilateral and multilateral aid and through the Government budget. The
above data illustrate that even the smaller investment program based on the



- 25 -
lower demand forecast (para 2.11) will require a large effort in fund raising.
There are doubts that this can actually be accomplished, underscoring the need
for well planned capital expenditure programs and balanced investment budgets
(paras 2.12 and 2.13).
Subsidiary Loan
6.12      As in previous operations, the Government has agreed during
negotiations to relend the proceeds of the proposed Loan to PLN on terms
equivalent to those of the Bank loan. In addition, the Government will
finance interest and commitment charges during the grace period of the
Loan which is in line with financing practices in public utilities and
avoids debt service payments during the remainder of the recovery
period. In accordance with Indonesian policy, the Government will bear
the foreign exchange risk during the Loan repayment period. Signing of
the Subsidiary Loan Agreement is a condition of Loan Effectiveness.
Audit
6.13      As in earlier operations, the standard audit covenant has been
included in the documents of the proposed Loan with the understanding that
the Directorate General of State Financial Supervision, which by law has
to audit PLN, is acceptable to the Bank as long as it provides satisfactory
audit.  Audit reports will continue to be sent to the Bank- annually not
later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal year.
Insurance
6.14      PLN does not presently insure its property in operation although
insurance against hazards of acquisition and transportation and delivery
of goods is regularly arranged. A recent review by SOFRELEC revealed that
insurance rates are exorbitantly high in Indonesia and would be prohibitive,
particularly for PLN, as long as it is still considered a high risk company.
As an interim measure it was agreed in earlier operations that the Govern-
ment will provide PLN with the funds required to cover normally insurable
damage minus a deductible amount equivalent to US$100,000. This stipulation
has been repreated in the documents of the proposed Loan.
Tariffs
6.15      The basic tariff structure of PLN for electric rates was estab-
lished by Government decree on June 12, 1973.  This structure of tariffs
was based on a study by SOFRELEC and, as for all tariff structures, was
a compromise between the cost of service and the social and political
considerations within the country.  Included wiLh the basic tariff structure,
PLN was given the right to increase its tariffs to cover the cost of transpor-
tation of fuel, increases in the price of fuel and increases of other current
expenses.



- 26 -
6.16      From 1973 to date, PLN has, with Government approval, surcharged
its basic tariffs with these excess costs so that where the basic rate
supplies Rp 11.13 per kWh to revenues, the surcharges supply Rs 16.08 per kWh
for a total average sale price of Rp 27.21 per kWh. This surcharge has been
applied to all classifications of tariffs on the basis of rupiahs per kWh
of energy with some variations between areas and classes of service.
6.17      There are two extremes in the possible method of distributing
surcharges, the first applying a percentage increase to the basic rate on
both the demand charge and the energy charge, and the second applying the
increase only to the basic energy charge. Neither system is correct and
when surcharges become in the order of 145%, as in the case of PLN, dis-
tortions between tariff classes as well as within a class of tariff occur.
Actually, the only practical method to eliminate this distortion is to
introduce a new tariff and revise both the demand and energy portions of
the basic rates.
6.18      PLN's practice to apply all surcharges on the basis of kWh sold
has caused distortions in the tariff structure among the various classes
of customers. This has not seriously affected consumers other than large
industrial, where the effect on these tariffs has been such that a customer
with a reasonable load factor would find it less costly to purchase its
own generating plant rather than to purchase from PLN. The following
table provides an example of a 400 kVA customer in Java and his charges
on the basis of the basic tariff, the basic tariff plus the surcharge as
presently applied and the basic tariff plus the surcharge applied on the
basis of demand charge and energy charge:
Basic Tariff plus       Basic Tariff plus
Monthly                             Surcharges as        Surcharge (145%) Applied
Usage      Basic Tariff          Presently Applied   On Demand and Energy Charge
(hours)       (Rp/kWh)               (Rp/kWh)                  (Rp/kWh)
50             14.2                   28.4                      38.4
100              9.6                   23.6                      23.5
200              7.3                   21.3                      17.8
300              6.5                   20.5                      16.0
400              6.1                   20.2                      15.0
6.19      In recognition of the distorting effect of PLN's present practice
of levying surcharges on kWh usage only but also bearing in mind that abrupt
tariff changes may not be politically feasible, a covenant was included in
Loan 1259-IND, and has been repeated in the proposed Loan, requiring the
Government and PLN to:
(a) ensure that future tariff surcharges will be related
to actual cost of service;
(b) embark on a program of tariff surcharge rearrange-
ments and corresponding billings so that by



- 27 -
March 31, 1979 the basic tariff plus surcharges
represent cost related charges; and
(c) adopt by April 1, 1979 a basic tariff schedule
which incorporates all tariff surcharges.
6.20      It would be appropriate to start with the tariff for large cus-
tomers. The realignment of the surcharges on this tariff could be made to
reflect, as far as possible, the incremental cost of service as well as to
make the tariff competitive with private generation. The surcharge given
in the last column of the above table is not necessarily the correct dis-
tribution but PLN could investigate different percentage increases to the
demand and energy charge that would correct the present distortion, so that
the revised basic tariff and surcharges can be incorporated into a new
tariff in 1979. After first correcting the large industrial tariff, PLN
could then investigate a revision of the other tariffs on the basis of the
same general principle. In any case the Bank and the Indonesian authorities
will keep close contact in this matter.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During Loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points and appropriate covenants were included in the documents:
(a) adoption of the lower of two projections of PCR's
Java System Development Study as a guideline for
system development in Java until FY1984 (para 2.12(a)).
(b) annual review with the Bank of potential load growth
changes and variations in the system development (para
2.12 (b)); and
(c) annual review with the Bank of PLN's investment budget
(para 2.13).
7.02      The following are conditions of Loan effectiveness:
(a) satisfactory contractual arrangements with the
engineering consultants for Muara Karang 4 and 5
(para. 4.13); and
(b) signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement between
the Government and PLN (para. 6.12).
7.03      Conclusion of satisfactory financing arrangements for the supply
and erection of major equipment of Muara Karang unit No. 5 is a condition
of disbursements against expenditures for this unit (para. 4.11).
7.04      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$116 million, for a term of 20 years including 4.5 years of grace.

Summary of Legislation Affecting PLN
(as of December 31, 1975)
1.        The following is a summary of the Indonesian legislation as far as
it affects directly PLN's legal status and activities. In particular it
comprises:
(i) Government Decree No. 18/1972 dated May 18, 1972 of
the President of the Republic - PLN's Charter;
(ii) Decree No. 12/PRT/1975 dated September 9, 1975 of the
Minister of Public Works and Electric Power - General
Policy, Objective and Scope of Activities. This regula-
tion revokes Decree No. 13/PRT/1972;
(iii) Decree No. 13/PRT/1975 dated September 9, 1975 of the
Minister of Public Works and Electric Power - Organization
and Business Rules of PLN. This regulation revokes
Decree No. 1/PRT/1973; and
(iv) various decrees on budget administration.
Status
2.        PLN is a Public Enterprise (Perum). It is the executing agency
of the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power for power development
throughout the country, carrying out its objectives within the National
Development Program in accordance with Government policies. All legal
provisions existing in Indonesia and not revoked or modified by above
decrees continue to apply.
Responsibilities
3.        Most of the activities mentioned below are PLN's exclusive res-
ponsibility. In some cases, however, the Government retained the right
of final decision, and if so, appropriate notes have been made. PLN's
responsibilities are:



ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 7 pages
(i) construction and operation of generation, transmission
and distribution facilities including procurement. Despite
Decree No. 12/PRT/1975, which provides the Government
with the authority for procurement of goods and services
financed from the national budget, an undertaking was
received from the Government during negotiations that it
will restrict its involvement to bid evaluation only.
(ii)  drafting of power development plans based on demand surveys
and load forecasts. These programs become part of the
national development plan and, consequently, are subject
to Government approval;
(iii) drafting of regulations licensing power installations owned
by third parties. After approval by the Minister, adminis-
tration of the regulation becomes PLN's responsibility.
At the moment the following licensing rules apply:
(a)  no registration is required for power generators
of less than 2 kVA capacity;
(b)  generators with a capacity of 2-25 kVA must be
registered with PLN;
(c)  prior to installing a generator of more than
25 kVA capacity, a permit must be obtained from
PLN; and
(d)  installations existing before May 18, 1972 (date
of PLN's Charter) are exempt from above licensing
provisions.
(iv) entering into purchase or sales contracts of electric
power with third parties;
(v) organizing of training for its personnel; and
(vi) conducting research in the field of electric power.
In exercising its responsibilities, PLN is entitled within the framework
of existing laws and regulations to:
(i) make use of private and public roads;
(ii)  enter into and/or make temporary use of public and
private property;
(iii) install wires and cables above or under public and
private property; and



ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 7 pages
(iv) dig in public as well as private roads.
Supervision by Government
4.        The Minister determines PLN's policy and exercises general control
over its activities. He is advised by an Advisory Board consisting of the
Ministers of Finance, Industry and National Development Planning (Chairman
of BAPPENAS) on all policy matters, including annual and long-range develop-
ment programs, tariffs, audits and other issues of major importance for PLN's
activities.
Management
5.        PLN's management is in the hands of a Board of Directors consisting
of a President Director and at least two Directors. At the moment there are
five Directors responsible for planning, construction, operation, finance
and administration. The President Director is responsible to the Minister,
the Directors report to the President Director in their respective fields.
6.        In performing its management functions the Board acts as an agent
of the Minister. The members of the Board are appointed by the President
of the Republic for a maximum period of 5 years. They are eligible for re-
appointment.
7.        PLN's middle management consists of (see also Organization Chart
on page 7):
(i) Deputy Directors in headquarters;
(ii) Director Power Research Center;
(iii) Director Training Center;
(iv) Chiefs, Regional Offices; and
(v) Chiefs, Special Projects.
They are appointed by the Minister upon recommendation of the Board. The
officials mentioned in (i) through (iv) are responsible to the Board.
Concerning the Chiefs, Special Projects the decree is not clear. For all
practical purposes, however, they can also be considered as responsible
to the Board.
Organization
8.        The organization is divided into three distinct levels which
reflect the fact that PLN has to cover a huge area with largely inadequate
communication and transportation facilities:



ANNEX 5
Page 4 of 7 pages
(i)  Leadership - Board of Directors together with the deputy
directorships, all located in headquarters.
Internally the leadership level is respon-
sible for overall guidance, planning and
policy matters in coordination with the Minis-
try. Externally it keeps contact with all
agencies of the Government, particularly the
Ministries of Public Works and Electric Power.
Operationally headquarters performs all the
tasks prior to implementation (for instance
drafting and review of bidding documents,bud-
get, and operation of the central warehouse
and workshop) and collection and finalization
of statistical and accounting data.
(ii) Supporting
Services - Power Research Center and Training Center.
(iii) Executing
Level    - Regional Offices and Special Projects.  The
regional offices are responsible for all
operational matters within their area as well
as the implementation of minor projects.
Special Projects are construction implementa-
tion units for projects too large or too
important to be handled by regional offices.
9.        PLN's directorates in headquarters have the following responsi-
bilities:
Directorate
Planning      - Technical as well as management planning; input
for the national development plans; designing of
technical standards throughout the country; eval-
uation of application for captive plant licenses;
and bid evaluation and bid award.
Directorate
Operation     - Guidance and supervision in matters of
operation and maintenance of generation
transmission and distribution facilities;
construction of minor distribution facili-
ties; operation of the central workshop and
warehouse; and drafting of power supply con-
tracts with third parties.



ANNEX 5
Page 5 of 7 pages
Directorate
Construction  - Guidance and supervision in project implemen-
tation; research on improvement of construction
methods; procurement of construction equipment,
if required; construction contract supervision;
and drafting and supervision of construction
budget.
Directorate
Finance       - Central accounting and financial management;
drafting and supervision of the revenues and
expenditures budget; and internal audit.
Directorate
Administration - Performance of administrative services; person-
nel management; legal assistance; Board secre-
tariat; and personnel safety.
Audit
10.       PLN's external audit is the responsibility of the Directorate
General of State Finance Control. PLN has to submit its annual accounts
for auditing not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. The
audit should normally be completed within 3 months. The Directorate main-
tains staff in PLN's headquarters who are responsible for a permanent audit.
Budget
11.       The budget of revenues and expenditures is within PLN's authority
and has to be submitted to the Government only for information and as sup-
porting data on internal cash generation. The investment budget, however,
is subject to strict Government regulations and, although PLN enjoys slightly
more autonomy than other state enterprises, the budget process is still
cumbersome. The following paragraphs illustrate the preparation, approval
and supervision process of PLN's investment budget.



ANNEX 5
Page 6 of 7 pages
12.                           Budget Calendar
(Fiscal Year April 1 - March 31)
Se tember
through
December  -  After negotiations with BAPPENAS on work programs
to be performed in the coming fiscal year as well as
budget ceiling settings (this is in fact a con-
tinuous process), the final budget proposal
(Daftar Usulan Projek - DUP) is submitted through
the Minister of Public Works and Electric Power
to BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Finance to be
included in the Rencana Anggaran Pendabatan dan
Belanja Negara (RAPBN), the overall budget pro-
posal.
January   -  The President of the Republic submits the overall
budget proposal to the Parliament for approval.
March     -  Before the end of March the Parliament has to finish
its deliberations on the budget proposal which,
after approval, becomes the final budget (Anggaran
Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara - APBN).
April     -  The Ministry of Finance through the Minister of
Public Works and Power informs PLN of its share
of the final Government budget. This is called
Daftar Isian Projek (DIP).
13.       For each fiscal year regulations on budget withdrawal procedures
are stipulated by Presidential Decree. They may differ somewhat from year
to year, but in principle remain unchanged. In the case of PLN the various
regional Treasury offices receive authorization to release quarterly the
budgeted amounts over which PLN then has spending authority.

2. General Assumptions
(a) Investment Cost
On the basis of 1976 prices, the investment cost of
Muara Karang 4 and 5 is approximately Rp 64 billion,
exclusive of all duties and taxes.
(b) Operation and Maintenance Cost
The operation and maintenance cost was estimated
at 2% of the capital cost of the Muara Karang units
and the associated transmission and distribution.
(c) Fuel Cost
PLN purchases its fuel oil at the controlled price of
Rp 22 per liter for Bunker C (US$8.43 per barrel) and
Rp 25 and 22 per liter for high speed and industrial
diesel (US$9.58 and 8.43 per barrel). For calculation
of the economic return and the least cost solution
todays's world market price of US$11.25 per barrel was
used for Bunker C oil. Although diesel oil prices are
normally about 50% higher than Bunker C prices, this
difference was not taken into account since no free
market price exists in Indonesia. However, the diesel
price was raised by the same percentage as the Bunker C
price to maintain the price differential as now existing.
(d) Cost of Transmission and Distribution
An investment of approximately Rp 48 billion in transmission
and distribution will be required to market the output of
Muara Karang 4 and 5.
(e) Operating Pattern
The Muara Karang plant would be operated at a plant factor
of about 70% for the first 10 years and, thereafter, would
be shifted gradually to the upper portion of the load
curve with decreasing operating hours. A plant factor of
55% was assumed for the last 5 years of the 25-year plant
life.
(f) Incremental Revenue
The incremental revenues of the Project were calculated
on the basis of the present average sale price of Rp 27.21
per kWh. These revenues are used as measure of the benefits
of the project. To be extent that they exclude consumers
surpluses, the economic return based on these revenues is
understated.

MEMORANDUM ON
FINANCIAL CRITERIA AND PERFORMANCE TESTS
I.   BASIC CONSIDERATION
1.        Section 4.08 of the Project Agreement of Loan 1259-IND requires
PLN to develop, in consultation with the Bank, a system of appropriate
financial performance targets designed to evaluate all aspects of PLN's
financial management. These targets would apply after PLN has attained
full financial recovery as defined in earlier documents between the Govern-
ment of Indonesia (GOI), PLN and the Bank. Agreement was reached on this
covenant because PLN is approaching the end of its financial recovery
period and is now entering the phase of normal financial viability.
2.        The definition of what constitutes financial viability of a power
utility varies widely between economic systems and prevailing theories about
the role of the Government in the power sector. On one end of the scale can
be found the "private enterprise approach," on the other end there is the
"public service approach" which considers electric service a basic necessity
to be provided to the public at the lowest possible cost with subsidization
of certain marginal consumer classes (for instance rural electrification).
The private enterprise approach is profit oriented and aims at a maximum
return on invested capital. It has to maintain a first class credit rating
to be able to raise the necessary funds for expansion in the capital market
at lowest possible cost. The public service approach maintains that revenues
from sales of power should only cover expenses, 1/ the return on invested
capital should at best cover debt service in excess of depreciation (equity
capital constitutes "public funds" owned by all consumers within an economy
who reap the "return" through lower tariffs) and investment should be largely
financed through Government budget allocations.
3.        Both approaches mentioned above have their merits and drawbacks
and, given the proper economic and political environment, can function
perfectly well. As a rule, the Bank is not concerned with the economic system
of the borrowing country. However, in each lending operation for a public
power utility one of the major objectives followed by the Bank is to establish
and maintain the financial viability of the utility in the context of its
economic environment. Experience has shown that, as a minimum, the entity
1/   The definition of what constitutes expenses again varies considerably.



ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 21 pages
.hould be able to meet from its revenues all financial obligations such as
current expenditures and debt service payments, and should be in a position
to mobilize the additional resources necessary for its expansion in appro-
priate proportion through earnings, borrowings and equity contributions.
Given the capital intensive nature of the electric power business, the
budgetdry constraints of many countries, and the generally inadequate de-
velopment of their capital markets which virtually precludes local borrowing
from sources other than the Government budget, it has generally been found
prudent that power utilities be able to finance a reasonable proportion of
their expansion program from internal cash generation. There is no fixed
rule as to how large the internal cash proportion should be, in fact it
varies between about 20% and 60% of investments, depending on the adequacy of
capital sources external to the borrower.
4.        As indicated above, "financial viability" is not an absolute
criterion. It can only be determined on a case by case analysis of the
sector and its economic and financial environment. Consequently, the
following paragraphs deal with the aspects affecting financial viability
in the light of PLN's special circumstances, they discuss the techniques
to measure financial performance, and they try to demonstrate the effect
certain assumptions have on.PLN's finances.
II. ASPECTS AFFECTING FINANCIAL VIABILITY
Earnings
5.        A prudent revenue policy is the cornerstone of good financial
management. This memorandum does not deal with the tariff aspect which
will be discussed separately in the context of the problem of PLN's tariff
surcharges.
Debt versus Equity
6.        With the exception of the onlent funds of two Bank loans, all
capital invested by the Government in PLN is in the form of equity without
obligation to repay. This is because before PLN became a quasi autonomous
entity in 1972 the Government considered it as one of its departments fully
financed through the normal Government budget process. During the early
part of the financial recovery period this was maintained to strengthen
PLN's finances.
7.        Since for the time being the Government is the only source of
PLN's external financing, one could argue that this arrangement should
continue without change. In fact, however, the Government has to incur
debt on behalf of PLN, at least for the foreign component of PLN's
development program, probably also for part of the local borrowings since
it also might have to borrow for instance from Bank Indonesia. Consequent-
ly, it is entitled to be reimbursed for the cost of the borrowed capital
(interest and similar charges as well as the repayment installments).



ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 21 pages
8.        Apart from the above Indonesia - specific situation there is
a more general aspect, namely, borrowing for expansion is required simply
because funds from internal cash generation plus equity input are not
sufficient to finance a reasonable expansion program without raising
tariffs to unjustifiably high levels. Furthermore, it would not be fair
to let present customers pay through increased prices for investments
utilized by future consumers.
9.        The major questions which arise in the context of debt in pro-
portion to equity financing are:
(a) what portion of PLN's development program
should be financed through borrowing; and
(b) on what terms should borrowing be undertaken.
Both questions are interrelated. Despite the fact that paragraph (1)a of
Article 31 of Government Regulation No. 18/1972 provides that 55% of PLN's
annual profit after taxes should be allocated to the overall (Government)
capital investment fund (for all practical purposes this would be a dividend
payment), paragraph (4) of the same article empowers the Minister of Finance
to reinvest these funds in PLN. This policy can reasonably be assumed to
prevail also in future. Consequently, the equity portion can be considered as
"free" funds to PLN with a subsidizing effect on the borrowing terms. Under
these circumstances and with reasonable terms as discussed in paragraph 10,
total long-term borrowing should not exceed 60% - 70% of PLN's total capital-
ization and, consequently, the equity component should be of the order of 30% -
40% (debt/equity ratio between 60/40 and 70/30).
10.       A reasonable debt/equity ratio alone, however, does not necessarily
imply sound financial standing since, for instance, excessive short-term borrow-
ing would create serious cash flow problems. In the ideal case borrowing terms
should be equivalent to the useful life of plant they finance such as construc-
tion period plus 20 years for thermal generation, transmission and distribution
and about 40 years for hydro generation. Such terms, of course, are not obtain-
able. Consequently, care should be taken that with the before-mentioned mix
of debt and equity, the average term for all loans should be not less than
19-20 years and the average repayment period not less than 15 years.
Valuation of Assets
11.       Proper asset valuation is important for showing the true capitaliza-
tion of a company, for charging correct levels of depreciation on assets, for
measurement of efficiency and, last but not least, for establishing the basis
to measure the return on investment. In recent, years lack of asset revalua-
tion has increasingly become a problem throughout the world because regulatory
agencies frequently did not permit utilities to maintain realistic asset



ANNEX 11
Page 4 of 21 pages
maintain realistic asset values. Consequently, worldwide inflation has
progressively outdated the accounts, and gradually decapitalized the
corporations either because of taxation of book profits from which only
inadequate depreciation had been deducted, or because of inadequate return
on investment.
12.       After physical inventory and revaluation in 1971, PLN's assets
have been recorded at historic cost. The significance of accounts pre-
pared on the basis of historic cost, however, is subject to limitations.
The monetary unit in which they were prepared was not a stable unit of
measurement. During the recent period of rising prices a decrease in
purchasing power occurred which was not treated as a reduction of profits.
Depreciation charges were too low and fixed assets gradually lost their
significance as reliable basis for measuring the adequacy of tariffs.
13.       It is recognized that establishing realistic asset values
through revaluation is a controversial subject mainly because it is
difficult to develop units of measurement which maintain realistic
values. A number of techniques have been developed in this respect,
often derived from special circumstances in a particular country. The
two methods most often used are:
(a) the engineering appraisal method; and
(b) the index method.
14.       The object of the engineering appraisal method is to express
the existing fixed assets in current values (and not in terms of the
original monetary cost) derived from annual analyses of their cost
of replacement and remaining useful lives. Its main disadvantages are the
wide margin of personal opinion it leaves and the comparatively large
amount of time and cost it entails. In practice it requires establish-
ment of a permanent assessment unit within the company. However, sometimes
it has the side benefit of obtaining a complete inventory of assets, and
updating and improving of property records.
15.       The index method of revaluing assets tries to eliminate from the
accounts the effect of fluctuations in the purchasing power of money. The
method is not strictly a proposal for a change from accounting based on
historical cost, it tries to adjust accounts which have been prepared on the
basis of historical cost by applying an index to the historic asset value.
Thus the theory of the index method is that if there has been a change in the
purchasing power of money between the time when a transaction was entered into
and the date on which the accounts are prepared, the currency in which the
transaction took place was a currency different from that now in use. Con-
sequently, a conversion into the new currency must take place for which an
index of purchasing power is being used.



ANNEX 11
Page 5 of 21 pages
16.       The index method is certainly the one most widely used.  However,
it poses the problem of deciding which index to use, the cost of living
index, a special revaluation index or, for the foreign exchange component
of assets, the free exchange rate, if available. The index chosen should
be representative (it should neither overstate nor understate the asset
value), it should be easy to apply and it should be published regularly,
reliably and shortly after the close of the period it covers.
Taxes
17.       At present, taxes do not seem to pose a particular problem for
PLN. This is mainly because PLN has incurred annual losses rather than
profits in the past and also property tax has not been levied. With pro-
gressing financial recovery, however, the Government and PLN will have to
agree on a taxation system for public utilities. Problems arising in this
context are the tax rate (application of the present 45% corporation tax
rate), accelerated depreciation, permissible depreciation on revalued assets
(see above), tax credits, and similar items. The question of charging a
revaluation tax, as seems to be the case at present, should be thoroughly
reviewed.
III. TECHNIQUES TO MEASURE FINANCIAL VIABILITY
18.       As mentioned above, the Bank is interested in establishing and
maintaining the financial viability of its borrowers. For this purpose,
it agrees with Governments and companies on precise criteria for minimum
financial performance to assure the borrower's continued solvency and, more
specifically, the successful completion of the financing plan for the Bank-
financed project. The careful formulation of these performance tests and
the subsequent insistence by the Bank that they be observed, are therefore
very much in the interest of the borrowing entity and the Government.
19.       Of the two basic test areas which have developed into targets
for standard requirements in practically all loans to public utilities,
one aims at maintaining a specific minimum level of earnings throughout
the life of the loan (tariff covenant), the other establishes warning signals
to prevent the borrower from entering at any given time into commitments
which might endanger his solvency and requires him to consult with the Bank
when these signals are triggered (debt limitation covenant). Other types
of covenants may occasionally supplement these tests.
20.       Financial covenants are not intended to be, and cannot be, a
substitute for sound financial policies and competent financial management
of the borrower, but they are an assurance against unsound practices.
They provide the protection which would be required by a prudent investor
and should be viewed in much the same way as a Government guarantee-available
if needed, but unnecessary in the normal course of operation.



ANNEX 11
Page 6 of 21 pages
Tariff Covenants
21.       Historically the Bank has used the following three types of
tariff covenants:
(1) rate of return on net fixed assets in operation;
(2) contribution to expansion; and
(3) operating ratio.
Although still sometimes used when particular circumstances so require
(for instance PLN's recovery plan), the Bank tries to avoid the operating
ratio covenant because of its two main disadvantages:
(1) it does not deal with the return on investment
aspect of performance because it disregards
invested capital except for the depreciation
aspect; and
(2) it does not deal with the cash generation
aspect because it is only partially affected
by capital structure, terms of debt, dividends
and working capital needs.
Consequently, the following paragraphs deal only with the rate of return and
contribution to expansion aspects.
Rate of Return
22.       The rate of return is calculated as follows:
1/

23.       The rate of return concept has in the past been most widely used
by the Bank in defining earnings targets for its borrowings. It is pre-
ferred because:
(1) it reflects widely accepted costing concepts
in pricing utility services;
(2) it provides an accurate test, calculated on
an objective basis, of the profitability of
a company; and
(3) it relates net income to the corresponding
revenue producing assets.
24.       Although the rate of return concept is technically speaking an
earnings test, the definition of the reasonable return must also aim at
providing sufficient internal cash generation. The determining factors for
the return levels are therefore the existing capitalization of the enter-
prise and the terms of its borrowings, the expected growth rate for the
services, the prospective investment pattern and the availability of other
capital funds. This emphasis on the cash aspects of rate making is, in
virtually all expanding utilities, consistent with the parallel object of
having tariffs include an adequate charge for the cost of capital invested in
the enterprise. In the unusual event that an adequate return on capital
would generate more cash than the enterprise needs, excess funds would be
available to the Government for reinvestment elsewhere in the economy. In
actual fact, earnings by themselves rarely cover all the costs of expansion
and have to be supplemented by infusion of loan or equity capital.
25.       Desirable as the rate of return concept may be, it has a distinct
disadvantage. It works only if the assets of the enterprise are properly
valued and revalued to ensure that the rate base, the net operating income
and the depreciation charges are maintained at the same level in constant
terms. Recent experience shows that, generally speaking, asset valuation
has not kept pace with inflationary tendencies, in fact it has been dis-
allowed by a number of regulatory agencies or governments. The consequence
is that many utilities, although formally complying with stipulated return
targets, are in fact no longer able to maintain a sound financial viability.
2/   Gross value of fixed assets in operation less the amount of ac-
cumulated depreciation less the accumulated total of consumers'
capital contributions, all valued from time to time in accordance
with sound and consistently maintained methods of revaluation.
The term "average" means one half the sum of the value of net
fixed assets in operation at the beginning and at the end of the
year in question.



ANNEX 11

Contribution to Expansion
26.       The contribution to expansion concept measures net internal
cash generation 1/ against capital expenditures. It stipulates that
a defined minimum percentage of capital expenditures (investments) should
be financed through net internal cash generation. Since annual invest-
ment may vary, a series of consecutive years is frequently used, sometimes
all actuals, sometimes a blend of actual and forecast years. The use of
projected years only should be avoided because in this case too many
assumptions would enter into the calculation.
27.       The main advantage of the contribution to expansion concept,
which is becoming more and more evident, is that it can provide effective
protection against the financial consequences of inflation because it
measures cash requirement against investment at current prices. Con-
sequently, it is particularly appropriate for comparatively small utilities
with a large investment program. Furthermore, proper asset valuation reduces
in importance because the value of net fixed assets in operation does not
enter the calculation. Of course, there are other reasons for maintaining
a proper valuation of assets as outlined above.
28.       However, the contribution to investment concept has a serious
disadvantage. It is a questionable tool for formulating a sound tariff
policy because it eliminates past investment from the tariff base although
these investments form the capital basis on which a return has to be earned.
Often the need for averaging internal cash and investments over a number of
consecutive years is also quoted as a drawback; however we do not consider
this a serious weakness.
Debt Limitation
29.       There are several types of debt limitation targets, for example;
(1) debt/equity ratio;
(2) debt/asset ratio;
1/   Difference between (a) the sum of gross revenues from all sources
related to the utility's operations including cash consumers'
contributions in aid of construction, and (b) the sum of all
expenses of operation, maintenance and administration (excluding
depreciation and other noncash operating charges), repayment of
loans, interest and other charges on debt (excluding interest
financed under a loan contract), all taxes or payments in lieu
of taxes, all cash dividends and other cash distribution of sur-
plus, and any other cash outflows other than capital investments.

(3) interest coverage test; and
(4) debt service coverage test.
Although all tests mentioned above have been used by the Bank, those mentioned
in items (1) through (3) are less desirable and should be applied only in
special circumstances. The debt/equity and debt/asset, ratios react too
slowly to imprudent borrowing and also disregard entirely the borrowing terms.
The interest coverage test includes only part of the debt service. Consequently,
the preferred type is the debt service coverage test.
Debt Service Coverage
30.       The debt service coverage test is basically that included in Section
4.05 (ii) of the Project Agreement 1259-IND. It becomes operative each time
the utility wishes to incur debt. Then it compares the internal cash gener-
ation (defined as gross revenues less current expenses before depreciation and
interest) of the latest actual fiscal year or any actual twelve-month period
ended prior to debt incurrence, whichever is higher, with the maximum future
total annual debt service, including debt service on the debt to be incured.
31.       Bank documents include a target specifying how many times maximum
future debt service should at least be covered by actual internal cash gener-
ation. It should be noted, however, that if the test indicates that the coverage
requirement will not be met, the borrower is not prohibited from borrowing; he
has only to seek Bank concurrence before incurring such debt which, after
scrutinizing the financing plan, will normally be granted. As mentioned in
paragraph 19, the covenant is a warning light signalling possible danger to
the borrower's solvency rather than an absolute target.
IV. PLN'S FUTURE FINANCES
32.       Above theoretical considerations have been applied to PLN's estimated
future financial situation. Two forecasts have been made; one on the basis of
constant 1976 prices, the other on current prices using estimated future infla-
tion factors for revaluation of assets as well as current costs (for details see
attached tables and notes). In forecasting PLN's finances, the following basic
assumptions have been made:
(a)  PLN is expected to finance in future 30% of its capital
expenditures through net internal cash generation;
(b) from FY 1977/78 onwards, all Government funds will be
passed on to PLN in the form of loans instead of equity
as long as the debt service coverage is acceptable (see
paragraph (d)). Until FY 1977/78, Government funds have
been assumed as equity with the exception of those
borrowed on the basis of onlending agreements between
the Government and PLN (for instance Loans No. 1127 and
1259-IND);



ANNEX 11
Page 10 of 21 pages
(c) the assumed future average borrowing terms are:
19 years, including 4 years of grace, and 10%
interest per year. During the grace period interest
will be capitalized; and
(~) coverage of maximum future debt service through
actual internal cash generation (see paragraph 30
and 31) should not be less than 1.3 times the
maximum future debt service.
33.       On the basis of attached projections it appears that the following
two alternatives are available for measuring PLN's financial performance:
(a) rate of return on average net fixed assets in
operation. Gradually increasing targets from
about 1% to about 14% per year, the latter when
the full debt service becomes operative. For
applying the rate of return criterion, a system
for asset revaluation would have to be agreed on.
Above targets would have to be supplemented by a
debt service coverage of about 1.3;
(b) internal cash contribution to capital expenditures
or at least 30%. Although a debt service coverage
provision is, strictly speaking, unnecessary when
applying the cash contribution concept--this is
because debt service is deducted from gross
internal sources to arrive at net internal cash
generation--it is still advisable as an early
warning device on borrowing.

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Data
Revaluation
The financial data for the actual years 1971 through 1975/76 are
shown on the basis of actual figures as well as currently revalued assets.
The financial projections are based on:
(a) 1976 price levels; and
(b) current prices through application of
estimated inflation factors.
Assets revaluation starts with FY 1972 since PLN's assets were physically
identified and properly valued as of December 31, 1971. For revaluing the
foreign exchange cost of investments, the inflation factors included in
several Bank Central Projects Memoranda on "Guidelines on Price Contin-
gencies" have been used.  Revaluation of the local cost component is based
on the "General Price Index" as included in the Bank's report entitled
"Public Sector Investment and Financial Resources in Indonesia" dated
May 24, 1976. Assuming an average blend of 65% foreign and 35% local cost,
the following indices ensue:

Energy Sales
The forecasts of electricity sales are based on the lower of two
demand projections included in the Java System Development Study made by the
consulting firm of Preece, Cardew and Rider. However, downward revisions
have been made in the sales projections, particularly during the earlier years
of the forecast period, because PLN's delays in completion of distribution
rehabilitation and expansion programs make it unlikely to achieve the high
(up to 37% per year) sales increases projected by the consultants. Similar
sales increases as in Java, but with a time lag of about 2 years, have been
assumed in other areas of Indonesia.
Revenues from Sales of Power
Starting from the budget 1976/77 level of average revenues of
power sales (Rp 27.21 per kWh), tariff projections have been adjusted to
achieve an average net internal cash generation of 30% PLN's capital expen-
ditures. This leads to tariff reductions during the next several years in
the non-revalued alternative whereas additional increases are required if
inflation continues.
Purchased Power
The bulk of the power purchases is from the Juanda hydroelectric
station (Jatiluhur Authority) and amounts at present to Rp 1.47 per kWh.
This expense increases in step with PLN's tariff adjustments.
Fuel
Present fuel prices (effective April 1, 1976) are:
1/
Bunker "C" Oil             : Rp 22/1-/
High Speed Diesel (HSD)  :  Rp 25/1
Industrial Diesel (IDO)  :  Rp 22/1
In addition there are surcharges for the cost of transportation which vary
with the location of the power stations.  On an average PLN charges Rp 1.20/1
for HSD and Rp 0.70/1 for IDO. No charge is presently levied on Bunker "C"
oil because PERTAMINA's terminals are located close to PLN's steam stations.
Increases of 10% per year have been assumed in the revalued alternative.
Personnel Expenses
The projections of personnel cost are based on PLN's staffing plans
and assume the following number of staff:
1/ This is equivalent to US$8.43 per barrel and compares to about US$11.25
per barrel in the world market. Indonesia's oil price is based on
PERTAMINA's cost plus a 20% profit margin.

This results in annual cost increases of 2%-3% per year on the
basis of 1976 price levels. For escalating the personnel cost, a modified
cost of living index has been used to allow for a catch-up period in the
earlier years and smaller increases later.
Material
The cost for materials and supply has been increased in step with
the capital expansion program.
Depreciation
The depreciation rates used are those prevailing in the past and
applied in other countries for similar type of plant. On an average these
are 5% per year for thermal plant, 2.5% for hydro stations and 3.5% for
transmission and distribution equipment.
Corporation Tax
In principle, PLN is liable to corporation tax which, according to
the information received, amounts to 45% of the taxable profit. However, it
has been assumed that PLN will be allowed to apply investment allowances,
accelerated depreciation, tax holidays and similar tax reducing allowances,
which would neutralize any tax impact.
Capitalization
It has been assumed that those financial requirements which are
not covered through internal cash generation would be financed through
average 19-year loans (including 4 years of grace) at an interest rate of
10% per year. During the grace period interest would be capitalized.
Financing already committed on equity terms (free of interest and repayment)
would continue to be disbursed on this basis.
