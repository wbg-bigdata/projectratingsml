REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of $116 million to
help finance a Sixth Power Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years,
including four and a half years of grace, with interest at 8.5 percent per
annum. Proceeds of the loan would be onlent to Perusahaan Umum Listrik
Negara (PLN), the electric power authority with the Government bearing the
foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECON6MY /1
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "Public Sector Investment
and Financial Resources in Indonesia" of May 24, 1976 (1187-IND) evaluated
and analyzed Indonesia's public sector investment programs in relation to
the resource availabilities in the next three years. An economic mission has
recently visited Indonesia and its report is expected to be ready about the
middle of March 1977. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        In most respects, Indonesia's economic performance in the past
eight years has been impressive. GNP growth has averaged 7.5 percent. The
rates of investment and national savings have risen rapidly, and net foreign
transfers have correspondingly declined as a proportion of GNP. Agricultural
output has expanded at an average rate of 4 to 5 percent (with rice production
expanding in step). The beginnings of modern industry have been set up and
the country is already virtually self-sufficient in fertilizer and is likely
to be so in cement within the next two or three years. Transport, power and
telecommunications systems and other infrastructure have been improved and
strengthened. In short, in its third year of the Second Development Plan
(1974-79), the economy is basically robust and provides a sharp contrast to
the situation less than a decade ago.
4.        However, very difficult and serious problems remain.   The country
and the overwhelming majority of its people are very poor. Average per
capita GNP is now estimated at $180 and 59: percent of the population lives
at levels below the absolute poverty base. The population growth rate is
rising and is currently estimated at 2.5 percent, and population pressure on
Java has been growing. Many new employment opportunities have been created
but much more needs to be done to provide employment for all the new entrants
into the labor force and reduce existing K'iemployment and underemployment.
General nutrition standards have probably improved, but real wage rates for
/1 This part is essentially the same as that included in the President's
Report on the Second PDFCI Project, January 11, 1977 (P-1976-IND).

unskilled labor are still among the lowest in the region, and have shown only
a modest improvement. The Government is committed to the alleviation of
these problems. Projects to shift population from Java to unused cultivable
areas in other islands to increase productivity and incomes of farmers in
Java, to provide employment in a large rural works project and to improve
public education, health, water supply and other conditions in both rural and
urban areas are going forward.
5.        The country's resource position, balance of payments and the
Government budgetary situation have been dominated in the last two to three
years by the developments in the oil sector. First, there were the successive
increases in the price of oil in 1973 and 1974, which resulted in its quadru-
pling to $12.60 per barrel within a matter of months. With this increase, by
mid-1974 the balance of payments and revenues of the Government were improved
sustantially.
6.        In the course of the 1974/75 fiscal year, the Government adjusted
its expenditure plans. As a consequence, most expenditure elements in the
development budget were revised upwards, some very substantially, to utilize
the unanticipated revenues. On the current expenditure side, a large and
much needed increase in the civil servants' salaries was granted. Over the
first six months of the fiscal year, the country's foreign exchange reserves
registered an increase of $650 million from a level of $930 million at the
start of 1974/75.
7.        In October 1974, however, the first signs appeared of what turned
out to be a substantial financial over extension by PERTAMIINA, the national
oil company. PERTAM1INA had undertaken a large and diversified investment
program financed to a substantial extent by short-term borrowing and in part
not financed at all. With the initial signs of a recession, monetary insti-
tutions in the industrialized countries became restrictive, credit became
more difficult to obtain and PERTAMINA began experiencing serious financial
problems. In the third quarter of 1974/75, it started withholding part of
the corporate oil tax it had collected on behalf of the Government from the
foreign oil companies; by the end of the fiscal year a total of Rp 346 bil-
lion ($830 million) had been so withheld and used to meet PERTAMINA's
financial obligations. Early in 1975, PERTAMINA failed to meet payments due
to some foreign banks, and the Government stepped in to stem an incipient
crisis and took decisive action. All independent foreign borrowing by
PERTAMIINA and other public enterprises was banned and Bank Indonesia was
given sole authority to contract foreign obligations on behalf of the public
sector. The Government instructed Bank Indonesia to provide the funds needed
to meet PERTAMINA's external obligations, undertook a comprehensive review of
the oil company's investment projects and began the process of reducing and
replanning the company's investment program and of cancelling and renegoti-
ating many of the related procurement contracts. In the course of 1975, the
Government also initiated the reorganization of the oil company, and in March
1976, replaced its top management.
8.        At about the same time, the recession in the industrialized coun-
tries began to affect petroleum consumption and oil sales from Indonesia
began to suffer. Non-oil exports, particularly those of timber and rubber,



- 3 -
also began to decline. The volume of oil production declined sharply, to
less than 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) compared to 1.45 million bpd in
the first six months of 1974. In the 1974/75 fiscal year, there was a
shortfall of about $200 million in net oil exports from the levels projected
early in the year, and non-oil exports failed to increase at all.
9.        These factors combined to create considerable financial diffi-
culties for the Government of Indonesia. The foreign exchange reserves
gained in the first half of the year were lost in the second; by March 31,
1975 these reserves had declined to the level of a year earlier (i.e.
$920 million). On the domestic front, the Government, after the promise of a
very large expansion in development expenditures, had to resort to financing
by Bank Indonesia of much of the investment programs of public enterprises
which were expected to be financed by increased tax revenues. Nevertheless,
total development expenditures in 1974/75 amounted to Rp 770 billion ($1.9 bil-
lion) about 60 percent (about 20 percent in real terms) higher than the
level in the previous year.
10.       In the first half of 1975/76, Indonesia's foreign exchange reserves
declined by a further $480 million, despite substantial capital inflows,
which included two syndicated public borrowings (totalling $575 million) from
the international capital market. With continuing recessionary conditions in
Indonesia's principal markets, exports failed to increase while imports rose
again in 1975/76 (about 30 percent on an annual basis). Payments on behalf of
PERTAMINA were also very large (about $1 billion). In the second half of
1975/76, there was no appreciable change in export earnings, but imports ant
debt service payments were lower and there was only a small reduction in
capital inflows (two more cash loans, amounting to $475 million, were raised).
The country's foreign exchange reserve position was, therefore, relatively
stable in this period and the decline in the reserves for the year as a whole
amounted to $360 million.
11.       Public sector investments continued to rise rapidly in 1975/76.
The Government's development expenditures amounted to over $3 billion
(Rp 1.27 trillion), including foreign project financing totalling $925 mil-
lion and fertilizer subsidies amounting to $320 million. This is more than
two and one-half times the expenditures in 1973/74; when adjusted for price
changes it still represents an increase of about 60 percent.    A further
increase of 50 percent in development expenditures was budgeted for 1976/77.
12.       As stated above, the Government has had to borrow over $1 billion
on commercial terms and has had to divert substantial additional financial
resources to completing PERTAMINA's investment projects which could not
economically be reduced further or abandoned. A considerable share of these
investments was also finaniced through domestic credit expansion.   Despite a
substantial decrease in foreign exchange reserves, money supply increased by
40 percent in 1974 and 30 percent in 1975. This contributed to domestic
inflation which was at the rate of 20 percent in 1975/76, a rate higher than
that prevailing in Indonesia's principal trade partners and competitors.



- 4 -
13.       The recent financial difficulties will affect Indonesia's external
public debt service obligations during the rest of the decade. Debt service
payments over the next several years will be much larger than previously
envisaged as a result of large commercial borrowings in 1975 and 1976 (most
but not all of which related to PERTAMINA's obligations and projects) by the
Government. Debt service in 1976 is now estimated at about $800 million,
which would be about 14 percent of the value of projected exports, with oil
exports on a net basis, i.e. net of the foreign exchange costs of production,
refineries and domestic distribution and of foreign investment income. Debt
service payments on all loans contracted up to December 31, 1975 are likely
to reach $1.25 billion by 1978, before declining as shorter-term maturities
are paid off. This excludes obligations contracted by PERTAMIINA on account
of oil tankers which the Government is currently attempting to renegotiate.
This enlarged debt service will, in future years, sharply reduce net resource
transfers which were of the order of $500-600 million in 1973 and 1974, and
between $1 and $2 billion in 1975 and 1976. To keep the debt service burden
manageable, recourse to medium-term commercial borrowing in the next few
years will, therefore, have to be kept to a minimum, and certainly much below
the 1975 and expected 1976 levels.
14.       Confronted with these problems the Government has taken a series
of important, far-reaching and difficult decisions. It has decided that
foreign borrowing must be cut back sharply from the 1976 projected level of
about $3.4 billion to about $2 billion in each of the years 1977 and 1978
before being allowed to rise again to about $3 billion in 1980. lWith a view
to keeping the debt service burden manageable, it aims to effect most of the
reduction through a sharp cut in the least concessionary borrowings, especially
in the early years. On this basis, the debt service ratio is expected to
reach 18 percent in 1980 and would be at about the same level in 1985.
15.       In view of the expected sharp decline in net foreign resource
transfers, the Government has also decided to increase domestic revenues in
the next few years much faster than was originally contemplated and to levels
much higher than those likely to result from a mere continuation of the
existing tax policies and procedures. The Government also plans to reduce
selectively the aggregate size of the proposed public sector investment
program. This action is aimed at shifting the balance of the public sector
investment program towards a greater emphasis on directly improving the
income earning opportunities, productivity and living conditions of the mass
of the population.
16.       The balance of payments performance in the first half of 1976/77
has been better than expected earlier and the outlook for the second half
is very good. Non-oil exports have risen faster and imports have risen more
slowly than expected and the Government has not resorted to excessive borrow-
ing. The Government has virtually completed its negotiations with the foreign
oil companies which will increase its share in the profits from oil production.
The recent drought in Indonesia is likely to have reduced rice output, but
stocks are normal and imports have been ordered in time so that no pressure
on prices is expected.

17.       The country has a substantial potential for productive investment,
employment and income growth. In agriculture vigorous pursuit of ongoing
programs in irrigation, development of new plant varieties and technical
services, provision of credit and current inputs, etc. promise to yield
high returns. In addition, there are opportunities for the development of
new areas of food and plantation crops, partly in conjunction with a grow-
ing transmigration program. The industrial potential is good, both for
modern, capital intensive natural resource-based activities and for more
labor intensive, partly export-oriented industries.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA
18.       The discussion in Part I of this report underscores the need for
a development program which provides productive work opportunities (with
resultant increased incomes) for Indonesia's presently underemployed and
growing labor force. To assist the Government in attaining its goals the
Bank is planning to maintain or increase its lending to Indonesia and
in particular to support projects designed to: improve agricultural credit,
research and extension; rehabilitate and expand irrigation systems; improve
nutritional levels; assist transmigration and other land development outside
Java and Bali for and by smallholders; increase nonagricultural employment
in the rural areas and small towns through the establishment of small-scale
industries, rural credit schemes, vocational and nonformal education programs;
develop the electric power system; construct urgently needed water supply and
transport facilities; and expand the naticnal family planning program.
19.       As of November 30, 1976, Indonesia had received 37 IDA credits
totalling $561.8 million and 20 Bank loans amounting to $1,011.5 million.
At that date, IFC investments totalled $59.6 million. At the end of 1975
the Bank Group accounted for about 5 percent of Indonesia's total (disbursed)
outstanding public debt; by 1978 it is expected to account for 12 percent
of total outstanding debt and 5 percent of public debt service obligations.
A summary statement of IDA Credits, Bank Loans and IFC Investments as of
November 30, 1976, as well as notes on the execution of ongoing prciects are
contained in Annex II.
20.       To date, agriculture accounts for just over one third of all Bank
lending to Indonesia, including four IDA credits for estate rehabilitaticn,
seven Bank loans and IDA credits for the rehabilitation and expansion of tlhe
irrigation systems, twfo for fisheries, and one each for seeds product'on, beef
cattle, sugar, smallholder tea, srnallholder rubber, agriculture research,
food crop extension services and transmigration. In the industrial sector,
the Bank has assisted in three projects to expand PUSRI's fertilizer pro-
duction and distribution capacity, three for development finance companies
(Government-owned and private) which play, a major role in fostering the
growth-of industrial enterprises, and one for the Pulo Gadung industrial
estate. Loans and credits.have also been extended to the education, tele-
communications, tourism, power, transportation (including highways, inter-
island shipping and ports), population, urban and water supply sectors. Also



- 6 -
a loan was extended for a national resource survey and mapping project and
four credits for technical assistance to aid the Government in preparing and
formulating its development programs and projects.
21.       Bank lending to Indonesia started with an IDA Credit in 1968 for
irrigation rehabilitation, with lending on Bank terms commencing in June
1974. Disbursements on loans and credits are now at satisfactory levels.
The Indonesian authorities have become increasingly aware of the cost to
the country of the delays in project execution caused by cumbersome pro-
cedures and the need to establish an effective control system in BAPPENAS
(the National Development Planning Agency). At the Government's request,
the Bank has arranged for assistance under the Fourth Technical Assistance
Credit (Cr. 451-IND) to help set up a monitoring and control system, which
it is hoped will lead to better project administration.
22.       The proposed loan is the fifth presented to the Executive Direc-
tors this fiscal year and would bring total lending to Indonesia this year
to $245.5 million. Negotiations for a loan to finance a proposed nutrition
project are scheduled for January; this loan will be presented to the
Executive Directors in the near future. Projects for nucleus estate small-
holder development, education, rural credit, small business development,
irrigation and BAPINDO are expected to be ready for presentation in the next
several months.
Progress under Previous Power Projects
23.       Prior to the proposed loan, the Bank has financed five power
projects in Indonesia. With credits of $15 million in 1969 (165-IND)
and $40 million in 1972 (334-IND) the Bank supported the urgent rehabili-
tation of the badly deteriorated electric power distribution system in
Jakarta and its environs, including management consultant services to help
improve the then disorganized and inefficient power sector.     The first
credit has been fully disbursed and although disbursements under the second
credit were critically delayed, work is now progressing smoothly. In 1973 a
third credit was made (399-IND) for $46 million to finance the first two 100 MW
units at the Muara Karang thermal power plant northwest of Jakarta and
related transmission facilities. Contracts have been awarded for this
equipment and construction is under way. This project also included the
financial recovery plan for Perusahaan Umum Negara (PLN) the electric power
authority, and technical assistance for preparation of a power system
development plan for Java and for a feasibility study of a hydroelectric
project. Each of these undertakings is proceeding very well as described in
following sections of this report. A loan of $41 million (1127-IND) was
made in June 1975 to help finance a third 100 MW unit at Muara Karang.
Contracts have been signed for this equipment and implementation is on
schedule. Most recently, in May 1976, the Bank financed a fifth project
with a loan of $90 million (1259-IND) for further expansion of the metropo-
litan power distribution system. Since this loan became effective only on
September 20, 1976, it is too soon to evaluate performance.    But, on balance,
there can be no doubt that PLN has made considerable progress in the recent
past and is well on its way to normal utility efficiency.



- 7 -
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR
24.       Indonesia's public power facilities are owned and operated by
PLN, the national power utilitv. While PLN has been steadily improving in
operational and financial efficiency, it has not been able to keep pace with
growing demand. Therefore, private companies and individuals have installed
captive plant amounting to an estimated 40 percent of the total installed
capacity (private plus public). This private investment is uneconomic
because it cannot compete either in capital cost or operating efficiency with
larger stations. To build the foundation for national development, for which
reliable power supply is one of the cornerstones, PLN is pursuing a major
investment program. Both the Government and the Bank, which has been actively
assisting PLN since 1969, are concerned about ensuring that PLN's investment
plans are well balanced and its targets reasonable and attainable.
25.       Currently, Indonesia, the fifth most populous country in the
world, is' amongst the countries with the lowest per capita electricity
consumption.   Estimates show per capita installed capacity at about 13
watts and per capita sales at about 30 kWh in FY75. The low level of
electrification is further indicated by a ratio of 123 inhabitants per PLN
customer.
26.       PLN's total installed capacity on March 31, 1976, was 1,183 MW
(including the 125 MW Juanda hydro plant owned by the Jatiluhur Authority
from which PLN purchases the output). Including Juanda, it consisted of
37 percent hydro, 21 percent steam, 24 percent diesel and 18 percent gas
turbine capacity. These installations are scattered throughout the country
in small units and stations. Transmission and distribution facilities are
inadequate resulting in unreliable electricity service and high system losses
(about 25 percent of power generation plus purchases).     Major load centers
are not interconnected; production costs are high because only small, rela-
tively inefficient units can be operated on these smaller isolated systems.
Sector Development
27.       In an effort to define the most appropriate approach to developing
the power system in Java, where the bulk of the population lives, PLN
employed Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the UK to undertake a study of
Java System Development. The Study examines two load forecasts through the
period of the Government's Third Five-Year Development Plan, FY79-84,
(Repelita III). The lower of these two projections seems most reasonable
technically, economically, and financially and the one, therefore, on which
PLN should base its future investment program. During negotiations for the
proposed loan, the Government and PLN agreed (Section 4.03 of the draft Loan
Agreement) that it would:
(a) adopt the lower projection of PCR's Java System
Development Study as a guideline for power generation,
transmission and overall distribution development in
Java until FY84 (end of Repelita III);



- 8 -
(b) review with the Bank annually potential changes in load
growth and variations of the expansion program for Java
which may become necessary; and
(c) review with the Bank annually PLN's proposed investment
budget with particular emphasis on the balance among
generating, transmission and distribution facilities.
Even assuming the lower load forecast, the investment program envisaged for
PLN from FY77-84 would involve a total capital expenditure of about $7.3 bil-
lion equivalent in current prices. This investment program would
increase PLN's generation capacity by about 3,800 MIW as well as add related
transmission and distribution facilities; it also includes costs related to
another 2,600 MW of generating capacity to be commissioned after FY84.
Organization and Management of PLN
28.       PLN is a quasi-autonomous government agency under the Ministry
of Public Works and Electric Power. At the management level, PLN has a
President-Director and a Board of five other directors each responsible
for separate functions: planning, operations, construction, finance, and
administration. Middle management is appointed by the Minister upon recom-
mendation of the Board. Considering the limited reservoir of qualified
staff available to PLN, its organizational structure seems appropriate.
Although PLN has 21,000 employees, many still lack adequate technical skills.
Since PLN could readily absorb more engineers annually than are presently
being graduated from all the technical universities in the country, it is
endeavoring to upgrade its staff through in-house training, fellowships and
overseas training.
29.       The French management consultant firm of SOFRELEC was retained by
PLN for about six years to assist in nearly every aspect of the utility's
operations. By the end of their service in 1976, the consultants had helped
PLN recover from a period of chaos to near normal utility management. This
major consulting effort is being followed by the hiring of a few highly
skilled individuals to assist in particular management tasks (financed under
Loan 1127-IND). Progress achieved by PLN can be summarized as follows:
(a) Accounting and Finances: Unexpectedly good and fast improvement
has been registered in the field of accounting and finance.
Financial control systems have been introduced, a reporting system
has been designed and reports are now excellent and on time, and
mechanization is progressing on schedule. PLN's capabilities
with respect to accounting and fund management is comparable
to other utilities in the area. For results in achieving the
financial targets see paragraph 30.
(b) Operations: Very good results have been achieved in system opera-
tion and maintenance where manuals and up-to-date maintenance
procedures have been developed and are being implemented throughout
PLN. Overall efficiency has improved over the past several years.



-9-
During FY72-76, installed capacity per employee has increased by
about 63 percent (from 31.5 kW to 51.4 kW) and sales per employee
by about 52 percent (89,715 kWh to 136,117 kWh). The number of
customers per employee has risen from 46 to 55 (about 20 percent).
As a consequence of thermal opetation training, specific fuel con-
sumption has shown a decreasing trend. Between FY73 and FY74/75,
fuel efficiency in diesel stations has increased by about 5 percent.
(c) Construction: Efforts to improve the management of construction
activities have unfortunately shown less favorable results. Causes
for concern are not so much weaknesses in procurement - satisfactory
improvement has occurred in this respect - but delays in construc-
tion and erection. This is not entirely PLN's fault since the
reason for delays was often lack of Government budget funds for
financing the local component of investments. In addition, complex
and cumbersome Government regulations on budget approval, customs
clearance and Government procurement procedures have in the past
delayed project implementation. During the past year, however,
reassignment of personnel and better management have resulted in
encouraging progress.
(d) Planning: Progress in this difficult field is slow, mainly due
to lack of experienced personnel. A number of reassignments of
personnel have occurred during the past year and it is expected
that improvements will materialize in due course.
(e)  Training:  An extensive training program has been initiated by PLN
and the results so far have been encouraging.
30.       One of the consultants' major contributions was the development
of a Financial Recovery Plan which was incorporated into the Third Power
Project (Credit 399-IND). The objective of this Plan was to enable PLN to
achieve full coverage of its costs from current revenues by FY79. Assets
were physically identified and properly valued to put PLN's financial situa-
tion on a sound basis. Government funds were provided to PLN on terms that
would not create an insurmountable debt burden for the utility. As initially
conceived, the recovery plan was based on managerial improvements and invest-
ments which would lead to increased sales and increased efficiency. In
practice, however, it is now recognized that PLN's encouraging financial
performance is not due so much to increased sales from added investment as it
is to a 145 percent increase in tariffs between FY73 and FY76. The resulting
financial progress has been remarkable. In FY75 PLN exceeded the interim
cost recovery target established for that year and preliminary data for FY76
indicate a revenue/cost ratio of 97 percent, very close to the break-even
point which was not scheduled until FY79.
31.       PLN's basic tariff structure was e.stablished by a Government
Decree in June 1973 which gave PLN the authority, inter alia, to impose
surcharges to cover transportation of fuel, increases in the price of
fuel and increases of other current expenses. PLN has utilized this authority
to increase surcharges on the basis of rupiahs per kWh of energy to all



- 10 -
classes of customers, with only small variations. This practice has caused
distortions in.the tariff structure among various user classes which need to
be corrected by introducing a new basic tariff and revising both the demand
and energy portions of the basic rates. The covenant relating to necessary
tariff revisions has been repeated from Loan 1259-IND as Section 4.07 of the
Project Agreement. It requires the Government and PLN to ensure that future
tariff surcharges will be related to actual cost of service, to embark on a
program of tariff surcharge rearrangements, and to adopt by April 1, 1979 a
basic tariff schedule which incorporates the above tariff surcharges. The
most recent tariff increase was applied in accordance with this covenant.
32.       The revenue/cost targets of the financial recovery plan are of
a temporary nature and PLN could well achieve full cost coverage before
1979, the target year. Consequently, PLN agreed in the context of the
previous power loan (1259-IND) to develop in consultation with the Bank, a
system of financial targets which would apply after financial recovery.
During recent discussions on this matter, representatives of PLN and Bank
staff reviewed the criteria to be used in measuring the financial viability
of PLN. Relevant financial projections are presently being developed by the
Government; agreement with the Bank on the final set of targets is expected
in March 1977.
33.       The present financial program will continue to prevail until the
above targets are adopted. Consequently, the financial covenants of earlier
documents have been included in the Loan and Project Agreements of the
proposed loan. They require PLN to continue to carry out the financial
recovery plan (Section 2.04 of the Project Agreement) leading to full cost
coverage through revenues in FY 1978/79 at the latest; to make reasonable
financial contributions to investment after recovery (Section 4.03 of the
Project Agreement); to pay its debts when due (Section 4.04 of the Project
Agreement) in order to maintain its reputation as a reliable business partner;
to at least cover its maximum future debt service through actual internal
sources (Section 4.05 of the Project Agreement) ensuring that its cash
position is not endangered through excessive borrowing; and to keep outstand-
ing bills below the three-month billing level (Section 4.06 of the Project
Agreement).
Financial Requirements for Investment Program
34.       If PLN is to implement the investment program required to meet
demand by FY84, substantial amounts of capital must be raised outside Indone-
sia. Based on a projected total cost of $7.3 billion (para. 27), PLN could
be expected to finance 30 percent of its investments from internal cash
generation and about 7 percent would come from Government contributions; the
remaining 63 percent would be obtained through bilateral and multilateral aid
arrangements. Many of these aid arrangements are already being negotiated.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       The proposed project, which would increase PLN's generation capacity
by 400 MW, was appraised in May 1976. The Appraisal Report (No. 1289-IND) is
being distributed separately and a loan and project summary is attached as
Annex III. Negotiations took place in Washington, D.C., December 6-17, 1976;
the Borrower's delegation was led by Mfr. Ely Soengkono, Secretary General in
the Ministry of Public Works and Power.
Project Description
36.       The proposed project consists of the construction of the fourth
and fifth 200 MW units at the Muara Karang power plant outside Jakarta;
the engineering, design, preparation of bidding documents and bid evaluation
for a third unit (200 MW) at the Semarang Harbor steam electric station in
Central Java; and the provision of engineering services for a Java inter-
connection system including detailed design and preparation of the bidding
documents for Phase I.
37.       The Muara Karang power station will have an ultimate capacity of
700 MW. The first two 100 MW units are being partially financed under
Credit 399-IND and the third 100 MW unit under Loan 1127-IND. These units
are expected to begin service in 1978/79. The fourth and fifth units
are scheduled for service in 1980/81. They will be reheat, oil-fired units
and will supply the Java power system when inter connection is completed in
1983.
38.       The 200 MW unit proposed for engineering and design at Semarang
would be additional to two 50 MW oil-fired units being constructed with
financial assistance from the United States Agency for International Devel-
opment.
Project Cost Estimates and Financing
39.       Total project costs are estimated at $241.8 million including
foreign exchange costs of $149.3 million, 62 percent of the total cost.
A summary table of cost estimates appears in Annex III. Costs of major
equipment for units 4 and 5 at Muara Karang are based on actual bids received
whereas those for general construction are based on experience gained with
units 1-3. Physical and price contingencies totaling $47.7 million have been
included in the estimate as follows: physical contingencies of five percent
on equipment and 10 percent on construction, site development and piling, and
price contingencies of eight percent per year on foreign costs and of 15
percent per year on local costs. No contingencies have been applied to the
major equipment and engineering since firm prices have been received.
40.       The Project will be financed through proceeds of the proposed loan,
suppliers' credits, Government loans and contributions, and PLN's internal
cash generation. The proposed loan of $116 million, equal to 48 percent of
total costs, would finance the following items:



- 12 -
(a) the total foreign cost of unit No. 4 ($69.6 million) less that
portion of the engineering services for Muara Karang already
financed from Loan 1127-IND ($2.6 million);
(b) down payments and ocean freight for major equipment of unit No. 5
($7.7 million);
(c) the foreign cost of minor equipment, general construction, and
engineeting and construction supervision for unit No. 5
($33.3 million); and
(d) the total foreign cost of engineering services for the Semarang
unit No. 3 and the Java Interconnection System ($8.0 million).
PLN has invited bids on options for major equipment of unit No. 5 including
financing offers ($30.7 million). Attractive financing terms have been
received which, together with the Bank's willingness to finance the down
payments and ocean freight, provide optimum financing for PLN. Government
loans and contributions as well as PLN's internal cash generation will finance
the local cost of the Project ($92.5 million).
41.       As with previous projects,   the proceeds of the Bank loan will be
relent by the Borrower to PLN under a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to
the Bank; conclusion of the agreement is a condition of loan effectiveness
(Section 6.01(b) of the Loan Agreement). The subsidiary loan will carry the
same repayment terms and interest rate as the Bank loan. The Borrower will
bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan and finance interest and commitment
charges during the consttuction period.
Procurement
42.       Equipment and materials to be financed with proceeds of the pro-
posed loan will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Contracts for major equipment for
unit No. 5 (boiler, turbine generator, elec'trical equipment, and transformers)
will be awarded on the basis of options with financing offers received with
the cash bids for unit No. 4. Response to the invitation to bid was excellent.
Bid evaluation has been concluded and awards will be made after Board approval.
43.       Some participation by qualified Indonesian equipment manufacturers is
envisaged, in which case a 15 percent preference on the cif price, or the
prevailing duties, if lower, will be applicable for purposes of bid evaluation.
Over the past several years Indonesia has developed local consttuction
industries which are capable of perfo'r'ming civil and structural works similar
to that required for the Muara Karang plant. One such contractor is presently
undertaking the civil construction for units 1-3 and performing satisfactorily.
Consequently, the documents of the proposed loan include a 7.5 percent prefer-
ence in bid evaluation for qualified domestic civil works contractors.



- 13 -
Disbursement
44.       The proposed Bank loan will be disbursed against the following
items: major equipment for both units and major equipment for Unit No. 4:
100 percent of foreign expenditures for directly imported goods, 95 percent
of the ex factory cost of locally manufactured goods, and 65 percent of the
total expenditures for imported goods procured locally; major equipment for
Unit No. 5: 100 percent of foreign expenditures for down payments, erection
and field services (up to 20 percent of total cost), and ocean freight; civil
works: 67 percent of total expenditures; mechanical and electrical works:
100 percent of foreign expenditures; and consultants' services: 100 percent
of foreign expenditures. To assure complete financing of unit No. 5, no
disbursements will be made for expenditures on this unit until satisfactory
financing arrangements with the suppliers of major equipment have been made
(Schedule 1, paragraph 4(ii) of the Loan Agreement).
Implementation
45.       The project will be carried out by PLN with the assistance of its
engineering consultants, Black and Veatch International (BVI) of the United
States. BVI was retained by PLN for the engineering design of units 1-5 at
Muara Karang as well as preparation of bidding documents, assistance in bid
evaluation and contract award, and construction supervision of units 1-3. An
extension of their contract to cover construction supervision for units No. 4
and 5 and training of PLN's work force in operation of the new units will be
required. The foreign salary/overhead/fee cost for this work is estimated to
be $3.3 million based on 550 man-months (75 in the home office and 475 in the
field). It is a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01(c) of the Loan
Agreement) that a contract satisfactory to the Bank shall have been signed.
The man-month requirement for the engineering design services of the 200 MW unit
at Semarang is estimated at 550 at an overall unit cost of about $5,500. The
foreign exchange cost of the engineering services for the Java System Inter-
connection has been estimated at $5 million for 773 man-months. This is equiv-
alent to a man-month cost of $6,500. Both estimates are considered reasonable.
Project Benefits and Risks
46.       The project is part of an essential program for providing urgently
required base load generating capacity in Java. With the commissioning of Muara
Karang units 4 and 5, the firm capacity will be about 2,000 MW, sufficient to
meet the demand until 1982. PLN's expansion program, based essentially on the
lower load forecast of the Java System Development Study, indicates that the
interconnected Java power network will consist of 38 percent steam, 35 per-
cent gas turbine, and 27 percent hydro power, neglecting the small contrib-
ution made by diesels. This heavy dependence on gas turbines which consume
more and costlier fuel than large steam units indicates the urgent need for
base load steam power. The proposed Muara K-rang No. 4 and 5 units will
discharge this base load function and can be in service some four years ahead
of any hydro alternative such as Jatigede or Saguling.



- 14 -
47.       In the course of the comprehensive Jeva System Development Study
PLN's consultant examined all practical alternatives and has recommended the
least cost sequence of expansion of electricity generation. Nlew hydroelectric
projects cannot be coumissioned in time to meet the growth of demand by
1981-82. Further, the recommended generation scheme is more economical than
the best thermal alternative involving gas turbines for discount rates up to
at least 20 percent. The study concluded that (a) installation of Muara
Karang units 4 and 5 is the next step in the least cost sequence and (b)
both units should be in service in 1981-82 -f the actual load growth follows
the lower of the two demand forecasts. The above conclusions are reasonable.
48.       An estimate of the economic return on investment was calculated
by comparing the costs attributable to the Project (excluding duties, taxes
and depreciation) including the costs of transmission and distribution
associated with marketing the Project's output, to the additional revenues
derived from the sale of the energy to customers. Using the world market
price of oil instead of the Indonesian subsidized price, the estimated
incremental rate of return on the Project and associated installations of
transmission and distribution is at least 21 percent. There are no special
risks associated with the Project.
Ecology
49.       Since Indonesia has not yet established its own environmental
quality standards, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards
have been used as design criteria. Maximum particle concentration at ground
level due to exhaust gases will be below EPA standards and a mechanical
precipitator will be sufficient to remove solid particles from the gas.
However, space is provided for the future installation of electrostatic
precipitators, should they become necessary. Stack height will keep the
sulfur pollution below EPA ambient air standards even for high-sulfur mid-
Eastern oil which may be used instead of the more valuable Indonesian low-
sulfur oil. Consultants have carried out and will continue to carry out
surveys of atmospheric and oceanographic conditions and the flora and fauna
in the vicinity of the Project area so that conditions before and after the
plant installation will be on record.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS ANID AUTHORITY
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Perusahaan Umum
Listrik Negara, the report of the Loan Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft
resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
51.       Features of the Agreements of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 27, 31 33, 41, 44 and 45 of this report. Special conditions
of effectiveness are:



- 15 -
(a) Government approval of the Project Agreement between the Bank
and PLN;
(b)  the conclusion of a subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and PLN providing for the onlending of proceeds of
the proposed loan; and
(c)  the employment of consultants by PLN for supervision of construction
of Muara Karang units No. 4 and 5.
A special condition of disbursement for Unit No. 5 is the conclusion of
satisfactory financing arrangements for the supply and erection of major
equipment of Muara Karang unit No. 5.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Cr. No. 127 Irrigation Rehabilitation: U$5 Million Credit of
September 6, 1968; Effective Date: March 25, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
All civil works were completed on March 31, 1976 and the credit is
fully committed.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates: US$16 Million Credit of June 20,
1969; Effective Date: December 10, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976
The credit is fully commited.
Cr. No. 194 Second Agricultural Estates: US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Effective Date: February 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Project progress is good in the oil palm group which has sur-
passed the appraisal report target for new planting by 100%. Progress in the
rubber group has been unsatisfactory with only 50% of the appraisal report
target for new planting achieved. Planting costs are excessive and investment
planning weak. The project has suffered from management deficiencies and
shortage of funds for investment. Following several representations by the
Bank, the Minister of Agriculture has recently made the necessary changes in
management of the rubber group. The Government is expected to review its
financial policies, particularly with regard to dividends and finance, to
ensure sufficient finance to implement investment programs.
/1 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 195 Second Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$18.5 Million Credit
of June 15, 1970;' Effective Date: December 31, 1970;
Closing Date: November 30, 1977.
Progress has been delayed by initial difficulties in equipment
procurement and civil works execution, and later, by rising construction
costs. Project completion will therefore be about 2-1/2 years behind
schedule. The rehabilitated and new facilities are technically sound and
hydraulically adequate. The quality of maintenance of completed works is
expected to improve following the allocation by the Central Government of
operation and maintenance funds substantially higher than last year's
levels, as part of its commitment under the seventh irrigation project.
The credit is about 96% disbursed and the remaining funds will finance all
outstanding civil works. The estimated project cost has more than doubled
since appraisal due to high inflation rates and increases in contract quan-
tities, but the economic rate of return remains satisfactory because rice
prices and yields have been higher than those projected during appraisal.
Cr. No. 211 Fisheries: US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Effective Date: January 15, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978.
The credit is fully committed.
Cr. No. 219 Education: US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970:
Effective Date: January 29, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
All civil works have been completed and the Credit fully committed.
Cr. No. 220 Third Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$14.5 Million Credit
of November 6, 1970; Effective Date: May 28, 1971;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Overall project completion is expected by July 1977, about two
years behind schedule. The problems which caused this delay - difficulties
in preparation of contract documents, late financial allocations, heavy
rains in the 1973 construction season and, more recently high inflation rates
and consequent civil works cost overruns - have been mainly overcome, but
time lost cannot be regained. The quality of maintenance of completed works
is expected to improve following the allocation by the Central Government of
operation and maintenance funds substantially higher than last year's levels,
as part of its commitment under the seventh irrigation project. The esti-
mated project cost is about twice the appraisal estimate, but rice prices and
yields substantially higher than those projeLted at appraisal enable the
project to retain an economic rate of return over 20%.

Cr. No. 246 Seeds: US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;
Effective Date: December 7, 1971; Closing Date:
September 30, 1977.
Construction of the irrigation infrastructure and the seeds pro-
cessing plant has been completed satisfactorily. The Credit is due to close
by September 30, 1977. It is likely that land development at Sukamandi will
be limited to about 1,600 ha (65% of appraisal estimates) by that date to
enable the project authorities to consolidate production and other operations.
Significant results for 1976/77 expressed as percentages of appraisal esti-
mates are expected to be: (a) area under production - 1,800 ha (58%), (b)
yields of rice seed - 3.5 tons per ha (87%), and (c) production of certified
seed - 4,900 tons (42%). It is clear that due mainly to the delay in the
development of irrigation infrastructure, and partly due to overly optimistic
assumptions during appraisal, the targets for per ha yield and certified seed
production will not be achieved by September 1977. The project also envisaged
the development of 2,000 ha in three districts for seed multiplication. Due
to cost escalations and implementation difficulties, only one district,
Klaten, has been developed, and the total area developed to-date is about 200 ha
out of a total of 500 ha. Based on present levels of production the
National Seeds Corporation (NSC) is not commercially viable and will need
continued financial support from Government. The future of the project and
of NSC depend on Government policy for implementation of the further develop-
ment of the seed industry.
Cr.. No. 259 Tea: US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1971; Effective
Date: September 17, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Agricultural achievements to date have far exceeded appraisal expec-
tations necessitating construction and rehabilitation of three additional
factories. Project completion, estimated for December 1977, can probably be
advanced. Rising costs are creating pressure on available funds and the main
challenge for the two PTPs will be to reduce working capital requirements, as
well as overhead and indirect costs, and improve labor productivity.
Cr. No. 260 Second Highway: US$34 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Effective Date: August 10, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31,1978.
Quality of work is satisfactory and cost overrun has been relatively
small despite shatp price increases due to efforts to reduce construction
quantities, and to cost savings for consulting setvices. Construction work
is completed and final certifications and acceptance of work will be accom-
plished before the current Closing Date of December 31, 1976. A second
postponement of the Closing Date to December 31, 1978 has been agreed however
to permit payments for the completion of detailed engineering for the Padang-
Medan Road, the initiation of which was delayed to reconsider road design
standards in relation to those recently developed for the highway betterment
program and to take into account IDA's recommendations regarding standards
for urban portions of the road.

Cr. No. 288 Second Education: US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9,
1972; Effective Date: June 7, 1972;
Closing Date: March 30, 1978.
The project is about 12 months behind schedule because of late
appointment of consultant architects and lack of funds to meet cost overruns.
The main causes of delay have' ben overcome and significant progress is being
made. All civil works and about 90% of the furniture and equipment have been
contracted. The expert service is virtually completed. Progress of the
fellowship program and teacher training is satisfactory. The shortage of
full-time teachers, however, continues because of a Government embargo on new
recruitment. The Government has now made budgetary provisions to meet the
cost overruns. Disbursements have improved. Delayed implementation required
postponement of the closing date by 15 months to March 30, 1978.
Cr. No 289 Fourth Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$12.5 Million Credit
of March 9, 1972; Effective Date: May 5, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977.
The construction program has escalated in cost by 190% over the
appraisal estimate due to an increase in the magnitude of the works and
price escalation due to unexpected inflation. The bulk of the remaining work
will be accomplished largely with Government funds, since all but about
$1 million of the credit has been disbursed. Postponement of the closing date
for the credit beyond June 30, 1977 may be required. Feasibility studies
included in the project have been completed and groundwater investigations
are nearing completion; interim reports were received in November 1976.
Cr. No. 300 Population: US$13.2 Million Credit of April 20, 1972;
Effective Date: November 2, 1972; Closing Date: June 30,
1978.
General progress of this project is satisfactory. All vehicles
have been procured and are in the field; population education is now being
worked into formal and non-formal curricula; the lay field workers program
is fully operational; mobile information units are in use and more audio-visual
material is being prepared; support for a yariety of family planning research
topics continues; and advisors have been provided for specific program needs.
Implementation of civil works is now proceeding well after initial delays;
the Government has provided funds for MCH/FP centers from other sources, and
is expected to propose a corresponding reduction in project content. The
national family planning program, of which the project is an integral part,
continues to expand in terms of new acceptors recruited annually and the
program is effectively reaching rural villages.

Cr. No. 310 Development Finance Co. (BAPINDO I): US$10 Million Credit
of June 7, 1972; Effective Date: August 10, 1972;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
Prior to the original Closing Date which was December 31, 1976,
about $700,000 remained uncommitted and the Closing Date has therefore been
postponed to March 31, 1977.
Cr. No. 318 Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation: US$8.5 Million
Credit of June 28, 1972; Effective Date: October 19,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
Progress on this project is slow but funds are expected to be
fully committed by September 30, 1977. Due to substantial cost increases,
only about half of the anticipated tonnage will be rehabilitated.
Cr. No. 319 Fourth Agricultural Estates: US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Effective date: January 30, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Physical progress of the project which is being executed by PNP/X,
a Government-owned estate group, continues to be satisfactory, with plant-
ings of rubber and oil palm ahead of appraisal estimates and in excellent
condition. Coffee is a promising crop, and cloves planted in 1974 are
growing well. A hybrid coconut seed garden has been established, the first
in Indonesia. PNP/X management need to pay more attention to cost control
and to financial planning. Substantial cost increases have taken place
largely due to an expansion in the size of the program compared with appraisal
estimates. The Government has agreed to provide part of the short-
fall in project funding and discussions with the Government are proceeding
on a proposed increase in the budgetary allocation. PNP/X will participate in
the execution of smallholder development under the Transmigration and Rural
Development Project (Loan 1318-IND.)
Cr. No. 334 Second Electricity Distribution: US$40 Million Credit
of September 29, 1972; Effective Date: March 12, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The Jakarta distribution program financed from Credits 165-IND and
334-IND (together $55 million) encountered implementation delays due to procure-
ment problems and cumbersome management procedures. As a result the project is
two years behind the original schedule. These difficulties have been resolved
and recent progress is encouraging and no further delays are expected. The
Closing Date has been postponed from December 31, 1976 to December 31, 1977.

Cr. No. 355  Beef Cattle Development:   US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 1973; Effective Date: May 30, 1973;
Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Several problems have seriously 'delayed project implementation.
Government's budget allocation has been insufficient, and financial manage-
ment and coordination have been weak. The last supervision mission undertook
a thorough project review and its recommendations, which include major changes
in project scope and objectives, are presently under discussion with Government.
Cr. No. 358 North Sumatera Smallholder Development: US$5 Million
Credit of February 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 13, 19J3;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The full project program of oil palm and rubber planting by small-
holder participants should be completed by the end of 1977 at the present
rate of progress, which is now ahead of schedule.   Costs of the project have
increased from $10 million estimated at appraisal to about $26 million by the
completion of the project. However, higher than anticipated output of and
prices for rubber and palm oil and changes in project development techniques
have more than compensated the cost increase and the project's return to the
economy is likely to be higher than anticipated at appraisal. In spite of
the impressive physical progress achieved, it has not proven possible to
develop any effective credit mechanism for the credit assisted portion of the
project. The Government will supply the funds for maintenance of plantings
through project completion at end of 1981. Supervision by IDA will continue
up to this date.
Cr. No. 387 Third Education: US$13.5 Million Credit of June 1,
1973; Effective Date:  August 29, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
The project finances the production and distribution of 138 millicn
primary school textbooks, and related in-service training for 350,000 primary
sclhool teachers. Distribution of the first 31 million textbooks has been
completed in all but the most remote areas. Teacher training continues to
proceed on schedule and teaching equipment has been procured and is being
repackaged in Jakarta for delivery to teacher training centers. Project manage-
ment has been strengthened by addition of Indonesian staff to a reorganized
project unit, and by recruitment of specialists under a technical assistance
contract signed with UNESCO.
Cr. No. 388 Third Highways: US$14 Mlillion Credit of June 1, 1973;
Effective Date:  June 25, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
Construction work on the two North Sulawesi road sections included in
the project was started early in 1974 under two contracts. Contractors have
been delayed mainly because of long mobilization periods and heavy rains; Closing



ANNEX II
Page 10 of 15 pages
Date is likely to be postponed by one year. Project costs will likely exceed
original estimates by 70% mainly due to sharply escalated prices. The
training program has been successfully completed. Feasibility studies and
detailed engineering for the betterment program are nearing satisfactory com-
pletion.
Cr. No. 399 West Java Thermal Power: US$46 Million Credit of
June 22, 1973; Effective Date: August 28, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Bids received for the first two 100 mw units at Muara Karang
were about 65% higher than estimated at the time of appraisal.
This, together with construction cost increases, has resulted in an
increase in the total project cost of more than 100%. Government
will provide the additional funds required. PLN has satisfactorily met the
initial targets in its financial recovery plan provided for under the terms
of the Credit Agreement.
Cr. No. 400 Smallholder and Private Estate Tea: US$7.8 Million
Credit of June 22, 1973; Effective Date: November 30,
1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Due to a late start, only 734 ha of smallholder tea has been
replanted or rehabilitated instead of 860 ha and thus the project is about
15% behind- appraisal targets. It is estimated however that physical devel-
opment will be on target by the end of 1977. During 1975/76 the spin-off of
project to non-project smallholders has been excellent; about 350 ha of tea
was rehabilitated or replanted- using funds outside the credit program.
Estate development has not yet started but it should also be on schedule by
the end of 1977. Tea prices for project farmers are well above appraisal
estimates. Project costs are estimated to be about 90% above appraisal
estimates and Government and project participants will have to finance the
overrun; alternatively project targets may have to be reduced.
Cr. No. 405   Sugar Industry Rehabilitation:   US$50 Million Credit of
June 26,, 1973;. Effective Date: April 22,, 1974;
Closing Date:   June 30,. 1979.
The scope of the project has been reduced by the deletion of six
minor rehabilitations from the project description due to cost overruns.
The revised project consists of the maj!or rehabilitation of two factories
and the construction of a new factory.    Due to late project start-up and
delays in arranging consultancy services, project completion will be delayed
by one year. Civil works construction and installation of equipment is on
schedule and progressing satisfactorily.

of September 14, 1973; Effective Date: November 13,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The estate is developing satisfactorally and project completion
is scheduled for December 1981. Of 430 ha earmarked for the project, about:
270 ha had been acquired by September 1976, and 128 ha had been develcped
for occupation.   Seventy-four factories are located on the estate of whicTh
37 are operating and 37 are in various stages of construction or commissioIns
Factory employment is 16,275 and an estimated 1,400 are employed ocr averJae
in both factory construction and land development. Overall, operatiotis are
profitable.
Cr. No. 436  Private Development Finance Company of Iridonesia
(PDFCI):  US$10 Million Credit of November 2, 1973;
Effective Date:  March 6, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Despite a long start-up period and difficulties in recruiting
qualified staff, the project has progressed satisfactorally; only about
$2.0 million remained uncommitted as of December 15, 1976.
Cr. No. 451 Fourth Technical Assistance: US$5 Million Credit of
January 2, 1974; Effective Date: rebruary 15, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress under the project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 479 Bali Tourism: US$16.0 Million Credit of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: December 4, 1974; Closing Date:
August 31, 1979.
Project implementation has improved after initial difficulties.
The evaluations of project tenders have been approved by IDA.    Infrastruc-
ture construction started in July 1976 and completion is scheduled for
October 1979. Budgetary allocations as requested by the Bali Tourism Bevel-
opment Corporation for FY76/77 are satisfactory. Preliminary discussIG,.s
with three potential hotel investors are underway.Promotional efforts to
attract additional investors and tourists have been intensified during early
1976, and additional flights from Sydney and Hong Kong to Bali have bee-
approved by the Minister of Communications and Tourism.

After some iritial delays, the project has been making satisfactory
progress. Construction of shore facilities at Ambon has begun, and contracts
for boat construction and equipment have been awarded. Fishpond constructlilw
is proceeding well. Bidding for ice plant construction should start socn.
The justification for the trawler subproject is being reviewed by the Cover:ii-
ment.

Cr. No. 514 Jatiluhur Irrigation Extension: US$30 Million Credit
of October 3, 1974; Effective Date: January 10, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Due to initial procurement difficulties and delays in the appointment
of the Jatiluhur Authority's President Director and the engagement of consultants,
execution of the first of four civil works contracts will start in February
1977, about a year behind the original schedule. A review of the latest project
cost estimate indicates substantial cost overruns which will be verified after
the evaluation of bid prices for the first civil works contract early in 1977.
Loan No. 1005 Railway: US$48.0 Million Loan of June 14, 1974;
Effective Date: August 16, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Procurement of material and equipment, which had been slow due to poor
organization and inadequate budget allocation, has now improved. The bulk of the
contracts have been signed. Passenger traffic in 1975 was slightly lower than
in 1974, but still higher than forecast; freight traffic has continued to
decline due mainly to poor maintenance and inadequate motive power, which
should improve towards the end of 1976. Although tariffs were raised in May
1975, increasing passenger revenues by about 25% and freight revenues
by about 10%, the operating ratio is likely to deteriorate further,
as operating costs have continued to rise at a faster rate.
Loan No. 1040   Jakarta Urban Development:   US$25 Million Loan of
September 27, 1974; Effective Date: January 15, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Progress on the Kampung Improvement Program h-as been very good; costs
were less- than estima-ted, allowing additional work to be undertaken. Execution
of the Klender Sites and Services S"cheme is one year behind schedule due to
delays in- obtaining approval of project design, but tenders for construction
have now been issued.
Loan No. 1049 Five Cities Water Supply: US$a14.5 Million Loan of
October 31,f 1974; Effective D-ate: May 21, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30-, 1980.
Due to administrative and- manageriaI problems the project is running
13-18 months- behind schedule.  This delay together with higher rates of infla-
tion than anticipated is expected to increase proj-ect co'sts 25-3O% above
the appraisal estimate.   Detailed! engineering and preparationr of tender documents
have been completed and the project has reached- its cdns&tuction phase.    The
reorgan-ization of the Directora-te of Sanitary Engineerirg and the establishment
