INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF MAURITIUS WITH ThE
GUARANTEE OF MAURITIUS FOR A THIRD
DEVELOPMENT BANK PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM) with the guarantee of Mauritius for
the equivalent of $7.5 million to help finance a third development finance
company project. The loan would bear interest at 8.5 percent per annum, and
the repayment schedule would be an aggregate of the amortization schedules of
sub-loans and equity investments made by DBM, which would not exceed 20 years.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum on Recent Economic Developments and Prospects (268a-MAS)
was circulated to the Executive Directors on March 13, 1974. The following
reflects the findings of a mission that visited Mauritius in November 1974.
Country data are provided in Annex I.
3.        Mauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily depen-
dent on one crop: sugar. After two decades of stagnation, the country has
experienced a rapid economic growth during the 1970's. Family planning
programs have been a major success, and the rate of population growth declined
to 1.5 percent in 1973. The Government's effort to create new production and
employment opportunities through the development of export-based, labor inten-
sive industries and tourism has achieved an impressive beginning. During
1970-73 real GDP and national income each grew by an annual average rate of
9 percent. In 1974 when the growth of GDP slowed, the export price received
for sugar rose by 150 percent and permitted national income to increase by
over 20 percent. Though the economy is still heavily dependent on sugar,
output of manufacturing and services (including tourism) went up at a rate of
11 percent per annum from 1970 to 1973, thus contributing close to 30 percent
of GDP growth in this period. Employment expanded by about 27,000 from 1971
to 1974, mostly in industry, tourism, and construction, and the rate of
investment rose from 16 percent of GDP in 1969 to 25 percent in 1973.
4.        In December 1971, the Government adopted a Four-Year Plan (1971 to
1975) for social and economic development. Current government objectives
are: further development of the sugar industry, diversification of the eco-
nomy to create substantial employment, particularly in export-oriented, labor
intensive industry and tourism, and the improvement of training and education,
and family planning services. Investment under the Plan has been close, in
real terms, to projected amounts, and the growth target of 7 percent has been



exceeded. The Plan was well conceived and addressed itself to the basic
production and employment problems faced by the Mauritian economy. A new plan
for the 1976-80 period is at an advanced state of preparation, and is expected
to concentrate on further diversification of the economy and employment
creation, coupled with a high rate of growth of GDP, and an ambitious public
investment program of about $550 million for the five years.
5.        The diversification of the economy is a primary objective of
Mauritius, both within agriculture and in creation of other industrial activ-
ities. Sugar still accounts for about 30 percent of national income and over
90 percent of commodity exports. However, though sugar output increased sub-
stantially in 1972 and 1973, and export prices rose by 40 percent, all activ-
ities related to sugar contributed only about 25 percent to the growth of
real GDP in the three years Up to 1973; the dependence of the economy on
sugar is thus being gradually reduced. Future prospects for diversification
witlhin agriculture include the development of groundnuts, vegetables and tra-
ditional crops like ginger, and a livestock industry based on sugar cane by-
products. Outside agriculture, immediate possibilities for diversification
are in manufacturing and tourism.
6.        Absorptive capacity and availability of financial resources were
both considered the potential. constraints to future economic development when
the 1971-75 plan was prepared. Absorptive capacity is not now likely to be
a serious impediment to growth as a result of the steps taken by the Mauritians
in establishing new institutions and improving existing developmental institu-
tions, such as a planning office and a development bank, in mobilizing external
technical assistance and in training Mauritians. Financial constraints may
operate before absorptive capacity comes into play.
7.        Against this rather favorable progress in income growth and economic
planning, some causes of concern have emerged during the last two years. Where-
as the economic expansion was accompanied by an improvement in the situation
of public finances, external payments and domestic prices in the early 1970's,
In the last two years there has been a deterioration in public finances, an
increase in imports whiicli at times brought the balance of payments under
serious pressure, and an increase in the rate of inflation when sugar earnings
could have been mobilized to achieve substantial improvements in the national
economy.
8.        In 1972/73 government revenue exceeded total expenditure by $15
million.  The following year, despite record revenue frim sugar and other
sources, an overall deficit of $25 million occurred, and in 1974-75 such a
deficit was avoided only by a reduction in public investment. There were no
public savings in these two years. Higher salaries partially caused the deter-
ioration of government financ:es. In July 1973 the Government raised civil
service salaries by an average of over 30 percent and at the same time linked
them to the consumer price index. The initial award cost $9 million, and
since then five more awards of about 5 percent each have been triggered by the



- 3 -
rising price index. At the same time, on redistributive grounds, the Govern-
ment paid increased subsidies for rice consumption so as to stabilize the
domestic rice price in the face of increasing world prices. This cost $20
million in 1973/74 and a further $31 million in 1974/75. Further deterio-
ration of public finances also occurred as a result of substantially higher
prices for imported goods, most notably those of capital goods which increased
by 31 percent in 1973.
9.        Government has made efforts to improve its financial situation by
introducing fiscal packages in July and December 1973, and most recently in
July 1975. T'he first two packages raised revenue by 37 percent in 1973/74,
through, inter alia, a 10 percent surcharge on income tax, an increase in the
sugar export tax from 9 to 10 percent, and a 25 percent increase in customs
duties. The most recent package has raised the rate of sugar export tax
further to 12 percent, imposed a 10 percent tax on traders' profits, but has
reduced income taxes in the expectation of reducing tax evasion and ultimately
increasing revenue. During the last two years, Government borrowed heavily
from the private sector; in 1974-75 alone local sources lent over $60 million.
These combined policies have eased the situation and in the present fiscal year
there are likely to be improved public savings and overall balance in Govern-
ment's finances.
10.       The high prices obtained for sugar have financed a rapid growth of
imports. In 1973 imports rose by 44 percent and foreign exchange reserves
were reduced by $4 million compared with an increase of $23 million in 1972.
During 1974 imports doubled with the consequence that foreign exchange reserves
were almost depleted at the seasonal low point, but sugar revenues at the end of
the year increased reserves to $72 million above their level at the end of the
previous year. As a result of Government's heavy domestic borrowing, the
liquidity of the private sector has been reduced and it is likely that the
expansion of imports will be considerably slowed in 1975. Some net use of
foreign exchange reserves can be anticipated during 1975, however, as a severe
cyclone in February caused considerable damage to the sugar crop and the volume
of sugar exports is likely to be at least 20 percent below expectation.
11.       The fiscal packages have been supported by monetary measures to
reduce the rapid price inflation of earlier years. In 1973 prices rose by
14 percent and in 1974 by 29 percent. A ceiling to credit growth of 15 per-
cent has been imposed, the privilege of rediscounting sugar bills has been
withheld, and the cash reserves requirement of commercial banks has been raised
successively from 5 to 8, then 12 percent of liabilities. As a result of the
combined monetary and fiscal measures the rate of price inflation has been
reduced and is unlikely to exceed 15 percent in 1975. At the same time a
change in the system of indexing civil service salaries can be expected to
reduce wage inflation.



- 4 -
12.       Over 95 percent of gross investment was financed by domestic
savings in 1970-1974. During the same period annual gross public capital in-
flow a"eraged $9 0 million, of which $,.4 million was in grant form and $3.6
million in loans. Whereas at Independence, the UK was almost the only source
of external capital aid, there has been some diversification of the sources
of official capital in recent years. Among the new sources, Australia, the
European Economic Community, France, the US and the World Food Program have
contributed grants, mainly in the form of food aid, while loans have been
received from the African Development Bank, the Arab Oil Fund, France,
Germany, India, The People's Republic of China, and the World Bank Group.
Public capital inflows have been supplemented by a private capital inflow
averaging $1.8 million in the 1970-1974 period. In the forthcoming plan
period there will be a need for much more external assistance, and gross
public capital inflow should increase to about $60 million per annum by 1980.
13.       At the end of 1974 external public debt was $34.4 million, of which
12 percent was held by the Bank and 15 percent by IDA. Service payments during
1974 amounted to $3.7 million (of which 18 percent was paid to the Bank and
about 0.1 percent to IDA) equivalent to 1.0 percent of the foreign exchange
earned that year. Assuming further progress in fiscal management and con-
tinued satisfactory overall economic performance particularly in respect of
diversification of the economy and promotion of export-oriented industries,
Mauritius should be able to service a limited amount of conventional borrowing.
Assuming that public capital requirements discussed in the preceding paragraph
are borrowed on terms equivalent to a 20 percent grant element, Mauritius'
debt service ratio would reach about 12 percent by 1990. Assuming a modest
increase in our program, the Bank Group's share in Mauritius' debt and debt
service at that time would reach about 23 percent, of which the Bank would
represent about 20 percent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
14.       To date, Mauritius has received five IDA credits and three Bank
loans, totalling $45.7 million to help finance projects in infrastructure
($17.0 million), agriculture ($9.2 million), industry ($12.5 million) and
education ($7.0 million). IFC made a loan of $600,000 in June 1971 for the
construction of two beach hotels. Annex II contains summary statements of
Bank Group investments in Mauritius, as of August 31, 1975, as well as notes
on the execution of on-going projects. Implementation of industrial and
infrastructural projects is generally satisfactory, but the educational and
agricultural projects are facing some difficulties which are discussed in
Annex II.
15.       The program for Bank Group lending supports the Government's stra-
tegy in promoting economic d:iversification and creating employment outside
-sugar. The proposed project would continue the assistance that the Bank



- 5 -
Group has provided so far to industrial development.   Projects currently in
the pipeline will provide assistance for infrastructural development such as
power and water supply.  We also intend to continue assisting in the develop-
ment of industry through the financing of further industrial estate and de-
velopment bank projects.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL, TOURISM AND FINANCIAL SECTORS
16.       Mauritius industry is still dominated by sugar processing.   Value
added by non-sugar manufacturing in 1973 amounted to 8 percent of GDP, and in
1974 employment in non-sugar manufacturing was estimated at 18,600 or 12 per-
cent of total employment.   Until recently, nmst of the non-sugar manufacturing
output came from industries catering to the domestic market, primarily food
and beverage, construction materials and printing. Because of the small
size of the domestic market, import substitution has limited potential and
such possibilities have been substantially e;diausted. The major scope for
industrialization now lies in the trans,-ormation of imported raw materials
and intermediate products for export markets. The dexterity and high
quality of the Mauritius labor force and its low cost compared with compet-
ing countries is a considerable asset, particuiarly for industries such as
manufacture of office machinery, transistors, textiles, clothing, footwear
and toys where labor cost has a large share in value added.
17.       Associate membership for Mauritius in the European Economic Commu-
nity became effective on June 1, 1973 and gave Mauritius-based industry easier
access to that major market area. Australia has conceded preferential tariff
rates on certain Mauritian products and consequently, exports to that country
are growing. Exports to South Africa are also growing.
18.       Up to 1970, the Government's main means of stimulating industrial
development consisted of granting Deveiopment Certificates which offered cer-
tain advantages to entrepreneurs, for projects in a selected group consisting
primarily of import-substitution type industries. Since then, Mauritius'
strategy has been aimed at encouraging export processing industries, and in
December 1970 an Export Processing Act was approved. Under this scheme,
export-oriented labor intensive projects are offered incentives including
preferential rates for power, tax holidays on dividends and retained earnings,
exemption from import duties on raw materials and capital goods, and guaranteed
foreign exchange for raw material imports and for repatriating profits and
capital. The Government reviews these incentives regularly to ensure their
adequacy.
19.       From 1971 to September 1974, the Government approved a total of 97
export processing applications. Since only about a third of the companies
with approved application have begun to operate, increased activity in the



- 6 -
sector has not yet been fully reflected in output and employment. By September
1974, 11,000 new jobs had been created by export processing industries alone
and pending projects were estimated to require over 7,000 additional employees.
The export processing applications approved so far include mostly textile
projects, but also several schemes in food and beverages, jewelry, electrical
and electronic products, andl toys.
2n.       In addition, the Government has sought to accelerate the pace of
industrialization through the establishment of industrial estates.    The first
major estate, developed and administered by DBM, is nearing completion and
is partly occupied. A second scheme, assisted by an IDA credit in July 1973,
is being constructed. Additional areas have been earmarked for this purpose
including 200 acres near the harbor of Port Louis that are presently being
reclaimed.
21.       Because of its small size, Mauritius can least afford a misallocation
of its scarce land resources. This reinforces the requirement for a careful
and comprehensive land use planning to ensure that industrial development takes
place in the most suitable areas and that the supporting infrastructure is
provided in a coordinated manner. The Government has prepared a land suit-
ability map and, with the assistance of a team of experts obtained under
bilateral aid, is now preparing a plan for the long-term development of
industrial sites.
The Tourism Sector
22.       Mauritius has distinct attractions for tourism; it has unspoiled
white sand beaches, coral reefs, lagoons and subtropical temperatures with
long daily periods of sunshine on the coast. Tourism In Mauritius has
developed since 1969 beyond all expectations. Visitor arrivals have increased
by an average of 33 percent a year since 1969, reaching 68,000 in 1973. The
1,200 hotel rooms and bungalows in Mauritius were estimated to have a 70 per-
cent occupancy rate in 1974. The largest increase in arrivals has been in
the number of visitors from South Africa, the Indian Ocean area, Europe and
Australia, due in part to the introduction of special promotional air fares.
liotels presently under construction are expected to add about 560 rooms by
the end of 1975. New applications for hotel projects are being carefully
considered in light of possible adverse effects of the petroleum price in-
creases on air travel.
The Financial Sector
23.       Mauritius has a well developed commercial banking sector, with
eight commercial banks. The Mauritius Commercial Bank accounts for half of
all banking business and Barclays for about another quarter. In June 1973,
a new State Commercial Bank was established with Rs 2.5 million in share
capital, 80 percent of which was contributed by the Government and 20 percent
by DBM; it makes working capital loans to "neglected" sectors of the economy,



- 7 -
mainly small--scale industry and agriculture. The Mauritius Commercial Bank
is the only other bank incorporated and owned locally; the other six are
branches of overseas banks. Commercial baDks' short-term lending to the
private sector increased by over 30 percent per annum between 1972 and 1973
but by only 10 percent between 1973 and 1974, partly as a result of Government
measures to control inflation. All commercial banks extend term loans to
industry, usually tup to seven years. These banks had reached their limits
on medium-term lending in the fall of 1974. -iowever, the sharp increase in
deposits which took place in late 1974 and early 1975 has enabled them to
increase the[r medium-term lending operations.
24.       The Central Bank discount raLe is 6 percent while the prime rate for
commercial lending is 7 - 8.5 percent per annum depending on the duration of
the credit. According to current legislation, the maximum interest rate on
secured loans above Rs 6,000 is 9 percent. On unsecured loans, the legal
limit is 36 percent. The rates on time and savings deposits are between
4.5 percent and 6.5 percent depending on the term.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Development Bank of Mauritius"
is being circulated separately. A Loan and Project Summary is provided at
Annex III. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in
September 1975. The Mauritius delegation consisted of Mr. C. Jesseramsing,
Mauritian Embassy, Washington D.C., and Mr. V.S. Raghavan, Managing Director
of DBM.
History and Objectives of DBM
26.       DBM was established in 1964 as a statutory corporation to finance the
development of industry and tourism as well as the diversification of agricul-
ture.  It is owned by the Government which holds 80 percent of its share capi-
tal and the Bank of Mauritius which holds the remaining 20 percent. In 1972,
DBM received an IDA credit of $3.5 million to finance industrial and tourism
development projects. This credit has been fully committed and, as of
August 31, 1975, only $0.9 million remained to be disbursed. In 1973, IDA
made a credit of $4.0 million to Mauritius to help finance DBM's investments
for the development of an industrial estate at Coromandel.    The implementa-
tion of this project is on schedule. In 1974, the Bank made a loan of $5.0
million to DBM to help finance further industrial and tourism development
projects, as well as further investments in industrial estates. By April 1,
1975, the portion of this loan ($4.4 million) earmarked for industrial and
tourism development had been fully committed, although the actual signing of
the sub-loans had to be postponed until June 1975 pending enactment of legis-
lation to enable DBM to pass the foreign exchange risk to its borrowers as



-8-
had been agreed when the loan was made. By August 31, 1975, all sub-loans
had been signed and about $0.5 million had been disbursed. In the meantime,
DBM had financed the industrial estate component of the 1974 project with
its own funds, and the Bank recently agreed to DBM's request to reallocate
the $0.6 million thereby released to finance further industrial and tourism
projects.
Board of Directors
27.       DBM's Board consists of twelve Directors including representatives
of the Ministries of Finance, Commerce and Industry, and the Bank of Mauritius,
seven private businessmen and DBM's General Manager. Board members are all
chosen by the Government. The current chairman is Mr. D. Soopramanien,
Mauritius' Assistant Financial Secretary. The Board, which must approve all
investments, meets twice a month.
Management and Staff
28.       DBM' s Managing Director, Mr. V.S. Raghavan, joined the company in
May 1975 for a two-year term. He is a staff member of the Bank Group on
secondment to DBM. In all, DBM's staff consists of 19 professionals and
51 non-professionals. Organizationally, there are separate divisions for
medium/large industrial and tourism loans, agricultural loans, industrial
estates, small-scale industrial projects and administration. All the divi-
sions are adequately staffed. The quality of DBM's appraisal work has been
generally satisfactory.
Policies and Operations
29.       DBM's operations are guided by its Policy Statement which was adopted
by DBM's Board in October 1971 and which is satisfactory to the Bank. DBM
is the only significant institutional source of finance in Mauritius for in-
dustrial and tourism projects requiring terms longer than seven years. Through
direct financing and its industrial estate program, DBM has assisted 57 percent
of the companies with Development Certificates and 67 percent of the companies
with Export Processing Zone Certificates. Partly because of lending limits
on individual investments, DBM and commercial banks have jointly financed a
number of large operations. Between March 1964 and June 30, 1974, DBM
approved 182 loans and 13 equity investments for a total of about Rs 84
million to medium and large-scale industrial projects. In FY 1975, DBM
approved 25 loans and three equity investments for a total amount of Rs 38
million. DBM's total disbursements in that sector as of June 30, 1975 amounted
to Rs 54 million, about 30 percent of which were in FY 75 alone. It is
estimated that DBM financed about 10 percent of industrial investments in the
country in 1974.
30.       DBM's outstanding industrial loan portfolio at June 30, 1975 con-
sisted mainly of textiles, primarily for export (45 percent), followed by
hotels (17 percent) and food, fish, and livestock processing (11 percent)



-9-
which are primarily for the domestic market. The risk to DBM due to its
relatively large exposure in textiles is mitigated by the diversity of tex-
tiles (jute, bags, yarn, made-up garments, knitwear) produced in Mauritius,
and by the geographical dispersion of markets.
31.       DBM also operates a scheme for making loans for small-scale indus-
trial development. The Government reimburses DBM for the cost of administer-
ing the scheme and assumes the risk of defaults by sub-borrowers. During
FY 72 through FY 74, DBM approved 438 loans (totalling Rs 2.9 million), under
the scheme. In FY 75, the corresponding figures were 304 loans totalling
Rs 2.2 million. These loans have been fairly evenly distributed among food
processing, light engineering, garment-making, furniture, and other projects.
32.       Since its establishment, DBM has approved about Rs 16 million for
agricultural projects representing 11 percent of total approvals (excluding
industrial estates). In the past five years, agricultural loan approvals
have averaged about Rs 1 million per annum and have generally been for small
sugar planters, tea, mixed farming, and livestock projects. In addition,
Rs 64 million were approved for the Coromandel Industrial Estate Project
during FY 73 through FY 75.
33.       Procurement under DBM's loans and DBM's disbursement procedures are
generally satisfactory. Except for very small loans or where it is otherwise
impractical, DBM requests its clients to obtain several quotations before
deciding on equipment or construction contracts. Disbursements are usually
made through letters of credit (for import financing) or after evidence of
completion of work on construction contracts.
DBM's Lending Terms
34.       DBM's interest rate on loans for medium and large-scale industry and
tourism was raised from 9.5 percent to 10.0 percent per annum in July 1975
to help DBM cover its increasing administrative costs and the higher cost
of its borrowed funds. As was the case under the 1974 loan, DBM's borrowers
will bear the foreign exchange risk.
Portfolio Evaluation
35.       As of June 30, 1975, about 8 percent of DBM's total loan portfolio
was affected by arrears of over three months, as compared to 18 percent as of
June 30, 1974. This substantial improvement is mainly the result of the work
of two sub-committees set up by DBM's Board to review industrial and agricul-
tural loans in arrears. A portion of these arrears is on loans made at the
request and risk of the Government. On the Rs 49 million balance of the
portfolio at DBM's own risk, 6 percent was in arrears of over three months
on June 30, 1975.   DBM has also succeeded in reducing industrial loan
arrearages from 9 percent on June 30, 1974 to 5 percent on June 30, 1975.



- 10 -
36.       On the same date, DBMt held Rs 10.5 million of equity investments
in 12 companies, representing 16 percent of the loan and equity portfolio.
Two of them paid dividends in FY75. Most of the other companies are just
beginning operations. The quality of the equity portfolio is satisfactory,
except for one small investment of Rs 22,000 on which DBM is likely to incur
a loss.
Financial Condition
37.       DBM's financial condition is satisfactory.    Provisions, at 2.8 per-
cent of the total loan and equity portfolio, are considered adequate to cover
potential losses. The term-debt to Hquity ratio presently at 0.9 to 1 when
subordinated loans maturing after repayment of the proposed loan to the Bank
are included in equity is low and well within the 4 to 1 limit agreed with
DBM (see Section 4.06 of the (Iraft Loan Agreement).
38.       DBM's net income dropped from Rs 2.0 million in FY73 to Rs 1.2 mil-
lion in FY74 and Rs 1.0 million in FY75, or from 9 percent to 3 percent of
average net worth during the same two-year period. This was primarily due
to a more than 100 percent increase in administrative expenses between FY73
and FY75 (following the general adjustments in salaries initiated by the
Government in FY 73) and an increase in the average cost of borrowed funds.
Resource Requirements and Financing
39.       DBM expects to approve about Rs 56 million of industrial and tourism
loans during FY76, i.e. an increase of about 50 percent over FY75. Thereafter,
approvals are expected to grow at 10 percent per annum in real terms or an
estimated 17 percent in current terms. On this basis, DBM's commitments for
the period April 1, 1975 (time at which the previous IBRD loan was entirely
committed) through December 31, 1977 are estimated to reach Rs 138 million
(US$25.0 million equivalent) about 75 percent of which is in foreign exchange.
Towards this amount, DBM is expected to generate Rs 20.0 million internally.
The net resource requirements for medium and large-scale industrial projects
for the period of the proposed project therefore amount to Rs 118.0 million
($21.5 million equivalent). The proposed loan would thus finance about one
third of DBM's requirements during the project period. The Government will
make the balance available to DBM from its own resources with assistance
from other external agencies (see section 2.02 of the Guarantee Agreement).
Negotiations with several of these agencies including the African Development
Bank, KfW (Germany) and Caisse Centrale (France) are at an advanced stage.
Projected Financial Results
40.       Following the rapid increase in salaries in FY 73-75, administrative
expenses are expected to increase by less than 10 percent in FY76 and by about
20 percent in FY77 and FY78. Administrative costs as a percentage of average



total assets are expected to decrease from 1.6 percent in FY75 to about 1.1
percent in FY76, and remain at this level in the following years. DBM's
rising cost of debt is expected to be largely offset by higher average
earnings on loans. As a result, profits are expected to recover from 3 per-
cent in FY75 to about 6 percent of average equity in the next several years.
Term of Bank Loan
41.       The amortization schedule for the loan would be the aggregate of the
amortization schedules of sub-loans and of the fixed schedules of repayment
by DBM to the Bank for loan funds to finance equity investments. Repayment
schedules will be limited to a maximum of twenty years for equity investments
(schedules suitable to the individual investments will be agreed upon with
DBM in each case) and for sub-loans for projects in tourism, and to a maximum
of fifteen years for sub-loans for industrial projects.
42.       Under the first Bank loan to DBM, projects over US$150,000 up to an
aggregate of $1.0 million were sent to the Bank for approval. Under the
proposed loan, in recognition of DBM's progress in appraisal and follow-up
work, the free limit would be increased to US$400,000 and the aggregate free
limit to US$2.0 million. Taking this limit into account, it is expected that
DBM will have to seek Bank approval for about 70 percent of the financing to
be provided with the assistance of the loan.
Disbursements
43.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against the foreign exchange
requirements of DBM's investments in industry and tourism. The foreign ex-
change component of each investment would be estimated as 100 percent of the
CIF cost of direct imports, 75 percent of the invoiced price of goods previously
imported through normal trade channels, 50 percent of the invoiced price of
goods produced in Mauritius to a substantial extent from imported inputs and
45 percent of the construction costs of industrial buildings and hotels.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and DBM, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Mauritius and the Bank, the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The Loan
Agreement has no special features.
45.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECT IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 239-MAS        Tea Development Project:  $5.2 Million Credit of
April 9, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Project field development is experiencing problems due to poor soil
and drainage conditions, poor quality of planting material and the effects of
a cyclone which hit Mauritius in February 1975. These problems are aggravated
by general problems facing the Mauritius tea industry, especially rapidly
increasing wage rates in the sugar industry with which the tea sector is unable
to compete. These problems were examined about a year ago by a study group
which included some Bank staff members. The recommendations of the study
group, which included suggestions on what the role of the Tea Development
Authority should be, have been accepted by the Government and are being
implemented. Further, the area under the project has been reduced from 5,600
to 3,000 arpents and, consequently, the number of factories has been reduced
from two to one. Project costs are estimated to be some 25 percent above
appraisal estimates. The possibility of using savings from reducing the
scope of the project for rehabilitation of plantations after the February 1975
cyclone damage is being examined.
Credit No. 313-MAS        Development Bank of Mauritius Project; $3.5 Million
Credit of June 23, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
As of August 31, 1975, the credit had been fully committed and only
about $0.9 million remained to be disbursed.
Credit No. 411-HAS        Industrial Estate Project; $4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1980
Implementation of the project is on schedule.
Credit No. 419-HAS        Rural Development Project:  $4.0 Million Credit of
July 9, 1973;  Closing Date:   February 29, 1976
Project execution has slowed down considerably and only the forestry
component is expected to be completed by the present Closing Date. The
village development, fodder and self-help components are behind schedule. The
bench terracing program has been cancelled because of land acquisition prob-
lems and alternative ways of using the funds originally earmarked for it are
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

being considered. Several factors including procurement difficulties, the
rise in sugar prices which caused land prices to rise sharply, thus making
it difficult for the Government to obtain land for the project, and the
February 1975 cyclone have contributed to the delays.   There have also been
management problems, including, in particluar, the lack of interministerial
coordination and a deterioration in the management capac-ity of the rural
development unit. The Association is working closely with the Government to
resolve these problems and speed up the implementation of the project.
Loan 976-MAS             Port Project:   $10.0 Million Loan of April 12, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Civil worlks contracts under the project have been awarded. Physical
execution of the project is making good progress. The National Port Authority,
which was to have been established by July 1, 1975 (postponed from January 1,
1975), is now expected to be established by the end of January 1976.
Loan 979-MhAS            Second Development Bank Project:   $5.0 Million Loan
of April 24, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The proceeds of this; loan have been fully committed but actual
signing of the sub-loans was cdelayed pending passage of an Act wich enables
DMB to pass the foreign exchange risk of its operations to its sub-borrowers.
The Act was passed by the Government on June 6 and disbursements have now
started.
Loan 1033-MAS and         First Education Project:  $3.5 Million Each of
Credit 501-MAS           July 29, 1974;  Closing Date:   March 31, 1980
The credit and loan became effective on October 29, 1974, but the
project has been making slow progress, due mainly to the inexperience and the
slow build-up of staff in the Program Unit, slow interministerial channels of
communication, and lack of forward planning by the Unit. Further identifica-
tion and acquisition of building sites is making satisfactory progress. One
architectural consulting firm has been appointed and a second one has been
nominated. An experienced equipment and furniture procurement specialist
for the Program Unit has been recruited and recently a committee composed of
representatives of all the relevant ministries was formed to review progress
under the project regularly, and to ensure effective coordination of all
activities under the project. It is expected that the overall implementation
of the project will now improve.
