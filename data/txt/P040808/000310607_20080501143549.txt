F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the project are to: (a) assist SRNyDS in prioritizing its proposed
actions dealing with native forests; (b) facilitate the development of an incentive and
regulatory framework that encourages public and private decision-makers to internalize
more fully within their decision-making process the full range of social costs and benefits
associated with their actions affecting native forests; (c) develop a plan for transforming
the Argentine National Parks Administration into a world-class park management
organization; and (d) increase the environmentally sustainable level of tourism in selected
National Parks.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., PAD/ISR, not evaluative)

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country and sector background, rationale for Bank assistance)

At the time of appraisal, Argentina had scarcely recognized the need to address the issue of public
goods and services derived from its native forests, with the exception of conservation through its
national protected areas system. The recently completed Forestry Sector Review (Report No.
11833- AR, dated April 26, 1993), pointed to the need to improve the policy framework around
issues of native forests and protected areas, generate information for the appropriate management
of the same, and improve the public management of native forests areas. Information on native
forests was scarce, and Argentina could not count on a solid research and information base on
which to base its analysis of policy options, making it difficult to develop realistic plans or
political consensus on critical issues of natural resource management. The country lacked a
comprehensive inventory of its native forests, as well as any environmental or economic analysis
of the threats to that resource or the economic opportunities therein. In addition, a recent analysis
of management effectiveness in Argentina's protected areas estimated that less than 21 percent of
the area under protection was acceptably managed while nearly 50 percent received little or no
management whatsoever.

At appraisal, the area of native forest in Argentina with commercial potential was estimated at 15
million hectares and produced approximately 1.5 million M3 of wood per annum, equal to about
40 percent of the country's annual production. Preliminary studies showed much of the country's
land to be degraded by water and wind erosion. This was due, in part, to overgrazing and the
destruction of the perennial vegetative cover. Desertification in parts of the Chaco was identified
as one of the more problematic aspects of the degradation trend. Only about 4.4 percent of the
national territory (about 12.1 million hectares) was protected, 22 percent of this being in protected
areas in national parks and the remaining 78 percent under provincial or other control. However,
many of the provincial protected areas were in reality "paper parks", with no active management
or day-to-day management presence.

The Bank's country assistance objectives and strategy for dealing with native forests and the
protected areas system was defined through a series of intensive mission contact beginning in
1992, leading to a Forestry Sector Review, this continued into the identification, preparation and
appraisal of this project. The Project was in line with the 1995 CAS, current at the time of project
preparation. The CAS had three objectives: (a) consolidating structural reform; (b) reducing
poverty and strengthening social services; and (c) rebuilding infrastructure. Under rebuilding
infrastructure the CAS includes inter alia lending for forestry, enhancing the regulatory
framework in forestry, and improving the management of native forests. The Project was the
Bank's first free-standing project aimed at improved management and conservation of native
forests and protected areas in Argentina. As a part of the Agricultural Services and Institutional
Development Project the Bank had previously supported a small sub-component for forestry
research (US$1.9 million). The Forestry Development Project, meanwhile, focused on forest
plantations, timber processing industries and agroforestry.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The project was conceived prior to the use of the Results Framework within the Bank. The
overall objective of the project was to develop and to implement an appropriate state role in the
conservation and management of native forests and the development and management of
the protected areas system. The intermediate objectives or outcomes of the project are to: (a)
assist SRNyDS (now SAyDS) in prioritizing its proposed actions dealing with native forests; (b)
facilitate the development of an incentive and regulatory framework that encourages public and
private decision-makers to internalize more fully within their decision-making process the full
range of social costs and benefits associated with their actions affecting native forests; (c) develop
a plan for transforming the Argentine National Parks Administration into a world-class park
management organization; and (d) increase the environmentally sustainable level of tourism in
selected National Parks.

The project objectives align with the objectives identified with for each of the three components
of the project, described below in Section 1.5. Impact indicators were developed for each of the
objectives. Specific performance indicators were also developed during preparation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,
(original and revised, briefly describe the "primary target group" identified in the PAD
and as captured in the PDO, as well as any other individuals and organizations expected
to benefit from the project)

The principal beneficiaries of the project were the government institutions responsible for
sustainably managing native forests and protected areas, the populations that those institutions
serve, in particular the rural populations that live within and near the native forests and protected
areas included in the project, and the public in general. The rural populations benefited from
improved natural resource management and from local economic growth. Visitors to the national
parks also benefited from improvements to the physical infrastructure at the parks as well as
improved park management and conservation of their natural resources. The general public was a
recipient of the goods and services provided by the country's forests and protected areas.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project had three components: (A) generation and dissemination of research and information;
(B) protected areas; and (C) project implementation. Total project costs at appraisal amounted to
US$30 million; US$19.5 million IBRD and US$10.5 million from GoA.

Component A ­ Generation and Dissemination of Research and Information (US $13.4
million; US$7.9 million from IBRD and US$5.5 million from GoA)

This component was designed to address weaknesses and deficiencies in the policy, legal and
regulatory framework on native forests. It had the following three subcomponents: (1) reform of
the policy, legal and regulatory framework affecting native forests; (2) a national inventory of
native forests, and establishment and operation of a related database; and (3) applied research and
studies to facilitate the improved management and conservation of native forests and protected
areas.

Subcomponent A1: Policy, Legal and Regulatory Reform ­ The objective of this subcomponent
was to update the regulatory and legal framework which SAyDS works within as the responsible
agency for managing native forests at the federal level. The subcomponent included provisions
for a detailed study of existing federal legislation and regulations affecting the use and
conservation of native forests in order to identify the main obstacles to their better management.
The subcomponent also stipulated that the study would be followed by workshops for
representatives of the public and private sectors and NGOs, the objective of which was to obtain
feedback on the study and agree on a hierarchy of problems.

Subcomponent A2: National Inventory of Native Forests and Management of a Related
Database­ The objective of this subcomponent was to: (a) complete an inventory of native forests,
including their biodiversity in carefully selected areas, and (b) to develop and manage a related


                                                   3

database so that SAyDS would have the capacity to store, retrieve, analyze and publish reliable
information related to its mandate governing native forests.

Subcomponent A3: Applied Research and Studies to Facilitate the Improved Management and
Conservation of Native Forests ­ The overall objective of this sub-component was to provide
additional building blocks to SRNyAH in its efforts to develop a strategy for discharging the
federal responsibility with respect to native forests. Based on the information generated from the
inventory, SRNyAH developed and managed an applied research and studies program to (a)
identify the geographic areas of native forests most threatened with loss and destruction; (b)
select from the set of areas so identified the subset with the highest priority for protection; (c)
identify the principal forces leading to loss and destruction in the subset with the highest priority
for protection; and (d) develop and elaborate the options, including, where feasible, a cost-benefit
analysis for actions recommended, which SRNyAH would exercise to improve the management
of these priority areas, particularly when all or part are privately owned.

Component B ­ Protected Areas (US$10.3 million; US$7.3 million from IBRD and US$3.0
million from GoA)

Argentina was the first country in Latin America to create a national park system. At the time of
inception the system consisted of 30 protected areas covering 2.8 million ha (1% of the total
national land area). Tourism generated by the parks system is a significant and growing part of
the economy, though visitation to and revenues from the parks is highly unequal; the four
Patagonian parks included in this project generated 44% of all park revenues in 1994. The
National Parks Administration (APN) suffered generally from a shortage of funding, which had
resulted in under-investment in park infrastructure. APN's own studies pointed to the need for
improved protected areas management, institutional strengthening and training and a strengthened
national system of protected areas.

The objectives of the Protected Areas Component were: (a) to prepare a plan for modernizing
APN and transforming it into a world-class park management organization; and (b) to increase
the capacity of four national parks in Patagonia to accommodate a greater number of tourists
without damaging their environment. (The four selected parks were: Lanín, Naguel Huapi, Los
Alerces and Los Glaciares.) To this end, the Protected Areas Component was divided into two
sub-components: (1) the development of a plan for the modernization of APN; and (2) specific
infrastructure developments and management strengthening in four selected parks in the
Patagonian region.

Subcomponent B1: Development of Modernization Plan for APN ­ The general objective of this
subcomponent was to support studies and activities which are aimed at developing an agreement
on a vision and subsequent draft implementation plan for the transformation of APN into a world-
class parks administration. The subcomponent did not include financing for the implementation
of project activities due to the uncertainty and difficulty associated with, among other things, the
costs that could be accrued in such an effort prior to reaching an accord on the visioning and
planning process.

Subcomponent B2: Infrastructure Development and Management Strengthening in Four Selected
National Parks ­ The general objective of this subcomponent was to finance the development of
basic infrastructure and to strengthen the capacity of four national parks selected in the region of
Patagonia: Lanín, Nahuel Huapi, Los Alerces and Los Glaciares. The parks were selected on the
basis of their ecological importance and the critical role that each of them plays in protecting the
water resources of the region.

Component C ­ Project Implementation (US $2.2 million; US$2.2 million from IBRD)
This component strengthened the capacity of Directorate for Native Forests (DRFN) of SAyDS
and APN to manage and coordinate project implementation by establishing a PIU which would
assist the managers of DRFN and APN in implementing the project. Following the transfer of
APN to the Secretary of Tourism, a PIU with a separate special account was established there.

1.6 Revised Components

There were no revisions to the project components themselves.

1.7 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding
allocations)

Institutional arrangements ­
The Native Forest/Protected Areas project was originally designed to work through the
Secretariat of Natural Resources and Human Environment (SRNyAH). SRNyAH established a
single PIU, responsible for the coordination of project implementation, working with the staff of
the Directorate of Forests (DB) and the semi-autonomous National Parks Administration (APN).
The DB and APN, responsible for the native forest and protected areas components, respectively,
were both within the SRNyAH.

Following a series of institutional reorganizations in the environment ministries, in 2001 APN
was transferred to the Ministry of Tourism. At that time, SRNyAH was renamed as the Secretary
of the Environment and Sustainable Development (SAyDS). The transfer of APN to the Ministry
of Tourism had implications for the implementation of the project. Once transferred, the
Protected Areas Component experienced significant constraints in the timely flow of funds from
SAyDS (which held authority for the special account) for routine operations. This constraint was
eventually resolved by establishing a separate special account for APN and separate procurement
authority.

Very late in the project (2007) SAyDS was transferred to the Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros,
where it remains at this time. However, no negative impacts on the project were incurred as a
result of this shift.

Project Extensions ­

The project had 3 extensions. These were for 12, 9, and 3 months for a total of 24 months beyond
the original closuring date. Impacts of the fiscal and political crises of 2001 ­ 2003 on the project
had slowed progress during those years. However, following the crisis the project had recouped
its momentum and showed good signs that it could successfully accomplish its objectives,
providing it was granted more time. The first two extensions were linked and were processed in
response to a request from the borrower for a full 21-mt. extension. The first (12-mt.) extension
contained triggers for the second (9-mt.) extension and stipulated that only work underway or
contracted and projected to be concluded in the additional 9-mt. period could be included in the
second extension. The triggers were primarily directed at Subcomponent B2's infrastructure
works, which were progressing slowly. Nevertheless, all subcomponents benefited from the first
two extensions, as the draft law was submitted to congress (A1), the inventory completed (A2),
two additional applied research projects completed (A3) and the modernization plan approved



                                                   5

(B1) during the 21 months. The third extension was requested strictly to finalize four major
infrastructure works which were over 90% complete and could be finished within 3 months (The
works were completed at the end of that period.).

Amendment of Disbursement Category Allocations ­

In July 2003, an amendment was made to the loan agreement which included a reallocation of
funds, along with a change in the percentage of expenditures to be financed by IBRD and the
establishment of a separate PIU and special account for APN (following its transfer to the
Ministry of Tourism). The reallocations were as follows:

             · Consultants' services, disbursement category (1)(a) ­ increased from USD
                 590,000 to USD 715,000;
             · Workshop and training tours, disbursement category part (1)(b) ­ increased from
                 USD 126,000 to 210,000;
             · Consultants' services, disbursement category part (2)(a) ­ increased from USD
                 3,324,000 to 3,626,500.
             · Vehicles, remote images, equipment, software, workshops, disbursement category
                 (2)(b) ­ decreased from USD 941,000 to 774,500;
             · Applied Research and Studies, disbursement category (3)(a) ­ decreased from
                 USD 2,910,000 to 2,437,000;
             · Workshops, disbursement category (3)(b) ­ decreased from USD 90,000 to
                 85,000.
             · Consultants' services, disbursement category (6)(a) -- decreased from USD
                 1,520,000 to 893,000;
             · Vehicles and equipment, disbursement category (6)(b) ­ decreased from USD
                 119,000 to 59,500;
             · Consultants' services, disbursement category (8)(a) ­new disbursement category
                 at USD 760,000 for the APN PIU; and
             · Vehicles and equipment, disbursement category (8)(b) ­new disbursement
                 category at USD 59,500 to support APN's new PIU.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
(including whether lessons of earlier operations were taken into account, risks and their
mitigations identified, and adequacy of participatory processes, as applicable)

In the early 1990s, Argentina was emerging from a period of hyperinflation and economic
instability, and was confronted with the challenge of promoting economic growth. One of the
more promising areas identified with potential for growth was the forestry sector. With this in
mind, the government sought ways to narrow the gap between existing and potential sustainable
levels of production. At the government's request, the Bank initiated a review of the sector in
1992, leading to a Forestry Sector Review (Report No. 11833-AR, dated April 26, 1993). This
provided the foundation for the identification, preparation, and appraisal of the project.

The review noted that the major issues and challenges confronting Argentina's forest sector were
inter-alia the need to improve the policy framework around issues of native forests and protected
areas, generate information for the appropriate management of the same, and improve the public
management of native forests areas. Information on native forests was scarce, and Argentina


                                                 6

could not count on a solid research and information base on which to base its analysis of policy
options, making it difficult to develop realistic plans or political consensus on critical issues of
natural resource management. The country lacked a comprehensive inventory of its native forests,
as well as any environmental or economic analysis of the threats to that resource or the economic
opportunities therein. The Bank's support for economy-wide policies and actions necessary for
the improvement of Argentina's forestry potential was pursued as part of the country dialogue
and economic work program. It was determined that the Bank could be of significant assistance to
the government in helping it to develop and implement an appropriate state role in forestry and
conservation.

Project Preparation

The Bank team was composed of economists, foresters, protected area specialists and other
technical experts. The FAO CP played an important role in providing technical experts to work
side-by-side with the national counterparts in the project formulation. The project was well
conceived and had a sound technical design that targeted the issues and constraints derived from
the sector review report.

Lessons learned incorporated:

At the time of assessment, the Bank had lent over US$2 billion for forestry projects and projects
with forestry components. Despite this resume, the Bank had only one existing Implementation
Completion Report (ICR) and no Project Audit Reports (PAR) for the forestry sector in Latin
America & the Caribbean. An internal Operations Evaluation Department (OED) study (1991)
concluded that the frontier for development in the forest sector lay in institutional and human
resources as well as research and information systems. The design of the Native Forests/Protected
Areas project was closely aligned with these findings.

The project also heeded the lessons learned from other Bank and non-Bank projects ­ that native
forests and other wildlands are a resource capable of being managed for multiple outputs,
including environmental services, and that the government has a key role to play in protecting
critical habitat.

Rationale for Bank Involvement:

The project provided a vehicle for pursuing one of the three pillars of the 1995 CAS for
Argentina: rebuilding infrastructure, which included inter alia lending for forestry, enhancing the
regulatory framework in forestry, and improving the management of native forests. It achieved
this objective by enhancing the policy, legal and regulatory framework governing native forests,
by addressing information constraints to the sustainable use of native forests and the conservation
of biodiversity through investments in physical infrastructure in key parks, and by supporting the
modernization of APN. Because forestry was a relatively new area for investments in Argentina,
Bank experience in other countries was instrumental in helping the Argentines prepare for the
proposed project.

Project Design

One important factor contributing to the project's success was the decision to base the project's
design on the comprehensive sector study of 1995. The study included a review of government
policy and regulation in the forestry sector, institutional structure and capacity, research capacity
and extension services, plantation management, and environmental sustainability. The project


                                                   7

design aimed to address shortcomings in these areas, strengthen weaknesses, and mitigate
constraints existing in the forestry sector. The project's success demonstrates the importance of
carrying out a sector review to identify issues and constraints in the early stages of preparation.

Risk Assessment:

The major risks and uncertainties included the danger that the institutions charged with executing
the project would not be up to the task and that the government commitment of funds to achieve
long-term goals would not be sustainable in the face of short-term fiscal constraints. These risks
were mitigated by funding for training of government professionals and technicians, and
augmenting capacity with specialized consultants needed to fill critical gaps in staffing. The risk
of fiscal constraints was mitigated successfully by emphasizing the importance of national parks
to become more self sufficient.

Borrower Commitment:

A key factor in the project's success was overall good government support, with the project
closing with a high degree of support from both SAyDS and APN, as line agencies. However,
during the crisis years, the government commitment was hard to ascertain ­ both IBRD and
counterpart funding were severely constrained, and project progress slowed. IBRD expenditures
dropped from US $2.5 million in 2001 to US $0.7 million in 2002. Scarce government funds were
shifted from the executing agencies to social relief programs. At the same time, the line agencies
maintained, albeit with difficulty, marginal rates of progress during the crisis. In contrast, as the
crisis began to abate in 2004, both agencies, and APN in particular began to regain their footing
and implementation rebounded strongly.

2.2 Implementation
(including any project changes/restructuring, mid-term review, Project at Risk status, and actions
taken, as applicable)
Economic and Political Collapse 2001-2002 ­ By the end of 2001, capital flight led to the
imposition of banking controls, a policy that proved highly unpopular and the cause of massive
protests. In December 2001, President De la Rúa resigned and was succeeded by several interim
presidents in the month after his resignation until President Duhalde was appointed by the
national congress to complete the existing presidential term through May 2003.

During the interim presidencies, the parity between the peso and the dollar was abandoned, and
the government announced that it would not service its external debt (except for that with the
IFIs). Meanwhile, the country continued to sink into a deeper recession, with GDP falling by 11
percent in 2002. The social costs of the crisis were profound, with poverty affecting more than 50
percent of the population by July 2002.

The crisis had an immediate and significant impact on project implementation. In face of the
ensuing economic and institutional chaos, national and provincial authorities turned their
attention to crisis management and many programs were postponed due to lack of adequate fiscal
resources and mounting social tensions. At the same time, the 2001 crisis severely affected the
legitimacy of government, resulting in the evaporation of much political capital. Given the highly
unfavorable implementation environment, the achievements of both of the components are
particularly noteworthy, as are the institutions which struggled to see them through closure.

During the economic crisis, the project's execution was considerably below expected rates and
the project was considered at risk, as was most of the Argentina portfolio. With 50% of the


                                                  8

population haven fallen below the poverty line, the government was compelled to shift scarce
funds to avert or mitigate social crises. Consequently, across the board budget cuts were
experienced in the project and sector, and the line agencies were left with little recourse.
However, with assistance from the Bank team, the agencies made successful appeals for
additional funding to the Ministry of Economy and Production and the President's Chief of
Cabinet. In addition, the Bank agreed to an amendment of the loan agreement to increase the
percentage of IBRD resources required for implementation from 60% to 100% for Consultant
Services, under disbursement category (2)(a); from 60% to 100% for Research and Studies, under
disbursement category (3) (a); and from 67% to 80% for Civil Works, under disbursement
category (5) (c). This helped to boost implementation, as lesser amounts of scarce counterpart
funds were required for implementation. The Bank team was also supported by the Country
Lawyer and the Lead Procurement Specialist, who helped the client to find a solution to the
stalled contract for the national forest inventory. The team also worked with the government to
form a separate PIU and special account for APN, which had been transferred to the Secretary of
Tourism. All of these measures were instrumental in boosting implementation and helping the
project to meet its objectives.

Although the peso was pegged to the dollar at a 1:1 ratio at effectiveness, the peso devalued to
nearly 3.6-to-1 in 2002 and remains today at about 3.1 to 1. The devalued peso,
along with low rates of inflation (avg 8%) between 2003 and 2006, resulted in lower rates of
disbursements in the project in US Dollars, even as the country emerged from the crisis and the
project began to recover lost ground in implementation. This is because most of the project's
expenditures were in Argentine Pesos and US Dollar equivalent costs were much lower after the
crisis compared to the cost estimates at appraisal. The graph below shows the disbursements in
US dollars before and after the crisis relative to the dollar-equivalent in pesos.

While the economic crisis created financial difficulties for the Argentine state and directly
impacted project budgets, conversely it helped to stimulate an increase in international tourism.
Improvements to the National Park system, including the four parks strengthened by this project,
capitalized on this increase in tourism and increased revenues for APN. Revenues and visitation



                                                      9

rates for the four target parks increased significantly relative to the park system as a whole. Total
revenues from the four parks in the Native Forests/Protected Areas project increased from 36% of
total park revenues in 2000 to 53% in 2006. Similarly, visitation rates in the four parks increased
from 29% of total park visits in 2000 to over 45% in 2006.

Despite the very difficult macroeconomic context, the federal and provincial governments took
extraordinary measures to contain the fiscal situation during 2002. The government also agreed
on a transition program with the IMF, covering the period January through August 2003. By then,
Argentina began to emerge from the depth of the crisis. Economic growth rebounded, reaching
8.8 percent growth in GDP in 2003. This growth can be understood as a function of the country's
improved competitiveness due to the currency devaluation of 2002, favorable international
market and financial conditions, and improved fiscal management.

Personnel Changes - Personnel changes were incurred during implementation; however this
rarely impacted implementation, since most of the core technical staff were retained. Over the
course of project implementation, the National Director for Component A changed six times and
the National Director for Component B changed four times.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

(a) M&E design-- The project design includes indicators for project monitoring. The design was
simple, straightforward and easily understood by the agencies and the Bank staff. Both
components provided good background information to support their measurements.

(b) M&E implementation-- Both APN and SAyDS collected the relevant data throughout the
project cycle and developed annual reports of indicator progress. Information from field
supervisions was used to augment the indicator reports. Both SAyDS and APN's PIUs collected
the data for the monitoring. Given the nature of the project, the arrangements were satisfactory.
The data were generally considered good. Periodicity could have been improved to produce
quarterly reports had more funding been available to the line agencies for the task. Only one
particular obstacle to monitoring was encountered ­ as infrastructure contracts were frequently
packaged to include more than one type of work, contracts required post reviews by the team and
APN to identify discrete works relative to the individual indicators and their associated progress.

(c) M&E utilization-- The PSRs and ISRs were regularly updated with the monitoring and
evaluation information, which proved to be a useful tool for the team in its supervision and to
provide the needed feedback and guidance to the implementing agencies on where to focus their
efforts. The M&E was particularly important in the post-crisis period to clearly demonstrate to
high-level administrators of the line agencies areas to target for improvement. The M&E effort
was the first for both agencies, and they have demonstrated the knowledge obtained through the
project by building high-quality indicator sets for a proposed new operation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
(focusing on issues and their resolution, as applicable)

Fiduciary

Three supervision missions to the project were carried out by the Regional FM and Procurement
Teams in 2002, 2004 and 2006. The conclusions of the supervision missions were that the
project's overall FM and procurement performance was satisfactory. Some weaknesses, mainly



                                                  10

related to the lack of timely counterpart funding, partly caused by the 2001-2002 economic crisis
and some errors in the exchange rates applied to convert expenditures paid in pesos into dollars,
were identified by the FM supervision missions. Funds flow difficulties were identified within
APNs bureaucracy and FM guidance was useful in order to bring these to the attention of the
agency and help to resolve them. However, the identified weaknesses did not materially affect
project performance and were satisfactorily addressed by the PIU through the completion of an
agreed action plan. The project had no cases of misprocurement nor (financial disqualification
problems) accountability issues in any of the financial auditing reports.

Safeguards

Environment Assessment (OP 4.01) : The project was rated as a category "B". It aimed to
promote improved environmental management of native forests and protected areas, the effects of
which were designed to be overwhelmingly positive. Small infrastructure works within
Component B were the main focus for environmental management and monitoring. To manage
this, prior to the execution of the works, APN carried out specific environmental assessments
according to the potential for environmental impacts per National Law 22.351 and APN
resolution no. 16/94, which were completely consistent with OD 4.01. The requirements and
administrative procedures for the assessments are outlined in APN's Reglamento para la
Evaluación Impacto Ambiental en Areas de la Administración de Parques Nacionales. EIAs and
mitigation plans were reviewed and cleared by the team's environmental specialist for the
relevant works. APN performance for the reviews and environmental management was
consistently complete and of high quality. The Bank supervision team included biologists and
foresters trained in the applicable Bank safeguards policies.

Natural Habitats (OP 4.04): The project was designed to have positive impacts on the
environment, and to bolster the capacity of the government to manage and protect natural
resources and biodiversity. The protection of natural habitats was a major focus of the Protected
Areas Component. All activities under this component aimed to increase the conservation
capacities of the government level institution while enhancing the local community involvement
and benefit-sharing from park improvements, infrastructure and increased tourism. Infrastructure
works in national parks incorporated Bank standards for EA and EIA for relevant activities. APN
has shown excellent compliance with Bank standards, and has a set of protocols for works in
Parks which are comparable and applicable for all projects through its Reglamento para la
Evaluacion de Impacto Ambiental en Areas de la Administracion de Parques Nacionales. These
standards apply for all works whether or not they are financed by the Bank. The native forests
component resulted in new legislation which includes a moratorium on forest clearing, and
requires compliance of provinces to develop land use capability plans and employ sustainable
forest management techniques for forestry ­ which is the first legal reform for native forests in 60
years. Supervision missions visited each park and applied research site during the course of
implementation, and the project was consistently found to be in compliance.

Forestry (OP 4.36): The project was conceived and formulated according to the 1992 World Bank
Forestry Policy (OP 4.36) which was the applicable corporate policy instrument regarding
forestry at the project's inception. The project was under implementation for five years before the
revised OP and strategy were approved in 2002, notably at the height of Argentina's economic
crisis. The project was completely consistent with the new World Bank Strategy in both spirit and
substance, and had a strong environmental focus ­ there was no commercial harvesting included
in the project, and the project did not work in tropical areas. Restructuring the project in order to




                                                  11

conform to the new OP and strategy was not necessary. During the course of implementation, a
forester participated in each mission, and the project was found to be consistently in compliance.

Cultural Property (OP 11.03) : The project was consistent with the safeguard in that it sought to
directly improve protection of cultural properties included in the project parks. Three historical
structures were renovated. Bidding documents and contracts required that the original materials
should be favored for structural improvements and that the original architectural layout and
design remain unchanged. Updated management plans included the works along with public
consultation to ensure transparency in the process with stakeholders, despite these works being on
federal land. In the case that replacement of materials was required; for example, decayed
timbers; new lumber had to be of the same specifications and species (to the extent possible) as
the originals. APN provided works inspectors, through the project, to ensure contractor
compliance and Bank supervision missions carried out physical inspection of works.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
(including transition arrangement to post-completion operation of investments financed by
present operation, Operation & Maintenance arrangements, sustaining reforms and institutional
capacity, and next phase/follow-up operation, if applicable)

Post-Completion, Transition Arrangement and Sustainability of Reforms:

Component A. The Government of Argentina considered the sustainable development of the
forestry sector an important part of its national economic development strategy. Prior to project
completion, the government proposed a second IBRD forestry project to continue to strengthen
the capacity of the DB, reform policies and regulations, strengthen forestry research and develop
ways to combat deforestation, especially in the Chaco. The project, Argentina Sustainable Natural
Resource Management Project, presently under preparation, will aim to achieve all these
objectives.

The project supported the development of the first revision of the 1947 forest law, which was
successfully passed by Congress and ratified by the Senate in November 2007. This new legal
framework provides the means for providing incentives for sustainable forest management and
conservation of the country's native forests and is a major contribution of the project. It includes
a hard-won moratorium on forest conversion until provinces can comply with new standards for
sustainable forest management and scientific techniques of land use planning. Training for DB
staff has improved their management capacity for working in forestry policy and planning, and in
forest monitoring.

The impact of this legislation is enhanced by the recognition of the environmental services
provided by forests. The recognition goes beyond a mere statement of principles, by establishing
a fund (Fondo Nacional para el Enriquecimiento y la Conservación de los Bosques Nativos) to
pay for forest environmental services. The fund is to receive 2% of the agricultural export tax
and a minimum of 0.3% of the national budget in addition to other national and international
donations it may receive to pursue its goals. This could mean compensations available for forest
protection and sustainable management in the order of US$300 million according to some
estimates.

The results of the national forest inventory and the forestry database have been broadly
disseminated and are found on SAyDS's Web site, which facilitates user access and fosters cross-
cutting applications according to a diverse set of user needs. The provinces of Misiones, Chaco,
Salta, S. del Estero, Tucuman, Jujuy, Formosa, Cordoba, Santa Fe, Neuquén, Rio Negro, Chubut,


                                                  12

Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego are actively using the data in the management of forests. The
DB also carried out a pilot exercise to update its methodology for carrying out the inventory on a
decentralized basis within the Chaco ecosystem, a model which is planned for replication
throughout the country.

The formation of specialized working groups, the installation of trials, and the consolidation of
lines of research represented a form of sustaining the achieved results. The DB through the
project developed a strategy for research implementation, with a long-term planning focus. Each
of the applied research projects has a 30-year monitoring plan.

The UMSEF, National Forest Monitoring Unit developed by the project has been completely
absorbed by the government and is now financed and supported by the DB as an official forest
monitoring service. It will continue to provide important updates on forest state and change,
necessary for providing timely information on forest for conservation, production, and
environmental services; such as forest watersheds and carbon sequestration. The information and
conclusions derived from the study on the Chaco region are now being used to set the stage for a
new Bank-government effort for regional development planning and to bring deforestation under
control through the combined efforts of a consortium of actors at the federal and provincial levels,
as well as private land holders.

Component B.

APN has demonstrated a high level of commitment to the sustainability of the project objectives.
This includes the required levels of funding and personnel for the maintenance, care and use of
the facilities and equipment provided by the project to support the project's objectives of
increasing the capacity of the parks to accommodate a greater number of tourists without
damaging the environment. Budgets for the 4 parks have steadily been increasing through closure
and revenues from the four parks supported under the Native Forests/Protected Areas project rose
from a total of US $5.6 million in 2000 to a total of US $25.3 million in 2006. As a percentage of
total park revenues for 2000 and 2006, those figures represent a jump from 35 percent to 53
percent, respectively.

By the end of the project (2007) the government provided substantial contingents of personnel for
maintenance, conservation and administration, as follows:

APN reached consensus on a "vision for a reformed APN"; a plan which was signed into
agreement with the Subsecretary of Public Management (Subsecretaría de la Gestión Pública) on
October 29, 2004 in order to strengthen its commitment toward implementation. The
management plan objectives includes increasing the protected areas system to cover 5% of the
country, integrating cultural values and social aspects surrounding parks, increasing
decentralization of parks administration, greater financial sustainability of the parks system, as
well as measures to modernize the on-ground management of parks personnel and providing
secure visitation among others. That strategic vision then was translated into a detailed
implementation plan that guides current planning and management. An objective reflection of this
commitment to the modernization plan is found in the 2008 APN budget, which states among its
objectives "To advance in...the implementation of the Institutional Modernization Plan
incorporating new management guidelines and providing a response to the functional
requirements that derive from the incorporation of new protected areas."1

APN's first progress report on the implementation plan was approved by the Dirección General
de Coordinación Administrativa (Informe No.352/06). Finally, in April 2007, APN approved
(through Resolución No.074) the Modernization Plan, which serves as the basis for strengthening
the agency that now manages over 3.5 million hectares of protected areas. As a result of the
modernization and more favorable economic conditions, the institution is benefiting on several
levels. Human resources have increased almost 50%, from 772 in 2003 to the present level of
some 1148 personnel (of which half are estimated to be field personnel) to cover the new needs
and vision of the parks system, providing outreach to communities and visitors in addition to
increasing protection of core areas. The budget has tripled from AR$28 million in 2002 to
AR$89 million in 2007 and projected to be AR$131 million in 2008. Increasing revenues are
being generated from park visitation, concessions and other external sources providing an
important hedge against future economic crises that may arise. The decentralization efforts
include the creation of several regional delegations that manage much of the day-to-day needs of
the parks while the incorporation of community management has advanced significantly through
the establishment of co-management regimes including Lanin National Park (one of the parks of
PDO 4) that should be models for other Latin American countries.

Next Phase:

The government of Argentina has requested Bank assistance for a new project which will build
on the achievements of the Native Forests/Protected Areas project. While the project helped
Argentina confront many central issues in the sector and to develop a consensus on priorities, it
did not address the inter-agency coordination between federal and provincial actors needed for a
comprehensive approach to forest management. This incomplete policy agenda provides the

rationale in part for the next project and will be incorporated as an activity under the new
operation.

The proposed follow-on operation, the Sustainable Natural Resource Management (SNRM)
Project is currently under preparation, and is designed to improve the sustainable and efficient
management of forest resources, conserve biodiversity in protected areas and forest landscapes,,
and integrate small producers into forestry development and conservation. In forestry, the project
would focus on (i) developing cohesive policy and institutional instruments at federal and
provincial levels supportive of investments in sustainable forestry and conservation (ii)
supporting efficiency gains by making research and extension more competitive and responsive to
user needs and (iii) promoting the integration of resource-poor small and medium sized producers
into sustainable forestry and forest conservation.

Concerning protected areas, the government has produced the Federal Strategic Plan for
Sustainable Tourism (PEFTS) in 2005 that provides the guiding principles for the sector over the
next few years. In this respect, national parks are considered a key element in conserving the
natural resource base for sustainable economic development. The new project is also underpinned
by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and its national level implementation or
national action plan (NAP), and the components for biodiversity conservation of the proposed
project are consistent with the National Biodiversity Strategy adopted in 2003 by the Secretary of
Environment and Sustainable Development (Resolution 91/03). The new project would key on
these by aiming to strengthen management capacity of eleven priority protected areas and to
upgrade APN's capacity in Buenos Aires. These parks have been identified as having high
potential, but lack the management capacity and infrastructure to provide needed levels of
protection to biodiversity while serving increased numbers of tourists.

The current (2006) Argentina CAS refers to promoting agricultural growth, reducing rural
poverty, and improving environmental management.The CAS highlights the importance of the
forestry sector, while emphasizing that "Argentina's growth has long been, and will continue to
be, based in significant part on its tremendous natural comparative advantages".2 In this respect,
the project maintains a high degree of consistency and relevance with the present CAS and
concerns of the country.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

The project has a high degree of relevance to current country priorities and to the overall Bank
assistance strategy for Argentina. The project's design, objectives and implementation are
completely consistent with current development priorities, including the current Argentina CAS,
and that relevance is further reflected by the development of a follow-on operation, the Argentina
Sustainable Natural Resource Management (SNRM) Project. Government commitment to the
protected areas and native forests sectors have increased. APN's budget has increased from
AR$28 million in 2002 to AR$89 million in 2007 and projected to be AR$131 million in 2008.

Estimates are that the new forests law will provide as much as US $300 million dollars to help
manage the country's native forests in sustainable ways.

The Government of Argentina places a high priority on improving the management and
conservation of native forests and protected areas. These sectors are the basis of significant
economic activity and are the source of innumerable positive externalities which benefit the
economy. However, the unsustainable use of Argentina's resources furthers environmental trends
that are "still of great concern," according to a recent World Bank co-sponsored publication
Argentina: State of the Environment 20053.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between outputs and outcomes, with details on
outputs in Annex 2)

PDO 1: To reform the policy, legal and regulatory framework affecting native forests

When the project was designed, the law governing native forests in Argentina dated to 1947. In
order to reform the regulatory and legal framework around native forests, the project worked to
generate reliable information on the area of forests, related threats, management alternatives and
production potential. The project financed studies of policies, laws, and regulations at the federal
and provincial levels to target policy weaknesses in the country. The studies assessed existing
federal and provincial legislation and regulations affecting the management, exploitation,
transportation, processing, and exporting of commercial products from forests, and identified the
main obstacles to the efficient functioning of the sector, including related environmental
consequences. Based on the conclusions derived from the studies, the project supported the
drafting of federal legislation while ensuring consistency with Argentina's environmental laws
and regulations.

The major impact resulting from this work was the "Ley de Presupuestos Minimos para la
Proteccion Ambiental de Bosques Nativos", which was developed as a draft under the project.
The proposed law was submitted to Congress in April 2007 (Ref. 1568-D-2007) and passed by
the Argentine Congress in October and ratified by the Senate in November of the same year. The
law establishes a moratorium on deforestation for one year and prohibits the felling of high-
conservation value forests. It also sets forth the minimum standards for provincial forestry
policies and creates the basis for incentives to protect native forests including the payment for
environmental services. In the period while the bill was stalled in the Senate, grass roots
organizations rallied to support it, including Greenpeace, la Fundación Vida Silvestre Argentina,
la Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (FARN), la Fundación Proteger, Movimiento
Campesino de Santiago del Estero (MOCASE) and the Organización de Naciones y Pueblos
Indígenas en Argentina (ONPIA) as well as the major productive forestry sector organization, la
Asociación Forestal Argentina (AFOA). The organizations helped to collect 1 million signatures
from private citizens to support the new law. Jorge Cappato, National Coordinator for the IUCN
and Director of the NGO Proteger in Argentina noted that the support for the law was, "...one of
the most important achievements of the citizens of Argentina and NGOs...to support the general
welfare of the country..."

The impact of the new legislation is enhanced by the recognition of the environmental services
provided by forests. The recognition goes beyond a mere statement of principles, by establishing
a fund (Fondo Nacional para el Enriquecimiento y la Conservación de los Bosques Nativos) to
pay for forest environmental services. The fund is to receive 2% of the agricultural export tax
and a minimum of 0.3% of the national budget in addition to other national and international
donations it may receive to pursue its goals. This could mean compensations available for forest
protection and sustainable management in the order of US$300 million according to some
estimates.

PDO 2: To generate and disseminate information on the native forests of Argentina in order
to enable all actors, public and private, to contribute to their improved management and
conservation.

Argentina is now one of only two countries in Latin America to have an updated and
comprehensive native forest inventory ­ the other being Mexico. The project financed and
successfully executed the First National Inventory of Native Forests, covering a total area of 33.2
million ha. The inventory has provided key data for both the technical justification for modifying
the forestry law as well as for civil society to understand the impacts of deforestation on the
natural resources of the country as well as its contribution to global climate change. Prior to the
existence of the inventory, the estimates of remaining forests were quite high, leading to
complacency regarding their conservation and sustainable use. The inventory rectified this
situation by providing objective information of the true forest coverage according to ecosystems.
The inventory revealed that there were 33.2 million hectares of forests in the country, 70% of
which are located in the Parque Chaqueño, 11% in the Salva Tucumano Boliviano, 8% in the
Espinal, 6% in the Patagonian Andes, and 4% in the Selva Misionera. Targeted studies on
deforestation were carried out in the Yungas, Chaco and other areas, and provided the
information needed to determine the country's deforestation rate and identify its root causes ­ a
task that had never before been possible to accomplish in a technically sound way. In fact, the
new information on deforestation generated by the project showed a very high rate of loss of
native forests, one of the highest in the region, at .06 - .07% per year (200,000 ha annually) ­
principally due to clearing for agricultural crops, particularly soybeans and cotton, in the Parque
Chaqueño.

The new information on forest state and change provided the foundation for an informed and
substantive policy discussion on native forest issues that has lead to a new legal framework for
forest management and forest incentives, and sets the stage for substantive policy reform in the
future. Non-governmental organizations utilized the data produced by the inventory for their
education and awareness campaigns surrounding the efforts to reform the forestry law and reduce
the deforestation rate. The general public and specialists benefit from the inventory through
current estimates of deforestation, technical studies and alerts regarding forest fire damage and
fragmentation among other relevant forestry themes. The project also provided the technical
capacity to the government needed to carryout future assessments.

The governments (national and provincial) presently use the inventory information and statistics
database as a basic instrument for policy development and planning at national and regional
levels. At closure, 14 different provincial forestry authorities (Misiones, Chaco, Salta, S. del
Estero, Tucuman, Jujuy, Formosa, Cordoba, Santa Fe, Neuquén, Rio Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz,
and Tierra del Fuego) reported they were using the inventory materials in their forest planning
and management. The information has also had global outreach given that the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations used the data as a critical input to its Global
Forest Resource Assessments 2000 and 2005. The inventory will also be a key instrument to


                                                  17

implement the new forestry law that requires forests be classified in each province according to
their relevance for conservation and management and will establish the patterns for future land
use in these regions.

The inventory information content and quality is considered very high. The inventory consisted
of two phases (a) remote sensing mapping of forests at the national level and (b) the field
inventory applied on six forest strata defined as Forested Regions (Parque Chaqueno, Selva
Misionera, Selva Tucumano Boliveano, Bosque Andino Patagonico, Monte and Espinal). The
remaining portions of the country outside these strata were defined as regions of non forest, and
were not included in the sample frame. A separate detailed inventory was also conducted for the
area of Caldén and Ñandubay which fell outside of the forested regions but contain a small
forested area of high conservation value where there are threatened stands of Proposis spp.
Information generated by the inventories includes areal statistics; volumetric data for different
ecosystems; and maps of forest areas at national scale, regional and provincial levels. The related
computer database has been published on the internet. Considering the size of Argentina, the
successful completion of the inventory was a major accomplishment.

To further support the inventory effort, the US Government, through a cooperative agreement
with the US EPA and the DB, helped the Argentine government evaluate the inventory and its
results. The review was conducted by Dr. Andrew Gillespie, former National Leader of the US
National Inventory for the US Forest Service. He reported that "no significant weaknesses are
noted in the current design and implementation [of the inventory]. The UMSEF staff and the staff
of the Proyecto Bosques Nativos y Areas Protegidas are commended on their successful
implementation and completion of a complicated program..."

In order to systematically archive and make public the results of the new forestry information and
other forestry themes, the project supported the creation of the National Forest Monitoring Unit
(UMSEF), which is now developing and managing information and materials necessary for
continuous updating of the national inventory. The unit and staffing costs have now been
completely absorbed by the Forests Directorate and receives a high level of institutional support.

The UMSEF generates and manages multiple databases which allow it to store, recover, analyze
and publish reliable information relative to the state of native forests and its changes. The project
also piloted the development of a decentralized database management center in Chaco Ecosystem,
where deforestation problems are most severe. The decentralized data collection instrument is
setting the stage for greater provincial involvement through their participation, while increasing
their linkages to the federal system.

As a result of the project, the UMSEF has a website for dissemination of forestry information ,
http://www.ambiente.gov.ar/, and has published the Forestry Atlas of Argentina, in both technical
and scholastic versions, as well as a 7 volume bound set of inventory reports for technical users.
The inventory reports are available in their entirety on the UMSEF Website.

In addition to the inventory, the project produced high quality analytical studies on the social,
economic, environmental, demographic and productive qualities of critical forest ecosystems. By
identifying appropriate techniques and alternatives for improved forest management on both
public and private lands, the research studies provided SAyDS a scientific foundation for a public
policy concerning the conservation and management of native forests and the formulation of the
new legislation. In addition, the studies were prioritized with producers in order to address
relevant issues in the forestry and other productive sectors. The research will provide important
inputs to forest management for the implementation of the new forests law as well. Prior to this


                                                 18

effort, there were essentially no scientific studies on native forest management and there was a
dearth of knowledge on forest economic analyses, regeneration studies and the application of new
forms of silviculture. Based on the advances achieved in the sector, the project was invited to and
attended the International Union of Forest Research Organization (IUFRO) World Congress in
2005 in order to present the findings of this important new research.

The research was carried out through five applied research sub-projects: (i) Applied forest
management in the Semi-Arid Chaco, (ii) Applied forest management in the Sub-Humid Chaco,
(iii) Agro-forestry systems for the Espinal ecosystem, (iv) Agro-forestry systems for the
Patagonian Andes, and (v) Forest management alternatives for Tierra del Fuego. By the end of
the project established 33 demonstration plots over 650 ha of forests ­ each with a 30-year
monitoring plan. A proposed sixth project was not implemented. The project also carried out a
baseline study of the Chaco forest ecosystem, where deforestation was found to be the highest,
and funded some of the first studies on the potential for payments of forest environmental
services. Bound reports are available for technical users, as is a video of the research. All reports
are on the agency's internet site.

The applied research project in Tierra del Fuego's lenga, Nothofagus pumilio, forest pioneered
the development and application of silvicultural techniques in forest-harvest areas in order to
enhance the re-generation of the forest cover and enhance biodiversity. Given that estimates are
that 1000 ha per year of these forests are logged in Tierra del Fuego, the research provides an
important alternative to help balance the extraction of wood fiber with ecological concerns, while
helping to ensure the long-term sustainability of the forests. The results of this study were
published in The Journal of Technology Management and Innovation in September 2007.

The applied research experiment in Patagonia developed agroforestry systems with Nothofagus
antarctica in two separate research plots, one in Chubut and the other in Santa Cruz Province. N.
antarctica forests cover about 360,000 ha, and the research showed that about 70% of these areas
have potential for the installation of agro-forestry systems. The systems incorporated both sheep
and cattle into the plots along with the trees. Because the livestock industry is a principle activity
in these areas, the agro-forestry systems developed provide alternatives to farmers to maintain
their traditional activities, while helping to mitigate impacts on the forest ecosystems in which
they occupy.

Two applied research activities were carried out in the Chaco, one in the semi-arid area and the
other in the sub-humid area. The Chaco eco-region is the second largest forest ecosystem in South
America, second only to the Amazon ­ much of it is highly degraded and it is presently the locus
of the country's deforestation. Providing viable alternatives for the sustainable use of the forests
is critical to help thwart these changes. Within the semi-arid Chaco, the subproject conducted
baseline studies on forest composition and socio-economic profiles of people living in the target
areas, as well as research on growth and yield, applied silvicultural techniques, non-timber forest
products and wood technology within in ten research plots. Most of the research focused on
determining growth rates and management regimes for several species of Prosopis, which is the
predominant tree genus in the sub-region. Non-timber products studies showed a range of uses of
five different species of Prosopis including food, forage and medicinal uses, as well as industrial
applications of chemical extracts (tannin). Within the sub-humid Chaco, researchers focused on
the development of silvo-pastoril systems, given the predominance of cattle ranching in the area.
However, the experiments were inconclusive for these areas, and the systems developed showed
low rates of return (7% or less).




                                                   19

As is the case in Patagonia and parts of the Chaco, one of the principal land uses is cattle ranching
in the Espinal Ecosystem, and the research there centered on how to balance this practice with
sustainable forest management. The research was highly successful in developing viable models
for the Espinal. The study identified potential commercial uses for several species of Prosopis
one species of Acacia and several others, which could help to encourage farmers to maintain tree
cover on their lands, rather than converting them completely to pasture. The study developed the
regimens for thinnings, prunings, site preparation and control of undesirable species within the
silvo-pastoril systems. Rates of return for these systems are considered acceptable, increasing the
probability of adoption by producers.

PDO 3: To begin transformation of APN into a world class parks administration

Argentina has the longest tradition of parks management of Latin America, having created the
first park in 1922 and established a Parks Administration in 1934. However the scope of its work
had increased substantially through the creation of many new parks in the 1980's and 1990's
while the nature of parks management changed in these decades to focus on the needs of both
conservation and recreational use of natural resources. The focus of the APN component was to
provide the skills and planning needed to confront new challenges in conservation, a growing
parks system, and increased visitation.

The project supported the development of a new vision and plan for APN as a whole, a process
which culminated in a new Strategic Plan for the agency in addition to the infrastructure
investments and improvements in park management, which are described below (PDO 4). APN
undertook several studies with support from the project to develop the proposal and process for
modernization of the institution. These included thirteen different institutional analyses and
studies that looked at a range of aspects from personnel policies to concessions. However, the
process experienced setbacks in bringing conclusion to the reform agenda during several
government transition periods. First was the transfer of APN from SRNyHA to the Ministry of
Tourism and second was the economic crisis, which consumed the government from 2001-2003.
These periods were constrained by five changes of APN Presidents and lack of institutional
stability during the crisis that impeded institutional reform and project advances.

Despite these constraints and thanks to its high caliber human resources base as well as political
commitment by the Board of Directors, APN reached consensus on a "vision for a reformed
APN"; a plan which was signed into agreement with the Subsecretary of Public Management
(Subsecretaría de la Gestión Pública) on October 29, 2004 in order to strengthen its commitment
toward implementation. The management plan objectives includes increasing the protected areas
system to cover 5% of the country, integrating cultural values and social aspects surrounding
parks, increasing decentralization of parks administration, greater financial sustainability of the
parks system, as well as measures to modernize the on-ground management of parks personnel
and providing secure visitation among others. That strategic vision then was translated into a
detailed implementation plan that guides current planning and management.

APN's first progress report on the implementation plan was approved by the Dirección General
de Coordinación Administrativa (Informe No.352/06). Ultimately, in April 2007, APN approved
(through Resolución No.074) the Modernization Plan, which serves as the basis for strengthening
the agency that now manages over 3.5 million hectares of protected areas.

Finally, APN's successful evolution towards a world-class parks institution is demonstrated by its
recent organization of the Latin American Parks Congress with the World Conservation Union,
IUCN. This conference is organized only once every decade to review advances with the World


                                                  20

Conservation Congress objectives and goals. The Congress provides a forum for discussing and
reviewing regional experiences and provides guidance for reaching agreed conservation and
sustainable development objectives. APN effectively held the Congress in Bariloche in 2007,
hosting over 2000 conservation professionals, NGO and indigenous group representatives.

PDO 4: Increased capacity of four national parks in Patagonia

The impacts of this PDO are threefold; the effective strengthening of the management and
protection capacity of four key protected areas of the national parks system, improving the
services provided to visitors linked to the improved financial sustainability of APN, and
providing greater economic opportunities and incentives for local communities based on
sustainable use and management of natural resources.

The protected areas component of the Native Forests and Protected Areas project focused on four
high visibility parks in Patagonia: Lanin, Los Alerces, Nahuel Huapi and Glaciares that total 2.1
million hectares; around 75% of the parks system coverage at the time of appraisal. The project
financed training to improve the overall management of the four parks and management plans for
each park were approved through Resolutions by the APN Board of Directors. Although progress
in this area was delayed by the administrative and institutional challenges to implementation that
resulted from the economic crisis and the institutional changes, the project team rallied following
the crisis starting in 2003, completing 90% of the projected works by closure.

The infrastructure investments greatly enhanced the quantity and quality of infrastructure and
services available at the four parks, and improved the visitors' experience. Revenues and
visitation rates increased significantly at each. Revenues from the four parks supported under the
Native Forests/Protected Areas project rose from US $5.6 million in 2000 to US $25.3 million in
2006. As a percentage of total park revenues for 2000 and 2006, those figures represent a jump
from 35 percent to 53 percent, respectively.

Whereas visitation to national parks had been flat or declining in the 1990s, they rose rapidly
during the project's tenure. The project was able to successfully capitalize on the increase in
tourism to Argentina after the economic crisis, and visitation rates to the four parks in the project
rose over 300% from the inception of the project to its closure. The national parks system has also
grown over the last decade from 2.8 million hectares to cover over 3.5 million hectares at present
in 33 protected areas. Based on this growth and the success of the investments in the four parks
(in addition to other investments in five parks through a semi-blended GEF project), APN is
currently designing a new project of investments for 11 national parks that will substantially
complete strengthening of the parks system and provide a high level of management capacity and
services for visitors and communities around these areas.

3.3 Efficiency
(Net Present Value/Economic Rate of Return, cost effectiveness, e.g., unit rate norms, least cost,
and comparisons; and Financial Rate of Return)

The following summary is to evaluate the efficiency of the project, including cost
effectiveness analysis and financial analysis.

Cost effectiveness: During the project appraisal, an economic analysis (economic rate of return)
for the project as whole was not conducted, nor were estimations of cost effectiveness. Given the
economic benefits derived from the project are not quantitatively measurable, a cost effectiveness
analysis was carried out ex-post to evaluate the benefits of the project.

The project applied modern technology in implementing project activities. Preparation of the
native forest inventory used satellite technology to stratify the country's land cover and develop a
sampling frame for forests, where field measurements were carried out. This greatly improved the
efficiency of the effort. GIS technology was also applied in the development of the relational
databases and maps, making it possible to readily calculate statistics, update maps and load
information onto the internet. The Native Forest Inventory has provided a key instrument for the
government policy makers for strategic planning for forestry sector. The project improved the
infrastructure in four national parks in Patagonia and introduced modern management methods to
the park administration and helped to put APN on track to becoming a world-class management
organization.

The economic benefits generated from the Project were (i) institutional strengthening for
government institutes (SAyDS and APN); (ii) human resource development for government
officials, whose working efficiency improved and are able to provide better service; and (iii) the
tourists receive better services from the improved park facilities and services.

Efficiency: The project development objectives were fully achieved and almost all project
activities were completed by project closure. Due to the impact of economic crisis, which slowed
project progress for two years, the project completed the implementation in ten years. The total



                                                  22

project costs at the end were 69 percent of the original estimation. The main activity which did
not fully use the estimated budget (32 percent) was applied research under component A, Native
Forests. However, the subcomponent of applied research has reached its overall development
objective (see annex 1). The main reason the disbursements were low for the Applied Research
was the failure to implement one of the sub-projects and the devaluation of the Argentina Peso,
which resulted in lower costs (e.g., training, labor and local materials). The researchers' labor
cost was a third of the estimated costs during project preparation.

Financial analysis: The SAR (Annex C) provided a financial analysis for the four project parks
in the Patagonia region that have specific investments in works and a clear link to financial
sustainability of the parks system. The results of the analysis showed that the investments would
be financially viable: the financial rate of returns were 13 percent, 16 percent, 11 percent and 36
percent respectively for investments in Nahuel Huapi, Lanin, Los Glacares and Los Alerces
National Parks.

The financial analysis results and comparisons are as follows:

National Parks                     FIRR At Appraisal (%)              FIRR at ICR (%)
Lanin                                              16                               13
Nauel Huapi                                        13                               17
Los Alerces                                        36                               15
Los Glacares                                       11                               57

The high financial rate of return (FIRR) for the national park of Los Glaciares was due to the high
annual increase rate of visitation and the corresponding entrance fees. The FIRR for Los Alerces
was lower than estimated because the visitation did not reach the expected level, due largely to its
isolated location. However, the overall impact of the project intervention in the 4 parks as a
whole was overwhelmingly positive.

The analysis indicates that the project has made a significant contribution to the sector
development and the country's economic development. Given the period of economic crisis, the
project overcame great difficulties to finally achieve its development objectives. The
methodology and models developed under the project provide tools for the future in regard to the
forestry sector development. The Native Forest law also provides significant tools, including the
use of economic incentives to pay for environmental services of forests, for the country to
sustainably manage its native forest resources. The strengthening of the four national parks in
Patagonia in regard to physical infrastructure and management met the goal of ensuring the parks
are financially sustainable. (Detailed analysis is in annex 3, Economic and Financial Analysis)

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs, and efficiency)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The project achieved virtually all of its development objectives, which are still considered
relevant in the 2006 CAS. Some of the work carried out by the project, for example the national
inventory, new national legislation for forests and the very high quality infrastructure works, were
state-of-the-art and conform to the highest expectations. However, the tenure of the project at 10
years was excessive, in part due to the impact of the economic crisis. Its efficiency in the conduct
of the work before and during the crisis years was below expected standards while some specific
products such as works in the parks, training and research projects were not 100% completed.



                                                  23

The project should therefore be considered moderately satisfactory. Although the achievements
were high and continue to provide positive impacts and externalities, it is balanced by the fact
that the efficiency was variable and even low during the early and mid-periods of implementation.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Not applicable

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)
Component A
By increasing the quality and quantity of information that SAyDS administers, as well as its
ability to validate and disseminate that information, the project significantly strengthened the
institution's ability as an advocate for the sustainable native forest policy measures and provides a
platform for implementation of future payment for environmental services and other incentive
structures to be developed. The studies give SAyDS's policy recommendations the underlying
scientific support that was previously absent and provided civil society with awareness and the
means to inform their decisions. Non-governmental groups found in the information objective
reasons to rally public opinion in favor of the protection of the remaining forest resources in
Argentina. The new law "Ley de Presupuestos Minimos para la Proteccion Ambiental de
Bosques Nativos", which is a product of the project, is providing for the first major reform of the
native forest sector since 1947 and provides SAyDS with the basis for institutional improvements
and the incorporation of real tools for enforcement and providing incentives for forest
conservation and sustainable management.

Component B
The Modernization Plan, as well as the works contracted under the project, have strengthened the
APN. The plan has provided a vision for the institution to embark upon long-term growth with a
clear objective of protecting key ecosystems while providing the mechanisms for communities to
benefit in the conservation process. The 2008 budget has increased by AR$40 million over the
last year to AR$131 million with important additions in field personnel and infrastructure
investments. Furthermore, the infrastructure investments have improved the visitor experience
while management at the institutional and park level recognize the opportunity for greater
financial sustainability of the parks system through the increase in revenues.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

In the course of the approval of the new forest legislation, there was considerable lobbying from
opposition groups seeking to restrain government intervention in the Chaco. The focus of the
opposition was to prevent government intervention that would restrict private citizens from
converting forests to agricultural lands (mostly for soybean cultivation). Conversely, the stalled
legislation brought more focus to the deforestation problem, and groups supporting the new
legislation gathered over one million signatures in favor of the new law. The television media
picked up on the new law and has aired special features on the previously unrecognized problem
of deforestation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Low

The risks to development outcome are low given that the support for the project's activities has
been embraced and supported by the government. The country approved new legislation for the
protection and sustainable management of its forests, a formal resolution to modernize the
national parks administration, adequate levels of funding for maintaining the new park
infrastructure and performing conservation activities and government funding of the new
inventory unit and for implementing the forest protection legislation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank's performance in identifying, preparing and appraising the operation was moderately
satisfactory. Even though the resulting project was highly pertinent to both Bank and country
priorities, some shortcomings were discovered during implementation that could have been
avoided. The Bank conducted an appropriate diagnosis of the current state of native forest
management, highlighting the need for a highly participative process, fundamental for a country
with diverse environmental systems and potentially conflictive natural resource management
issues. In addition, The Bank correctly focused its efforts on strengthening the institutional and
human resources of the forestry and protected areas sectors. Nevertheless, the Bank
underestimated the complexity of the process of legislative reform and the implementation
arrangements in APN at appraisal were less than satisfactory, and resulted in a slow startup of the
Protected Areas Component. The project was approved with an 8-year implementation period,
based on the standard disbursement profile at the time for Argentina. While the rationale may
have been sound, a tighter timeframe for implementation might have helped to focus the work
and encourage more rapid implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including of fiduciary and safeguards policies)
Rating: Satisfactory

As a consequence of the long implementation period, three task managers managed the project.
The Bank team developed a strong collaboration with the Borrower. The team's experience and
technical quality contributed substantially to the success of implementation and monitored the
progress. On average, supervision missions were carried out two or three times a year with over
20 supervision missions in total. The combined knowledge of the Bank team in addressing similar
forestry problems in other countries and situations strengthened, enriched, and helped to guide the
project's evolution. The team included foresters, economists, biodiversity specialists, institutional
specialists and one forest inventory specialist.

During the financial crisis, the Bank team worked diligently with the PIUs to keep the project
from failing. During that period, while counterpart and IBRD resources were sharply reduced



                                                 25

during the crisis years, the project was one of few Bank-financed projects that made progress and
received at least some government counterpart funding. To help mitigate the effects of shortages
of counterpart funds, in 2003 the team processed an amendment to increase the percentage of
IBRD resources required for implementation from 60% to 100% for Consultant Services, under
disbursement category (2)(a); from 60% to 100% for Research and Studies, under disbursement
category (3) (a); and from 67% to 80% for Civil Works, under disbursement category (5) (c). In
addition, the Bank team successfully helped the line agencies in their appeals to the Ministry of
Economy and Production for additional funding.

Compounding difficulties during the crisis, the largest contract (for the national inventory) was
jeopardized when two parties of a three part consortium abandoned the work. The Team worked
with the Country Lawyer and Lead Procurement Specialist in the Region and their counterparts
within the line agency for several months, successfully guiding the government on an acceptable
means of re-initiating work and completing the contract. The FAO-World Bank Cooperative
Programme (FAO-CP) made strong contributions to project supervision as well providing key
technical supervision that would not have otherwise been available.

The Bank team included biologists and foresters trained in both social and environmental
safeguards. These skills helped to prevent problems in these areas, and guide the implementation
of the project. Fiduciary staff were routinely involved in missions and conducted four
independent fiduciary supervision missions.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In consideration of the ratings for preparation and supervision (above), the overall rating is
considered moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

In general, the Government of Argentina supported project preparation and implementation. They
gave priority to forestry development and conservation, and collaborated with all work required
by the Bank. The government supported the new law for native forests protection and sustainable
management from its development in the project and afterwards during its successful presentation
in the congress and senate. During the crisis years the government provided counterpart funds to
the extent possible, and helped the line agencies when called upon to do so. Following the crisis,
when actual allocations to the line agencies were below requested amounts the Ministry of
Economy and the President's Chief of Cabinet worked to provide additional funding.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The PIUs were composed of qualified technical professionals and administrative staff. Based on
the number and diversity of programs, subprojects, and activities implemented under the project
and supervised by the PIU, it was highly efficient in its work. They also collaborated with the
National General Auditor in project audits, and incorporated comments received into its
operations. Within the framework of constraints experienced during implementation, the line
agencies are to be commended in their tenacity and retention of focus and for bringing the
majority of the work to successful closure.


                                                 26

Collectively, the PIU staff demonstrated a high degree of dedication to their work and during the
project's lifetime conducted 37 workshops, and processed 149 separate contracts.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

Overall borrower performance is considered satisfactory given the level of government
commitment during the project's tenure to provide the funding for execution, satisfactory
performance of the line agencies, including the high levels of results obtained and the high
sustainability of impacts generated. There were no cases of corruption, misprocurement nor
safeguards violations during the project's tenure.

6. Lessons Learned
(both project-specific and of wide general application)

Wide General Application:

Lesson One: Development is not a linear process, though Bank-financed projects expect them
to be. Although the project was fraught with setbacks, delays and even reversals during
implementation, it managed to produce highly relevant impacts for the forestry and protected
areas sectors by closure. The time-bound production-line process for producing outputs and the
achievement of impacts envisioned at inception and codified in the SAR was overly mechanistic.
The Bank, as an institution, needs to ensure that its instruments, philosophy and approaches to
development are sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing country conditions, while maintaining
an acute focus on development objectives.

Lesson Two: Natural resources management where several levels of government and multiple
mandates exist requires additional efforts in developing collaborative partnerships. Component
A was largely a `preparatory' operation to help strengthen the fledgling Directorate of Forests. In
this respect, it made a significant contribution. However, presently there are four federal agencies
involved in forestry issues, as well as the provinces and there are no coordination mechanisms in
place. Experience with the project highlighted the complexity of issues underlying the sustainable
management of privately owned native forests and deforestation in a country as large as
Argentina. It laid bare the disconnect between the various institutions responsible for native
forests including: the disconnect between government institutions and stakeholders, the absence
of a shared vision at federal and provincial levels vis-à-vis the future role of native forests, while
the limited capacity and mandate of the federal Native Forests Directorate highlighted the
importance of developing collaborative partnerships to address native forest issues. Although it
can be difficult and costly to pursue a rigorous campaign of dialogue and open communication
with stakeholders (taking into account the amplitude and diversity of actors in the Argentine
context), inter-sectoral and multi-stakeholder dialogue is fundamental to achieving support for the
development and implementation of public policies at the national level.

Project Specific:

Lesson Three: Although natural resource management problems require immediate attention,
the technical, legal, and social groundwork must be performed to develop effective measures
over the short and long-term. Although deforestation and degradation of natural resources in
Argentina has been recognized for decades by sector specialists, their concern was not translated
into effective action to mitigate these impacts because of a lack of recognition by decision-makers,


                                                  27

politicians, and civil society. The project approach of developing scientifically and technically
accurate inventories made clear the dimension and speed of the problems being faced by
Argentina's native forests. This information was then disseminated at several levels from school-
children to NGOs and forestry specialists translating into public campaigns, while draft
legislation provided the basis for government to respond effectively to the problem.

Lesson Four: Tourism can be a positive force and successful investment in flagship protected
areas may generate benefits for the entire protected areas system The investments in the four
Patagonian parks under the project were highly successful in their outcomes for the individual
parks. In addition to the conservation of biodiversity, they saw increases in their fees collected,
improved infrastructure and equipment for their personnel, and enhanced visitor experiences.
These conditions create a favorable image for decision-makers as sound investments for the
national budget and interest is generated at the national level tourism agencies and from local
governments in other regions that would like to benefit from similar investments in parks within
their localities. This is occurring presently with the new Bank operation under preparation with
APN for 11 national parks.

Lesson Five: Applied research projects are successful when attention is given to stakeholders
and producers needs, but weak local capacities may hinder execution and sustainability. The
project provided for many research projects that were developed to address real needs of
producers facing challenges in regard to degradation of natural resources, sustainable production,
and forest management. These experiences are being widely disseminated both nationally and
internationally. However, those projects that were located in poorer ecoregions where the
capacities of beneficiaries, academic institutions, government agencies, and NGOs was weaker,
faced more problems ranging from a lack of consensus regarding thematic approaches, to the rate
of disbursement and implementation. Good environmental baseline information is not available
in these areas generally, making it more difficult to target research approaches adequately,
however participatory approaches and consultation processes may improve the focus and
selection of interventions.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

During the project appraisal, an economic analysis for the project as whole was not carried out.
The SAR (Annex C) provided a financial analysis for the four project parks in the Patagonia
region that have specific investments in works and a clear link to financial sustainability of the
parks system. The results of the analysis showed that the investments would be financially
viable: the financial rate of returns were 13 percent, 16 percent, 11 percent and 36 percent
respectively for investments in Nahuel Huapi, Lanin, Los Glacares and Los Alerces National
Parks.

For the ICR, the economic analysis sought to evaluate the economic benefits generated from
Component A and B, Native Forests and Protected Areas (the four National Parks in Patagonia),
and the financial analysis is to reassess the results of the original financial analysis by using
actual data.

Economic analysis

Component A
The main achievements/results of the component included (i) support for the proposed law for the
protection of native forests; (ii) completion of a Native Forests Inventory; and (iii) applied
research on sustainable management of native forests.

The principal beneficiary is the government agency, SAyDS, which is responsible for establishing
sector policies and strategies for promoting the sustainable management of native forests. The
training and technical assistance, including various studies, strengthened the capacity of the
agency and provided the basis for the recently approved forestry law. The forest inventory
provided detailed information on native forest coverage providing the government and decision
makers with an objective tool for decision-making in regard to native forest protection and to
inform the new legislation.

One of the applied research studies supported by the project provides an economic analysis of
several alternative uses of forest lands which provides insight into the importance of sustainable
forest management. Without any management, the output of timber was valued US$300 per
hectare over a 14 year period. With a sustainable management and subsidy the output of timber
more than doubles and was valued at $700 per hectare; and this practice can provide continuous
returns in a sustainable way. Converting land for soybean field increased the output value,
estimated at US$3,000 per hectare, but this high value output is estimated to last only five years.
Another study shows that integrated production with livestock production (e.g., cattle ranching),
honey production and sustainable forestry management methods plus a subsidy can generate an
output value of US$3,100, and the practice is sustainable for maintenance of native forests.

Component B
The main economic benefits included: (i) strengthening of APN staff's capacity; (ii) increases in
tourists visiting the parks; and (iii) incentives to local economies and local rural inhabitants,
primarily those who invest in small businesses (restaurants, tour guides, souvenir shops, etc.).
Through training activities and technical assistance targeting to strengthen capacity of the staff of
the APN, their working efficiency has improved vis a vis improved working conditions, updated
management and planning tools, new vehicles, communication and computer equipment, and
infrastructure investments, which ensures the efficient use of financial and human resources.



                                                   36

The increase in visitation to the national parks is linked to the country's booming tourism
industry. Since 2000, the total number of visitors has increased by more than 30 percent annually.
Among the four parks, the highest increase rate has been in Lanin National Park. In 2002,
visitation to this park increased by 170 percent relative to the previous year, and it has kept
increasing annually at a rate of 30 percent. The other three parks also maintain high rates of
increase of visitation, ranging between 30-80 percent.

However, one of the important factors for this phenomenal growth was the devaluation of
Argentina currency; the Peso. The country has become one of the regions favorite tourist
attractions. The projects contribution to the increase in visitations was to provide adequate tourist
capacity through the improvement in the physical facilities (e.g., visitor center, volunteer housing,
road and path, water fountains and sanitation) and information provision. The tourists enjoy the
natural scenery and wildlife of the parks as well as outdoor activities (skiing, fishing, hiking, etc.),
while the improved facilities make their stay comfortable and pleasant. The re-visitation rate has
reached 15% in 2007.

As more and more tourists visit these parks, the local people have begun engaging in small
businesses and service provision to the visitors. These include restaurants and tour guide services
among others. The park administration collects management fees from the business within the
protected areas. The financial data shows that the revenue from fees collected exceeded 30% of
the total park revenue. These activities have helped to promote local economic development. On
the other hand, the local people also come to appreciate the importance of conservation increasing
their support for the environmental protection activities of APN.

Financial analysis

During appraisal, a financial analysis was carried out to evaluate financial viability of the four
project parks. The analysis was based on the assumption and estimation of park revenue,
investment costs and operational costs. The incremental revenues for each park, "with" and
"without' were derived from a study and projection. Of course, no one was able to predict the
financial crisis that occurred two years following project approval and there was no way to
predict that the parks would be benefit or be harmed.

Main Assumptions on the Revenues and the Costs

The financial analysis below calculates the financial rate of return for each park the project
supported. Then the results were compared to the results of the analysis in the original SAR. The
analysis uses actual data collected by the project management unit in regard to the investment
costs, as well as APN data for the parks revenue and operational costs.

The investment costs were compiled from the project data and these costs covered the project
investment activities. Since the implementation was delayed for three to four years, the resulting
costs are lower than planned due to the devaluation of Argentine pesos. The investment costs
include construction works (visitor centers, historical rehabilitation, trails and road), vehicle, boat,
and equipment, training and technical assistance.

The incremental revenues include two sources: entrance fees and park management charges to
businesses and services. The incremental operational costs include park administration staff
salaries, operation and maintenance of control posts, visitor centers, volunteer housing, mountain

refuges, and guard housing, maintenance of road and trails, operation and maintenance of
vehicles and boats.

The streams of incremental revenue and costs are run over a twenty year period. The actual data
on annual revenue and operation costs are used up to the year 2006, and an estimation of revenue
stream is made from the year 2007 onward. The annual increase in the rate of visitation is
projected at ten percent with the project and 4.5 percent without project.

Reassessment of the Evaluation during the Appraisal

Comparing the actual data on revenue and costs with the data used in the financial analysis in the
SAR, some overestimation and underestimation is noted. The overestimated data regards the
annual revenue with the project in three national parks: Los Alerces, Nahuel Huapi, and Lanin.
The actual revenue generated was about 45-70 percent of the estimated revenue. The
underestimated data includes annual revenue in Los Glaciares. The actual revenue generated was
50 - 100% higher than estimated originally. The incremental operational costs were generally
also underestimated as compared to the actual data reflects during project implementation.

The Results of Financial Rate of Returns (FIRR)

The cash flow calculation shows that three of the four parks are financially viable and robust.
The financial rate of returns for all four National Parks of Lanin, Nahuel Huapi, Los Alerces, and
Los Glacares is 13 percent, 17 percent and 57 percent respectively. The financial rate of return of
Los Alerces National Park was 15 percent and did not reach to the estimated because the
visitation did not reach expected levels until the year 2004. Notably, Los Alerces is the most
isolated of the four parks. The high rate of return of Los Glaciares National Park was because of
its high annual increase in the rate of visitation (168 percent in 2003). The sensitivity analysis
shows that the model is most sensitive to the variation of revenue and less sensitive to the
variation of costs, especially to investment costs because the investment costs always occur
during the early years.

Conclusion

The analysis indicates that the project has made a significant contribution to the sector
development and the country's economic development. Given the period of economic crisis, the
project overcame great difficulties to finally achieve its development objectives. The
methodology and models developed under the project provide tools for the future in regard to the
forestry sector development. The Native Forest law also provides significant tools, including the
use of economic incentives to pay for environmental services of forests, for the country to
sustainably manage native forest resources. The strengthening of the four national parks in
Patagonia in regard to physical infrastructure and management has met the goal of ensuring the
parks are financially sustainable.

Objetivo del Proyecto
Los objetivos del proyecto son los siguientes: (a) ayudar a la SRNyAH a asignar prioridades a sus
acciones propuestas referentes a los bosques nativos; (b) facilitar el desarrollo de una estructura
de incentivos y normas que aliente a los decisores, tanto públicos como privados, a internalizar
más completamente dentro de su proceso de toma de decisiones, el espectro completo de
beneficios y costos sociales asociados a sus decisiones y acciones que afecten a los bosques
nativos; (c) desarrollar un programa para transformar la APN en una organización de
administración de parques a nivel mundial y (d) incrementar el nivel de turismo ambientalmente
sustentable en cuatro parques nacionales: Lanin, Nahuel Huapi, Los Alerces y Los Glaciares.

Componentes del Proyecto e Impactos
Componente A ­ Generación y Diseminación de Investigación e Información
Este componente apoya las acciones e inversiones tendientes a generar información con un alto
contenido de sentido de bien público referente a los bosques nativos y las áreas protegidas. El
Componente A cuenta a su vez con tres subcomponentes:

Subcomponente A1: Reforma del marco político, legal y regulatorio que afecta a los bosques
nativos buscando la elaboración de una propuesta que adecue la política forestal nacional, de
manera de impulsar el manejo sustentable de los bosques nativos y las áreas protegidas,
incluyendo la conservación de su biodiversidad.

Subcomponente A2: Inventario nacional de bosques nativos y áreas protegidas y manejo de la
correspondiente base de datos buscando crear y mantener actualizada una base de datos que
constituya el Sistema Nacional de Evaluación Forestal, obteniendo información confiable sobre la
ubicación, extensión y biodiversidad de los Bosques Nativos y reforzando la capacidad de la
SAyDS para almacenar, analizar, recuperar y publicar dicha información.

Subcomponente A3: Investigación aplicada y estudios para impulsar el mejoramiento del manejo
y conservación de los bosques nativos y de las áreas protegidas con el objetivo de proporcionar a
la SAyDS las bases de una política de conservación, manejo y aprovechamiento de los Bosques
Nativos mediante la identificación de las regiones amenazadas de destrucción, la selección de las
áreas cuya protección sea prioritaria, la identificación de las causas de la deforestación en las
áreas prioritarias y el desarrollo de alternativas de manejo mejorado, en propiedad pública o
privada.

Impactos
Al analizar las prioridades de desarrollo actuales y las circunstancias al momento de la realización
del presente ICR, se concluye que existe una elevada pertinencia total de los objetivos del
Proyecto. Esto significa que los objetivos, diseño e implementación de la operación resultan en
alto grado consistentes con las prioridades de desarrollo actuales.
En cuanto a las prioridades de gobierno, tal pertinencia con los objetivos de la operación queda
evidenciada a partir de la promulgación de la Ley General del Ambiente Nro. 25.675/02, que
establece los presupuestos mínimos para el logro de una gestión sustentable y adecuada del

ambiente, la preservación y protección de la diversidad biológica y la implementación del
desarrollo sustentable.4

Subcomponente A1: Reforma del Marco Político, Legal y Regulatorio que Afecta a los Bosques
Nativos. El resultado en la ejecución del Subcomponente A1 fue SATISFACTORIO
En base a los estudios detallados acerca de la legislación federal y demás normas existentes que
afectan el uso y la conservación de estos bosques, se identificaron los principales obstáculos para
su manejo mejorado, incluyendo aquellos que impiden la internalización de los valores
ambientales en la toma de decisiones públicas y privadas. Esta tarea se vio enriquecida por la
participación del sector público, el sector privado y una cantidad importante de instituciones y
organizaciones del Tercer Sector, lo que permitió llegar a un Anteproyecto de Ley de promoción
al uso sustentable de los recursos forestales nativos que reúne la visión del conjunto de actores a
nivel nacional.

Subcomponente A2: Inventario Nacional de Bosques Nativos y Areas Protegidas y Manejo de la
correspondiente Base de Datos. El resultado en la ejecución fue SATISFACTORIO
El proyecto ha logrado completar un inventario de bosques nativos, al mismo tiempo que se ha
podido desarrollar y manejar una base de datos de manera que la SAyDS cuente con capacidad
para almacenar, recuperar, analizar y publicar información confiable referida a su misión de
administrar los bosques nativos. La institucionalidad lograda por la UMSEF y la generación de
nodos regionales a partir de ella, significan logros de gran relevancia en la sostenibilidad de los
objetivos del programa, aun finalizado el plazo de ejecución del Proyecto.

Subcomponente A3: Investigación Aplicada y Estudios para Facilitar la Mejora del Manejo y la
Conservación de Bosques Nativos. El resultado en la ejecución fue MODERADAMENTE
SATISFACTORIO La ejecución de este Subcomponente permitió contar con los elementos
informativos necesario para desarrollar una estrategia que permita cumplir con la responsabilidad
federal hacia los bosques nativos. Estos elementos se corresponden con la información generada a
partir de Estudios Integrales de las Regiones Forestales del país que fueron vitales para identificar
las áreas geográficas de los bosques nativos más amenazadas de pérdida y destrucción, establecer
prioridades de intervención, identificando las fuerzas principales que conducen a la pérdida y
destrucción en este sub-grupo de protección prioritaria.

Productos del Componente
Se destacan algunos de los productos más resaltantes del Componente A. Entre ellas se citan:
Entrenamiento de 250 especialistas técnicos de la SayDS a través de 30 actividades;
sensibilización a casi 1200 personas a través de 29 actividades y seminarios sobre bosques
nativos; desarrollo del borrador de Ley de Bosques Nativos y su discusión en diferentes
instancias; producción de mapas de bosques e informes ecorregionales; un atlas forestal nacional
y materiales didacticos e informativos sobre bosques; un sistema de GIS para el inventario.

Componente B ­ Áreas Protegidas
Este componente busca fortalecer tanto la institucionalidad de administración de las áreas
protegidas como la infraestructura y capacidad de conservación en áreas clave de la Patagonia.




4N.b.: El informe de cierre del prestatario fue preparado previo a la promulgación de la Ley de
Presupuestos Mínimos para la Protección Ambiental de Bosques Nativos.

Subcomponente B1: Desarrollar un programa para transformar la APN en una organización de
administración de parques a nivel mundial. Este subcomponente ha enfocado en diferentes
análisis, talleres y estudios para mejorar la capacidad de gestión a través de un Plan de
Modernización para la APN que guiaría su labor a futuro buscando la consolidación del Sistema
Nacional de Áreas Protegidas.

Subcomponente B2: Incrementar el nivel de turismo ambientalmente sustentable en cuatro
parques nacionales: Lanin, Nahuel Huapi, Los Alerces y Los Glaciares. Este subcomponente se
ha concentrado en obras como reparación de caminos, puentes, edificios de administración y
protección y centros de interpretación para turistas y pobladores. Al mismo tiempo se ha
mejorado el marco de planificación de estas áreas a través de la actualización de los planes de
manejo de los parques.

Impactos
Resultado del Componente B: SATISFACTORIO
Al analizar las prioridades de desarrollo actuales y las circunstancias al momento de la realización
del presente ICR, se concluye que existe una elevada pertinencia total de los objetivos del
Proyecto. Esto significa que los objetivos, diseño e implementación de la operación resultan en
alto grado consistentes con las prioridades de desarrollo actuales. Las Obras realizadas han
implicado beneficios al sector turismo, Centros de Visitantes, Pasarelas, Muelles, y todas las
Obras que implican infraestructura en general, dándole al turista mayor información y comodidad
en su visita. Así mismo hubo beneficios en el Manejo y la Conservación de la biodiversidad, esto
se refleja en las Obras de Viviendas para Guardaparques, Viviendas para Voluntarios, Puestos de
control etc. Estás Obras implican mayor presencia en las Áreas Protegidas tanto del personal de la
APN, como de los voluntarios que realizan un gran aporte en la prevención de incendios y el
control general.

Los dos subcomponentes (B1 y B2) contienen actividades de elevada relevancia para los
objetivos del Proyecto. Las perspectivas de sostenibilidad (sostener o mantener en el tiempo) de
los resultados alcanzados son considerables. APN, a partir de la ejecución del Proyecto, ha
manifestado incrementos en la recaudación anual por el cobro de accesos (entradas) como así
también un incremento total por el cobro de diferentes ítems (a saber: accesos, alquileres, multas,
venta de pliegas, venta de bienes, arrendamiento de tierras, etc.).

El Plan de Modernización fue Aprobado mediante Resolución del Honorable Directorio de la
APN N°74/07 Durante el desarrollo del Plan de Modernización se contrataron varias consultorías,
las mismas realizaron análisis de situación de la institución y entregaron informes finales, pero
nunca se concretó un Plan de Modernización. Durante 2006, se contrató una nueva consultoría
con fondos locales a la que se le encomendó sintetizar lo actuado y realizar un informe final que
incluya el Plan de Modernización. Este fue entregado a fines de 2006 y aprobado por el
Honorable Directorio en abril de 2007.

Productos del Componente

Diseño, Implementación y Aplicación de Monitoreo y Evaluación (M&E)
Componente A
Durante la etapa de implementación se identificaron satisfactoriamente un conjunto de
indicadores seguimiento y control que resultaron de gran utilidad para monitorear el avance del
Proyecto en sus diferentes etapas de ejecución. En todos los casos, los indicadores significaron
una fuente de información valiosa sobre la marcha del proyecto útil para la toma de decisiones,
pero principalmente sirvieron a los fines del monitoreo y seguimiento de la ejecución de la
aplicación de los fondos en referencia a los objetivos acordados con el prestamista. Los métodos
de recolección de datos fueron implementados y garantizados por la misma coordinación del
Proyecto mediante la generación interna de información, hecho que se tradujo en una satisfactoria
aplicación de los indicadores y en un producto final esperado.

El uso dado a los mecanismos diseñados para el monitoreo y evaluación del Proyecto ha sido
satisfactorio en cuanto a que sirvieron como guía y referencia para la asignación de tareas y la
planificación para el cumplimiento de los objetivos del proyecto. Se destaca la objetividad y
precisión metodológica de los acuerdos de M&E. La calidad y confiabilidad de los datos
utilizados, su recolección y posterior uso es altamente satisfactoria. Se destaca la apertura de la
información y la completitud de los datos proporcionados por la coordinación del proyecto a los
fines del Informes Final de Resultados.

Sostenibilidad de las Inversiones
Componente A
Se a generado un Plan de Sustentabilidad de las actividades del Componente A del Proyecto
concluido, el que pone de relieve un conjunto de propuestas de acciones para garantizar los logros
y extender los resultados de cada uno de los Subcomponentes. El personal afectado al proyecto ha
mantenido sus funciones para garantizar la permanencia de los resultados y el cumplimiento
definitivo de los acuerdos. A tal fin, se ha completado durante la ejecución del proyecto una serie
de actividades de capacitación y divulgación

Componente B
El proyecto ha permitido que la APN resulte fortalecida significativamente, ya sea por la cantidad
y calidad de información que administra sobre los parques nacionales argentinos, como por el
proceso de participación. Es necesario mencionar que otro aspecto importante que impacto al
Cambio Institucional en forma positiva fue el incremento de los trabajadores en los distintos
parques. Progresivamente se ha notado un incremento en la cantidad de trabajadores en cada uno
de los parques.

Lecciones Aprendidas
Componente A
Cabe destacar que la participación de organizaciones, instituciones y actores privados afecta
positivamente la implementación del Proyecto y contribuye mejorando la posibilidad de extender
los resultados a todo el territorio nacional mediante los mecanismos de participación e incidencia
pública en la divulgación, toma de consciencia y cambio de cultura de la sociedad para con los
bosques nativos.

Componente B
La adecuada articulación de gestión entre la coordinación del Proyecto y las autoridades de línea
de la APN constituyó un factor determinante en la eficacia de la implementación en la etapa final
del proyecto. Otras lecciones incluyen: necesidad de una adecuada articulación entre el
Ministerio de Economía, la APN y la Jefatura de Gabinete de Ministros, así como el apoyo
político suficiente por parte de la APN; una unidad de implementación da agilidad por su pequeña

dimensión; pero en ocasiones hubo que contratar consultorías para la realización de proyectos,
generando las mismas altos costos y no siempre buenos productos; el Proyecto debe ser
consensuado de manera que los cambios políticos institucionales no afecten su normal desarrollo
y; necesidad de agilizar contrataciones y adquisiciones entre el Banco y APN.
