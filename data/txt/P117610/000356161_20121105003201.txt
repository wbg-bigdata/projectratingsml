F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The Program Development Objective of the programmatic series of three single-tranche
development policy credits was to improve the results of one of Vietnam‟s National
Targeted Programs for poverty reduction, Program to Reduce Poverty in Communes
Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and Mountainous Areas, known as Program
135 Phase 2 (P135-2), through strengthening four policy areas: (i) poverty targeting; (ii)
decentralization, participation and empowerment; (iii) fiduciary transparency and
accountability; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation.

  The First operation established the basic legal and administrative framework for
pursuing the policy reform agenda under P135-2. The prior actions in this case were
primarily policy and institutional actions for strengthening community-level ownership
over the planning, execution, management and construction supervision, and operation
and maintenance of basic infrastructure investments. The Second operation followed an
objective stock-taking of overall program progress through the mid-term review, and
emphasized policy actions in the areas which were assessed as requiring additional clarity
to strengthen implementation or push forward policy actions which have experienced
some delay. The Third operation, supported additional areas of policy and institutional
actions identified through the mid-term review in areas not anticipated in the original
policy matrix, to accelerate progress, particularly at the subnational level, towards
achievement of results in the final years of P135-2.

  According to the ICR Guidelines, a single ICR is prepared for a programmatic DPL, on
completion of the program and after the closing of the last operation in a prespecified
series. However, this ICR focuses on DPC2 and DPC3. This is because the first ICR was
prepared in 2009 after the first operation as the second operation was presented to the
Board of Directors of the World Bank more than 24 months (26 months) after the
presentation of the first operation.

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
There were no changes in the PDO. At the beginning of the P135-2 implementation
period, a five-year policy matrix or results framework was established jointly with the
Government and participating development partners. It was modified based on the
findings of annual joint reviews.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Vietnam has achieved remarkable development success over the last 25 years. Reforms
introduced in 1986 have transformed the country from a centrally planned to a market oriented
economy. At a macro level, Vietnam has aggressively pursued a trade-led growth strategy with
increase in exports and imports as a proportion of GDP. This has spurred rapid economic growth
(averaging 7.3 percent during 1990-2010), and significant poverty reduction. In the years
preceding the second and third operation, however, Vietnam has found it more difficult to
maintain high levels of growth with macroeconomic stability. This is in part due to its deeper
integration into global markets with World Trade Organization accession in 2007 and the 2008
domestic and global crises. A timely stimulus package however helped to cushion the adverse
impact of the crisis. After registering real GDP growth of 5.3 percent in 2009, its economy grew
by an estimated 6.8 percent in 2010.

At the time of appraisal of the second and third operations, the overall poverty rates had
continued declining, with the much slower progress for ethnic minorities. In 2008, 14.5
percent of the population remained below the poverty line. However, poverty has increasingly
become a phenomenon among ethnic minorities, who make up nearly 15 percent of the
population. In 2008, over 40 percent of the remaining poor were ethnic minority households;
nearly half of ethnic minority households still lived below the poverty line, compared to only 9
percent of Kinh/Hoa majority households. By 2010, when the Development Policy Credit 3
(DPC3) was appraised, ethnic minorities accounted for 65 percent of individuals in the poorest
welfare decile, up from 53 percent in 2006. Government efforts to accelerate poverty reduction in
these areas had focused on increasing the flow of central government funding to the poorest
provinces and districts through National Targeted Programs (NTPs). One of the most significant
ones was the Program to Reduce Poverty in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic
Minority and Mountainous Areas, known as Program 135 (P135).

Government’s Program 135 sought to address regional disparities in access to basic services
and markets that could be effectively carried out in remote locations. P135 was coordinated
by the Committee for Ethnic Minorities (CEM), The Government‟s lead agency for ethnic
minority affairs whose role was evolving towards coordination of development support targeted
to these communities. At the same time, however, responsibility and capacity for direct
implementation remained largely with the line agencies and provinces. For the second five-year
phase for P135 (P135-2), the Government aimed to increase its effectiveness so as to both
accelerate poverty reduction and improve the capacity of poor communes to assume their
responsibilities under Vietnam‟s decentralized fiscal system. Over the five years, P135-2 covered
1,958 communes and 3,274 villages facing extreme hardship in 369 out of 690 districts in 50 out
of 63 provinces in Vietnam.

The Wolrd Bank’s programmatic series of policy lending operations was identified as an
effective vehicle for the coordination of development partner support for the intended
reforms in Vietnam’s NTPs for poverty reduction. The experiences from donor supported
projects utilizing community-driven development (CDD) approaches - to strengthen local
participation in investment planning, implementation and oversight - were generally viewed as
successful by both the Government and donors. This led to increased interest in means to
“mainstream? these approaches into Government‟s NTPs and decentralized fiscal systems which

                                               1
were channeling several times the amount of donor financed resources to the poorest districts in
the country. Based on joint donor-Government reviews of the NTPs, P135 was identified as a
suitable mechanism for direct donor support and introduction of the lessons learned from smaller
investment projects into the national poverty reduction agenda. The operations were jointly
prepared with three bilateral donors - Australia, Finland and Ireland - who provided parallel
financing and technical assistance (TA) through bilateral agreements with the Government. In
addition, the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) also provided parallel TA, and the European Union (EU) and
Switzerland also joined in providing financial support in the last year of P135-2 implementation.
Department for International Development (United Kingdom) provided budget support for the
P135-2 during the DPC1 and remained engaged in policy dialogue during DPC2 and some parts
of DPC3. UNICEF maintained active role in policy discussions and participated in Joint Program
Reviews throughout the implementation but without financial commitment. All partners were
active members of the Partnership Committee (PC) and all financiers used the common operation
policy matrix as a basis for disbursements.

The series of operations in support of P135-2 was designed to complement and build on
both the Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs) and investment operations. At the
time of the identification of the programmatic series, the Bank was working closely with the
Government to support Vietnam‟s Poverty Reduction Strategy Process and its implementation
through a series of PRSCs. At the same time, the Bank was financing two major CDD projects –
the Community Based Rural Infrastructure Project (CBRIP), and the Northern Mountains Poverty
Reduction Project (NMPRP) – both of which had been considered successful in introducing more
participatory and transparent implementation processes in communes and villages of poorer
provinces. The programmatic series was meant to bridge the gap between the macro-reform
agenda of the PRSCs and the micro-level of investment operations by supporting policy and
institutional actions that would deepen and mainstream the reforms targeted at the needs of ethnic
minorities concentrated in the poorest, remote areas of the country. After a considerable internal
discussion on whether to channel support through a traditional specific investment credit or
budget support instrument, the Government and the development community agreed that policy-
based budget support, complemented by parallel technical assistance (TA), was the most
promising financing modality to help bring about the outcomes P135-2 was designed to achieve.

The series was fully aligned with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2007-2011.
The CPS was based on the Government‟s SEDP (2006-2010), which the Bank and other donors
recognized as embodying the main principles of a poverty reduction strategy, including a clear
results orientation. The proposed series was most strongly aligned with the second CPS pillar -
„Strengthen social inclusion‟ - under which it directly addressed two CPS outcomes of „better
access to services and infrastructure for the rural poor‟, and „ethnic minorities in rural areas more
fully integrated into development processes‟. It was also meant to contribute to the fourth CPS
pillar - „strengthened governance systems‟ - particularly with respect to the outcome „modernized
planning towards development objectives, with more participatory approaches.‟

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO of the Bank’s programmatic series, and thus both DPC2 and DPC3, was to improve the
results of one of Vietnam‟s National Targeted Programs for poverty reduction, the Program for
Socio-Economic Development in Communes Facing Extreme Hardship in Ethnic Minority and
Mountainous Areas, 2006-2010 (known as „Program 135 Phase 2‟ or P135-2), through
strengthening four policy areas: (i) poverty targeting; (ii) decentralization, participation and
empowerment; (iii) fiduciary transparency and accountability; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation.

                                                 2
This ICR focuses on assessing the extent to which the above mentioned PDO and outcomes for
13 policy actions associated with four policy areas were achieved, or are expected to be achieved
(with a focus on performance under DPC2 & DPC3). It is meant to complement the ICR that was
prepared for DPC1 of the same series.

Key Outcome Indicators

Policy Area 1: Poverty Targeting. Number of provinces with pro-poor criteria for allocating
resources amongst communes: Baseline (DPC1): 0, (DPC2): 41, (DPC3): 47, Target: 47.1

Policy Area 2: Decentralization, Participation & Empowerment. Percentage of P135-2
communes which act as investment owners for at least a significant share of program investments.
Baseline (DPC1): 30 %, (DPC2): 60%, (DPC3): 65%; Target: 70%2

Policy Area 3: Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability. Ensure adequate oversight of
public funds through independent audits, covering both operational and financial aspects, as
indicated by public disclosure of audit results at national and local levels, and documentation of
follow up actions taken. Baseline (DPC1): No operational audits conducted in VN by State Audit
Authority for a National Targeted Program. (DPC2): Financial and operational audit carried out
and publicly disclosed in ten provinces and follow up action reports for eight provinces covered
by 2007 audit. (DPC3) Financial and operational audit carried out and publicly disclosed in 18
provinces by 2009 audit and follow up action report for ten provinces prepared by audit
coordination group led by CEM. Target: Financial and operational audit carried out covering at
least 18 provinces and publically disclosed and follow-up actions reports for 14 provinces
covered by 2009 audit.

Policy Area 4: Monitoring and Evaluation. Randomized survey approach with baseline and
control group and citizen report cards used to assess progress and beneficiary satisfaction to
inform program improvements: Baseline (DPC1): No use of citizen report card or other
participatory monitoring tools. (DPC2): Baseline survey and introduction of citizen report cards
used to identify areas for program strengthening. (DPC3): Aligned Monitoring Tool (AMT)
reports and improved routine reports used as inputs to joint progress review mission. Target: End
of project survey and citizen report cards used as key elements of final evaluation report

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators

No formal revision of PDO was done during Program implementation. However, following the
MTR, as the baseline data became available, the key indicators were reviewed and some
measurable indicators were revised/added to allow for clearer, more quantitative assessment of
progress towards objectives. As a result, the program matrix was revised and reflected in the
program documents for DPC2. Further adjustments in outcome indicators and target values were
made in the policy matrix for DPC3 (Annex 3, pp. 50-52).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

                                                   3
Of the thirteen specific areas, or objectives, agreed in the four policy areas, eight had specific
prior actions for DPC 2 and DPC3.

Policy Area I: Poverty Targeting. The actions supported by the Program under this policy area
aimed at addressing the weaknesses in poverty targeting identified under P135 by making the
selection of eligible communes, villages and households for inclusion under P135-2 (targeting in
program design) as well as the criteria used for targeting program resources to participating
communes, villages and households (targeting in program resource allocation and
implementation) – more pro-poor, verifiable and transparent. This area also included the policy
actions aimed at enhancements in sustainability of program investments and provision of
production/livelihood support.

Commune, Village and Household Selection. Under P135-1, provinces utilized a broad range of
mechanisms, often without sufficient poverty targeting focus, to qualify participating communes,
villages and households for program support. As a prior action for DPC1, the Government issued
Decision 393/2005/QD-UBDT which introduced verifiable, poverty-based criteria for selection of
commune and villages under P135-2. More specifically, the criteria developed by the Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs (MOLISA) were adapted and used by all provinces as a common and
verifiable basis to determine poverty incidence and thus, qualification of communes and districts
for support under P135-2. The follow-up actions under DPC2 and DPC3 focused on adjustments
in the selection criteria (based on the evidence from the MTR) and on requirements for their
publication.

Program Resource Allocation. Under P135-1, each participating commune was uniformly
allocated VND 500 million per year (equivalent to approximately US$50,000 at the rate during
1998-2005), irrespective of population size, and levels of remoteness or poverty. The evaluations
of P135-1 showed that investments were primarily directed at infrastructure in or close to
commune centers, and so did not necessarily benefit the more remote or poorer villages. There
was therefore a recognized need for greater transparency in establishing the decision-making
criteria for resource allocation, and improvements in targeting of household level housing and
production support elements in Phase 2. In response, the Government introduced inter-ministerial
circular 676/2006 a policy requirement that by 2007, provinces develop and implement
transparent, verifiable formula for allocation of resources amongst participating communes and
villages based, in part, on the number of poor households. The policy actions supported under two
subsequent operations were directed at ensuring the implementation and monitoring of the newly
introduced allocation criteria.

Enhancing Sustainability of Program Investment. No Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
budget allocation was made under any NTP or other investment operations prior to P135-2. O&M
was expected to be carried out on the basis of local contributions without mandating specific
support from districts or provinces, largely resulting in poor maintenance. This was particularly
challenging for poor communities in upland areas where O&M involves higher cost due to
erosion and rock slide vulnerability and the adverse impacts of extreme weather events. In order
to improve maintenance and increase returns to infrastructure investments, the Government
introduced the concept of dedicated O&M funding into the design of P135-2, and in 2007, O&M
groups with recognized legal status were to be formed in participating communes and villages,
and a clear plan with monitoring actions formulated on measures to build their capacity. In 2008,
CEM issued the O&M funding policy allocating 6.3% of the annual infrastructure component
budget for O&M. In the same year, Government, for the first time under a Targeted Program,
allocated this funding to provinces, which was a prior action for DPC2.


                                                4
Pro-Poor Orientation of Production/Livelihoods Support. Support to production, particularly
agriculture, under P135 and other Government programs in the uplands areas had traditionally
focused on provision of subsidized inputs based on the decisions of the district or provincial
agricultural extension staff. Due to some reluctance in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development to move away from the food self-sufficiency approach, and in the process of policy
matrix formulation, the debate became confused as a conflict between belief in food security
versus market orientation. Consequently, and as a prior action under DPC2, MARD prepared a
circular clarifying relevant implementation aspects particularly regarding the use of funds for
investment costs and cost-sharing requirements, and, with IFAD assistance, technical manuals to
further detail how livelihoods support may be provided in different ecological and market
environments. Roll-out of these manuals and related training was monitored as a benchmark in
2010.

Policy Area II: Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment. These policy and
institutional reforms were intended to deepen the participatory nature of the fiscal
decentralization process in the poor areas covered by P135-2. The reforms drew upon a
combination of international good practice and experience from projects in Vietnam.

Informed Public Participation in Program Planning and Management. Although Vietnam
has a well-developed planning and budgeting system which starts at the local level, the ability of
citizens to participate in the process is limited in the poorer villages and communes, particularly
amongst women, by linguistic differences as many if not most people speak primarily ethnic
minority languages. To increase participation in P135-2 planning and decision making, the
Government developed a communication strategy in 2007 to guide planning and implementation
of communication activities under P135-2. Subsequent policy actions in this area included
dissemination of communication materials in five principal ethnic minority languages;
participation of people in the progress reports; and issuance of Manual on Participatory Planning,
including guidelines for participatory O&M, and minimum percentage requirement of women‟s
participation at 30%.

Devolution of Investment Ownership. Under P135-1, only around 15 percent of the 2,200
participating communes took on the role of commune investment ownership (CIO) - referring to
primary responsibility for the planning, design, contracting, supervision, and O&M of basic
infrastructure investments. P135-2 was seen as a major vehicle to empower poor communes to
take on such roles and to ensure that investments undertaken in a specific commune, including
O&M, should be fully managed or “owned? by that commune. CEM developed specific guidance
to provinces on transparent criteria to be used to determine commune readiness for CIO, and CIO
responsibility was then extended to all P135-2 communes with prior experience with investment
management under State or ODA-financed projects (about 35% of program communes). In 2008,
Inter-Circular 01 included specific criteria for identifying communes for investment ownership as
well as criteria for targeting TA from the districts. Finally, technical task forces were to be
formed in selected provinces to accelerate the transfer of CIO to communes supported by P135-2.

Local Institutional Capacity-Building Support. While the Grassroots Democracy Decree
encourages participation and transparency in all local development activities, NTPs provided very
little or no dedicated funding for capacity development to support this objective. Support for
local-level institutional capacity-building was to be increased from less than 1 percent under
P135-1, to a minimum of 7 percent of total program cost of P135-2, which was in the Prime
Minister‟s Approval No. 206/TTgt-QHQT (dated February 8, 2007) as a prior action for DPC1,
and a capacity building plan was adopted in 2008. It was expected that over 70 percent of


                                                5
Program communes and villages would implement participatory investment plans and that
community supervision would be widely spread.

Policy Area III: Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability. The third policy area concerned
fiduciary transparency and accountability in P135-2 implementation. Drawing on experience
from other projects in Vietnam and international good practice, these sets of policy actions were
meant to complement the first two policy areas, since active and informed participation in public
investments can only be achieved where community groups are empowered to take on
appropriate procurement and social audit responsibilities.

Procurement for Small Scale Infrastructure. Evaluations of P135 investments indicate that
they are completed at lower unit-costs than similar public investments, and also that there is
further scope to improve the cost-effectiveness of investments made, particularly through the use
of more transparent and competitive public procurement methods. Moreover, it was noted that
opportunities to generate greater levels of local employment through the use of community
contracting methods were being missed. Provisions under P135-2 to introduce and promote these
methods, which are not explicitly covered by Vietnam‟s procurement law, were found to be
insufficiently clear to encourage their wide-spread use. Therefore, the series of operations
supported in 2008, the preparation of a procurement manual to guide the application of these
unfamiliar methods, and in 2009, the issuance of detailed instructions on community participation
procurement methods.

Public Financial Management – Financial Reporting. Given the multi-tiered level of financial
flows through Vietnam‟s decentralized fiscal system, transparent reporting is particularly
important to identify constraints and verify efficiency in resource flows. In order to provide a
clearer basis for monitoring and assessing resource flows under P135-2, The Government issued
Ministry of Finance (MOF) Guidance No. 2849 governing public financial management for
P135-2, and instructed MOF to prepare processes and procedures for fund flow reflecting the
provision of funds from the state budget to each spending agency at central, provincial, district
and commune levels, and quarterly financial reports and reconciliation of expenditures under
P135-2 between spending units and State Treasury (STV). In 2007, program-wide quarterly
expenditure and funds flow reports were to be issued, as well as six monthly reports on the
allocation, transfer and use of P135-2 funds to provincial level disclosed publicly on the MOF
website on regular basis.

Public Financial Management – Independent Audits. The Government‟s own auditor, the
State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) was recognized by donors as a capable and independent audit
authority, however the scope of its standard audits was considered to be insufficient to provide an
overall assessment of a highly decentralized and wide ranging program such as P135. Rather than
engage private auditors, donors indicated their preference to enhance the quality of SAV to build
capacity and establish good practice which could be applied to other programs. Accordingly, the
Government committed to strengthen SAV‟s audits for P135-2 by issuing and sharing with
donors a multi-year audit plan for P135-2 that provides for increasing the number of sample
provinces by 20% per year, submitting the final reports within six months of the end of the
audited year, and engaging independent external auditors as needed. In 2007, the first P135-2
audit would be completed, including at least 8 provinces, and then increased gradually up to
coverage of 18 provinces in 2009. The audits were to be publicly disclosed through the media and
SAV‟s website.

Community Contributions. Local contribution - often in-kind labor - has been the norm in most
programs in Viet Nam and Program 135 was not the exception. At the same time, it was

                                                6
recognized that in poor communes this requirement could be particularly burdensome for poor
families either as direct taxation of their limited cash incomes, or reducing the time available for
paid or self-employment labor. Further, experience under donor supported projects and other
public programs had demonstrated the value to the very poor of paid labor opportunities in public
works schemes. In order to address these issues more broadly, the Government stipulated in
Inter-Ministerial Circular 676 that such contributions should be affordable; the poorest
households should be exempted from compulsory cash contributions and that mechanisms should
be developed to promote paid local labor in civil works, with priority given to poor households in
respect of wage earning opportunities. By 2007, it was expected that at least 50% of infrastructure
investments under P135-2 would include local paid labor. Subsequently, the policy decision to
capture and monitor such local contributions so that the information collected from the grass-
roots level can be used in the future policy-making was agreed to as a prior action for DPC3.

Policy Area IV: Monitoring and Evaluation. The policy area on M&E was intended to address
the concern that the lack of an efficient monitoring and evaluation system not only hindered
project management at the central levels, but that it also decreased opportunities for downward
accountability. A sound M&E system could empower decentralized levels of government to serve
their constituents, by communicating the real needs and priorities of villages upwards to higher
levels of government to feed into policy decisions that would reflect the realities and needs on the
ground. The primary goal was to strengthen the results-focus under P135-2.

Impact Evaluation. NTPs in Vietnam had yet to implement statistically rigorous impact surveys
to evaluate their programs, although other forms of performance evaluations are common.
Assessments tend to focus on output information. P135-1, although considered successful by the
Government, could not refer to any rigorous analysis on its impact on the livelihoods of poor
ethnic minorities. Internal and external reviews were not based on program relevant data, and
drew largely on ex-post studies. As the effectiveness of P135-2 was a shared concern of both
Government and donors, a set of outcome indicators and an overall M&E framework were agreed
and adopted by the Government. Further, the Government, through its statistical service, had
significantly improved its capacity for poverty diagnostics, and a baseline survey was designed
which included a matched control group which would be completed in 2007.

Process Monitoring. Progress information is routinely collected under NTPs in Vietnam.
However, there have been few experiences with a standardized, computerized MIS database
tracking process as wells as inputs and outputs. This has made it difficult for the government to
monitor program processes and effectiveness. Lack of evidence to support claims of poverty
reduction under Program 135-1 strongly underlined the need to have an effective monitoring
system in place to support project reporting and management. Under Phase 1 of the program, no
efforts were made to monitor processes such as rates of participation among different ethnic
groups, income groups etc. Ensuring the effectiveness of program targeting and that resources are
reaching the intended beneficiaries was impeded by this lack of monitoring.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

There were no revisions to policy areas.

1.6 Other significant changes

Originally, the three single tranches for each of the policy-based lending operations were planned
to be of equal amount, US$50 million. However, the amount for the second operation was
increased from the originally planned US$50 million to US$100 million as a part of the response

                                                 7
to the government‟s request to support the financing of its stimulus program in the midst of the
global financial crisis, as well to support additional actions identified through the MTR and ICR
process to reinforce the reform agenda.

Based on the lessons learned during the period covered by DPC1 and from the MTR, GoV and its
development partners have placed emphasis on support at the provincial and district levels to
strengthen understanding and capacity to implement reforms, and to ensure effective reporting
and utilization of the M&E system, as reflected in the revised policy matrix included in DPC2
and DPC3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

In the design phase, a 5-year policy matrix or results framework was established jointly
with the Government and participating development partners. The policy matrix used a
limited set of conditions as prior actions (9) across the 13 selected policy actions in 12 policy
areas, plus 8 additional monitoring actions to gauge overall program progress. Several outcome
indicators and target values were modified in DPC2 & DPC3 based on the findings of annual
JPRs; however, the policy areas remained unchanged throughout the series. The matrix also
included actions that some bilateral donor partners used as conditions for disbursement in the
alternate years between the joint operations also supported by the Bank.

Government achieved all of the prior actions recognized by DPC2 & DPC3. DPC2 was
approved on May 21, 2009, and became effective on October 5, 2009. DPC3 was approved on
April 26, 2011, and became effective on August 29, 2011. Overall, there was little variation
between the triggers identified and prior actions required to have the next DPL approved. The
implementation of the reform agenda was generally positive and consistent with achievement of
the end of program outcomes, though the pace of reform was delayed and uneven across different
areas. This was primarily due to initial challenges in program coordination amongst the multiple
implementing agencies resulting, inter alia, in a prolonged process of revising Inter-Circular 676
governing program implementation, as well as delays in deploying TA to national and sub-
national levels.

The originally planned phasing of individual operations in the series was delayed. DPC2 was
processed 26 months after DPC1, and DPC3 23 months after the second operation. The
government Program 135-2 closed in December 2010 as planned. As a successor to DPC2, the
third operation was processed as a budgetary support after the GoV program closed to reward the
policy achievements that were made.

Both DPC2 and DPC3 were single-tranche operations. DPC2 was fully disbursed on
November 10, 2009 and DPC3 was fully disbursed on November 29, 2011. The main funding
source for the implementation of P135-2 was the state budget, including central budget sources
(which accounted for 70-75 percent of all state budget resources for P135-2), resources from
provinces, and those from local people‟s contributions. When P135-2 closed in 2010, it has
budgeted about US$715 million (exchange rate of US$=19,600 in 2010), and disbursed US$694
million (97 percent) over five years. Donor funded budget support was equivalent to nearly 50
percent (or US$ 355 million [at exchange rates used at November 2010]) of total Program
funding. Once approved, the fund disbursements were processed by the GoV in an efficient
manner and both operations were closed on time.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Government at all levels maintained a strong political consensus and commitment to P135-
2 as a core instrument for poverty reduction throughout the Program implementation.
P135-2 has been viewed as one of the most successful programs for poverty reduction in Vietnam.
The State budget was the basis of the Program budget, mobilizing financial support and TA from
development partners as well as the community contributions. In addition, the Government has
included P135-2 in the National Assembly‟s annual plan for oversight and evaluation, and
demonstrated openness to adjusting the policy actions for each new DPC according to
implementation experiences.

The increased macroeconomic instability due to the 2008 domestic and global crises
emerged as one of the risks facing the last two operations. The crisis exposed Vietnam‟s
vulnerability to external shocks at both the macroeconomic and household level. Even so, growth
has remained strong through the crisis thanks to the sizable stimulus package. The Bank provided
timely support to Vietnam to address the impact of the crisis, including through the increased
amount of funding under DPC2, which allowed the Government to maintain its commitments
under P135-2 and continue delivering support to the poorest areas.

Some policy reforms agreed by the Government at the central level and development
partners often lacked local leadership and were not seen as priority at implementation
levels. The outcomes of the policy matrix were not reflected in the Government‟s own „roadmap‟
for provincial implementation, which featured a different set of indicators. Hence, there was little
or no familiarity with the policy matrix below the national level. As a result, decentralized levels
paid less attention to implementing policies that were not contributing directly to achievements of
outcomes defined in the Program‟s own results framework.

Capacity risks were initially correctly identified but remained the main factor in
constraining effective implementation of the program. Weak institutional capacity at local
levels was further exacerbated by the restructuring of CEM with the abolishment of its sections at
district and commune levels in 2008. This was a significant change, which made it more difficult
for provinces to implement commitments made at central level. In 2010, the decision was taken at
national level to reinstate the District Ethnic Board. The DPC series aimed to address the capacity
constraints through issuance of user-friendly manuals and guidelines, as well as setting up
taskforces at sub-national levels with TA from development partners to assist the activities, but
due to finite resources only 11 provinces under the Program benefitted from this support. Greater
TA coverage of provinces would have contributed to smoother implementation of Program
activities.

Delays in delivery of complementary TA slowed down the implementation of policy actions
at subnational levels. It was envisaged that the parallel TA support would be instrumental in
taking the process forward at province level. However, the arrangements for a large part of the
TA package (from IrishAID and Finland) were finalized only towards the end of the Program,
leaving only one year for TA delivery. The late start of formulation of national guidelines
contributed to a slow delivery of TA personnel on the ground. This had an impact on Program
administration and implementation, including the implementation of the M&E framework system,
and the writing and dissemination of guidance, circulars and training materials. Another challenge

                                                   10
was multiple PMUs for separate TA projects by DPs in support of the Program, which made the
management and coordination for CEM more cumbersome and made central management and
coordination difficult. Program 135-2 Coordination Office under CEM together with different TA
developed annual Joint TA Plans to help coordinating better different TA activities but due to
different mechanism applied under each TA, achieving effective synergy was still a challenge.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E Design. As a whole, the 13 outcomes in the matrix capture important elements in the
support towards achieving the PDO, although the individual outcomes are not always well
defined. A number of original outcome indicators were revised in the DPC2 policy matrix, as
they did not readily allow for measurement of progress. At that time, the baseline survey and the
program mid-term review had taken place, which helped inform the choice and targets of new and
revised indicators. Although they represent a significant improvement over the original indicators,
some of the indicators in the DPC2 and DPC3 policy matrix could still have been improved to
better capture the achievements made in each policy area. A few of the indicators suffer from
unclear logic between prior actions, triggers and benchmarks to final outcome. Some disconnect
can be observed between the qualitative description of the indicators and the quantitative baseline
and end of survey goals stated.

The collection method could have been more diversified. In many cases the results on outcome
achievement rely too heavily on the outcome of the end of program impact evaluation survey,
rather than program monitoring data, external reviews or thematic studies. More emphasis could
have been placed on regular monitoring of project outputs to help management assess progress
and identify obstacles to implementation. The M&E system was designed by the Government
with the help of development partners and hired consultants, and was under the overall
responsibility of CEM.

M&E Implementation. Government and development partners for P135-2 engaged through a
Partnership Committee which ensured that reporting, supervision and policy dialogue are
streamlined and standardized to minimize the incremental demands on implementing agencies.
All partners participated in an annual JPR exercise as part of a consensus-based approach to
assess the progress and identify changes needed. This engagement was led by the Government,
with rotating donor coordination.

The Aligned Monitoring Tool (AMT) chosen as the program‟s MIS proved to be challenging to
implement at decentralized levels. The tool itself and the many indicators it contained were
unfamiliar to staff at local levels. Design of the MIS could have been improved had the system
been based on traditional reporting at local levels using existing indicators with which local
officials were familiar, and introducing new indicators only where essential to monitor progress
towards outcomes. A thorough baseline survey was conducted in 2007, with a final report
available in November 2008. The survey consulted a large sample of households in P135-2
communes, and created an appropriate control group from similar communes targeted by P135-2.
An end of program survey was also conducted, and preliminary results from this were made
available in June 2012. Both surveys were conducted after significant delays.

The AMT was also implemented late. Training of trainers was initiated in October 2008, and only
subsequently did provinces and districts start using the system. At the time of the final JPR, only
22 out of 50 provinces were using the system, and 11 provinces were able to use the system fully.
The JPR missions conducted in both 2008 and 2010 found that local levels would report planning
data instead of reporting on implemented activities. By the end of program, consolidated reports

                                                11
were not available at the central level, although a report containing data from the 22 participating
provinces was produced in 2010. Lack of follow-up on citizen report cards resulted in limited
information available on beneficiary satisfaction with program investments.

M&E Utilization. Despite these challenges, considerable progress has been made given the very
limited prior experiences with M&E in government programs. The baseline data and MTR
findings were used to adjust the indicators and make a number of policy actions more focused.
CEM put substantial effort into promoting the MIS tool throughout the program provinces.
Sufficient capacity was not built all the way down to commune level, but gaps in knowledge and
major obstacles were identified and are currently being addressed by CEM in preparation for
follow-up programs. The extent of progress made in provinces that received TA from the
development partners should also be recognized and used to guide future programs.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

In October 2010, the Government established an overall Poverty Reduction Framework as an
umbrella NTP for the period of 2011-2015, incorporating all major poverty reduction programs
such as the 30A program, P135 Phase 3, the program to support poor coastal communes, and the
national vocational training program. Discussions about the division of institutional
responsibilities under this Framework are still ongoing. The current proposal would have CEM
(under P135-3) focus its future support on infrastructure development while other entities (i.e.,
MARD and MOLISA) would support livelihoods improvements. Some elements of P135-2, such
as the promotion of CPP methods, and use of an open menu for small-scale infrastructure
investments (which has been shown to enhance allocation efficiencies), are expected to be used in
other NTPs. The Government has also recently established a Central Steering Committee for
Sustainable Poverty Reduction in the 2011-2020 period with both CEM and MOLISA as the
Committee‟s Vice Chairs.3 The Bank will continue to closely engage with the Government as it
refines the follow-up activities.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives and overall design of the Program, and thus of DPC2 and DPC3, remained
consistent with the Government and Bank’s development priorities and strategies that were
updated at the time of the ICR. In particular, the policy areas are consistent with the continued
focus on social equity and structural reforms under the recently approved Vietnam‟s Socio-
Economic Development Strategy (SEDS) 2011-2020, and SEDP 2011-2015. They are also
aligned with the Bank‟s new CPS 2012-2016 pillar on „broadening access to social and
economic opportunity’ and the related outcomes of „increased opportunities for the poor and
household resilience to shocks‟ and „improved basic infrastructure and public service delivery‟ as
well as all three cross-cutting themes: (i) „strengthening governance, (ii) promoting gender
equality, and (iii) improving resilience in the face of external economic shocks, natural hazards,
and the impact of climate change.

Over time, the focus of the two last operations was directed at actions identified as needing
additional emphasis to advance the reform agenda. While the PDO remained the same
throughout the series, the benchmarks and prior actions underwent minor adjustments in DPC2
and DPC3 to reflect better the situation and needs on the ground as the implementation
progressed. The DPC2 prior actions included revised policy and supporting procedures in areas
such as production support and competitiveness of local procurement to permit more effective
implementation by provinces, districts and communes, as well as strengthening of the monitoring
and oversight functions at the central level; while DPC3 put special emphasis on sub-national
levels following the MTR. In summary, the focus of the DPC series has been on reform agendas
central to Vietnam‟s poverty reduction and development efforts and supported by the B ank team
in these areas.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Objective 1: Strengthened Poverty Targeting

Overall, the rating for the achievement of this objective is moderately satisfactory.

Commune, Village and Household Selection. P135-2 beneficiary selection and fund allocation
methodology have been successful areas of government and donor collaboration. DPC1 made the
push for improved pro-poor targeting, the enforcement of which was tracked through DPC2 and
DPC3. The adopted criteria for inclusion were verifiable and transparent, and included poverty-
based measures (e.g. percentage of poor households according to the official poverty line) in
addition to geographical characteristics (e.g. topography, accessibility) and demographic
attributes. By the end of the Program, 46 out of 504 provinces were applying improved targeting
mechanisms, while the target for this outcome was that all provinces would do that. The list of
eligible communes was reviewed annually to identify communes that have met Program
objectives and can „graduate‟ from P135-2, i.e. are no longer considered the poorest communes
(2007 benchmark). It was anticipated that the number of communes in the program would
progressively decrease over time. However, between 2006 and 2010, 314 communes have been
added to the Program, while only 181 communes have graduated from P135-2. The
Government‟s Final Report lists several reasons for this. The total number of communes and
villages participating in the Program has increased through the Program period, from 1,644
communes in 2006, to 1,848 communes in 2010. In 2007, 2008, and 2009, 69 communes fell
back into poverty and 250 communes further were selected to enter the list of program communes
after the administrative division of the existing communes as per Government Decrees. At the
same time, P135-2 resources were insufficient to reach all villages in the commune and due to the
low investment norms and large needs, the infrastructure remains weak and the number of near-
poor households remains high. The DPC3 benchmark calling for publicizing of the list of
beneficiaries of Program support at the commune and village offices was met as commune
authorities were aware of this obligation, and posted information about infrastructure investments
at the commune office and at construction sites. In summary, the expected outcome of improved
poverty targeting has been largely achieved.

 At the beginning of the program 135-2, there were only 47 provinces in the program. After 5 years of
operation, GoV/CEM added more communes that met the program criteria. This increased the number of
provinces that have communes participating in the program from 47 to 50.


                                                  13
Program Resource Allocation. Forty one out of 50 provinces have issued criteria for budget
allocation by which higher norms were applied for more disadvantaged communes and villages.
While the allocation of P135-2 funds from provinces to district and commune levels was done on
a „pro-poor‟ basis, the 2010 JPR raised the concern that the commune officials appeared to still
prefer distributing Program support to beneficiaries on an equal basis rather than planning support
to households based upon their needs. Infrastructure investments were largely made in
accordance with the commune SEDP, and local people‟s priorities, as expressed through village
meetings, were only one of the inputs that the communes needed to take into consideration in
preparation of the plans. According to the Government‟s Final Report on P135-2, the Program
financed 12,646 infrastructure schemes in total – giving an average of around 6.3 schemes per
commune; while the average number of villages per commune is around 10 . Infrastructure
schemes also benefit one or more villages in different ways according to the type of infrastructure.
This exemplifies the negotiated aspect of the local planning process, which inevitably involves
trade-offs between village, commune and district priorities. In summary, the expected outcome of
improved pro-poor resource allocation has been largely achieved.
Enhancing Sustainability of Program Investment. The creation of a central budget line for
Operation & Maintenance (O&M) was another area of success. The approval of allocation of
6.3% of infrastructure investment funds to O&M and the O&M Manual published present
landmark legislation supported under DPC2 and DPC3. Since 2008, equivalent to 6.3% of the
total budget for infrastructure development has been allocated to localities, and O&M activities
covered about 5-7% of the completed infrastructure schemes. However, the findings from JPRs
and the ICR mission suggest the fund is often not being operated as intended. Since the needs for
infrastructure are greater than the funds available, O&M funds were often used for upgrading and
major rehabilitation of works, and even for construction of school buildings and roads. The
„preventative‟ approach of O&M to occasionally undertake routine maintenance has not been
well understood or institutionalized on the ground. Districts largely remain the investment owner
for O&M instead of communes as intended. There has been no systematic preparation or
monitoring of O&M plans for P135-2 infrastructure, or review of improvements in quality of
maintenance, which makes it difficult to assess the final outcome under this policy area which
asked for maintenance plans to be prepared for all implemented projects and quality of
maintenance to improve. The Prime Minister approved the extension of O&M fund allocations
for 2011, and the overall progress made in this area is seen as satisfactory given the novelty of the
reform and the demands on the ground. In summary, the expected outcome of enhanced
sustainability of Program investments has been partially achieved.
Pro-Poor Orientation of Production/Livelihood Support. Production support was one of the
key activities of P135-2; however, the implementation of the intended policy changes has been
challenging. The jointly agreed outcome in the policy matrix was “poor upland households
increase incomes and diversify livelihoods in a sustainable, market responsive manner as
indicated by changes in crop agricultural income and increased share of non-rice income.?
However, in practice, the Program has continued to heavily subsidize agricultural production
inputs for the poor, reflecting the initial debate between the development partners and MARD
around food security versus market orientation, which continued throughout the implementation.
The outcome indicator for this policy area in DPC2 was identified as „crop income 8,000
VDN/month or average for region‟ and then was adjusted in the DPC3 to „average income per
capita/year > VND 3.5 million/year at 70 percent.‟ According to the 2010 Government‟s Final
Report, this target has been achieved with over 70 percent of households having an average
income per capita of VND 4.2 million/year (compiling from provincial repors). However. the IE
survey results show that 41.1 percent of households in P135-2 areas have an annual income
higher than VND3.5 million, which means that this target was not achieved. Nevertheless, it is

                                                 14
difficult to establish a direct causal link between the Program interventions and the increase in
income. The 2012 endline survey results point out that only 37 percent of surveyed households
think that P135 has helped increase income and 30 percent that it has helped increase agricultural
productivity. Furthermore, it is not possible to assess if the target of 30 percent women
participation in production activities was achieved due to the unavailability of data.

Another important aspect that should be examined is the extent to which the program has been
able to adapt the repertoire of agricultural technologies and extension models to suit the particular
needs and conditions of poor ethnic minority farmers. The share of households that use
agricultural services has increased significantly (from 32 percent in 2007 to 71 in 2012), yet the
satisfaction with agricultural extension has declined significantly (from 89 percent in 2007 to 61
in 2012). The 2010 JPR concludes that there was a low take-up of agricultural demonstration
models, suggesting they were not always suitable to local needs, and the production element
overall remained prescriptive, with little flexibility for communes in setting the criteria for
activities locally or in promoting off-farm activities. These shortcomings are indicative of broader
constraints in the agricultural extension system, which still focuses on establishing demonstration
models, combined with technical training and subsidized inputs. DARD‟s effectiveness in
supervising the production support activities proved to be limited. Lastly, a weak point in design
was the lack of any triggers and only one policy action related to livelihoods. The Government
allocated a much greater share of the total program budget for P135-2 to livelihoods support than
was the case under Phase 1 (from less than 4 percent in P135-1 to 20 percent in P135-2), yet the
Program provided little leverage on it. In summary, the intended outcome in this policy area has
not been achieved.

Objective 2: Decentralization, Participation and Empowerment

Overall, the achievement of these outcomes can be seen as moderately satisfactory.

Informed Public Participation in Program Planning and Management. The approach and
implementation modalities of P135-2 provided an enabling environment for participation in
general, and improved access to information and inclusiveness. CEM issued Participatory
Planning Manual in August 2010, including the participatory O&M, which was a Prior Action for
DPC3. 5 The levels of participation in village meetings in which infrastructure projects were
selected have increased significantly from 57 percent in 2007 to 81 in 2012, exceeding the target
of 70 percent. Thirty-seven percent of households in the P135-2 areas stated in 2012 that they
gave ideas on project selection and 26 percent felt that their ideas were taken on board (compared
to 14 and 8 percent respectively in 2007). Ninety-two percent of respondents stated that they were
satisfied with the project selection, overshooting the target of 80 percent. The second part of this
outcome indicator (“effective coordination of NTPs and other forms of public action at commune
level?) is difficult to assess, as no information is available to evaluate changes in effectiveness in
terms of coordination of different public actions at the commune level as a result of P135-2.
While people‟s participation in the program was largely considered informed and inclusive,
concerns have been raised about the quality of their participation. The 2010 JPR states that
people‟s participation “could be described as consultation at best?6, while the Government‟s Final
Report says that the quality of participation was not always high, and in some places „the

principles of democracy and openness have only been exercised in a superficial manner.‟7 Neither
document provides an in-depth analysis of this issue, so it is difficult to assess why and under
what circumstances quality of participation was compromised. In summary, the expected
outcome of enhanced public participation has been achieved.

Devolution of Investment Ownership. The issuance of clear criteria for identifying communes
for investment ownership was supported under DPC2. DPC3 called for formation of technical
taskforces in selected provinces drawing from provincial and district technical staff to help speed
up the transfer of CIO to communes supported by P135-2. At the end of 2010, task forces had
been set up in 17 provinces, including the 11 provinces with TA projects, with clear TORs
defined to help communes in the role of investment owners. By 2010, out of 1,848 communes in
the program, 69.5 percent were acting as investment owners for infrastructure works and 77.6
percent for the production support project, with 86.1 percent for the combined infrastructure and
production support.8 The target of 70 percent agreed in the policy matrix was therefore achieved.
These are positive results; however, they should be interpreted with caution because there is a
wide spectrum of commune capacity. In some cases, the communes have been assigned basic
responsibilities for CIO, without having full decision-making powers or control over resources
due to their weak capacity. The guidelines for the NTP on New Rural Areas (2011-2020) has
extended the principle to cover all rural communes in the country, whereby communes will be
investment owners for projects valued under VND 3 billion.9 In summary, the expected outcome
in this policy area has been achieved.

Local Institutional Capacity Building Support. Overall, the efforts under P135-2 to strengthen
communications and capacity building activities at the district and commune levels are believed
to have contributed to broadening of popular participation in the investment planning, decision
making and supervision processes. More intensive training for commune cadres and local people
has been provided under P135-2 compared to the first phase of the program. There is no data to
assess the specific outcome target of 45 percent of supervision teams for P135-2 being trained
prior to taking on their roles. However, the endline survey shows that 56 percent of P135-2
projects had supervision boards, and 17 percent of the household representatives on the
supervision boards received technical training, which appears low. According to the
Government‟s Final Report, the Project on Capacity Building and Training received just over 4
percent of the program budget allocation between 2006 and 2010. This falls below the initially
assigned budget allocation of 7 percent, which was the prior action for DPC1. 10 Nonetheless,
ninety-five percent of commune officials participating in the endline survey stated that they took
part in training courses, and 85 of them were satisfied with the quality of training provided.
Although these activities have evidently contributed to the progress made in CIO capacity and
other aspects of Program implementation, province and district officials commonly highlight
weaknesses in the capacity of commune officials, such as lack of technical knowledge and skills
in the design and costing of infrastructure works, procurement procedures, financial management

etc. The need for further institutional capacity building at the local level therefore remains. In
summary, the expected outcome in this policy area has been partially achieved.

Objective 3: Fiduciary Transparency and Accountability

The DPC series performed moderately unsatisfactory in enhancing fiduciary transparency and
accountability. Specifically, the enhancements in the financial reporting and auditing have been
substantial; however, the reforms in the areas of community contracting and community
contributions have been less successful.

Procurement for Small-Scale Infrastructure. The policy actions for the development and
issuance of Program-specific policies on competitive procurement and community contracting
have been completed but the implementation has not achieved the benchmarks. The 2010
benchmarks stipulated that 80 percent or more of contracts under P135-2 would be awarded
through open and competitive bidding and/or other non-direct contracting methods, and verified
by SAV‟s annual audit reports, and that at least 70 percent of works below relevant threshold
would follow community contracting. To promote competitive procurement methods under P135-
2, DPC2 required the issuance of a Manual on Procurement introducing community contracting
and elements regarding transparency and procurement planning. The guideline was issued and
training provided but the enforcement remains weak. However, a majority of civil works were
still procured through Direct Contracting methods in 2010 (for contracts valued VND 300 million
to 1 billion). Limited competitive bidding and full competitive bidding has been applied for an
increasing number of works over time (valued over VND 1 billion). The application of
Community Participation Procurement (CPP; for works under VND 300 million) has been tried
only in a few provinces. Reporting and auditing of procurement performance was also insufficient
and inadequate.11 In summary, the expected outcome in this policy area has not been achieved.
Even though the policy actions were achieved by the central level, including the issuance of
Circular 01 about community contracting and Procurement Manual Book, procurement
implementation at provincial level remained weak due to, inter alia, the low interest of bidders to
do construction work in P135 communes, characterized by rough terrain and rugged topography.

Public Financial Management. The IDA development policy operations and support by other
donors have helped to put a greater focus, and improve the financial management, procurement
systems and audit arrangements under P135-2. The Program is the first national program being
audited by SAV on an annual basis with the increase in number of provinces being covered by the
audit over the time (meeting the DPC2 prior action of covering 10 provinces in FY07 and the
2010 benchmark of covering 18 provinces in FY09). By the end of the Program, all provinces
covered under the program have been audited, and some have been audited twice. These regular
and independent financial audits included clear indications of areas of weaknesses and
recommendations for improvements towards greater fiduciary scrutiny and assurance. According
to SAV, the verification of their recommendations was done regularly; however, since there was
no proper enforcement mechanism on implementation of the auditor's recommendations, the
follow-up was not that effective. The quality of the audit reports and findings was acceptable. The
outcome related to the improved access to financial information, however, has not been fully met
as the semiannual financial reports were not regularly published on the MOF website and the
audit reports were published only in the summary form without individual provincial reports on
the website of the SAV, whilst both the semiannual financial reports and the full text of the SAV
audit reports should have been published on a regular basis, at least on the CEMA website.

According to the endline survey, 82 percent of P135-2 communes have publicized their budget
allocation and financial expenditure for commune projects. In summary, the expected outcome in
this policy area has been largely achieved.

Community Contributions. Little progress has been made in this area. These were usually made
in the form of cash, labor or in-kind and recorded at commune levels but not systematically done
in the program‟s central MIS. MOF therefore issued guidelines to ensure capturing villagers‟ paid
labor and contributions in MIS and commune accounts, as prior action to DPC3; however, the
enforcement on the ground has been lagging. Monitoring and recording of community
contributions was not taking place in a uniform way, despite the guidance from MOF. A common
reason reported was the challenge of monetizing various types of contribution. As a result, the
reported level of community contributions varies widely between the provinces. According to
provincial reports, on average community contributions to the Program varied at between 10-15
percent of the total investment budget for project works. While some communes and districts
require external contractors to use local paid labor as an integral part of construction contracts,
this practice appears to be far from widespread.12 In terms of the wage-earning opportunities for
the poor households, which were identified as the outcome indicator for this area, the IE results
show that there has been a negligible increase in the percentage of households in P135-2
communes providing paid labor in infrastructure projects (from 26.1 in 2007 to 27.5 percent in
2012). On average, households contributed 2.49 days of unpaid work for P135-2 projects
compared to 1.07 in P135-1, and an average of VND 89,670 for all P135-2 projects compared to
VND 12,240 in P135-1. For paid labor opportunities, 9.12 percent of households received money
from working for infrastructure projects under the P135-2, an increase from the rate of 4.44
percent from the Baseline in 2007. Though this is a two-fold increase, it is still quite low. In
summary, the expected outcome in this policy area has been only partially achieved.

Objective 4: Monitoring and Evaluation

The rating for the achievement in policy area IV is moderately satisfactory reflecting the
significant progress made in this areas, but also delays and quality of implementation in both
impact evaluation and process monitoring.

Impact Evaluation. Design of impact evaluation was satisfactory, but the endline survey was
implemented after significant delay. A thorough baseline survey was conducted in 2007 as
planned with a final report ready in November 2008. The end of program survey was originally
planned for 2010, but the survey was completed in June 2012 and the analysis and report in
August 2012. The control areas in the endline survey included P135-2 communes raising the
question of rigor and attribution for some of the findings. Nevertheless, the surveys represent the
first such effort in NTPs in Vietnam and contain a wealth of information that can inform not only
the management of P135-2, but also future programs and policies targeting ethnic minorities in
Vietnam. In summary, the expected outcome in this policy area has been largely achieved.

Process Monitoring. The Government AMT/PMT tools were retailored for P135-2 and
implementation of the system was initiated with the training of trainers at provincial level in fall
2008. It only operates fully in 11 out of 50 provinces, and can thus not be said to effectively track
progress and identify program management issues, and reports are not readily produced at all
levels of government. Citizen report cards (CRCs) survey was undertaken in 2008 (as DPC2 prior
action) but did not ensue following this initial pilot and thus no reports on actions taken to

address weaknesses and concerns identified in the CRC surveys are available. This stands in
contrast to the expected outcome of the policy matrix, which anticipated annual CRC surveys to
be undertaken. Although the AMT/PMT management information system does not yet function
as intended, serious efforts were put into its development and implementation. Despite many
challenges, the Government has learned valuable lessons about what is possible at each level of
Program implementation and demonstrates an understanding of how to resolve some of the
obstacles encountered under P135-2 implementation. In summary, the expected outcome in this
policy area has been partially achieved.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, the supported policy reforms contributed to enhancements in poverty targeting;
decentralization, participation and empowerment; fiduciary transparency and
accountability; and monitoring and evaluation in P135-2. Success in implementation of
reforms has not always been linear and it has been uneven across different areas. While some of
the outcomes may appear overambitious in hindsight and thus several targets have not been
achieved, the rating reflects the overall positive trend and significant progress that has been made
in achieving the set objectives as well as their sustained relevance. The assessment of the progress
made in achieving the PDO takes into account the fact that several reforms have been highly
innovative in the country context and would have unlikely been endorsed at the policy-level
without the actions supported under this series.

When P135-2 closed in 2010, it had achieved progress on several fronts, including: (i) more
decentralized decision making from provinces to districts and communes as investment owners,
(ii) greater empowerment and participation by local communities, (iii) higher budget allocations
for O&M, (iv) measures in place for improved transparency and fiduciary safeguards, (v) a
baseline survey conducted and M&E system and tools installed, which are starting to show some
results, (vi) an improved policy dialogue on poverty reduction for ethnic minorities, and (vii) a
shift in focus beyond infrastructure investments to also include attention to livelihoods support.

The reforms supported under this programmatic DPC also made a significant contribution
to decentralization and implementation of Government’s “Grassroots Democracy? Decree.
It is evident that P135-2 contributed to the demonstration of more effective and transparent
systems of decentralized program planning and management to district and commune levels. This
needs to be seen in context of the broader political and administrative reform process, which
denotes the appropriate delegation and assignment of powers and responsibilities to different
levels of local government.

The extent to which different objectives have been achieved primarily depended on the
degree to which the reforms were in line with broader Government efforts. The areas with
strong Government ownership underwent most successful reforms, such as improved resource
targeting and support to CIO, or where the reforms could be centrally implemented such as the
baseline and endline surveys, and enhanced financial reporting and auditing. In contrast, those
reforms which derived from development partner priorities and/or introduced significant changes
compared to existing practice, such as a more diversified and demand driven approach to
agricultural assistance, and particularly those implemented at the local levels, such as community
contracting, saw little enforcement on the ground.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
                                                19
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

Poverty Impacts. According to the Government‟s Final Report on P135-2, the poverty rate in
communes and villages facing extreme hardship and covered under P135-2 has been reduced
from 47 percent in 2006 to 28.8 percent in 2010 (the target for 2010 was below 30 percent).
However, this was assessed based on the poverty line of VND 200,000/person/month.13 If the
new poverty line of VND 400,000/person/month is applied, the poverty rate would be 60 percent,
with 1.4 million poor households and 6.3 million poor people. According to the 2012 IE results,
the overall poverty rate in the treatment areas dropped from 54.6 percent in 2007 to 48 percent in
2012. The poverty rate among ethnic minority groups fell by 6 percent points; the total income of
ethnic minority households increased by 10 percent; and the income per capita increased by 11
percent. The poverty rates vary among different ethnic minority groups with the highest among
Hmong and Thai (63 and 61 percent respectively). The Program impacts include an increase in
the net enrollment rate of primary-aged ethnic minority students by 6 percent points, reduction of
the travel time to health facilities for ethnic minority communities by 16 percent.

Gender Aspects. Ethnic minority women are considered among the most vulnerable groups in
Vietnam, and efforts were made to mainstream gender equality in the relevant areas of the policy
matrix as well as in the P135-2 M&E system. However, the data on women‟s participation during
the implementation was not recorded effectively. The available reports suggest that there was
awareness among key stakeholders of the importance of women‟s participation, and that their
participation in meetings and trainings did not encounter major obstacles, but there is no data
available to demonstrate that women did participate at a satisfactory level. The last JPR noted that
steps were taken to increase the participation of women in Program activities; however the delay
in preparing a gender mainstreaming manual for the Program had held back progress in this
regard. The IE results show that 22 percent of female-headed households reported that P135-2
helped them increase income and 11 percent reported that it helped employment generation. Only
29 percent of female-headed households reported that the Program helped increase access to
health care and education compared to 42.6 percent of male-headed households. Further
assessment of how women have benefited from participating in the Program, how women‟s
income or wellbeing has been impacted in specific and concrete ways, or how existing capacity
building activities have specifically addressed the needs of women would be helpful in informing
future Government programs.

Social Development. The promotion of voice and accountability, participation, empowerment
and transparency were at the core of P135-2, and qualitative assessments suggest positive impacts.
Basic models of participation and information dissemination were provided in the Grassroots
Democracy Decree, and P135-2 strengthened and institutionalized its application through annual
planning processes. The Government reports point out that this model of participation at the
commune level has gained wide currency. The criteria for: (a) resource allocation to communes,
(b) poverty targeting for livelihoods support, and (c) commune self-assessment of their capacity
as investment owners, have all been widely publicized and utilized. The manual on participatory
planning clearly sets out the steps required for consultation with local people and beneficiaries in
the selection of activities and targeting of livelihoods support policies. The P135-2 website
provides public information about the Program as well as relevant legislative documents to a
greater extent than many other Government programs. 14 The managing authorities have also

                                                20
sought to promote greater connectivity with oversight bodies including the National Assembly,
the Province People‟s Councils, and through the independent annual audit by the SAV.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The programmatic series supported numerous reforms aimed at institutional strengthening
across four policy areas, with one policy area focusing specifically on strengthening local
institutional capacity building support. The Program has clearly developed a pathway for
assessing the capacity of communes to act as investment owners; and combined with an increased
level for funding for capacity building and training activities, has contributed substantially to
building this capacity, to the extent that legislation has now been introduced for wider application
of this principle to all rural communes in future. The program has also developed implementation
guidelines and practical manuals - on participatory planning, O&M and CPP, which provide a
good foundation for wider application of these methods in future. Lastly, it also contributed to
improving the policy dialogue between ODA providers and central agencies, helping to enhance
the way NTPs are managed, and a greater harmonization and alignment of ODA with government
goals and policies.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

Arguably, one of the most successful areas has been the policy to support poor school pupils
(through cash transfers). This has now been integrated with the regular education and training
sector policies and extended to cover all poor school pupils nationwide. Interestingly, this was not
specifically included in the Policy Matrix, although it is alluded to under Policy Area I on poverty
targeting.

3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

There were no Stakeholder Workshops held. The End line survey was, however, conducted
during the late 2011 and finalized in September 2012. The Annex 2 presents the summary results
from the Endline survey. By the time of this ICR preparation, the analysis of the Endline survey
was not completed. However, the preliminary assessment of the Endline survey suggested that up
to the survey time, some objectives are not achieved (e.g., percentage of households having the
average income higher than VND3.5 million, decrease in poverty rate, etc). The program
however has some positive impacts on the ethnic minority groups. The survey also revealed that
attribution from other programs/projects, and intervention of the program itself – that reduced the
survey‟s power to measure the impact of program – might have underestimated the impact of the
program. At the same time, Program 135-2 involved mostly supply-side interventions whose full
impact might need more time to be measured.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Ratings: Substantial

The overall risk of policy reversals in the areas supported by the P135-2 support operations
series is substantial. Given the uncertainty related to the modality for follow-up to Program 135,
sustainability of most policy changes will depend on the extent to which they will be replicated
and the same objectives further supported in other NTPs and Government‟s poverty reduction
programs.




                                                21
Poverty Targeting (Substantial): The outcomes from the first policy area are at substantial risk.
While the MOLISA poverty targeting and pro-poor resource allocation criteria have been well
accepted and are likely to be integrated in other poverty reduction programs, the prospects for
wider application and sustainability of the reforms related to livelihoods support and funding for
infrastructure O&M are less clear. The major challenge for the reform on production support was
that the policy interventions through P135-2 – which does not directly address the core business
or quality of agriculture sector services – could have had only a limited impact on the
introduction of improved approaches on the ground. Similarly, existing decisions and guidelines
on O&M are still specifically connected to Program 135 and have not been extended or
incorporated into wider national legislation. Reform of O&M financing would need to focus on
recurrent budget allocations and systems and financing sources and mechanisms (rather than
investment budgets), across the range of infrastructure sectors.

Decentralization, Empowerment and Participation (Low): For commune investment
ownership, legislation has already been introduced to apply these policies more widely beyond
the geographical and programmatic focus of P135-2. Other risks in this area relate to
sustainability and potential scaling-up through adoption in other interventions of the participatory
approaches to planning and management of commune-level public actions and sustained capacity
of commune and village officials who were trained. However, the Government is committed to
advancing the decentralization agenda and is well aware of the capacity building needs on the
ground.

Financial Transparency and Accountability (Substantial): The SAV auditing capacity has
been strengthened through their engagement in P135-2 and their role in the follow-up activities is
yet to be defined. The application of more competitive procurement methods at local government
level will take longer than 5 years to be fully enforced. Similarly, there are few incentives – and
many practical dis-incentives – for the district and commune authorities to introduce CPP. This is
because it would necessitate processing, managing, supervising and liquidating a much larger
number of small-scale works. In this area of procurement, parallel engagement with a wider pool
of relevant legislative and executive agencies at both national and provincial level may be
necessary to promote the intended reforms.

Monitoring and Evaluation (Moderate): The development outcome in this area is not prone to
many risks. However, successful implementation of the MIS in follow-up activities of the
Program will to a large extent depend on the ability of CEM at national level to promote and
enforce the reporting system at decentralized levels and to ensure that program decision making
at all levels is timely and based on the available data. Lack of external TA at all levels could also
hamper the progress towards the development outcomes, as this has proved to be indispensable in
the provinces who successfully adopted M&E activities under Phase 2.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

The Bank team effectively facilitated the preparation of the two operations and actively
engaged in the policy dialogue. The Bank worked closely with the Government and
development partners to identify strategic reform areas and follow up on progress. The overall

                                                 22
design of the programmatic series complemented well other Bank activities (PRSCs and
investment operations) and remained relevant until completion. The initial decision to
complement the use of investment lending instruments with Development Policy Lending was
sound, and strengthened the dialogue with the Government on the strategic reform agenda – in
particular on support for CDD approaches. However, the implementation phase demonstrated that
the budget support modality also gave less leverage to the Bank and other development partners
to press for deeper reforms in some more demanding and politically sensitive areas, such as
competitive procurement or community contributions. The choice of some benchmarks,
indicators, and targets was less than optimal. Nevertheless, the institutional arrangements resulted
in progress on the ground, ensured high level commitment and attracted parallel financing by
other donors. The Bank‟s support and increased funding under DPC2 in response to the financial
crisis was timely and appreciated by the Government.

The Bank’s leadership role in the development partner coordination around a
programmatic reform agenda is considered good practice. The Bank provided the largest
funding among DPs and led the dialogue with the Government on development and later
adjustments of the policy matrix. The Bank‟s knowledge systems and fiduciary safeguards gave
other partners confidence to also provide support to P135-2. Consistent with the Hanoi Core
Statement on Aid Effectiveness (Vietnam‟s localized version of the Paris Declaration), the
Partnership Committee proved to be a powerful, transparent and fair tool for donor
harmonization.15 However, the Committee has been inactive since the closing of the Program,
leaving significant vacuum in terms of donor coordination on this set of reforms.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

In total, two Joint Progress Reviews (JPR) and associated supervision missions were carried
out in the 2009-2011 period. The Bank team participated in these and took an active part in the
policy dialogue. Since it was planned that DPC3 would follow the DPC2 in 2010, less than 12
months apart, no ISR was prepared for DPC2 as ISR is required for policy lending every 12
months. The quality and candor of JPR reports was adequate, but the follow-up on emerging
issues less so. Specifically, the issues raised during the MTR and in later years of implementation
with regard to the production support component and need for appropriate and more extensive
capacity building and participation at local level could have been addressed more effectively,
since implementation of these components remained problematic until closing of the Program.
Following the MTR, the team introduced course corrections to address weaknesses in the first
years of implementation and even though some adjustments were made, Program development
outcomes, triggers and benchmarks still appear to have remained ambitious in DPC2 and DPC3,
leading to some frustration at the implementation levels.16

Supervision was focused on policy actions and their impacts but the quantitative results
were not available for assessment. A number of indicators identified in the policy matrix for
progress monitoring towards development outcomes and as benchmarks could not be measured in
quantitative terms during the implementation, leading to primarily qualitative assessments of
progress during JPR missions. These qualitative assessments could not provide a clear picture of
the concrete levels of implementation process for donors and the Government. The TA provided

by DPs was not sufficient to support the implementation of the AMT/PMT and more could have
been done to encourage the authorities to collect the data required for updating the indicators.
Finally, the task team leadership changed with each operation in the series, and transitioned from
country office to headquarters (DPC2) and then back to the country office (DPC3); however,
these transitions have been managed well and ensured consistency in the engagement. The team
on the ground played an important role in maintaining a continuous dialogue on P135-2
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

On the basis of the above assessment of Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry and in
supervision, overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

Government’s ownership and commitment to implementation of P135-2 was very strong
since the Program was developed by the Government as one of its main poverty reduction
programs. Less ownership has however been demonstrated in pushing through the
implementation of some of the agreed policy changes. Once the initial disbursement delay caused
by the late issuance of implementing guidelines was overcome, the Government generally
followed up on the initial policy actions with further adjustments as required, particularly where
this could be implemented from the central level. However, in 2008 after implementation of the
Program had begun, it became apparent that guideline documents and regulations from the central
authorities were not always conducive and this caused difficulties for provinces in implementing
the Program smoothly, according to the Government‟s Final Report.

Overall, MOF and other central agencies (SAV, SBV, MPI etc) played a positive and
cooperative role in supervisory missions and in implementing the follow-up actions. Over the
years, the Government played a proactive coordination role and controlled effectively the
socialization process of engaging different line agencies and new donors into the reform process.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

P135-2 was a complex program that has involved multiple implementing agencies at
different levels. As such, the Program did not have a unified management structure in the
conventional sense. Rather, cross-sector coordination and guidance was achieved through steering
committee structures, which operated under the Prime Minister‟s Office at central level and the
Peoples Committees at province and district level. Day-to-day coordination was assigned to the
Standing Member of these committees – namely, CEM at national level, the Province Board of
Ethnic Affairs (PCEM) or Department of Planning and Investment (DPI) at province level, and
the Peoples Committee Office at district level (see Annex 7).

CEM’s ability, as the coordinating agency, to push through progress on the triggers and
affect the performance of different line agencies and provinces was limited. In contrast to
other sector ministries and line departments, neither CEM at national level nor PCEM had the
executive structure, staffing or outreach capacity to manage and implement projects and programs

                                               24
on the ground. The effectiveness of P135-2 implementation therefore largely depended on local
government leadership; for instance, in the extent to which cross-sectoral coordination was
achieved, the quality of program monitoring, and the extent to which the intended policy reforms
were sanctioned and applied at sub-national level. In most provinces, overall coordination of
P135-2 was assigned to the Office of the District Peoples Committee. This followed dissolution
of the District Ethnic Board in 2008, which presented a notable change in the organizational
system during program implementation – at a point in time when the program was introducing a
stronger decentralized approach. According to CEM, this had a detrimental impact on
implementation in some provinces, particularly with respect to coordination of training activities
and program monitoring.

Generally, relevant central authorities (MoF, MPI, MARD and SAV) provided good
cooperation and support to help CEM with management and implementation of the
program. This ICR does not go into details about the various line agencies as each pillar
involved working with several different implementing agencies. While some agencies were more
open, for example MoF, others were less accepting of some policy changes, such as
diversification of the extension support for production.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Moderately Satisfactory

On the basis of the above assessment regarding Government and implementing agencies‟
performance, overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

There are several lessons that can be drawn from the P135-2 experience for similar budget
support and DPCs of the World Bank and other donors:
   Support for decentralization reforms generally – and those promoting CDD-approaches
    in particular – should be long-term and gradual. DPCs that aim to support and
    demonstrate such complex reforms may require an extended time-scale (of at least 5 to 10
    years) to roll-out, pilot and adapt the policy reforms for wider application. The DPL program
    should be driven by the Government‟s own priorities and the pace and scope of reforms
    should be sensitive to the operating and political context.
   For the DPCs in support of decentralization reforms, active engagement with both
    national and sub-national leadership and levels of government is essential to build
    consensus and gain backing for the intended decentralization reforms. While it is important
    for the dialogue to take place with central government agencies and agree on the proposed
    areas of policy reform at national level first before rolling-out to the provinces, the official
    backing – or lack of official backing – at province level for some policy reforms has been a
    major factor affecting performance and application of these reforms.
   Promoting policy reforms for poverty reduction requires a multiple and coordinated
    engagement with the Government. The achievements made under the DPC series were
    aided by simultaneous engagement with the Government through poverty focused SILs,
    AAAs and other DPC series. In complex reform areas which necessitate changes to
    underlying budgeting systems and budgetary allocations (such as infrastructure O&M) or
    which necessitate modifications to statutory legal provisions (such as for procurement),
    greater effectiveness could be achieved if Development Policy Lending would target entire
    sectors and country systems rather than a single program.

                                                25
   Successful gender mainstreaming requires strong awareness raising and endorsement at
    all levels from policy makers to implementing agencies and local authorities. To ensure
    effective gender mainstreaming for expected development outcomes, any policy action on
    gender should be included in the policy reforms from the start and integrated in the policy
    matrix in a logical manner. The actions should be levered up for higher profile and strong
    implementation support to realize its development impacts.
   The timely placement and innovative utilization of TA is needed to cover capacity
    building, lesson-learning and facilitation of the reform process at all levels. Donors
    should pay particular attention to ensuring provision of a strong, sub-nationally focused TA
    program to reinforce capacity and understanding to implement reforms, as well as to support
    better information and experience sharing between provinces and between various levels of
    Government.
   Program design should be flexible enough to allow for adjustments in poverty targeting
    over time. A purely geographical targeting approach may become insufficient as the number
    of poor people decreases and the pockets of poverty shrink, increasing the risk of mis-
    targeting. To ensure that scarce poverty reduction resources are used efficiently, and in ways
    that best address the particular needs of the poor, different kinds of methods targeting the
    poorest households and individuals should be considered in different Program components.
   Policy interventions promoting innovative approaches to improving livelihoods are
    likely to be more successful if they directly address the core business and quality of
    agricultural sector services. The efforts to institutionalize participatory methods of
    agricultural extension (e.g. Farmer Field Schools) in local government systems should be
    coupled with stronger linkages between adaptive research and extension. „Programmatic‟
    structure and contents of extension with funding tied to specific national or provincial
    extension programs allows little flexible financing whereby the extension service can respond
    to „demands from below‟ or introduce „locally adapted technologies.‟
   Large national programs that are implemented at subnational levels should use a
    simplified version of an MIS. The MIS should build on the traditional reporting formats and
    indicators with which the local levels are familiar. The number of indicators to be tracked
    should be kept to a minimum. Connecting data collection to funds flow should be considered
    as an incentive for timely data collection.
   Systematic and effective impact evaluation arrangements can greatly enhance learning.
    Efforts need to be made to ensure that the baseline and endline surveys are done in a timely
    manner so as to also inform program management and other government program/projects.
    This can be addressed through more TA at the central level, and could also be considered as a
    prior action for credit disbursement.

     SUMMARY OF GOVERNMENT’S REPORT ON FINAL REVIEW
  OF THE PROGRAMME FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF
 COMMUNES FACING EXTREME HARDSHIP IN ETHNIC MINORITY AND
 MOUNTAINOUS AREAS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ETHNIC MINORITY
              POLICIES IN THE 2006-2010 PERIOD
                    Hanoi, December 2010

       With an implementation period of 5 years, Programme 135 Phase II covered
1,958 communes and 3,274 villages facing extreme hardship in 369/690 districts in
50/63 provinces. 17 The Programme has achieved important results, contributing to the
socio-economic development of communes and villages facing extreme hardship in
ethnic minority and mountainous areas.

1. Targets that have been achieved:
       - The poverty rate in communes and villages facing extreme hardship has been
reduced from 47% in 2006 to 28.8% in 2010 (the target is that by 2010, the rate will be
reduced to below 30%).
        - At present, the average income per capita is VND 4.2 million/year (the target is
that by 2010, over 70% of the households will reach an average income level of VND 3.5
million/person/year).
       - The number of communes with roads for motor vehicles (at least motorbikes)
from commune centres to villages has reached 80.7% (the set target to be reached by the
end of 2010 was 80%).
       - 100% of communes have health stations at present (the target to be reached by
the end of 2010 was 100%).
          - 100% of local people needing legal aid had been provided with support free-of-
charge.

2. Targets that have not been achieved:
        - The number of communes with small irrigation schemes to support production
has increased from 53.7% in 2006 to 70 % in 2010 (the set target to be reached by the end
of 2010 is 80%).
       - The number of communes with solid schools and classrooms has been increased
to 83.6% (the set target to be reached by the end of 2010 is 100%). The number of

children going to primary school at the right age has been increased to 90% (the set target
to be reached by the end of 2010 is 95%).
        - The number of communes with commune centres connected to the power grid
has increased to 84.6% (the set target to be reached by the end of 2010 is 100%)
        - The number of households having sufficient domestic water has reached 67.8%
(the set target to be reached by the end of 2010 is 80%).

3. Issues and shortcomings:
      In the last 10 years, communes and villages facing extreme hardship in ethnic
minority and mountainous areas have been receiving investments and support from the
Party and the Government, which have been aimed at narrowing the development gaps
and gradually reducing the disparities in living standards among ethnic groups and among
regions and areas in the whole country. However, in terms of Programme steering,
management, and implementation, there remain a number of issues and shortcomings as
follows:
      In Programme steering, management:
       + At the central level: In 2006, the documents providing management mechanisms
and implementation guidelines were not issued in a timely manner and some of the
guidelines were difficult to implement (Circular 676 was issued late; some of the guidelines
in the document guiding the implementation of the production development support project
were not relevant and had to be revised a number of times, and the budget allocation
structure for the project on production development support was not appropriate); the
central level transferred the budget to provinces serveral times in a year; there haven‟t been
incentives for localities to perform well and quickly achieve Programme objectives; there
haven‟t been sanction/penalty measures for localities that were slow and not performing
well, especially there weren‟t any measures in place to deal with localities that have an
attitude of reliance and do not want to be phased out although the have met the criteria to
graduate from the Programme.
         + At the local level: At times and in some issues, local governments have not
really paid due attention and made aggressive efforts. There were delays in setting up and
filling positions in the Steering Committees, and there has been a lack of efforts to
decentralise management tasks to commune level. Besides, monitoring and supervision
has not been conducted on a frequent basis and with high quality. Some localities have
been struggling in organising implementation, and some provinces have had low
disbursement rates over many years, and therefore, their results have been well below the
targets both in terms of the amount of work completed and disbursement rates. Localities
have not always provided information and submitted reports in a timely manner, in full
compliance with requirements, and in the stipulated formats, thus causing difficulties in
steering and managing the Programme.
       - In implementation of Programme‟s interventions: Programme‟s interventions have
not been implemented in a synchronized manner. For example, it was not until the end of
2006, 2008, and 2009 when the budget was allocated for implementing the project on
production development support, for suppporting cultural activities and providing legal aid
services, and for supporting poor households to improve sanitation, respectively. Support

                                             37
and investments for villages facing extreme hardship in Zone II communes have been 1
year behind schedule. Some production models have not worked well, the norms have been
low, support has been in the form of subsidy and not been sufficiently sizable, and
resources from the Programme have not been effectively combined with resources for other
policies in the communes and villages facing extreme hardship (such as the policy to
address the shortage of production land, policy on settlement and sedentarization support,
and policy on providing production services). The investments under the Programme have
not really been investments for development and therefore have not really been sustainable.
Village-level infrastructure schemes are generally small-scale, not meeting technical
standards and being solidly built, and so the quality is low, especially village roads. Access
by villagers to social services has remained limited. Some localities have provided support
to the wrong beneficiaries, and in some places, there have been some malpractices in
making payments to poor students (in Tien Phong junior secondary school, Tien Phong
commune, Que Phong District, Nghe An province)
       - Some localities have not paid due attention to communication about the
Programme to communities. The results from implementation of the principle “the
commune has infrastructure schemes and the people have employment for increasing
income by participating in construction of the schemes? have been limited. In some
places, the principles of democracy and openness have only been exercised in a
superficial manner, and the quality of participation has not been high.
       - The percentage of resources mobilised from local budget and from the community
has not been high. Some provinces have not based themselves on the real conditions of the
communes and villages to allocate resources accordingly; instead, they have distributed the
budget equally among all the communes and villages and have prolonged the allocation
process.
       - Only 5/9 Programme targets have been achieved. Some targets have been achieved
but the sustainability of the results is not really guaranteed. The results of the 2010 survey
conducted on 1,848 communes facing extreme hardship (with over 20,000 villages) in 369
districts of 50 provinces implementing the Programme show that:
       + The average income per capita in the target areas of the Programme is around 4.2
million/person/year at present, equivalent to only 1/6 of the national figure. The poverty
rate is now 28.8% (by the poverty line of VND 200,000/person/month). If the poverty
line of VND 400,000/person/month is applied, the poverty rate will be 60%, with 1.4
million poor households and 6.3 million poor people. Especially in some areas such as
the North West, Western Nghe An, and Western Thanh Hoa, there will be many
communes with poverty rates of 80-85%.
       + 218 thousand commune and village officials and members of mass organisations
are in need of training and capacity-building on management and on implementation of
policies, programmes and projects in the target areas. Around 4 million labourers need
training and knowledge on use of credit, on household economy development, on
agricultural-forestry-aquaculture extension, and on doing services as well as vocational
training.
       + 360 still do not have asphalt or concrete roads to commune centres; nearly 14,100
villages still do not have sealed roads for the main village routes; 11% of the communes
and 38.6% of the villages still have no access to electricity; 32.2% of the households still

                                             38
do not have access to safe/potable drinking water; 16.4% of the communes still do not
have enough solid classroos; 75.6% of the villages do not have kindergartens and nursery
classes; 41% of the communes and 77.6% of the villages do not have enough cultural and
community houses.

4. Causes:
a) Objective causes:
       - The Programme is implemented in poor, remote and isolated areas, which are
characterised by rough terrain and rugged topography. Besides, they have suffered from
frequent severe and damaging cold spells, severe typhoons and floods.
       - There have been impacts of the world economic crisis and the domestic inflation
and economic slowdown.
       - In communes and villages facing extreme hardship, the education attainment level
of the people is low and there remain a lot of issues related to the quantity and quality of
local officials, especially commune and village officials.
b) Subjective causes:
      - Decision No. 07/2006/Q?-TTg of the Prime Minister approving Programme 135
Phase II was a Framework decision, specifying the objectives, target areas and
beneficiaries, and contents of the Programme, as well as assigning the mandates of
organising Programme implementation to relevant agencies. Therefore, when rolling out
the Programme, Ministries, central agencies, and localities had to conduct surveys and
assessments and identify target areas and beneficiaries; besides, on a yearly basis, the
Decision on investment and subsidy norms had to be formulated and submitted to the
Prime Minister for approval, and guidelines had to be developed. Therefore, in initial
years, there were usually out-of-control delays.
      - Steering and management of the Programme required inter-sectoral coordination,
but there have been many difficulties in ensuring coordination and consensus among
Ministries and agencies which provide advice to the Prime Minister, especially in
issuance of the Inter-circular approving the investment norms for the Programme, leading
to delays in implementation.
      - The Programme set ambitious objectives with a lot of targets but the allocation
norms for communes and villages have been low, not commensurate with the set
objectives and not sufficient to meet the real needs. To be specific, the average allocation
for 1 commune for 5 years is only VND 5.2 billion, and for 1 village is VND 0.65 billion
(the needed budget is VND 20 billion/commune on average and VND 3-5 billion/village).
       - The communication strategy was approved but allocation for implementing the
strategy was very small and was only available to central level agencies (VND 10 billion,
equivalent to 0.001% of the total Programme budget). Localities did not receive any budget
from the central level for conducting communication activities, and therefore, the results of
communication at local levels have been limited, especially at commune, village, and
community levels.




                                             39
      - A segment of population and some communities still have an attitude of reliance
and have not tried hard to grasp opportunities to escape from poverty and improve their
living standards.

       - In 2008, Decree No. 14/2008/N?-CP of the Government was implemented and
there was no more dedicated division to work on ethnic minority affairs at the district
level. Therefore, the mandates of a standing body were assigned to various technical
divisions at district level, which led to difficulties in management and implementation of
Programme‟s interventions.

5. Overall Assessment:
       - Program 135 Phase II has been a sound initiative by the Party and State, which
has met the legitimate expectations of the people and enjoyed the support and
appreciation of the people. It has not only contributed to poverty reduction but also to
socio-economic development of disadvantaged areas. The Program has promoted the
creativity and tapped on the wills and resources of people in the whole society, and
brought about fundamental changes to rural life in ethnic minority and mountainous areas
facing extreme hardship; the living standards of ethnic minority people have gradually
been improved, and the poverty rate has been rapidly reduced; the knowledge level of the
people has been improved, and ethnic minority people have adopted production practices
and techniques for more commodity-based production; the percentage of villages with
electricity, roads, classrooms, cultural houses and irrigation schemes has been increased;
grass roots officials have received training and capacity-building on management of local
development, especially officials of local Party Committees and local governments have
had the capacity strengthened; political security and social order have been well
maintained.
      - The Program has been enjoying the consensus of the Party, National Assembly,
Government, Ministries and central agencies as well as local Party Committees and local
governments, which have paid attention to and provided guidance for programme
implementation with high level of determination. In the context of adverse impacts of
economic recession and budget constraints, the Government has expressed its strong
determination for the Program by directing Ministries, agencies and localities to integrate
resources to provide support and investments, address the most urgent issues, ensure the
stable production, carry out socio-economic development, and improve the life of people in
communes and villages facing extreme hardship.
       - The Programme has been able to mobilise various resources for implementation,
both domestic resources and resources from international organisations. The Programme
has also enjoyed the participation and support of the whole political system in helping
communes and villages facing extreme hardship to develop production and undertake
economic structural transformation, thus improving the living conditions and spiritual
well-being of the people. Therefore, a consensus has been reached from the central to the
local levels.
       Observing the principles of openness, transparency and democracy in Program
management and implementation, the Program has attracted widespread and deep
participation of local people in processes of planning, decision-making, implementation

                                            40
and monitoring of the Program‟s activities (according to quick survey results, more than
98.13% of households know about Program 135; 87.7% of households participate; 95.9%
households are satisfied with the Programme‟s interventions). With increased efforts for
communication activities, the community, especially beneficiaries have become an
effective monitoring channel; at the same time, through communication the capacities of
officials and awareness of the communities about the Party and State‟s policies and
objectives, scale, funding sources and contents of Program 135 have been improved.
       There has been close coordination among Ministries, agencies and localities in
Programme management and in guidance for Programme implementation, as well as in
realisation of many systematic solutions for effective implementation. Especially, the
management mechanism and Programme implementation guidelines have been revised and
supplemented in a timely manner with a view to ensuring relevance with the real conditions
and solving difficulties and bottlenecks at local levels. Especially, the planning processes
and financial mechanisms of the Programme have been characterised by openness,
transparency, and clarity, with the participation of and supervision by the community;
therefore, the investments and support have been delivered to the right beneficiaries and
the funding used for the right purposes, meeting the practical needs of the people.
      - Strong decentralisation and devolution of power to grass roots level have been
undertaken under the Programme. According to consolidated statistics, only 500
communes were investment owners of infrastructure schemes and other projects in 2006,
accounting for 30.4% of the total number of Programme communes; now the figures have
increased to 1,591 and 90% respectively. With investment ownership devolved to the
commune level, communes have had greater autonomy and become more active in
Program implementation and the capacity of commune officials has gradually been
improved.
      - The capacities of district, commune and village officials for management and
implementation have been improved through training and direct involvement in
management and implementation of the Program‟s activities. There have been many
positive changes in the awareness of communities and people regarding development of
household economy, which has been a contributing factor to help them move out of
poverty.
      - Programme 135 mainly operates in communes and villages in remote, isolated,
and border areas facing extreme hardship and characterized by complexities, and with
hostile forces frequently inducing people to side with them, but thanks to achievements in
poverty reduction, improvements in health and education services, and improvements in
people‟s knowledge, the Programme has helped the Party and State to gain people‟s trust,
which, in turn, contributes to maintenance of political security and social stability in the
most critical strategic areas of the country.

6. Some Lessons Learned:
      First, it is necessary to ensure a high level of determination and consensus of the
whole political system from central level to local levels, especially the active
participation of socio-political organisations in poverty reduction:



                                            41
      With the viewpoint that ethnic minority affairs and implementation of ethnic
minority policies are part of the mandates of the whole political system, and that priority
must be placed on socio-economic development of ethnic minority and mountainous
areas and areas facing extreme hardship, all sectors and levels of governments from the
central to the local levels have to be unified in their leadership, make aggressive efforts
and provide guidance on a frequent basis, and be in close touch with situation on the
grounds. With that in mind, Programme 135 Phase II has been included in the National
Assembly‟s annual plan for oversight and evaluation. The Government has issued strong
policies, strengthened its leadership in this regard and provided close guidance to Party
Committees and governments at provincial, district, and commune levels, considering the
Programme one of the key political tasks in its action plan. Experiences in the past years
have shown that in implementation of the same policy with the same management
mechanism, results may vary greatly from one locality to another because of different
levels of leaders‟ attention and different ways of organising implementation. Therefore, it
is necessary to enhance the sense of responsibility of leaders at different levels for
poverty reduction and socio-economic development of communes and villages facing
extreme hardship in ethnic minority and mountainous areas.
       Second, it is necessary to have an accurate assessment of poverty, identify the most
important objectives to be achieved and the right target areas, with priority given to the
poorest communes and most disadvantaged villages in order to concentrate resources for
sufficiently sizable investments rather than thin investments. Besides, it is necessary to
mobilise all resources available, including State budget, credit, people’s contribution,
and the support and assistance from international organisations and enterprises for
poverty reduction in communes and villages facing extreme hardship in ethnic minority
and mountainous areas.
       On the whole, Programme 135 Phase II has covered the right target areas, which
are communes and villages facing extreme hardship indentified on the basis of clear
criteria, as well as identified the most pressing issues and set the right objectives to be
addressed. The success of the Programme can be attributed to the stability of resources
and transparency in identification of beneficiaries and allocation norms, which has
ensured reliability for localities to prepare plans. Besides, the State budget has been the
core part of the Programme budget, acting as the basis for attraction of financial support
and technical assistance from international organisations , as well as for mobilising
contribution from local people and communities in various forms.
       Third, it is necessary to ensure that when decentralising tasks, devolviing power,
and providing autonomy to the grass roots level, all the upper levels from central down to
the district levels make increased efforts for checking and monitoring in order to provide
support and detect errors in a timely manner, helping communes to overcome all
difficulties in implementation
      Experience has shown that wherever there is strong decentralisation and devolution
of power to the grass roots level, the Programme is implemented effectively, with
infrastructure schemes and projects meeting requirements in terms of quality and
progress as well as being relevant to the needs of local people. It is necessary for upper
levels to monitor closely and provide guidance, support, and instructions to lower levels,
especially commune level, when decentralising tasks and devolving power, rather than

                                            42
“leave them alone? in management and implementation of the Programme‟s interventions.
Besides, it is necessary to maintain attention to training and development in order to
improve the quality of human resource in ethnic minority areas.
      Fourth, it is necessary to have a simple Programme design with relevant
interventions and manageable requirements, taking into consideration local needs and
the capacity of local levels; besides, it is necessary to adhere to the principles of
democracy, openness, and transparency in Programme implementation.
      The lessons learnt from Programme 135 and other programmes, policies, and
projects show that having flexible and simple operation mechanisms which suits the
management capacity of local levels and easy to implement is the pre-condition for
ensuring feasibility. It is important to ensure adherence to the principles of openness and
democracy all the time, with provision of complete and timely information to
beneficiaries. Besides, it is necessary to ensure clear division of responsibilities and tasks
among sectors, agencies, and levels, from the central to the local levels. The central level
is to provide budget transfer based on budget availability and issue mechanisms for
implementation by local levels. Localities are to be proactive and base on local conditions
to adapt mechanisms for programme management and implementation. It is necessary to
make strong efforts for monitoring, inspection, and communication.

GoV/CEM COMMENTS ON THE ICR

In general, CEM agreed with the ICR assessments and ratings. In addition, CEM
provided more information/clarifications in some areas as following:

      On procurement policy area. CEM considered that the direct contracting
       procedures under the Procurement Law was somewhat equivalent to limited
       competitive bidding. This was because under the Law and related guiding decrees,
       direct contracting method required 3 quotations to select from. At the same time,
       CEM re-emphasized that they achieved the policy actions as defined in the agreed
       policy matrix at national level.
      On CEM capacity. The project outcome and implementation were somewhat
       affected by various changes of CEM structure at local level. CEM considered that
       reliance on local governments/authorities in implementing the program could help
       sustaining the capacity at local levels for other program implementation.
      On targeting of poor communes. CEM provided long list of criteria in selecting
       communes to be included in the program in response to one lesson learnt on
       program design. The selection of program communes did not rely only on
       geographical criterion but also on a group of indictors of social services,
       infrastructure, local capacity, etc.

Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

     Comments were received from SDC and Irish Aid.

     SDC responded with compliments to a good report and suggestion to expand the
lessons learnt section into a chapter to highlight the importance of the lessons learnt.

       Irish Aid, as a co-donor who also joined the WB ICR mission, agrees with the
overall positive assessments of the WB on the achievements of the P135 in delivering
services to the poorest community and building capacity to commune level. Irish Aid
acknowledges the important contribution and influence of the WB in the P135
Partnership Committee, taking lead in policy dialogue. The Bank played an important
co-ordinating role in bringing donors together, ensuring effective dialogue amongst
donors, CEMA and related ministries18. Irish Aid appreciates the Bank„s engagement and
its influence in the design of the support instrument, the provision of donor co-ordination,
high-quality analytical inputs and as the largest financier.

      Irish Aid notes that the World Bank tended to focus much of its energy at the policy
level. They agree that to some extent policy triggers (e.g. CIO) could take place top down
in the context of Vietnam, however it is obvious that the capacity of targeted P135
communes and communities needs intensive capacity building interventions in order to
tackle the roles and responsibilities of an investment owner as set out in the P135 agenda.
Institutional and capacity readiness at the commune level is crucial for the target to be
met.

      Irish Aid notes that some of the achievements stated in the results framework are
rather more positive than what it might be in reality. For example, the targets for
communes assuming the investment ownership and participatory planning are
quantitatively positive. Nonetheless, there have been concerns over the quality of the
process involved, whether communes really acted as CIO for all investment components
of the programme, and whether community including poor people were able to
participate in the decision making and monitoring of public investment work is crucial.
To this end, the end-line survey, which has been conducted by UNDP can provide an
important insight into the impact of P135 at household level, which is an important
complementary perspective on policy achievements.

      Irish Aid also expresses their disappointment regarding the Bank‟s decision to
phase out its engagement in the P135 or the NTP-SPR, particularly following the high
level of achievements in P-135. They would like to have seen more discussion with other
DPs on this decision particularly considering the strong co-ordination which had been the

norm during the latter phase of the programme. While a number of donors have indicated
a downsizing in Vietnam beyond 2015 as Vietnam has become a lower middle income
country, it is still recognized that more than ten million Vietnamese still live under the
poverty line, and that poverty issue are becoming more complex. These have been
forcefully pointed out in several researches conducted/commissioned by the Bank. It is
Irish Aid‟s view that donors who remain interested in poverty agenda should continue to
work more closely together to leverage changes and innovations to GoV‟s efforts in a
concerted manner rather than separated through project interventions.

      Irish Aid remains committed to the P135, which has now been superseded by the
National Targeted Programme for Sustainable Poverty Reduction (NTP-SPR) 2012-2015.
The organization believes that the new programme can benefit considerably from lessons
learnt in P135 phase II. They would remain a close contact with the WB in the poverty
assessment exercise and in its Northern Mountain Poverty Reduction Project and the
Central Highlands Poverty Reduction Project. Irish Aid also hopes to see greater synergy
between those programmes and the GoV‟s programmes related to poverty reduction.
