INTERNATIONAL BANK FUR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LDAN
TO JAMAICA FOR A SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Jamaica for the equivalent of US$15.0 million to help finance a
sites and services project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, includ-
ing six years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4% per annum, except for US$1.9
million equivalent which would be relent to the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB)
to help finance the small industries component of the project. The JDB will
repay the government on terms reflecting the composite amortization schedule
of its sub-loans and the government would, in turn, repay this part of the
Bank loan on these terms. In addition to 7-1/4% interest, the government
would charge the JDB a fee of 1% per annum for bearing the foreign exchange
risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Economic Report (No. 257a-JM) entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Jamaicall was distributad to the Lxecutive Directors on
March 12, 1974 . Country data sheets are attached as Annex I to this
report.
3.        During the decade 1962-72 the economy has expanded rapidly with
the annual rate of growth accelerating from about 4.5% to about $.5M. At
the same time the economy has undergone major structural changes.   Mining,
alumina production and tourism, all supported by large private capital
inflows, have expanded, while agriculture has stagnated and agricultural
exports, notably of sugar, have declined. This shift in the production
pattern has been acconipanied by rapid urbanization, and by the emergence
of severe and persistent unemployment and of sharp disparities in income
distribution. Large-scale emigration abroad during the decade has resulted
in the loss of significant numbers of skilled and semi-skilled workers; the
consequent shortage of technically qualified personnel has been aggravated
by deficiencies in the academically oriented educational system.
14.       As a result of its limited resource endowment and the small size
of its domaestic market, Jamaica has a very open economy heavily dependent
on the external sector. Until 1972 a widening current account deficit in
the balance of payments had been offset by substantial private capital
inflows for e;pansion of the bauxite/alumina industry.   These inflows fell
off sharply in 1972 with the completion of major investments in alumina
capacity. Partly as a consequence, but also due to some weakness in
monetary and fiscal programs, Jamaica for the first time sinoe independence



- 2 -
experienced serious balance of payments difficulties. Corrective action
taken late in 1972 and early 1973, including devaluations, the imposition
of import restrictions and a tightening of credit policy, was successful
in temporarily reversing the reserves drain during the middle of 1973.
However, subsequently exchange reserves have fallen again and by the end
of 1973 were down to about one month's imports. The situation has been
aggravated by the tripling of petroleum prices at the end of 1973 which will
cost Jamaica about US$100 million extra in 1974, equivalent to about 18%
of 1973 export earnings. To conserre foreign exchange reserves the govern-
ment in early 1974 took additional measures including an increase in gasoline
taxes, further restrictions on imports and credit availability and an increase
in interest rates. Further tax increases will be necessary and other measures
being contemplated include additional foreign borrowing, including loans of a
quickly disbursing nature. Jamaica has recently negotiated an increase in the
price of its sugar exports to the United Kingdom and is negotiating with the
mining companies for an increase in revenues from bauxite and alumina exports.
The measures recently taken by the government and the prospect of increased
export earnings should help ease Jamaica's balance of payments difficilties
in 1974/5. 
5.        Over the medium- and longer-term Jamaica will need to take action to
reduce the risk of further foreign exchange crises and consequent constr5iints
uponl economic growth.  Without a sustained rate of economic growth it will be
difficult for the country to achieve its principal objective of a significant
reduction in the high rate of unemployment, currently about 15%.    The need for
increased job creation will become even more acute in the years ahead since
the growth rate in the total population of working age is expected to rise from
0o.5% to 3% during the period to 1980 due to falling emigration and an im rease
in the natural birth rate in the 1950s.    For the immediate future the poten-
tial for increased growth and employment is encouraging. In agriculture, a
comprehensive review of the sector has recently been undertaken with assistance
from the Bank;  government initiatives are already under way to rehabilitate
the important sugar industry, and other government plans to revitalize the
sector include land-use reorganization to increase productivity and employment,
and measures to stimulate other export crops and domestic food production. A
substantial investment in an oil refinery is in prospect with the possibility
of associated investments in petro-chemicals; and in manufacturing, there is
potential for increased contribution to export growth.    However, the extent
to which Jamaica's agricultural and industrial growth potential can be realized
will depend in large part on how successful the government is in implementing
policies to improve Jamaica's competitive position and to overcome existing
institutional constraints.
6.        In recent months there has been a sharp increase in Jamaica's domestic
price level which during 1973 increased by an average of 19% over the pre-
vious year.   In part the increase can be attributed to recent increases in
world prices and higher import prices resulting from devaluation. However,
under the pressure of active trade unions, wage settlements in recent years
have outstripped increases in productivity and have been particularly high during
the last few months, reaching 25% in the construction industry and even higher
levels in other sectors. The government is considering the early implementa-
tion of a prices and incomes policy which, if effective, would help Jamaica
retain its international competitiveness and would facilitate the process of
adjustment. The government is keeping under review action to progressively



-3-
increase interest rates, which have become negative in real terms as a result
of recent price inflation. This should also encourage savings, and help
reduce the present interest rate incentive to invest funds abroad rather than
in Jamaica.
7.        In order to reduce unemployment significantly Jamaica will need to
achieve an increased rate of growth of about 7% annually. This will require
substantially higher inflows of private and public capital than in the recent
past. Such inflows are in prospect over the next few years and given continued
progress in public policies, it is likely that they could be maintained for
the rest of the decade. Commitments of external public loans (including govern-
ment-guaranteed loans) in recent years are gi'7en in the table in Annex I. For
the five-year period 197h-78, public capital inflows, including guaranteed
loans to the private sector, could reach J$450 million. From existing indica-
tions, about 60% will be raised from official sources - the Bank, IDB and
bilateral aid sources, while the remainder would consist of medium-term loans
from suppliers and financial institutions. Private capital inflows in the form
of equity and loan payments are also forecast to be substantially above the
recent past, mainly because of private loans projected for the proposed oil
refinery. Jamaica will also need to mobilize increased domestic financial
resources, both public and private. It will thus be necessary for the govern-
ment to take measures to restrain the growth of government current expenditures
and to achieve a further growth of revenue relative to GDP. A recovery in
private sector savings can also be expected provided the government maintains
fiscal discipline and discourages consumption by the appropriate use of
monetary policy.
8.        Jamaica will need to take prompt and determined policy measures
in the critical areas of the economy outlined above, and discussed at
greater length in the Economic Report, to maintain economic stability and
achieve a reasonable rate of sustained economic growth. Assuming sound
policies are pursued, public debt service as a ratio of export earnings
is projected to rise from about 4.0% in 1972 to perhaps 7.5% by 1980. Given
the importance of exports in Jamaica's GNP, this ratio is high but not
unmanageable, and the country remains creditworthy for further borrowing
on conventional terms. Although no special terms of Bank lending appear
justified on country grounds, the foreign exchange component of projects
such as agriculture, urban development and population planning, may be
relatively small; in order, therefore, to help achieve an adequate level
of external capital inflows some local currency financing would be justified
in these cases. While it has not yet been possible to assess fully the
impact of higher petroleum prices on the Jamaican economy, the rise in export
earnings in prospect from revenues in bauxite, alumina and sugar exports should
substantially mitigate the effects of the increased cost of petroleum imports
(see paragraph h above). The Bank will review the situation more closely, with
particular emphasis on the external sector, during a mission to the country
planned for May.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONST IN JAMAICA
Introduction
9.        Since the country's independence in 1962, the Bank has made
eight loans to Jamaica totalling nearly $7090 million.    Of this amount
over half has been for infrastructural investment in electric power, water
supply and highways; the remainder has gone into education, family planning
and an agricultural credit project.   The proposed loan would be the first
for urban development.   There have so far been only two IFC operations; a
loan in 1961 to a concrete company, and an equity/loan irnvestment in 1968
in a hotel project.  Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans
,and IFC investments as of  March 31, 1974 together with comments on the
execution of recent and on-going projects.   As noted in the Annex, the Bank
has experienced problems in the execution of projects in Jamaica, although
the situation has improved in recent months.
Future Direction of Bank Lending
IC.       The case for continued Bank lencing rests on the need to provide
sonme of Jamaica's external financing requirements and to support appropriate
policies in critical areas of the economy mentioned in Part I of this report.
As in the past, Bank lending will also be directed towards achieving improve-
ments in lifrastructure, at contributing to the alleviation of the unemploy-
ment problem and to assisting in the wider distribution of the benefits of
growth. After a lull in Bank lending 1972/73 - due largely to institutional
constraints and slow project preparation - the pace of Bank operations is
expected to accelerate over the next two years. The Bank's share of external
public debt is projected to increase from an estimated 15% in 1974 to about
20% in 1978 and its share of external public debt service to increase from
10% to 12% over the same period.
11.        In infrastructure, the Bank plans to continue to lend support
to high priority investments in the transportation sector which were identified
by a transportation survey financed by CIDA and carried out in 1968/70. A
Bank mission has recently appraised a project for construction of arterial
roads, while an airports project will shortly be ready for presentation to
Executive Directors.
1.        Other infrastructure investments being considered by the Bank
would have as a primary objective improving essential facilities for the
rapidly exDanding Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA), which itself accounts
for over one-quarter (about 550,000) of the total population of Jamaica and
a large proportion of its industry and commerce.    A proposed sewerage
and water supply project would provide limited extension of Kingston's
sewerage system to meet its most urgent needs, and also additional water so
as to avoid shortages which would otherwise develop over the next 3 to 4
years. The project -would also include engineering studies and preparatory
work necessary for the next major water supply project for Bank financing.
The project now before you will help alleviate the city's serious shortage of
low-cost housing for the lower income groups, and, by financing the
requisite studies, will also facilitate the fonau2ation of an integrated
urban development policy for Kingston area. More widely,the proposed
infrastructural investments would help strengthen the institutions
concerned.



13.       In the social areas, in addition to the proposed sites and services
project, we propose to continue our association with the education sector
with a third education project. However, ths scope of this project will
not be defined until the conclusions of a recent survey of the education
sector, undertaken by AID with Bank participation, have been considered
and more progress made in implementing the ongoing second project. Further
ahead, it is expected that s econd family planning project, which might
include a nutritional component, would be considered.
14.       In the directly productiive sectors, the Bank is already involved
in agriculture through a loan to the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) for on-
lending for agriculture credits and a second loan is currently under
consideration. At the request of the government, the Bank assisted in the
conduct of an agricultural sector survey with a view to revitalizing this
sector as a means of promoting exports, stimulating import substitution and
helping to check the population drift from the rural to the urban areas.
We expect to be able to assist the government in implementing the program
of action which has emerged from this study, and will be placing increasing
emphasis on agriculture in our future lending to Jamaica. Detailed feasi-
bility studies are already under way which should result in a project for
Bark financing tD rehabilitate the important sugar industry. Looking
further ahead, it is expected that the government would wish the Bank to
assist in the preparation and financing of a project designed to ameliorate
the situation of the small farmer;   the content and scope of such a project
have not yet been defined but may take the form of a rural development
project including components for improving land utilization and crop
production.
PART III - HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPK.MT IN JAMAICA
Housing Requirements
15.       Jamaica has a population of about 1.9 million.   The population
growth rate in the urbanized areas is more than twice the national rate
of about 1.5, per annum net of emigration.   About half of thie increase in
the urban population is the result of immigration from the rural areas.
It is government policy to check the exodus from the rural areas by
revitalizing the agricultural sector and by providing improved rural
services and amenities. At the same time the government is seeking to
promote new urban growth centers outside the congested Kingston-Spanish
Town metropolitan axis. However, if present trends continue, the result-
ing population pressures in this and other urbanized centers will maks
critical an already serious low-cost housing shortage. In 1960, Kingston
had 376,000 inhabitants or 23% of the national population; at present it
accounts for over 25% and if its present annual growth rate of about 2.9%
is projected to 1990 the population of Kingston would by then reach 914,000
or 35% of the projected national population. Population growth rates in
Jamaica's next three largest cities where one-third of the project will be
located - Montego Bay (population 50,000), Spanish Town (population 48,000)
and Maypen (population 32,000) - are even higher.



-D -
16.       Urban population growth, particularly in Kingston, has far
ouboaiced the construction of low-cost housing and related infrastructure.
Consequently, there has been a proliferation of squatter settlements in
over-crowded shanty towns which lack basic sanitary facilities. It is
estimated that over the next ten years the averaige annual low-income
housing needs for the four largest cilies, including the replacement of
obsolescent housing, would ra ge frnm 3,000 to 4,900 for Kingston,
380 to 720 for Montego Bay, 620 to 1,350 for Spanish Town and 230 to 480 for
iNaypen.
17.       The need for an early expansion of low-cost housing in Jamaica's
urban areas is maeLde more acute by the high level of urban unemployment.
KinLgsl.on's unemployment is estimated a-t 25%, significantly above the national
nver;Ae cf abouu 15%. This results in severe maldistribution of income and
Js conducive to a high rate oE crime not only in Kingston but also in other
,owns such as IIIonterc Bay where the contrast between the squatter settlements
and luxur-y hotels is stark.
Governmen C Pro-rams
18.      The government presently provides assistlnce to the housing.sector
throaa_hl a variety of heavily subsidized schemes which in some cases result in
subsidies of up to 4hCV of costs. For the 1973/74 fiscal year the government
has provided about J$8-5 million for housing construction and assistance
through its housing Fund, net of J$1.6 million as receipts in the form of
paymenL_ by house and land purchasers. There are a variety of government
housing sche-nes; government housing is however relativelv costly and-
subsidies notwithstanding, for the most part falls outside the reach of
the lowest incre groups. The government Sales and Rental units (which is
t.he larrgest prooram and accounts for over 4o% of the 1973/74 expenditure)
sell for aroundd J$3,500 (or the equivalent in rent) for a one-bedroom apart-
ment in Kingston and would cost considerably more without subsidization.
Other schemes include slum clearance accomodation under which squatters are
given temporary shelter while more permanent structures are built, owner-
occupied schemes under which owners or occupiers with long leases are given
financial assistance to expand their houses, and assistance to middle-income
cooperative housing estates. Only two small programs, largely confined to
non-urban areas and neither operated by the Ministry of Housing, are geared
.c cow-income groups. These are the indigent housing scheme run by the
linistry cf Local Government which provides cheap subsidized housing units
for the -zer, poor, and farm houses administered by the Ministry of Agriculture
i.n the rural areas. Neather scheme provides basic infrastructure.
19.       More recently the government, recognizing that its existing schemes
were not, meet-in- the needs of the low-incomr  segrents of the urban population,
adopt ed a new low-income housing strategy based on the self-help sites and
services approach; this approach is seen by the government as the key to the
provisiorn of low-cost. housing and as a solution to the proliferating squatter
p:roblern; it is the govern=ent's intention that this approach should grow into
: long-term and majoIr operation of the Mlinistry of Housing.



- 7-
Urban Development and Planning
20.       There is an urgent need to analyze and coordinate the diverse
investment programs of the major agencies influencing urban growth in the
Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA). At present substantial investments are
under way or planned by important public agencies and by government depart-
ments without reference to an integrated urban development plan for the city.
Industrial and commercial location decisions also have a major impact on
growth patterns in the Kingston area, but such decisions are at present not
being taken with full regard to their economic and social consequences or
within a clearly established urban development policy. Responsibility for
various aspects of planning and controlling growth in KRA is formally vested
in the Town Planni.ng Authority (responsible to the Ministry of Minirng and
Natural Resources), the Kingston and St. Andrews Corporation (KSAC) and the
Mrinistry of Local Government; in practice, however, the pattern of investment
is largely determined by fragmented decisions, such as those taken by the
Urban Development Corporation (UDC), a government agency, which is currently
underLaking major urban renewal investments and land development projects in
the city. The municipal authority, the KSAC, is a small operation which is
responsible for basic city services and exercises little effective control
over urban investments. Although the KSAC and the parish councils are
designated by law as local planning authorities, their lack of qualified staff,
limited financial resources and political relationships generally preclude them
from effectively exercising this role.
21.       The lack of an adequate framework for urban development in Kingston
has been compounded by an anachronistic property tax system which is based on
land values assessed in the 1930s. In addition to eroding the fiscal base
for a program of urban renewal and improved municipal services, the system
has encouraged land speculation and discouraged development. This problem
was discussed by the Bank with the government during the preparation of the
sites and services project. Following upon -;hese discussions, the govern-
ment has recently substantially raised property tax rates throughout
Jamaica and initiated an updating of real property values which the govern-
ment has agreed should be completed by December 31, 1974 (draft Loan Agree-
ment; Section 3.08).
22.       The National Planning Agency (NPA), which is responsible for
macro-economic planning and project development and review at the national
level, is establishing a group toundertake urban planning in an effort to
integrate its physical and economic aspects. The Kingston Regional Plan,
prepared during 1967-71 by the government with UNDP assistance, provides
a 20-year perspective against wfhich to draw up an integrated urban develop-
ment plan for Kingston for the five years (1976-80); for this purpose
the proposed sites and services project includes a technical assistance com-
ponent for an urban growth and management study to be undertaken under the
auspices of the National Planning Agency. The study will include the pre-
paration of a capital budget taking into account prospective fiscal resources
and requirements, and will make recommnendations on institutional reform for
urban planning and its control in the KMA.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       A Bank mission from the Urban Projects Department identified the
project in July 1972; various Bank missions dunring the following year assisted
in it-s preparation. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington
in January 1974. The negotiating delegation for the Borrower was led by
IIr. R. Mullings, Deputy Financial Secretary, Y.inistry of Finance.
2^.       A report entitled "Jamaica - Appraisal of a Sites and Services Project"
(No. Z)ba-JM dated April 12, 1974) is being distributed separately to the Executive
Directors. The main features of the loan and the project are summarized in
Annex III.
Objectives
25.       The project is designed to bring self-help housing, essential com-
munity services and job opportunities to Jamaica's lower income groups. Because
of it is largely self-financing it is expected that this project will provide
the model for a national sites and services program with which the Bank could
be associated. Important objectives of the project include the achievement of
institutional reforms in the Ministry of Housing that will provide the executing
capability for a long-term, low-income housing program and the preparaticn of
an urban development strategy for the Kingston area. The project would also
provide additional employment rhtough the self-help element for housing exten-
sion and through the additional jobs (about 1,000) to be created through the
small-scale industries component.
Project Description
26.       The proposed project comprises the provision of:
(a) approximately 6,000 serviced lots distributed among six sites
in jour cities;
(b)  related infrastructure and community facilities (125 primary
school classroomis, 14 day-care centers/basic schools, 8 health centers,
12 community centers, 5 trade schools, 9 police posts and 7 market sheds);
(c) core units for individual water, sewerage and electricity
services, offering three different starting points for self-help construction
(see Annex IV);
(d) a construction materials fund to induce self-help housing
extension;
(e) upgrading of two existing squatter areas in Kingston and one
in Montego Bay affecting about 2,750 householders;
(2)  industrial financing for small- to medium-scale industries
t.o be located in or adjacent to the sites; and
(g)  tecrhnical assistance for (i) a study aimed at the reorgani-
zation of the Mlinis try of Housing and reformulation of its long-term housing
program; (ii) an urban growth and management study (see paragraph 22 above);
(iii.) the preparation of detailed engineering; (iv)training for staff executing
the project; and (v) monitoring of the progress and impact of the project.



- 9 -
27.       The 6,ooo new serviced lots would be provided at six site locLtions,
three in Kingston (Marcus Garvey, Camiplands, Hunts Bay), one in Spanish Town
(Prison Farmlands), one in Montego Bay (Catherine EIall) and one in Maypen
(Bushy Park). About two-thirds of the lots would be located in Kingston since
that is where low-cost housing deficiency is most acute. The individual
sites were chosen after taking into account employment and transport linkages,
edisting and planned investments in the areas concerned and the availability
and cost of land.   All lots would have individual water, sewerage, and
electricity connections.
28.        The basic units would offer three lot development options as
starting points for self-help expansion (see Annex IV). The simplest and
cheapest lot option would provide installed sanitary and electricity services
plus materials for self-help construction of a core unit, shelter and room
enclosure. The two more developed and more expensive lot options would have
greater pre-built components. During the first year of the three-year
construction period about 40% of the lots would be at the simplest level, 40%
at the next, and 20% at the highest service level. The self-help component
would be progressively increased in the second and third years by gradually
eliminating the more expensive units as experience is gained in self-help
construction techniques. So as to induce extension of individual dwellings
after the basic facilities have been constructed and thereby demonstrate tiat
the sites and services approach is an appropriate long-term response to
Jamaica's low-income housing needs, it is proposed to offer householders
loans of up to US$440 for the purchase of materials for self-help extension.
It is expected that about 4,000 of the 6,000 lot beneficiaries would take out
such loans from the proposed construction materials fund (paragraph 37 below).
Community Facilities and On-site Infrastructure
29.        It is proposed that community facilities (as listed in paragraph 26(b)
above) should be constructed at the sites to provide education, health and
other community services readily available to the household families. The
design for the community facilities will generally conform to the usual
government standards although modifications will be made to gear the facilities
to the needs of low income communities. The basic schools and community
meeting halls will also serve as day care centers. Small buildings for use
as trade training centers will be constructed on the Marcus Garvey and
Spanish Town sites adjacent to the proposed small industries (paragraphs 31
and 32 below). The trade training centers and health clinics would serve the
project households as well as other local communities. On-site infrastructure
would include roads, water supply, sewerage, drainage and electricity.
Squat-ter Settlements
30.       Government is reluctant to embark upon extensive squatter upgrading so
as not to encourage squatting in unviable areas; nevertheless, the government
recognizes that there are areas which justify improvement, and it will continue
to identify possible new areas for upgrading as a complement to the national
sites and services program.    The upgrading component of the project will bring
basic services (roads, drainage, water connections, elect.ricity lines) and
community facilities as required to three areas where low-income families are



- 10 -
alreadOy living at two locations in Kingston (Cockburn Pen and Drewsland) and
one location at Montego Bay (North Gulley) and would affect a total of about
2,7'rD ho(useholds. These areas have been selected since, for the most part, it
is economically and technically feasible to put in the requisite sernices, the
sites dlo not present health or safety hazards, and the areas appear to fit into
a sensible growth pattern for Kingston and IIontego Bay.
''miall Indus-tries
31.       This part cf the proJect is designed to link employment with low-
4ncome housing. It will aim at improving 'the incomes of the poorest households
by provicding employment and related training to unskilled family members and
thereby 'elp stabilize the newly created communities. The proposed small
industries, numbering between 10 and 20 would be located at the sites and
are epq)ec-ted to create about 1,000 new jobs over a three-year period. The
Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation (J:'DC), a government agency, would
dentXli! suitable industries, prepare feasibility studies, find private
entreoreneurs willing to invest in the sub-projects and provide industrial
trainiL.. The Jamaica Development Bank (JDB), another government entity,
using as its agent its recently established affiliate,   the Development
Ven"ture Capital Financing Company  (DVCF), would appraise the sub-projects
for their financial, economic, and technical viability and would assess the
mana,erial capabilities of the entrepreneurs.   It is envisaged that the
selected private partner would in each case own a minimum of 51% of the
eqluity.  The remainder would initially be held by the JIDC and the JDB but
may eventually be resold to third parties with provision for worker partici-
pation in appropriate cases.  The JDB itself would provide the necessary
long-tecm loan financing and help the entrepreneur find any required short-
term working capital from commercial bankcs. JIDC will assign three
professionally qualified staff to be responsible for the promotion of the
enterurises and the preparation of feasibility studies.
32.       It is estimated that total expenditures on the industries would be
about US$3.8 million including working capital;it is proposed that the
government should on-lend part of the proceeds of the Bank loan amounting to
USPl .9 million, representing 50% of expenditures, to the JDB for its long-term
loan financing requirements for the sub-projects. Appraisal reports would be
submit tec for prior Bank approval for each of the first five industrial
sub-loans and for all o-ther sub-loans exceeding US$275,000. Bank funds would
bo on-lent to JDB by the government at 7-1/4, plus a fee of one percent to
cover the foreign eIchange risk.  JDB's sub-loans would bear an interest rate
set initially at the same level as the prinm rate (currently 11%) prevailing
when t1r Sub-roan is made.  1^i-t the end of the period of grace of each sub-loan,
,he interest rate will be increased by two percentage points and will remain at
that level until the sub-loan has been repaid.  The sub-lcans would have a
mnaimum grace period of three years and, unless the Bank otherwise agrees, a
tern  not exceeding 15 years. The amortization of the government loan to the
1DB would be based on the composite amortization of the sub-loans to the
enterprises.  The anortization of this part of the Bank loan would in turn



conformJ t~ the amortization schedule of' the fands on-lent by the government
to the JDB.   The terms of the on-lending to JDB by the government would be
covered by a Subsidiary Loan Agreement to be approved by the Bank and
executed as a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.   The terms and
conditions upon which the JDB would on-lend to the small enterprises are
embodied in the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the JDB.
Project Costs
33.       Total project costs (net of duties and taxes) are estimated at
US$30.0 million,exaluding land valued at about uS$4.9 million.   Of the total
Us$h.9 million land valuation, only US$1.2 million is being purchased by the
government; the remainder has been acquired by the Ministry of Housing through
inter-government transfers and, for the purpose of the economic analysis, has
been valued a-t its opportunity cost. The overall foreign exchange costs of the
project are estimated at about 23%. However, for reasons mentioned
in paragraph 8 above, and in order to give the Bank an adequate role in
this project, it is proposed that we finance some local costs and that
the Bank loan should therefore cover 50% of total project costs, excluding
land. On this basis the Bank loan would amount to US$15.0 million. It
is proposed that the loan have a term of 25 years including six years of
grace except for that part amounting to US$1.9 million equivalent which
would be re-lent to the JDB and would be amortized on the same terms as
is usual for Bank loans to Development Finance Companies (paragraph 32).
34.      The cost estimates for the civil works component are based on
detailed engineering for the first-year sites and preliminary engineering
for the second- and third-year sites. For the first-year sites average on-
site infrastructure costs assignable to residential lots are estimated at
J$690. Since, however, certain on-site infrastructure costs would be
recovered by the water and sewerage and electricity public utilities through
standard monthly user charges, these costs will be deducted from the lots in
computing their basic price so as to avoid double charging of the low-income
householders covered by the project.    In the case of the first-year sites
these deductible costs would average J$380 per lot, leaving J$300 to be
included in the lot costs. The remaining on-site infrastructure costs (about
20 of the total) have been allocated to the industrial and community
facilities. On-lot costs, depending on the level of the three service develop-
ment options, are estimated at J$1,110, J$1,360 and J$1,740 including the cost
of materials for initial self-help construction estimated at J$620, J$490
and J$250 respectively. Total lot costs would thus average for the first-year
sites from about J$1,410 to J$2,040 depending on the level of lot service
development installed.   These COsts are estimated to be about one third the
cost of fully built low income housing now available in Jamaica.
Terms and Financial Conditions
35.      Selection of lot beneficiaries would be based on the followina
criteria. Annual household incomes of beneficiaries should not exceed J$1,500
(a figure falling in the 50th to 60th percentiles on the urban income dis-
tribution curve) at the time of lot allocation. Within this ceiling about
25% of the lots would be reserved for households with annual incomes not



- 12 -
exceeding J$900 (estimated to be about; the 33rd income percentile during the
allocation period). Preference would be given to families satisfying these
criteria already residing in areas adjacent to the sites. In order to keep
the project as fully self-financing as possible while simultaneously reaching
the lowest income groups, 25% of the lots would be charged a premium of J$200
each based on locational advantage, which premium would be used to provide
a subsidy to the 25% lowest income beneficiaries (earning less than J$900 per
annum) by reducing their mortgage by an equivalent amount.
36.       Serviced lots would be offered on a 40-year, renewable leasehold
basis with security of tenure and compensatioh for any eventual government
re'aL]ing. Leaseholds would be on an owner-occupier basis; however, subletting
of rooms would be permitted because there are many single migrants into
cities and this policy would provide for supplemental household incomes per-
nitting the project to reach dowfn to the lowest iincome levels. The terms and
conditions of the lease, acceptable to theBank, would be drawn up prior to
_llorzmencl (draft Loan Agreement; Section 3.04 (b)).
37.       Loans of up to US$440 would be made available to households from
t1he proposed materials construction fund, which would be financed from the
mort-a -e dolwm oavmients, and would be repayable over a madimum period of four
years at 12 ' per annum. Allottees who borrow from the materials fund would be
el Jibole to receive a grace period on the mor'tgage payments of up to four
years, depending on the term of the loan; premium lots would not be eligible
for such a grace period.
38.       Prospective householders will be required to makce a minimum down-
payment of J$150. The average down-payment is expected to amount to J$200.
f;Jhen this is subtracted fromr the a-verage costs (including net assig-nable
on-site infrastru ture costs), for instance, of thle cheapest lot development,
capita3l investkAmen-ts for the Lirst, second and third-year sites of J$1,210,
J$1,465 and J$1,710 per lot would remain to be recovered. These sums would
be recover-d by mortgage payments over a maximum period of 25 years. The
intarest rate on mortgages will be fixed at thrle percentage points below the
IOr,ne rate (currently 11?f) prevailing when the mortgage agreement is made.
This compares with a maxirmum mortgage interest rate of 1 25o offered by local
building societies and an interest rate of 8od at present charged by the
Min-stry of iousing for mortgages on its other housing program. On the basis
of an 8% mortgage interest rate and a term of 25 years, average monthly
i,iortgage payments for the first, second and third-year siites would amount
to J$9.50, J$11.40 and J$13.30 , respectively. The figures of costs and
monthly recovery rates in individual cases would vary from site to site
and would be higlher for more developed lot options. Monthly user charges
"or water, sew;erage and electricity would average approximately J$8.00. To
this would be added the monthly charge of J$1.00 per household for site
maintenance and garbage collection and a land ren'tal charge.  For all but
the subsidized lo-ts the land rental charge would start at J$2.QO per month
for the first five years and increase progressively thereafter; for the
non-subsidized lots (75J of the total) this would result in an average charge
of about J$14.00 per month, the latter representing the estimated average
economi3 opportunity cost of the land. The subsidized lots (2% of the
total) would be charged J$1 .00 per month during the grace period and a
i-c-ie charge of J:,2.00 per month there.fter.

39.       Data about income distribution and household expenditures in
Jamaica is sparse.  hIowever, assuming that householders spend on average
up to about one-third of their annual incomes on housing and related
ep)enditure., a non-subsidized lot would be affordable at incaaes averaging
about J$800 per annum during the allocation period; cross-subsidization
would facilitate reaching even lower income families, down to about the 25th
percentile, while keeping the project as fully self-financing as possible.
procurement and Disbursement
40.       It is expected that between six and eight contracts, varying in
amount between US$1.0 million and US$4.0 million each, will be let for the
civil works. Firms would be able to bid on one or more of a number of lc-
cations and on one or more components (infrastructure, core units, community
facilities) as they are tendered and the lowest combination of bids would be
selected.  The civil works (apart from the factories) would be undertaken
on the basis of international competitive bidding; since the work is unlikely
to be attractive to firms not already established in Jamaica, it is planned
thaL the bidding should be advertised only in local newspapers and by
notification to embassies. The factories would be bid for locally on an
individual basis.
,1 .     The amount of the Bank loan is equivalent to 5of of total project
costs excluding land. Since, however, Bank funds would not be disbursed
against the construction materials fund (which is to be financed from the
householders' down-payments), disbursements of the Bank loan would be made
at the rate of 54L of expenditures for infrastructure, community fa-ilities,
lob developrment and technical assistance. Disbursements on the industries
component would be at the rate of 75% of capital costs excluding working
capital. In view of Kingston's critical low-cost housing needs, preparatory
work for project execution is under way. It is therefore proposed that
project expenditures which may be incurred before the date of the Loan
Agreement, but not before February 15, 1974 and not exceeding Us$500,000 in
total, be financed retroactively from the loan proceeds.
Project Execution
42.       The executing agency for the project would be the Ministry of
Housing, which has established a special Sites and Services Unit to imple-
ment this project. Appointment of the Director of the Unit in consultation
with the Bank is expected prior to the scheduled consideration of the loan
by the Executive Directors. Consultants to provide trAining for the staff
of the Sites and Services Unit and to assist in the completion of detailed
engineering would be financed from the Bank loan. The Unitwouldbe responsible
for supervising the construction of the houBing lots, infrastructure and
community facilities. When cmstruction of the community facilities has been
completed theywouldbe transferred to the appropriate Ministries for staffing
and maintenance (i.e. Ministries of Educatiop, Health and Youth and Community
Development). The unitwouldalso provide technical advice to householders
for self-help construction andwouldsupervise cmstruction of the infrastructure
and core units by private contractors. The small industries componentwould
be executed by the JDB and its affiliated DVCF in close collaboration
with the JIDC. The costs of a consultant for one year to help DVCF to



-I4-
execute its responsibilities under the industries part of the project
would be financed from the Bank loan. Thet Jamaica Credit Union League,
a non-profit organization established in 1942 and registered under the
Jamaica Cooperative Societies Law, would handle the construction materials
fund and the monthly mortgage and land paym3nts. The League is better
equipped to handle these transactions than the Ministry and would offer
on-site assistance and guidance to householders.
43.       A Sites and Services Coordinating Committee, comprising repre-
senlatives from all agencies concerned with the project would be established
to coordinate the many different components of the project. It would also
provide a useful mechanism for developing and implementing a continuing sites
and services program. In order to assess the success achieved in meeting the
social, and economic objectives of the project, it is proposed thF,t the project
be moni-tored and evaluated by qualified professionals contracted for this
purpose by the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University
of the Wlest Indies, and an amount of US$300,000 has been included in project
costs for this work.
h)4.      Apart from the specific arrangements required for project execution,
there is need to review the wider organization and operations of the Ministry
of Housing and to reformulate its long-term programs and policies. The
Kinistry a-t present undertakes a variety of housing programs (paragraph 18
above) and a thorough evaluation of them is needed to see to what extent
they need reformulation. Following such an evaluation, consideration would
need to be given to the organization and staffing of the Ministry. The fi-
nancial administration of some of the Ministry's housing programs is poor,
although improving, and substantial arrears have developed. Also, the
Ministry operdtes a Stores and Workshop Unit which manufactures housing com-
ponents for the government schemes; although the unit has materials worth up to
J$2.O million on hand with sizable plant and equipment, there is no commercial
accounting in its operations. Consultants to be financed under the project
would be engaged by the Ministry, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, to undertake a review of the Ministry's programs, organization, staffing
requirements and accounting procedures.
Economic Justification
The project would help alleviate a severe shortage of low-cost housing
in Jamaica's largest cities and put such housing within the financial reach of
the lowest income groups reaching down as far as the 25th percentile. The sites and
services approach, largely through the use of self-help construction and consolida-
tion, would provide lower-cost housing than existing public housing programs and,
because it is largely self-financing,can serve as a model for a long-term national
sites and services program. The project,through its small-industries component,would
provide an estimated 1,000 additional jobs and opportunity for training for presently



- 15 -
unemployed workers and would thereby raise the family income levels of
the participating households and help stabilize the new communities. The
project would have a substantial redistribution of income effect in favor
of low-incorme households by providing them with housing at a cost sub-
stantially below the market value for comparable accommodation. The
technical assistance component would leac' to the rationalization of the
governmant's existing housing programs and to the improvement of the
organization and operations of the Ministry of Housing.
46.       It is difficult to quantify the net economic benefits which
would result from the project and therefore to calculate a conventional
economic rate of return. The economic justification for the project rests
primarily on the fact that the houses which would be built under the project
would generate imputed rental values in excess of the cost incurred. In
addition to the net benefits deriving fram imputed rentals, other benefits
flowing directly to participating households include increased employment
opportunities and earning ability brought about by improved public services
and, in some cases, economies in transport costs to and from places of
employment because of locational advantages. Other external berefits to
the economy include reduction in the criim rate and reductions in the
health and child welfare expenditures within the areas affected. The costs
include the opportunity cost of the land used for housing, cost of the
housing structures and infrastructure serving the housing units, maintenance
of the infrastructure and the value of the self-help labor. On this basis
the internal rate of return for the project averages about 14.4%. If a
shadow price of 50, for labor is used to reflect its cost to the economy in
a high unemployment situation the project rate of return increases to nearly
17.0%. In the worst case postulated of various sensitivity tests (the dele-
tion of the rest of the economy benefits, reduction of household benefits by
20Y,', and an increase in the cost of dodestic materials by 10%) the project
still 7ields an es-Limated return of 10.1%.
PART V  - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank and the JDB, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement,
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       In addition to the features of the Loan Agreement which are referred
to in paragraph 31 above, Schedule I, paragraph 3 of the Loan Agreement makes
the receilpt by the Bank of satisfactory assurances regarding the participation
of JIDC and DVCF in the small industries component of the project a condition
of disbursing against sub-loans for 8X811 industriesa.



- 16 -
49.       I am satisfied that; the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECaOMENDATION
50.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take
full account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices.
iHowever, available information indicates that the proposed loan remains
fully justified.
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C. Projects in Execution
Ln No. 4k68 First Education Project; US$9.5 million of September 30, 1967
Closing Date: October 31, 1973
After substantial delays the project was completed in October 1973
over two years behind the original schedule. Delays in implementation due
to changes in site locations, design variations and poor management, together
with inflation have resulted in substantial cost overruns in construction.
Final costs'exceed appraisal estimates by about 50%. The loan closing date
originally July 31, 1971, was postponed three times, first to December 31, 1972,
then to June 30, 1973 and finally to October, 1973. The Bank plans shortly
to undertake a special supervision mission for a thorough review of the whole
execution of this project.
Ln No. 727   Second Education Project; US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Managerial weaknesses in both the Education Ministry and the project
unit have caused delays in the implementation of the project; implementation is
about, two years behind appraisal schadule.  It is now expectad that all the pro-
ject items will be completed by December 1976.   A postponement of the closing date
by a year and a half is likely to be required.   Because of the late implementation,
devaluation on the United States dollar and international inflation a cost overrun
o:' '-2,2', is likely. During the latest supervision mission, in March 1974, some
improvement was noted in the perfonTance and staffing of the project unit. The vacanrt
posts o' architect and procurement officer will be filled shortly.    However, there i3
no candidate to replace the project director, whose contract expires in July, and there
may be short-run delaying effects in the implementation of the project from the recent
transfers of the Minister of Education and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry.
Ln No. 454   Power Project; US$22 million of June 20, 1966
Closing Date: June 30, 1970
The physical execution of the project has been completed. The
loan closed June 30, 1970, six months after the original closing date of
December 31, 1969. Completion of the project was delayed largely due to a
tight financial position during 1970 and 1971 when, in spite of repeated
approaches by the Bank, the government was not prepared to allow a much needed
tarifr' increase. The Borrower's position improved in May 1972 when a substantial
rate increase of about 27% was implemented, although increased costs since then
have again weakened the Borrower's financial position.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Ln No. 719   Agricultural Credit Project; US$3.7 million of December 28, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
After a slow start the project has picked up momentum during the
last year and over US$3.0 million of the Bank loan has now been canmitted.
Disbursements have not improved equally but the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB)
has taken steps to streamline and simplify procedures which have mainly
accounted for the delays. The Bank has recently agreed to a second realloca-
tion of the loan proceeds to increase credit availability for beef and dairy
production. It is expected that the Bank loan will be fully committed by
end-May1974.
Ln No. 690   Population Project; US$2.0 million of June 18, 1970
Closing Date: March 31, l975
There have been delays in the design/construction programs for the
Victoria Jubilee Hospital (VJH) and ten rural maternity centers (RMCs), due pri-
marily to problems of coordination, and weaknesses in the management of the family
planning program. However, more recently improved progress has been made in imple-
menting some of the principal aspects of the program. Construction of all ten RMCs
has been physically completed although there have been delays in commissioning them.
Construction has started on the VJH expansion; however, the contractor has ex-
perienced a number of on-site problems and shortage of credit. Progress has been
slow in implementing the training and home encouragement aspects of the family
planning program, but intensified efforts are now being made in these areas. The
whole project is to be reviewed during a Bank mission scheduled for end-April.
Ln.No. 598   Kingston Water Supply Project; US$5.0 million of May 14, 1969
Closing Date: December 31, 197i
After initial delays over the acquisition of land rights and in the
award of contracts implementation of the physical aspects of the project has
improved and the works are now partially in operation. Full service should be
in operation by May 1974, although optimum pressure will not be available until
after delivery of certain booster pumping equipment in about 12 months' time.
The loan closing date, originally June 30, 1972, has been postponed to
December 31, 1973 and again to December 31, 1974. However, the financial
position of the Water Commission remains weak and the annual rates of return over
the last three fiscal years were significantly below the 8% required in the Loan
Agreement. Substantial increases in water rates were introduced in June 1973,
but since then increased operating costs, largely due to higher wages, have
again eroded the Commissionli; financial position. However, consideration is
being given to measures to reduce the institution's operating costs and to
ensure the maintenance of adequate revenues from water tariffs. Measures to
remedy staffing and management weaknesses are currently under discussion
betwee the Bank and the Borrower.

Ln No. 408   First Highway Project; US$5.5 million of April 8, 1965
Closing Date: March 31, 1973
By mid-1968 the execution of the project had been delayed and its
cost had increased by about 50% due to underestimation of work volumez
lack of cost experience in Jamaica and increased right-of-way costs and"
engineering fees. Due to these problems the Bank agreed to postpone the
closing date of the loan by two years to March 31, 1972, and reduce the pro-
ject's scope by omitting the construction of one road section. Further com-
plications arose in March 1972, when due to labor disturbances work was
suspended for about six months. The Bank agreed to further postponements
in the loan closing date from March 31, 1972, to December 31, 1972, and then
to March 31, 1973, to allow continued loan disbursements to the completion
of the project. There was a 60% cost overrun on the project. The estimated
rate of return on the affected part of the project at appraisal ranged from
10 to 25%. Taking into account the cost increases we estimate that the rate
of return would now range from about 10 to 15%.
Ln No. 899   Road Improvement and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million
of June 1, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This loan became effective August 31, 1973 and is progressing
satisfactorily. Consultants to carry out the technical assistance component
of the project have been appointed as have their government counterparts.
Bidding for the first phase of resealing went out for tender in early March
and ,York will commence in May 1974. A number of roads to be resealed under
the project were damaged by recent floods. In order to get them back into
operation as quickly as possible and prevent further deterioration, the Bank
agreed that about 40 miles of the total 250 miles to be resealed under the
project should be repaired by force account rather than by contractors.

JAMAICA - SITES AND SERVICES PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:               Jamaica
Amount:                 US$15.0 million equivalent in various currencies.
Beneficiary:            Part of the proceeds of the loan would be relent to the
Jamaica Development Bank (JDB).
Terms:                  The loan would have a term of 25 years, including six years
of grace, with interest at 7j6 per annum, except for
US$1.9 million equivalent which would be relent to the
JDB. The amortization schedule of this part of the Bank
loan would be based on the composite amortization of
JDB's sub-loans to the small industries.
Relending Terms:        Part of the Iroceeds of the loan amounting to US$1.9 mil-
lion equivalent would be relent to the Jamaica Development
Bank with interest at 74 per annum. The amortization of
this part of the loan would conform substantially to the
composite amortization of the JDB sub-loans to the industrial
enterprises. The government would charge the JDB a fee of
one percent for bearing the foreign exchange risk.
ProJect Description:    The project consists of: infrastructure for 6,000 self-
help housing lots with individual sanitary and electricity
services; related community facilities (e.g. schools,
health centers, community centers); a construction
materials fund to induce self-help extension of houses;
financing of small-to medium-scale industrial investments
at the sites, provision of infrastructure and community
facilities at threel existing squatter settlements; a
review of the programs, organization and staffing of the
Ministry of Housing; an urban growth and management study;
assistance to and training for staff executing the project;
and monitoring and evaluation of the project.
Estimated Cost and
Financing Plan:         Total project costs are estimated at $30.0 million (exclud-
ing land costs valued at $4.9 million) of which the foreign
exchange component is estimated at $8.0 million (about 23%).
The proposed Bank loan would amount to the equivalent of
5Q% of the total project costs excluding land. The govern-
ment would finance the remaining costs from budgetary
resources and householders' down-payments apart from the
small industries component which would be financed by the

Procurement
Arrmanements             The civil works (apart from factories) would be undertaken on
the basis of international competitive bidding and would be
advertised for tendering in local newspapers and by notification
to local embassies. The works will be bid in six to eight
contracts varying in amount between $1.0 million and $4.0 mil-
lion each. Local bids will be called on an individual basis for
factory construction. The small amount of equipment required
for the smal industries investments will be procured through
normal commercial channels. It is proposed that project expendi-
tures which may be incurred before the date of the Loan Agreement,
but not before February 13), 1974,, and not exceeding US$500,000
in aggregate, be financed retroactively from the loan proceeds.
Technical
Assistance:              Consultants will be engaged (a) to review the programs, organi-
zation, staffing rnquirements and accounting procedures of the
Ministry of Housing; (b) to carry out an Urban Growth and
Management study; tad (c) to assist in the preparation of
detailed engineering. The project will be monitored and evaluated
by consultants to be contracted for this purpose by the University
of the West Indies.
Rate of Return:         The economic rate of return is estimated at about 14.0%.
Appraisal Report:       No. 294A-JM   dated April 12, 1974.
