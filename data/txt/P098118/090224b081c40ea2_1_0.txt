                         Overall, implementation under SDNRP has been moderately satisfactory and the team is confident that that project will be fully disbursed by the project closing date of May 31, 2013.
                         The Ministry of Mines and Petroleum has adopted international norms for transparent, competitive and non-discretionary administration of the sector – and is demonstrating
                         significant change in its’ performance. Key achievements against the project development objectives include the following:
Public Disclosure Copy




                         1) Effective review by the Ministry with advice from the International Advisory Council (IAP) - : Over the life of the project there have been enhanced transparency, competition, and
                         fairness of mineral and hydrocarbon agreement, with oversight and advice from the IAP, including: 1) the publishing of all mining and hydrocarbon contracts as set out by a
                         Presidential Decree (2012); 2) the completion of two internationally competitive hydrocarbon bid rounds, the results of which were published on the MOM&P website; 3) adopting and
                         implementing a transparent competitive tender for the Aynak copper resource (2006-2009) through to negotiation of a mineral development agreement and publication of the IAP
                         2012 report on third-party monitoring of the Aynak process; 4) adopting and implementing four internationally competitive tenders for four mineral deposits, with the assistance for the
                         US government’s Task Force for Stabilization Business Operations; and 5) licensing of small scale mining through the issuance of 10+ new licenses and publishing them to the
                         website. In addition, on-going capacity building of the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) to review regulatory instruments for new mining operations has led to a
                         deeper engagement by NEPA on sector monitoring and regulatory oversight.

                         2a) The MoM&P is demonstrating transparent, non-discretionary licensing practices. MoM&P has issued of mining titles within the timeframe defined in the Minerals Law- The IAP
                         was established under the project as part of the third-party monitoring of the tender processes for Aynak and Hajigak, reporting on compliance-related issues. To improve efficiency
                         the IAP has recommended that the tender methodology established under the Minerals Law be modified to place stricter time limits on the project sponsor meeting financial close – a
                         recommendation being adopted. In addition, MoM&P has demonstrated improved contractual monitoring through an international consultancy (GAF) building staff capacity around
                         contractual and regulatory obligations on an ongoing basis.
                         2b) MoM&P has adopted competitive award for licensing of hydrocarbon and mining assets using international competitive tender. This provision was provided for under the 2005
                         Hydrocarbon Law and 2009 Mining; with the latter revised to remove “first come / first served? in order to align mining to hydrocarbon in which all new resource assets undergo
                         competitive tender.

                         3a) MoM&P has demonstrated capacity to grow the mining sector using global norms. Two new medium-size mines under development by 2010: The Aynak deposit, awarded to
                         Mining Metals Corportion of China through a competitive international tender 2006 – 2008, MCC (now named MJAM) has (a) explored the property and (b) is preparing a feasibility
                         study, environmental / social impact assessment, environmental social management plan and mine closure plan. Development by MJAM has been slow, with the submission of
                         these documents remaining outstanding. From 2010 – 2012 MoM&P completed international competitive tender of the Hajagak iron ore desposit. Negotiation is concluding on a
                         mineral development agreement.

                         3b) MoM&P has demonstrated capacity to grow the hydrocarbon sector using global norms. Two hydrocarbon licensing round: In 2012 MoM&P, with the assistance of the Task Force
                         for Business Stabilization & Operations (US Dept. of Defense), undertook a second hydrocarbon licensing round. The Bank team, through the SDNRP, shared the successful tender
                         methodology for Aynak. A block in the Amu Darya basin was assigned to China’s National Petroleum Corporation (CPNC) which in October 2012 started extracting oil, a first step
                         towards hydrocarbons generating significant revenues to the GoA and provide some added confidence to international investors.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         TThis ISR is based on on-going discussions with the Project Management Unit and findings from a series of periodic supervision missions to Afghanistan which took place during the
                         period of April – March 2013. The following key decisions were reached with the Government during that period:
                         •        Need to maintain MoM&P momentum around preservation of cultural heritage at Mes Aynak and country-wide through 1) Procurement of logistics and security coordinator
                         for Mes Ayank; 2) Procurement of 3D scanning equipment for documentation of antiquities in the red zone; and 3) Development of a long-terms strategy to more systematically
                         address the intersection between mining (and related infrastructure) development and cultural heritage.
                         •        The possibility of SDNRP2 playing a more active role in the hydrocarbons sector, through: 1) the procurement of a hydrocarbons policy advisor; 2) providing technical
                         support on the audit of the Amu Darya Hydrocarbon play; 3) beginning procurement of a firm for ongoing Amu Darya Contract Monitoring.
                         •        The MoM&P is in receipt of frameworks and templates that now require wide dissemination and day-to-day reference / application within business lines. The broadest
                         agreement for environmental / social issues is that the Strategic Environmental Social Assessment (SESA) be rolled out now through workshops across the Ministry, while
                         concurrently being further elaborated in key areas (i.e. illegal mining).
