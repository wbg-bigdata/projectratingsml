PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Fourth Highway Project in
Ecuador, for which Loan 1231-EC, in the amount of US$10.5 million, was
approved by the Board on March 30, 1976. The Loan was closed on
September 21, 1982.
The Completion Report was prepared by the Bank's Latin America and the
Caribbean Regional Office and is based on information obtained from the files
of the Bank's Records Center, LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervision Reports for Loan 1231-EC, Minutes of the Board Meeting and the
final reports prepared by the consultants involved in the project.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this Completion Report was read by the Operations Evaluation
Department, but the project was not audited by OED staff. The Draft
Completion Report was sent to the Borrower who, by letter dated March 29,
1983, communicated to the Bank its agreement with concepts expressed in it.
The letter and an unofficial translation have been annexed to the report.

HIGHLIGHTS
The Fourth Highway Project, which included the improvement of the
Babahoyo-Balzapamba road, had as a main objective the strengthening of the
Ministry of Public Works' capability for road planning, engineering,
construction and maintenance in light of the massive infrastructure invest-
ment programs expected to be implemented during the second half of the 1970s.
The improvement of the Babahoyo-Balzapamba road experienced
substantial delays and cost overruns because of an inadequate embankment
design in the southern bypass to the city of Babahoyo (paras 3.03, 4.01).
The problem was exacerbated by untimely actions by MOP, which were carried
out against Bank's recommendations. Although civil works were completed in
January 1982, the embankment is still settling. MOP is monitoring the
settlement rate and has undertaken to provide an asphalt pavement to the
bypass in due time.
Because of improvements to be completed in 1984 to the Babahoyo-
Ambato road, beyond Balzapamba, carried out outside the project and not envi-
saged during appraisal, the project road will become part of an important
route between Quito and Guayaquil. As a consequence, substantial benefits
derived from traffic diversion are expected to be realized, and the project
road will yield an estimated economic rate of return of 20% as compared to
the appraisal estimate of 14% (paras 5.02, 5.05).
The Project Completion Report concludes that the institution-
building aspect of the project was successful even when accomplishments fell
short of the now evidently over-optimistic appraisal expectations (para
8.01). In particular:
(a)  Technical Assistance for Highway Maintenance substantially improved
maintenance management practices, especially the information system
and programming of maintenance activities. However, the persistent
problem of budgetary constraints and lack of experience and contin-
uity in MOP staff limited improvements in administration of
workshops and warehouses, as well as the transfer of know-how from
the consultants to MOP's personnel (paras 3.07 and 3.08).
(b)  Technical Assistance for Highway Engineering and Feasibility
Studies contributed substantially to the strengthening of highway
design and economic assessment capabilities both of MOP staff and
local consultants, and it introduced modern design concepts and
technologies in Ecuador. This Technical Assistance was instru-
mental in the creation of a Feasibility Studies Department, includ-
ing a Traffic Studies Section within the Engineering Department of
MOP, as well as in the creation of a Cost Accounting Department
under the Directorate of Programming (paras 3.09 and 3.10).



- vi -
(c)  Technical Assistance for the Transport Planning and Coordination
Program, in compliance with the Loan Agreement, helped to expand
the former Planning Directorate of MOP into the Transport Planning
and Coordination Directorate (DPCT), with the addition of three
departments: (i) Policies and Planning; (ii) Economic Planning;
and (iii) Information and Studies. However, the creation of a
single unit for planning and coordination of all modes, Section
4.04(b) of the Loan Agreement, was not accomplished because of the
reluctance of the Defense Ministry to relinquish control of the sea
and air transport subsectors. Furthermore, although DPCT staff now
form a core group of prepared professionals, they have not
successfully integrated with the rest of MOP. MOP has tended to
view DPCT as an autonomous agency, and DPCT's investment planning
efforts have not yet been utilized in MOP's annual investment
programming exercises (paras 3.11, 3.13).
(d) Technical Assistance to the Construction Industry succeeded in
strengthening MOP's works supervision capability and the
administration and executing capabilities of the construction
industry, which were put to test during the period of the
assistance and thereafter by expanded road construction and
rehabilitation programs. However, the consultants' recommendations
to improve the performance of MOP's Construction Directorate
vis-a-vis the construction industry have still not been implemented
(paras 3.14, 3.15).
The Project Completion Report states that the main lesson to be
learned from this project is that the Bank must avoid being too optimistic
about the Borrower's absorptive capacity when it finances massive infusions
of technical assistance (para 8.02).



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Ecuador is almost entirely dependent on road transportation for the
movement of general cargo and passengers, with petroleum products transported
by pipeline. In 1980, the road network reached a total length of about
34,600 km, of which 17% are paved, 35% are gravel and 48% are earth roads.
The main network, under the direct responsibility of the Ministry of Public
Works (MOP), consists of about 8,400 km of trunk roads connecting the main
production centers and linking them with Colombia to the north and Peru to
the south. About 50% of these trunk roads are paved, and slightly less than
50% are gravel-surfaced. Responsibility for the remaining 26,200 km of roads
(1% paved, 34% gravel, and 65% earth) is divided among local governments and
national regional agencies. The 1970s was a period of rapid growth in the
highway subsector. Between 1970 and 1979, the total length of paved and
gravel roads grew by 5% annually; 1,600 km of paved roads, 4,600 km of gravel
roads and 5,400 km of earth roads were added to the road system.
1.02      Over the past 25 years, the Bank has been continuously involved
with highway development in Ecuador. Since 1954, six highway projects (total
lending about US$115 million) have been approved which, when the ongoing
Fifth and Sixth Highway Projects are completed, will have resulted in the
construction and improvement of about 1,800 km of primary and secondary roads
and 1,500 km of feeder roads, and improvements in the maintenance, manage-
ment, and operation of the network.
1.03      This completion report is based on information obtained from the
files of the Bank's Records Center, LAC Information Center, Appraisal and
Supervision Reports for Loan 1231-EC, Minutes of the Board Meeting, and on
the final reports prepared by the consultants involved in the Fourth Highway
Project.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION, APPRAISAL, AND NEGOTIATIONS
2.01      The Transport Sector Memorandum of June 1975 highlighted the need
for strengthening MOP's technical capability for road planning, engineering,
construction and maintenance. Ecuador had always suffered from institutional
weakness and, up to the early 1970s, had lived with few resources. Suddenly,
the country was benefited with large revenues derived from the oil industry
and started to expand infrastructural investments without having adequate
technical capability. The Fourth Highway Project was, therefore, a natural
consequence of the above-mentioned Memorandum. It was mainly designed to
provide MOP with the badly needed technical assistance to upgrade its insti-
tutional capacity and enable it to handle adequately the expected massive
infrastructure investment programs.



- 2 -
2.02       The improvements of the Babahoyo-Balzapamba and the Duran-
El Triunfo roads, as well as of ten rural roads, were selected in 1973 by the
Government and the Bank from a just completed Highway Master Plan 1/, with a
view to their inclusion in a proposed highway project. The Transport Sector
Memorandum (para 2.01) confirmed the priorities attached to the selected road
improvements.
2.03      Early in the project preparation period, the Bank suggested linking
the rural roads element of the project to specific agricultural development
programs. It was therefore decided to postpone the construction of the rural
roads for future projects but to include in the proposed project a study of
the agricultural potential of the area of influence of the trunk road between
Puerto Ila and Garrapata 2/and of the investments required to realize such
potential (para 3.16).
2.04       A local consulting firm was engaged by MOP in mid-1974 to carry out
the engineering studies for the Babahoyo-Balzapamba road, while the US con-
sultants responsible for preparing the Highway Master Plan were retained to
carry out the engineering studies for the Duran-El Triunfo road. By the time
of the appraisal (February 1975), it was clear that, while the studies for
the Babahoyo-Balzapamba road were progressing smoothly, contractual problems
between MOP and the US consultants were delaying the completion of the engi-
neering studies for the Duran-El Triunfo road. For this reason, the Issues
Paper, issued on April 17, 1975, dealt mainly with the uncertainties and
risks resulting from incomplete engineering and preliminary cost estimates.
Shortly after, the consultants, dissatisfied with the lack of progress in
resolving their contractual problems, terminated their services to MOP. The
detailed engineering was continued by local consultants, but the ensuing
delays caused the slippage of the Duran-El Triunfo road to the Fifth Highway
Project (Loan 1429-EC).
2.05      Loan negotiations were completed in December 1975, and a loan
amounting to US$10.5 million was approved by the Executive Directors on
March 30, 1976. The Loan Agreement was signed on May 24, 1976 and became
effective on October 13, 1976.
2.06       The agreed project, as described in the Loan Agreement, is as
follows:
Part A: Paving and improvement of the Babahoyo-Balzapamba road (about 49 km)
Part B: (1) Review of the operations of the entire Maintenance Department of
MOP and, specifically, its operations in MOP's Primera
Division 3/, including review of maintenance equipment,
1/   The Plan was part of a highway project financed by a consortium formed
by USAID, IDB, the Bank (Loan 379-EC) and IDA (Credit 51-EC).
2/   Puerto Ila-Garrapata was one of the ten rural roads originally selected
from the Highway Master Plan (para 2.02).
3/   Which includes the provinces of Carchi, Imbabura, Pichincha, and
Esmeralda.

technical aspects of maintenance operations, training of mainte-
nance personnel, and planning, budgeting and controlling of
maintenance works.
(2) Preparation, on the basis of the findings under Part B (1), and
carrying out of a two-year pilot maintenance program in the said
Primera Division, with a view to extending it to other Divisions
of MOP.
Part C: Preparation and carrying out of a program, including staff training,
to improve the capabilities of MOP in the fields of:
(1) highway planning and preinvestment studies;
(2) detailed engineering of highway projects; and
(3) application and enforcement of measures for protection of roads
and regulations of their use.
Part D: (1) Preparation and carrying out of a program designed to improve the
capabilities of the Borrower's road construction industry; and
(2) Provision of technical assistance to assist MOP in (a) prepara-
tion and review of prequalification procedures; (b) preparation
of bidding documents and evaluation and comparisons of bids;
(c) administration and supervision of civil works; and
(d) settlement of disputes with respect to civil work contracts.
Part E: Provision of technical assistance with respect to the functions of
the agencies to be established pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of
section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement 4/, particularly in the fields
of:
(1) transport sector economics;
(2) multimodal planning;
(3) statistics and information systems; and
(4) modal review and evaluation.
Part F: Preparation and carrying out of a two-phased program of studies on
the area of influence of the proposed trunk road between Puerto Ila
and Garrapata, concerning:
(1) development of such area's agricultural potential and investment
required to realize such agricultural potential; and
4/   Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement refers to the establishment within
MOP of an agency responsible for the planning and coordination of all
land transport (para 3.11).

(2) integrated rural development of such area, including investments
in physical infrastructure and social services, this second phase
to be carried out only if the investments recommended by the
study included in Part F (1) were technically and economically
feasible.
The project was expected to be completed by June 30, 1979.

III. PROJECT EXECUTION
Civil Works
3.01       Invitations for international competitive bidding for the
Babahoyo-Balzapamba works were issued in January 1977. The bids were opened
in April 18, 1977, and, after an extensive bid evaluation by MOP, contracts
were awarded, on September 1977, to two local contractors who presented the
lowest combination of bids as follows:
(a)   Sections 1 and 2 (Babahoyo-Puente Palmar y Puente Palmar-Pisagua,
39.2 km), at Sucres 227,082,193.52 5/, to be executed in
27 months, and
(b)  Section 3 (Pisagua-Balzapamba, 11 km), at Sucres 41,341,112.00,
to be executed in 30 months.
3.02       Execution of the civil works started in early October 1977, eight
months behind the initial implementation schedule shown in the appraisal re-
port.  The slow start of the project was mainly due to a five-month delay in
declaring the loan effective and was exacerbated by personnel changes in top
MOP positions after the project had been formulated and negotiated. Subse-
quent delays were caused by:
(a) abnormally long rainy seasons in the years 1979 and 1980;
(b) difficulties in excavating materials from the originally selected
borrow pits in an area where good materials are extremely scarce;
(c) embankment foundation problems in the swampy section (2.5 km long)
south of Babahoyo (para 3.03); and
(d) flooding, drainage and foundation problems in other road sectors.
3.03      A southern bypass to the city of Babahoyo crosses an area subject
to seasonal flooding, which, according to the original design, required a 3 m
high embankment. The foundation design of this embankment was not satisfac-
tory and, at the Bank's suggestion, MOP hired a soils specialist to conduct a
detailed study. In January 1978, MOP, with the Bank's concurrence, decided
on the construction of the embankment according to the specialist's recommen-
dations: sand pile foundation for culverts, 1 m overburden on top of the
embankment, and installation of settling monitoring devices totaling an addi-
tional cost of US$118,260. At the initiation of construction, and repeatedly
after the missions in September 1979 and July 1980, the Bank insisted on the
need for continuous instrumental control of sheer strength and bearing capa-
city of the weakest soils during construction. Nevertheless, MOP persisted
in constructing the embankment without sand piling for culverts, embankment
overburden, or installation of monitoring devices, and, in mid-July 1980,
added improved subgrade material to permit traffic of heavy trucks along the

bypass (this action had been requested by the city of Babahoyo to prevent
further deterioration of its heavily damaged streets). In August 1980, the
foundation soil on a 180 m stretch along the embankment suddenly subsided,
with a simultaneous upheaval of the natural ground on both sides. A November
1980 Bank mission, supported by a soils specialist, recommended specific
studies to program the reconstruction of the failed embankment section. MOP
carried out these studies and, contrary to the Bank's recommendations, put a
one inch thick asphalt concrete layer on top of the subgrade to facilitate
temporary diversion of traffic from Babahoyo. Civil works on Sections 1
and 2 of the project were completed in January 1982, but, since the embank-
ment is still settling at a pace of about 1 cm per month, MOP undertook the
commitment to compensate for future settlement and to provide an asphalt
pavement in due time.
3.04       Section 3 (10.5 km) was satisfactorily completed in December 1980,
with a seven-month delay. In addition to the abnormally long rainy seasons
of 1979/1980, the delay was caused by instability of the cut slopes, combined
with inadequate construction methods, resulting in a much greater number of
slides than estimated; unexpected drainage and foundation problems; and the
replacement of shoulder surface treatment by asphalt concrete as a precaution
against damage caused by slide removal equipment.
3.05       The supervision of the civil works was carried out by the same
local consulting firm that prepared the engineering and feasibility study for
the project road. Although its performance was adequate overall, it did not
recognize in time the importance of the foundation problems in the Babahoyo
area (para 3.03) and, therefore, did not recommend adequate preventive
measures.
Technical Assistance
3.06       The implementation of the technical assistance elements of the
project had a slow start for the reasons listed in paragraph 3.02 as well as
delays in the approval of a special decree to allow hiring of foreign con-
sulting firms without local 'participation. In addition, during the early
stages of implementation 6/, all elements of technical assistance suffered
delays and curtailed effectiveness because of inadequate counterpart staff
-and vehicles. These problems were partially overcome by mid-1978, except for
a few counterpart positions, particularly economists.
Technical Assistance for Highway Maintenance
3.07       This technical assistance component of the project was completed
satisfactorily by US consultants in January 1981. Their main achievements
were:
(a) testing and implementing of maintenance programing in the pilot
district of Santo Domingo;
(b) extension of maintenance programing to all other districts;
6/   Except for the technical assistance to the construction industry
(para 3.16), all the technical -assistances had started by October 1977.



- 7 -
(c)  improvement of the administration of central and district workshops
and warehouses;
(d)  improvement of the operation and administration of crushing and
asphalt plants;
(e)  development of cost data on all maintenance owecations; and
(f) preparation of about 12 audio-visual training courses for mainte-
nance operations.
3.08      Maintenance management, in particular the information system and
the programing of maintenance activities, has been substantially improved;
however, the impact of this technical assistance fell short of appraisal
expectations. The persistent problems of budgetary constraints and lack of
qualifications and continuity in the counterpart staff limited the improve-
ment of the administration of workshops and warehouses, as well as the trans-
fer of know-how from the consultants to MOP's personnel. These issues are
being addressed by the follow-on maintenance program included in the Sixth
Highway Project (Loan 1882-EC), which also sets out production and efficiency
targets. The final cost of this element of the project was US$1.62 million,
27% below the cost estimated at appraisal.
Technical Assistance for Highway Engineering and Feasibility Studies
3.09      MOP engaged an Argentine consulting firm to carry out this tech-
nical assistance, which was finalized in December 1980 after realizing the
following achievements:
(a)  creation of the Feasibility Studies Department, including a
Traffic Studies Section within the Engineering Department of MOP;
(b)  reorganization of the contracting and supervision of engineering
and feasibility studies;
(c)  preparation of personnel through on-the-job training in specific
fields such as soil mechanics, bridge and structure design,
hydraulics and hydrology, photogrammetry and computation;
(d)  creation of a Cost Accounting Department under the Directorate of
Programing;
(e)  the offering of 26 courses on engineering and economic subjects
which were attended by 800 trainees, as well as preparation and
publishing of the corresponding textbooks; and
(f)  assisting MOP in carrying out highway engineering and feasibility
studies and in supervising the performance of such studies by local
consultants, combined with on-the-job training of personnel in
these fields.
3.10       This technical assistance program contributed substantially to the
strengthening of highway design and economic assessment capabilities both of
MOP staff and local consultants, and it introduced modern design concepts and



technologies in Ecuador. This contribution was reflected in the consultants'
Final Report of October 1980, favorably commented on by the Bank's letter of
December 29, 1980. The final cost of this technical assistance was US$1.11
million, or 52% below the US$2.33 million estimated at appraisal. The
original estimates were based on the assumption of two different technical
assistance contracts. The consolidation into one contract resulted in impor-
tant cost savings.
Technical Assistance for Transport Planning and Coordination Program
3.11       This technical assistance was awarded to an Israeli firm and
started in mid-November 1977.   It was extended twice:    to compensate for the
delay originated by inadequate counterpart staffing and to expand the
program. In compliance with Section 4.04 (a) of the Loan Agreement, by
September 1980 7/, the former Planning Directorate of MOP had been expanded
into the Transport Planning and Coordination Directorate (DPCT), with the
addition of three departments: (i) Policies and Planning, (ii) Economic
Planning, and (iii) Information and Studies. Other tasks accomplished by the
assistance were:   review of general development plans, origin and destination
surveys both for freight and passengers, organization of a transport data
bank, inventory of all transport modes, evaluation of new transportation
projects, investigation of road user charges, and a draft Highway Transport
Plan for 1981-1995. The creation of a single unit for planning and coordin-
ation of all modes, Section 4.04 (b) of the Loan Agreement, was not accom-
plished during the implementation of this project because of the reluctance
of the Defense Ministry to relinquish control of the sea and air transport
subsectors; as a result, DPCT's role is limited to the planning of the land
transport only. Under the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1881-EC), a National
Transport Council was to be created, comprising all Ministers responsible for
the different transport modes; however, there has been little interest
regarding this proposition, and the Government is now taking steps for the
creation of a Sub-Secretariat of Transport to unify all land transport
efforts under a single agency.
3.12       The technical assistance for transport planning was completed on
December 31, 1980 at a cost of US$1.25 million, 18% below the US$1.48 million
estimated at appraisal. The Bank's comments on the Final Report encouraged
MOP to:
(a) support the recommendations for changes in the transport planning
organization;
(b) implement the recommendations on the highway investment plan,
especially,those regarding postponement and reformulation of
projects planned at that time; and
(c) ensure that, in the next phase of the technical assistance (to
be financed under Loan 1882-EC), the Directorate of Transport
Planning and Coordination (DPCT, formerly UPCT) and the Depart-
ment of Feasibility Studies work together closely in preparation
and analysis of traffic data.
7/   The original deadline for the compliance of this covenant was extended
twice.



In addition, during this subsequent phase of the technical assistance, the
consultants are reformulating some aspects of the methodology used before
updating the Highway Investment Plan.
3.13      The impact of the technical assistance to transport planning has
been mixed. On the one hand, a land transport planning institution has been
established, with planning and policy analysis benefiting substantially from
the introduction of economic analysis methodologies and a more systematic
collection and analysis of data.    DPCT staff have benefited from the on-the-
job training received and now form a core group of prepared professionals.
On the other hand, however, DPCT has not been successful in fully integrating
with the rest of MOP. MOP has tended to view DPCT as an autonomous agency,
and DPCT's investment planning efforts have not been utilized in MOP's annual
investment programing exercises. Under the Sixth Highway Project, efforts
are being made to strengthen the internal links between DPCT and the rest of
the Ministry.   The creation of a Sub-Secretariat of Transport (para 3.11)
would be a positive step in this effort since DPCT would constitute the core
Technical Directorate within the Sub-Secretariat.
Technical Assistance to the Construction Industry
3.14      The technical assistance for the construction industry, by the same
Argentine firm referred to in paragraph 3.09, was started in July 1978 and
completed in February 1980, at a total cost of US$120,000. Six courses
offered on construction subjects (three in Quito, two in Guayaquil and one in
Cuenca) were attended by a total of 300 engineers from MOP and local con-
tractors. Several important construction jobs were systematically visited
throughout a year to monitor construction techniques and production, work
organization, quality of works and supervision, payment procedures and
MOP/contractor relationships.
3.15      The consultants presented a Final Report, dated May 1980, with the
following main recommendations:
(a)  creation of a national register of contractors;
(b)  simplification of bidding procedures;
(c)  establishment of a general price escalation formula;
(d)  organizational improvements of MOP's Construction Directorate; and
(e)  continuity in road construction programs.
Except for the recent establishment of a price escalation formula
(para 4.02), these recommendations have still not been implemented. The
technical assistance succeeded in strengthening MOP's works supervision
capability and the administration and execution capabilities of the
construction industry, which were put to test during the period of the
assistance and thereafter by expanded road construction and rehabilitation
programs.

Puerto Ila-Garrapata Rural Study
3.16       The study of rural development in the Puerto Ila-Garrapata area by
an Ecuadoran/Colombian joint venture was completed in June 1979 and resulted
in the appraisal of the Puerto Ila-Chone Rural Development Project (Loan
1992-EC, US$20 million, signed November 24, 1981), comprising construction or
improvement of 215 km of feeder roads. Additionally, 48 km of feeder roads
in the Puerto Ila-Doblones area are being constructed under the Fifth Highway
Project.   The final cost of this study was US$680,000, about 8% below the
cost estimated at appraisal.
Project Coordination
3.17       Because of the complex character of, the technical assistance ele-
ments and the possibility for overlapping in the work of the consultants con-
tracted to implement them, the Bank considered the hiring of a qualified
project coordinator to be critical.    After rejecting three candidates infor-
mally proposed by the Bank (at MOP's request), MOP hired an Ecuadoran who
resigned in December 1977, four months after he initiated his activities.
MOP proposed one of its employees as a replacement, and, in order to prevent
further delays, the Bank gave its qualified agreement.     The new project coor-
dinator was restricted to administrative matters and did not adequately
address the coordination of certain technical problems common to at least
three of the programs, such as:
(a)  road inventories, road condition studies and technical classifica-
tion;
(b)  estimates of traffic volumes;
(c)  vehicle operating costs, and road construction and maintenance
costs; and
(d)  future expenditure levels in the highway subsector.
This resulted in overlapping of consultants and counterpart activities,
unnecessary additional costs and, in some aspects, contradictory recommenda-
tions offered by the different consultants. The final cost of the coordina-
tion was US$60,000, compared with the US$610,000 estimated at appraisal. The
reason for this important difference is the fact that MOP hired a local
coordinator, rather than the envisaged foreign one, at a salary comparable to
that of the local civil servants.
IV. COST ESTIMATES AND DISBURSEMENTS
4.01      A comparison between appraisal and final cost estimates (including
contingencies) is shown in Table 1. The final cost of the project was about
US$25.4 million, 21% above the appraisal estimate, including normal contin-
gencies. This increase was caused mainly by the fact that foundation
problems in the construction of the Babahoyo-Balzapamba road (para 3.03)
brought about an increase in the estimated final costs of the civil works of
56% above that of appraisal, which more than offset the decline' in the cost



- 11 -
of most of the technical assistance elements of the project. The final cost
of the civil works averaged US$409,800 per km. Supervision amounted to about
5% of the construction cost.
4.02       Although the project was physically completed in January 1982, the
final cost of the civil works cannot be established precisely because of
difficulties developed in the application of the polynomic formula for price
escalation contained in the Loan Agreement (Annex to Schedule 4). MOP
claimed that the use of the minimum wage as a proxy for labor costs
exaggerated price increases. Nevertheless, MOP started payments of price
escalation for 1979 through 1981 to the contractors according to the
contractual formula. These payments had not, been approved by the Contraloria
of Ecuador. A law on price escalation for all civil works contracts was
signed on March 24, 1983, approving a polynomic formula similar to the one
used for civil works under the loan. The law also orders all pending claims
based on previous formulas to be paid. This settles the dispute, and MOP
will duly cancel the outstanding price escalation payments.
4.03       Disbursements lagged behind appraisal estimates from the start, as
can be seen in the following table, which reflects the initial slow start in
implementing all project elements as well as the considerable delay suffered
during the road construction. The loan was fully disbursed in September
1982.

loan was closed on September 21, 1982.
V. ECONOMIC REEVALUATION
5.0i      Benefits were not quantified for the technical assistance component
of the project; however, in retrospect, the massive effort was overdesigned
for MOP's absorptive capacity and was further hampered by the inadequacy of
coordination and of the counterpart staff. A qualitative reevaluation of
each type of assistance is included in the description paragraphs of Chapter
III preceding.
5.02      The Babahoyo-Balzapamba road improvement was justified at appraisal
on the basis of:
(a) reduced vehicle operating costs and passenger time savings; and
(b) reduced road maintenance costs.



- 13 -
The appraisal estimated an ERR 8/ for civil works of 14%, while an ex-post
economic reevaluation resulted in an estimated ERR of 20%.    The significant
difference between the estimated ex-ante and ex-post ERRs can be explained by
an underestimation of normal and generated traffic growth (para 5.03) and by
the anticipated traffic diversion that was not expected at the time of
appraisal (para 5.05). These extra benefits were only slightly offset by the
real cost increases due to the embankment problem and the ensuing delays in
completing the civil works (para 3.03). In real terms, the estimated final
cost of the project is 27% above the appraisal estimate. Inasmuch as the
price escalation polynomic formula (para 4.02) overestimates the real cost of
the project, the calculated ERR is a conservative one.
5.03      In 1974, traffic volumes on the road between Babahoyo and
Balzapamba varied from 830 vehicles per day in the Babahoyo bypass to 230
vehicles per day in the Montalvo-Balzapamba section. The appraisal economic
evaluation was performed under the assumption of an overall traffic growth
rate of 8% per year until 1986 and of 6% thereafter. Current traffic counts
show that the actual average traffic growth rate on the project road was
14.7%. This high traffic growth rate reflects the heavily subsidized fuel
prices as well as the strong performance of the Ecuadoran economy, shown by a
growth rate of the real Gross National Product of about 6% per annum for the
period 1975-1980. 9/ The reevaluated ERR was calculated under the more
conservative assumption of traffic growing at a rate of 7% until 1986 and 6%
thereafter. The expectation of declining traffic growth rates is based on the
assumption that the price of fuel in Ecuador is going to increase gradually
until it reaches international levels. 10/
5.04      The 49-km Babahoyo-Balzapamba road is part of the trunk road system
of Ecuador and, specifically for traffic between Quito and Guayaquil, is part
of an alternate route which leaves the main road (the Pan American Highway)
at Ambato, some 100 km South of Quito, and then proceeds through Balzapamba
and Babahoyo to join the main road again between Milagro and Duran, close to
Guayaquil. The route through Babahoyo is the more direct communication
between Ambato and Guayaquil, but, at the time of the appraisal, its condi-
tion was very variable (from good and paved, on some sections south of
Babahoyo, to very poor, between Babahoyo and the Pan American Highway at
Ambato). Because of this variation in conditions, traffic between Quito and
Guayaquil stayed on the longer routes through Santo Domingo or through Rio
Bamba.
5.05      The improvement of the Babahoyo-Ambato road beyond Balzapamba,
where it climbs the Andes to Ambato, was considered uncertain at the time of
the appraisal. Since then, the larger than expected traffic growth

10/ The Government raised the price of gasoline in March 1983. Still,
a weighted average of petroleum derivative prices in Ecuador is 54% of
current international prices. The retail prices of regular and premium
gasoline are US$0.71 and US$0.95 respectively.



- 14 -
(para 5.03) made the improvement of the Balzapamba-Ambato road economically
feasible. The expected completion in 1984 of the last section of the
Balzapamba-Ambato road in need of improvement will place the project road in
an alternative Quito-Guayaquil corridor expected to save a diverted vehicle
35 km of the Quito-Guayaquil trip. Although the project road would have been
economically viable without the traffic diversion derived from the
improvement of the Babahoyo-Ambato road, its inclusion represents a
substantial normal traffic increase in the project road fundamental in
explaining the important difference between the ex-ante and ex-post estimated
ERRs.
VI. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER
6.01       The performance of the Borrower was mixed.    The main causes for
occasional less-than-satisfactory performance by MOP were:
(a) discontinuity in the staff assignments. The project was imple-
mented under five General Directors of Public Works with frequent
changes in managerial staff; and
(b) a chronic shortage of qualified technical personnel, due to
government salaries substantially below those paid by the private
sector.
6.02       There were frequent delays by the Borrower in processing payments
to contractors and consultants. These delays resulted from the Borrower's
overly complex procedures and documentation, particularly in the Ministry of
Finance.
6.03       In the case of the embankment problem (para 3.03), the Borrower did
not comply with the Bank's recommendations, causing further delays in the
completion of the civil works and increased costs.
6.04       The Borrower's compliance with the major Loan Covenants was good,
except for Section 4.04 (b) of the Loan Agreement, which obligated MOP to
create, maintain, and operate an agency for planning and coordinating all
modes of transport. As explained in paragraph 3.11, this objective was not
achieved.
VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01       The Bank contributed significantly to project identification and
preparation via its participation in the financing Consortium and the Sector
Mission of 1974 (para 2.01). During the execution of this project, the Bank
provided some essential continuity in view of Government changes. The scope
and size of this, the Fourth Highway Project, were probably beyond MOP's ad-
ministrative capability; this limitation was exacerbated by the poor project
coordination, which did not prevent wasteful duplication of assignments to
the already scarce technical personnel acting as counterpart staff for the
consultants in charge of the different technical assistance assignments.



- 15 -
7.02       The number and timing of supervision missions were appropriate for
project needs, and good relations with the Borrower were maintained through-
out the project period. The Rank is continuing to provide essential tech-
nical assistance to MOP under the two followup projects presently being
implemented.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01       The institution-building aspect of the project had some success
even when, as discussed throughout the report, accomplishments fell short of
appraisal expectations. These expectations were undoubtedly overly optimis-
tic. Nevertheless, the Fourth Highway Project did achieve, to a considerable
extent, its main objectives: MOP's capabilities were substantially strength-
ened in the areas of highway design, economic analysis and programing and
implementation of maintenance activities. It is in the area of transport
planning that the main objective - the integration of all transport modes
through the creation of a Transport Planning Unit - was not achieved. Never-
theless, the groundwork laid during the project, although limited to the
highway subsector, should represent, in the medium run, a considerable
benefit to Ecuador's transport sector.    The project was successful in upgrad-
ing the Babahoyo-Balzapamba road with an overall estimated ERR above that
expected at appraisal.
8.02       The main lesson to be learned from this project is that the Bank
must avoid being too optimistic about the Borrower's absorptive capacity when
it finances massive infusions of technical assistance. The project
emphasizes the importance of a patient and supportive attitude by the Bank in
assisting Borrowers through changing political and administrative circum-
stances, such as the frequent changes in the highway administration and the
lack of qualified counterpart staff resulting from low Government salaries.
It also highlights the benefits to the Borrower of a long-term view and
participation in the sector, such as, in this case, carrying out two followup
projects.
