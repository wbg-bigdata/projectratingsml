INTERNATIONLL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEWLPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
!W THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PRDPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR
-.OR A FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recomxendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Ecuador for the equivalent of US$10.5 million to help finance
a fourth highway- project.  The loan would have a term of 25 years, including
five years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Ecuador: Economic Memorandum" (No.1033-EC) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on February 26, 1976. Annex I suumarizes
the main economic and social indicators.
3.        With the first shipments of crude oil from the Oriente Region in 1972,
Ecuador became a net exporter of oil. This provided the country with additional
resources which at least temporarily removed the savings and foreign exchange
constraints that had severely impeded Ecuador's growth in the past. Oil income
rose from $38 million in 1972 to over $420 million in 1974. However, during the
last year it has become clear that the country's oil wealth is smaller than
previously estimated. One year ago, it was estimated that the country had
total -- proven and probable -- oil reserves equivalent to 5.7 billion barrels.
Current estimates are of only 2.5 billion barrels, owing to a substantial decline
in the calculation of probable exploitable reserves. Moreover, it is now expected
that the production levels projected last year for 1976 will not be achieved until
the early 1980s. Thec'e revised estimates, together with a better knowledge of the
difficalties to be encountered in the exploitation of Ecuador's untapped oil
fields, and with the transitory problems faced by the country's oil exports in
1974-75, indicate that Ecuador is not likely to accumulate substantial asounts of
foreign exchange reserves in the foreseeable future.
4.        There has been a sharp decline in petroleum output since mid-1974
because of marketing difficulties for Ecuadorian crude in export markets and a
protracted disagreemerLt between the Government and the foreign concessionaires
over the taxation of oil exports. The total offtake of oil dropped from an
average of 232,000 b/d during January-June 1974 to 123,000 b/d during the second
half of 19741, and became irregular in 1975, owing to two breaks in the trans-
Andean pipeline. For 1975, the average production is estimated at about 165,000
b/d. There has also been a virtual standstill in exploration during the past two
years and the level of proven recoverable reserves, estimated at 1.5 billion
barrels, has remained unchanged.
5.        The disappointing performance of the petroleum sector had not been
expected by the Government. Counting on rising petroleum income, the Government
had adopted policies designed to stimulate further growth. It increased public
expenditures -- including subsidies of essential consumption goods; offered more



- 2 -
generous credit programs for agricultural and industrial investment; and lifted
most quantitative import restrictions. In 1974, import duties were out by an
average of 34 percent. Moreover, imports of agricultural inputs and of essential
foodstuffs were fully exempted from duties.
6.        The response of the economy to these policies, and to the prevailing
very optimistic economic climate was, in general, strong. Gross investment grew
by 22 percent in real terms in 1973 and growth of GDP at market prices reached a
rate of about 15 percent, far above historical levels. Continuing rapid growth in
industry, construction, trade and Government services, made it possible to achieve
an overall GDP growth rate of approximately 8 percent in 1974. This was obtained
in spite of the significant decline in the oil sector product, and of the virtual
stagnation of agricultural production -- which was hampered, until early that year,
by the insufficiency of credit availabilities and by the inadequate price policies
followed up to then by the Government.
7.        The rapid economic expansion was accompanied by inflationary pressures.
The cost of living index for low and medium-income families in Quito, which had
risen by about 8 percent per annum during 1971 and 1972, increased by 13 percent
during 1973 and by over 23 percent during 1974. While the inflationary pressure
was largely generated by the rapid rise of public expenditure, the strong expan-
sion of credit to the private sector also contributed to the increasing money
supply. Domestic supply could not respond in full to the growth in demand, which
led to higher imports of wheat, oils and fats, and other products. In construction
materials, domestic production did not keep pace with increases in demand. In
manufacturing, the process of import substitution of finished goods accelerated,
leading to rapidly rising imports of equipment, raw materials and semi-finished
products. As a result, total imports of goods and non-factor services rose from
about $440 million in 1972 to $515 million in 1973 and over $1.0 billion in 1974.
This import growth in part also reflects a rise in import prices of 17 percent in
1973 and 28 percent in 1974. Exports -- also including non-factor services --
expanded from $365 million in 1972 to about $1.1 billion in 1974. Of the increase,
about 75 percent was accounted for by petroleum.
8.        Despite the growth of imports, Ecuador's balance of payments showed,
until mid-1974, a marked improvement.  In 1973, Ecuador achieved the first surplus
in its resource balance since the early 1950s, and net foreign exchange reserves
rose from $128 million at the end of 1972 to $371 million by the end of June 1974.
However, these favorable trends could not be maintained after mid-1974.  As oil
exports declined and total imports continued to rise substantially, Ecuador's
reserve position began to deteriorate rapidly. By August 15, 1975, the country's
net foreign exchange reserves had fallen to $181 million, equivalent to less than
two months' imports.
9.        Until 1974, increasing oil revenues brought about a substantial improve-
ment of the Government's financial position. For the Central Government /l -- which
received about 54 percent and 57 percent of total oil revenues in 1973 and 1974
respectively -- these revenues led to a strong increase in current savings and to
an expansion of capital expenditure substantially above the growth of current
expenditure. With current savings rising to about $68 million in 1973 and $298
million in 1974, the overall cash position of the Central Government turned from
L Including the National Development Fund (FONADE) and the National Partici-
pation Fund.



- 3 -
a small deficit in 197.3 to a $62 million surplus in 1974, despite a more than
threefold increase in capital expenditure in 1974. FONADE, established in late
1973 in an effort to earmark part of the additional oil revenues for the financing
of public investment p:rojects over and above budgetary allocations, disbursed about
$93 million in 1974. Iost of these disbursements helped finance the construction
of the Esmeraldas refinery, and the credit programs of the National Development
Bank and other financial institutions. As a result of the decline of oil revenues,
current savings decreased by an estimated 20 percent in 1975 despite an improved
performance of non-oil taxes. These developments led to a temporary financing gap
in the Central Government operations and to the decision to contain the growth of
Government expenditure in 1976.
10.       A number of recent measures have contained the deterioration of the
balance of payments, and foreign exchange reserves are estimated to have totalled
about $245 million by the end of 1975. The measures included a reduction of the
tax-paid cost of petroleum exports by the equivalent of about US$0.43 per barrel;
the concession of higher allowances to oil companies for their production cost;
and the introduction of import restrictions in August and September 1975. Oil
production has recovered, mainly as a result of the cut-back in the income tax
rate on oil exports, and is estimated to have reached over 210,000 b/d towards
the end of 1975.
11.       On October 2, the Government announced new financial objectives for
1976: to achieve additional increases in foreign exchange reserves and a more
balanced budgetary position, which would make it unnecessary for the Government
to borrow further from the domestic banking system or from foreign ccommercial
banks during 1976. The Government hopes to reduce the annual rate of inflation
from some 15 percent in 1975 to about 10 percent in 1976. Further negotiations
with the oil companies are expected to open the way to increased exploration and
development efforts.
12.       Ecuador's oil production is now expected to increase gradually and to
reach about 270,000 b/d by 1979-80. An expansion beyond this level appears
feasible, provided that a vigorous exploration and development program can be
brought underway in the near future. Increasing export earnings from petroleum,
coffee, sugar and manufactuired goods, combined with a net inflow of foreign capital
in the order of $265 million a year during 1976-80 -- needed largely to finance
new gas and oil-related ventures -- should make a substantial improvement of the
overall balance of payments situation possible after 1976, and permit a moderate
increase in foreign exchange reserves. The extent to which Ecuador's balance of
payments situation will actually improve depends largely on the success of
immediate stabilization policies, the development of oil production, the behavior
of oil prices, and the mobilization of foreign capital.
13.       Although the oil sector will continue to be the major source of foreign
exchange in the medium term, there are oonsiderable uncertainties with respect
to the possible production profile of this sector in the longer run. Most of the
oil likely to be produced until the early 1980s has already been found. Unless
exploration efforts are substantially stepped up nd new oil fields are discovered,
production could decline soon afterwards. To make the most efficient use of oil



- 4 -
revenues the Government therefore intends to begin to diversify the production
base of the economy by developing agricultural and industrLal activities in which
the country has a potential comparative advantage. Exports other than oil need
to be developed -- for examples, natural gas, and agricultural and forest resources.
An appropriate use of the financial resources provided by oil will also make it
possible to alleviate the country's most pressing social needs. However, Ecuador
continues to be one of the poorest countries in Latin Amerlca, with an estimated
per capita income of $450 in 1974, and a large proportion of the population living
at subsistence levels. Oil has only shifted Ecuador from the upper strata of the
poorest countries to the lower brackets of the middle income developing countries.
14.       Several years ago the Government designed an ambitious development
strategy. It is reflected in the 1973-77 Plan Integral de Transformacion y
Desarrollo and focuses on (a) promoting the diversification of the economy by
fostering agricultural and industrial development; (b) alleviating poverty in
the countryside through rural development programs; (c) upgrading social services;
(d) expanding infrastructure; and (e) improving the absorptive capacity by over-
coming major bottlenecks to development, notably the shortage of qualified manpower
and the administrative weakness of the public sector.
15.       To pursue these broad objectives, efforts have been made to improve the
investment capacity of the public sector. In 1973, a preinvestment fund (FONAPRE)
was set up to finance prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Inventories of
projects and project ideas were compiled in the entire pub:Lic sector. Also the
Government has been able to increase public investment rap:idly. However, progress
has been slow in sectoral planning -- particularly in setting investment priorities
in some major sectors -- and in the coordination of investments by region. The
proposed project would help overcome these shortcomings in the transport sector.
16.       Ecuador's development needs, as well as persistent structural and
institutional weaknesses, call for continued external assistance. Although the
country's creditworthiness has improved greatly, it would not be sound policy
for Ecuador to rely on the capital market as the sole source of external finance.
Neither the amounts nor the terms available to Ecuador in the market would make
this advisable. Rather, a mixture of commercial and official financing will
best suit Ecuador's needs during the next few years.
17.       E3cuador is creditworthy for further lending on Bank terms.  The external
public debt outstanding on December 31, 197h was estimated at US$530 miliion,
of which US$297 million was disbursed. Service on outstanding public debt is
relatively moderate -- about $85 million in 1975, equivaleint to about 8.0 percent
of the exports of goods and non-factor services. The debt service ratio is projected
to fall to approximately 4 percent in 1979-80. The Bank /IDA share in outstanding
and disbursed public debt as of December 31, 1974 was about 19.7 percent; it is
expected to rise.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ECUADOR
18.       Starting with the first loan in 1954£, the Bank and ILK have made twelve
loans and six credits to Smador totalling US$150 million, net of cancellations.
At the end of January 1976, the Bank and IDIL held about US$115 million, including
about US$45.2 million not yet disbursed. The most recent loan, to finance a
vocational training project became effective on November 24, 1975. IFC has made
five loan and investment commitments in Ecuador, two in a large textile company
and three in a development finance companyx, amounting to US$4.3 million of which,
as of January 31, 1976 US$2.7 million had been sold, terminated or cancelled.
In addition, IFC is considering loans and an equity investment to help finance
the expansion of sugar production in the Guayas Province area and a plywood mill
near Esmeraldas. Executioni of Bank Group financed projects has, on the whole,
been satisfactory, even thouigh it has not been free of difficulties often caused
by the insufficiency of the country's managerial and technical resources -- a
constraint that still is a major obstacle for Ecuador's economic and social
development. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IPC investments as of January 31, 1976, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
19.       Bank and IDA lending were originally concentrated in transportation and
power, where there were sulstantial deficiencies to be overcome. These two sectors
still account, respectivelr, for about 25 percent and 10 percent of total past
lending. Most of the lend-ing for transportation was to improve the road network
of the country, although onie loan was made to help finance a new port in Guayaquil
(FY59). Lending for power has been concentrated in improving generation and distri-
bution facilities in Quito. The first livestock development loan (FY67) marked the
beginning of a diversification of lending; since then the Bank and IDA have made four
more loans and credits for agriculture and fisheries, two loans to support industrial
development through two derelopment finance companies, two loans for education and
one loan for water supply. Bank/IDA assistance for the commodity producing and
social sectors account now for about 55 percent of total lending.
20.       External developmient financing has also been provided by IDB and USAID
and, to a lesser extent, b!r other bilateral sources. External financing by sector
and by source through 1974 is summarized below:
(US$ millions, Figures Net of Cancellations)
IBRD    IDA     IDB     AID
Lending 1954-64                    54.0     8.0    35.3    67.7

IDB is the largest single lender having extended most of its loans to Ecuador from
the Fund for Special Operations, which has normally carried a 2 percent interest
rate, a ten-year grace period, and repayment terms of up to forty years.  It is
likely that IDB will remain the major development lender in the immediate future,
although the terms will be less concessionary than in the past. USAID loans
generally have had amortization and grace periods similar to those of IDB, with
interest at 2-3 percent. Education, health and other socially oriented activities,
as well as agricultural development, have been receiving increasing attention from
the external lending agencies in recent years. IDB, USAID and the Bark Group have
coordinated their efforts in these fields to assure the most effective use of all
available resources.
21.       Bank lending is aimed at supporting the Government priorities outlined
in Part I above. This objective will be met by emphasizing projects that will
help strengthen the institutional framework for development policy -- particularly
concerning project planning, preparation and implementation -- in agriculture,
rural and urban development, transportation and other high priority activities.
This highway project, and the Second Port of Guayaquil project, which I expect
to submit for your consideration in the near future, are designed to help the
Government to establish the administrative mechanisms and technical procedures
required for designing and implementing appropriate policies and investment projects
in the transport sector during future years, while assisting also in the overcoming
of some major transportation bottlenecks.
22.       Beyond those two transportation projects, the current Bank program is
primarily concentrated on agricultural and rural development.  The Bank can under-
take a major institution-building effort in these fields, which should yield tangible
benefits for Ecuador. Agriculture is, at the same time, the most important and the
most neglected sector of the Ecuadorian economy. Its potential is far from being
adequately realized and its low productivity is a main cause of the extreme poverty
in Which most of the Ecuadorian population still lives. The current Bank program
includes a substantial support of integrated rural development projects and
important assistance for the development of the country's agricultural potential.
All projects programmed for this sector include sizable technical assistance
components, as a major part of the overall institution-building effort referred
to above. This is reflected particularly in the project also to be submitted
for your consideration in this fiscal year to aid Ecuador in the preparation of
agricultural and rural development projects. Other projects in this sector which
I expect to present to you during the next two years include one agricultural
credit, one irrigation and two rural development projects. Moreover, most of
the other projects currently under consideration -- for instance, rural roads,
rural electrification and agro-industries -- are also related to the major
objectives referred to above for agriculture and rural development.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR IN ECUADOR
23.       Ecuador's rugged topography has made it difficult to develop an efficient
national transport system. Its natural barriers long impeded communication between
the two principal regions, the Coast and the Sierra. Moreover, movement within the
Sierra is hindered by its transversal mountain ranges, while heavy rainfall in the



- 7 -
Coast, and some soil characteristics, have made highway construction and main-
tenance there quite cost:Ly. The difficulties of travel within the country
retarded Ecuador's economLc development for many years. The present transport
network permits the movemint of passengers and freight between most of the
country's inhabited areas as a result of substantial investments during the last
three decades, principally in highways, which is now the country's dominant trans-
port mode. Despite those improvements, the main road network (22,500 km.) is not
yet adequate to assure a satisfactory level of service. Further investments are
necessary to (a) improve operating conditions and accommodate foreseeable
higher volumes of traffic along the Sierra's central valley and between Quito and
Guayaquil; (b) help mobillze the agricultural potential of the Coast and
improve its access to the Quito, Guayaquil and overseas markets and (c) open up
the largely untapped prodictive potential of the Oriente, which eventually could
help relieve some population pressures in the Sierra and in the metropolitan
areas of Quito and Guayaquil.
24.       Beginning with the first loan to Ecuador (FY5h), the Bank and IDA have
lent US$53 million for transport., out of which US$40 million were devoted to
highways. The Bank has made three loans for this purpose, in FY54., FY58 and FY64,
the latter associated in a consortium project with an IDA Credit and loans
from USAID and the IDB. The first two loans helped to finance the paving of about
1,100 kms. of roads, primarily in the Guayas River basin, and others linking
Guayaquil with the Sierra,and Quito with the northern coast. The third loan
helped to carry out parts of the Government's 10-year transportation investment
program. Both the second and third projects included highway maintenance programs.
These loans contributed to the completion of the main road network in the Coast
agricultural area, while important links between this area, the Sierra and the
Northwest were also improved. The Bank's experience with these three projects
has been generally good, although the magnitude and complexity of the third one
required special coordination among the lending agencies and a very long disburse-
ment period.
25.       The Bank updated its knowledge of the transport sector through a sector
study conducted with the Government's cooperation in August-September 1974. The
sector mission's findings are now being discussed with the Government and the
report is expected to be finalized in the near future. The main conclusions of
the sector study are that:
(a) Planning and investment are not adequately coordinated between
the Planning Board and the five ministries responsible for the
several transport modes in the country. As a result, trans-
portation deficiencies coexist with cases of possible over-
investment or underutilization of existing facilities;
(b)  Tariffs, user charges and fuel prices are not established as
integral parts of a comprehensive transport policy. As a result
there are important inter-modal differences concerning costs and
prices, with t!ne attendant danger of serious misallocation of
resources;



- 8 -
(c) The highways planning, construction and maintenance practices
of the Ministry of Public Works (M.O.P.) need improvement;
(d) The domestic road construction industry, which has received the
major portion of highway contracts, cannot always perform satis-
factorily due to shortcomings in the industry itself (e.g.,
limited managerial and technical skills, poor financial and
accounting practices and inadequate bid preparation), and, also,
to some aspects of the Government's handling of the industry
(such as fluctuating investment programs, tardiness in making
payments, and absence of price escalation formulae).
26.      As a result of discussions between the Govermment and the Bank on the
abovementioned sectoral and sub-sectoral deficiencies, the Government has agreed
(see Section 14.O4 of the draft Loan Agreement) on the following approach to
transport planning and coordination:
(a) Not later than one year after the signing of the Loan Agreement,
M.O.P, will establish (i) a highway planning and programming unit
and (ii) an agency responsible for planning and coordinating all
land transport and for the administration and regulation of road
transport; and
(b) Not later than two years after the signing of the Loan Agreement,
the Goveernment will establish an appropriate agency for planning
and coordinating all transport modes.
27.       These measures are expected to provide the institutional framework
essential to formulate and implement sound investment, pricing and financial
policies in the transport sector as a whole, as well as in the highway sub-sector.
The specific programs and activities to be undertaken to organize the above agencies
and unit are discussed in part IV of the Report.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
28o       The roadworks to be included in the project were selected from a Highway
Master Plan, prepared in 1973 by M.O.P.'s consultants and financed under the third
highway project. The proposed fourth project's institutional aspects are based on
the 19714 Transport Sector Study (see paragraph 25 above)0 The project was appraised
in February-March 1975. Negotiations were held in Washington from December 15 to 19,
1975, at which time the Republic of Ecuador was represented by a delegation headed
by Mr. Alfonso Arcos, Technical Director, National Planning Board. An appraisal
report entitled "Ecuador: Appraisal of a Fourth Highway Project" (No.925a-EC) is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A summary statement on the
proposed project and loan is contained in Annex III to this Report.



-9-
General Description
29.       The proposed project would include:
(a) Improvement of the Babahoyo-Balzapamba section (49 km.) of the
road from Guayaquil to Ambato, on the Pan American Highway.
This road would provide an alternate route for the Guayaquil-
Quito corridor. The section to be improved serves part of
the Guayas RLiver basin agricultural area. (See Map attached.)
(b) A road maintenance program in one of the four maintenance districts
of MO.P. , rith particular emphasis on the improvement of work
methods and administrative procedures, and with the ultimate
purpose of textending such methods and procedures, once tested,
to all maintenance districts.
(c) A program to improve planning and coordination in Ecuador's
'transport sector. The institutional changes referred to in
paragraph 26 above would provide the framework for achieving
this objective of the project.
(d) A program to improve the planning, design and engineering capa-
bilities of M0.P.'s Directorate of Highways, through the proposed
highway planning and coordination unit mentioned in paragraph
26(a)(i) above.
(e) A program to improve the capability of the Ecuadorian road con-
struction industry. This program would approach the problems
noted before (see paragraph 25(d) above) through, on the one hand,
technical assistance to the industry in the areas of bidding,
financial planning, personnel management and training, and planning
and management of site operations and equipment and, on the other
hand, technical assistance to the Government on bid preparation and
evaluation, administration and supervision of civil works and
settlement of disputes with contractors.
(f) A study on the development of the agricultural potential of the
area of inflaenqe of the proposecl Puerto Ila-Garrapata road
(86 km.), in the northwestern Quevedo area and the investments
required therefor; and, should such investments prove feasible,
an integratei rural development study of the same area* This
two-stage study would evaluate the productive potential of an
area of approximately 150,000 ha., define needed complementary
investments in physical infrastructure and social services, and
recommend a financial plan and timetable for such investments.
30.       In line with the Bank strategy outlined before (see Part II above),
the purpose of the proposed project is twofold. First, to strengthen and
improve the institutiais responsible for the transport sector as a whole and
for the highways sub-sector. The improvement of the engineering capabilities
of M.O.P.'s Directorate of Highways and of the domestic road construction



- 10 -
industry would complement the establishment of an overall transport sector
planning and coordinating system, and of a highway planning unit with M.O.?,
The elements of technical assistance contained in several parts of the project
(see paragraph 29(b), (c), (d) and (e) above) include, where appropriate,
training of Ecuadorian counterparts by consultants. The integrated rural
development study of the area of influence of the projected Puerto Ila-Garrapata
road would provide a planning model for the coordinated development of selected
rural areas. The second purpose would be to improve the quality of services to
passenger, general cargo and agricultural crops traffic, not only through the
improvement of about 50 km. of an intensely used road, but also through the
highway maintenance program.   The latter, which to some extent would repeat
programs undertaken under the highway consortium project in 1964, is needed to
tackle recurrent deficiencies in road maintenance and, under present circum-
stances, affords an appropriate way to help preserve the investments made in
the existing highway network.
Execution
31.       The project is estimated to require three years to be completed.
Responsibility for the execution of the project would rest primarily with M.O.P.
In addition, both the establishment of the transport sector planning agency and
the integrated rural development study for the Puerto Ila-Garrapata road, would
require the participation of other ministries and government agencies. Likewise,
the cooperation of the domestic road construction industry will be required.
Participation in the technical assistance program devised for the industry under
the project would be a prerequisite for any domestic contractor wishing to parti-
cipate in any bidding for paved roads invited one year after the signing of the
Loan Agreement (see Section 3.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). Both the scope
of the project and the complexity of some of its components would exceed the
technical and administrative capabilities of M.O.P. Technical assistance to
supervise highway construction, to set up and operate the transport sector
planning unit, and to assist in the carrying out and coordination of other
parts of the project, will be provided by consultants, whose services would
be partially financed out of the proposed loan. Some of the institutional
aspects, particularly the transport sector planning system, are fairly complex
because of the current fragmentation of responsibilities within the Government,
and would require a gradual approach and a close monitoring by Bank supervision
missions to ensure that maximum benefits would be obtained in this respect.
Project Costs and Financing
32.       The total cost of the project has been estimated at US$21 million
equivalent. This estimate is based on early 1976 construction costs and an
estimated average cost of US$5,500 per man/month of foreign consultant services;
it also includes allowances for physical and price contingencies. The estimated
foreign exchange component represents 50 percent of the total cost and would
amount to US$10.5 million equivalent. This estimate assumes that work on the
Babahoyo-Balzapamba road section would be awarded to local contractors. The
breakdown of the estimated project costs is shown in Annex III of this Report.



- 11 -
33.       The proposed loan of US$10.5 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange componient of the project cost. The balance would be financed
by the Govermment.
Procurement and Disbursements
34.       Road improvemnent contracts would be awarded on the basis of international
comnpetitive bidding, in accordance with the Banlk Guidelines.  Improvement work
would be divided into Lots and bidders will have the option to bid for one or more
lots. Consultants, acceptable to the Bank, would be retained on terms and condi-
tions also satisfactory to the Bank.
35.       Disbursements, estimated to be completed during the second quarter of
1979 would be made for 40 percent of the total payments to civil works contractors
(estimated to represent the foreign exchange component of the civil works); for
50 percent of payments made to domestic consultants or 100 percent of payments made
in foreign exchange to foreign consultants for construction supervision; and for
100 percent of foreign exchange payments to consultants retained for project
coordination and technical assistance, except in the case of the rural development
study, where disbursements would be 75 percent of the foreign exchange payments to
consultants. Disbursements for the technical assistance program to the domestic
road construction industry would not be made until the Government has made industry
participation in the program a requisite for bidding in future works (see paragraph
31 above and also paragraph 4(b) of Schedule 1 to the draft Loan Agreement).
Retroactive financing uip to $100,000 equivalent would be provided for consultants'
services required to complete detailed design after December 1, 1975. Annex III
contains the estimated disbursements schedule for the proposed loan. Any funds
remaining in the loan account upon the project's completion would be available,
with the agreement of the Barnik, to finance the foreign exchange cost of technical
assistance in the same fields included in this project or to prepare high-priority
road projects.
Economic Benefits and Justification
36.       The investmerLt in the improvement of the Babahoyo-Balzapamba road, which
accounts for 65 percent; of the estimated project cost, would have an economic
rate of return estimated at 14 percent. Even under conservative assumptions of
cost increases and redutction of benefits, the rate of return would still be
acceptable. The quanti.fication of economic benefits has been limited to the
direct benefits to be derived by highway users, i.e. reduced vehicle operation
costs, time savings for passengers and road maintenance costs. There would
also be indirect benefits for agricultural producers and other road users, arising
from reduced breakage and spoilage of cargo (especially perishable produce and
fruits), from the elimination of traffic interruptions during the rainy season
and from a reduction of traffic accidents.
37.       Furthermore, there would be several additional indirect benefits which
were not quantified, but are nonetheless important. The Babohoyo-Balzapamba road
runs across the southeastern portion of the Guayas River basin. Approximately
40 percent of the area is still covered by forests amenable to exploitation.



- 12 -
The climatic and soil conditions of this area also permit the cultivation of
bananas, cacao, coffee and rice and, in the higher ground around Balzapamba,
citrus fruits. This would be of particular significance for the Babahoyo-
Montalvo irrigation project, now being implemented by a regional government
agency, which envisages new plantations of rice, soybeans, maize, sesame and
beans on about 10,000 ha. The improved road would permit faster access for the
expected increased volumes of these crops to the Guayaquil metropolitan market
and to the export markets through the port of Guayaquil.
38.       The planning and engineering capability improvements and the highway
maintenance program for the Ministry of Public Works and the assistance to the
domestic road construction industry would be Justified in view of the large
investments still required in the transport sector, and of the need to increase
the efficient use of available resources. The rural development study would
help to identify and coordinate investments in other sectors, which would be
required to realize the full benefits of the projected Puerto Ila-Garrapata
road.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
39.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Ecuador and the Bank,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement, and the text of the draft resolution approving the proposed
loan, are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. Features of
the draft Loan Agreement which are of special interest are referred to in para-
graphs 26, 31 and 35 of this Report.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMENDATIOIN
10        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 124-EC - Education Project; US$5.1 million Credit of June 27, 1968;
Effective Date: August 30, 1966; Closing Date: December 31.,
The project is about three years behind schedule because of initial
difficulties in appointing the project director and recruiting experts, and later
because of shortages of counterpart funds. As a result of the reorganization in
1974 of the Ministry of Education, which also affected the Project Unit, project
administration has improved and the project is now progressing satisfactorily.
Twenty-three out of 28 project schools are now in operation. The Government has
authorized the use of bond issues to finance the local component of the project
cost. The Association has extended the Closing Date until December 31, 1976 to
permit completion of the five remaining schools.
Loan No. 555-EC - Fisheries Project; US$5.3 million Loan of September 5, 1968;
Effective Date: September 4, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Execution of thLs project had a slow start due mainly to institutional
problems and less than anticipated demand for the fishing vessels included in the
project.  The project is now proceeding satisfactorily towards completion.  Prepara-
tion of a fishing training school, to be opened shortly, is being concluded with
consultants' assistance.
21 These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular,to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4
Credit No. 222-EC - Third Livestock Development Project; US$10.0 million Credit
of December 10, 1970; Effective Date: September 30, 1971
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is progressing satisfactorily. There was a slowdown in
lending from May 1973, when negotiations regarding changes in interest rates for
subloans were begun, until the issue was settled in May 1974. However, the credit
is n   fully committed and is expected to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
The objectives of the project are being met, and demand for investments for
subloans for beef and dairy development is good.
Loan No. 721-EC - Development Finance Companies Project; U $8.0 million Loan of
February 5, 1971; Effective Date: October 15, 1971; Closing
Date: March 31, 1976.
Disbursements are running slightly behind the original schedule, but the
loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the new Closing Date of March 31, 1976.
Credit No. 286-EC - Third Power Project; us$6.8 million Credit of February 15  1972;
Effective Date; December 15, 1972; Closing Date: May 15, 1976.
The generation components of the project were completed with exception of
the Cumbaya by-pass which had to be redesigned by the consultants due to geological
difficulties found while building the tunnel for the Nayon power plant. The trans-
mission and distribution components of the project remain to be completed. The
beneficiary, Enpresa Electrica de Quito (EEQ), effected a tariff increase in
December 1975, approved new Estatutos, contracted an assets revaluation study and
got the Quito Municipality to settle its debts. On the basis of these actions,
the Association extended the Closing Date to May 15, 1976.
Credit 425-EC - Milagro Irrigation Project; US$5.5 million Credit of August 17, 1973;
Effective Date: January 17, 1974; Closing Date: August 31, 1979.
Civil works are proceeding on schedule although there has been some delay
in awarding bids for some project equipment. The arrival of a construction consultant
has been scheduled to fit the expected arrival of the equipment. Consultants have
been retained to carry out the feasibility studies for a possible second project.
Loan 930-EC - Second Development Finance Companies Project; US$20.0 million Loan
of August 17, 1973; Effective Dates: COFIEC February 27, 1974;
CFN March 4, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project is proceeding according to schedule, and the loan was almost
entirely committed by December 31, 1975.

Loan 1030-EC - Gumay   l and Guayas Province Water Supply Project; US$23.2 million
Loan of July 23, 1974; Effective Date: January  9, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30 1978.
Disbursements have been considerably slow owing to delays in effectiveness
and changes in management and engineering consultants. However, procurement is now
underway. Lower than anticipated revenues and cost increases are likely to create
financial problems in the medium term and the Bank has started to discuss alternative
solutions with the Borrower and the Government.
Loan 1157-EC - Vocational Training Project; U§$t4.0 million Loan of September 3,
1975; Effective Date: November 25, 1975  Closing Date: September 30,
1978.
Project implemeatation is proceeding satisfactorily.  Construction of the
first phase of the Guayaquil vocational training center has commenced and the equip-
ment provided for this phase by the Federal Republic of Germany has been delivered.
Design work for the remainder of the civil work is about half completed. Furniture
and equipment lists are under preparation.
