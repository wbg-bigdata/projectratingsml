PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SMALL AND MEDTUM MACHINERY INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 2215-KO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Small and
Medium Machinery Industry project in Korea, for which Loan 2215-KO in the
amount of US$70.0 million was approved on December 16. 1982. The loan was
made to four Project Entities:   Small and Medium Industry Promotion
Corporation (SMIPC), Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB), Korea Long
Term Credit Bank (ILB), and Citizens National Bank (CNB). The loan closed
on December 31, 1987, one year behind schedule, with about US$23.9 million
of the loan amount undisbursed and cancelled. The last disbursement was
made on February 16, 1988.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations
Division, Country Department II, Asia Region (Preface, Evaluation Sutmary,
Parts I and III). During a supervision mission on a follow-up project in
March, 1989, the mission discussed Parts I and III of the report with the
Project Entities. The mission received minor comments which have been
incorporated in the report.
Preparation of this PCR was initiated during a Bank supervision
mission in February, 1988. The Project Entities agreed to the following:
that SMIPC would prepare an outline of the PCR for its component; that CNB
would do a combined PCR for its two loans (Loan 2144-KO and 2215-3KO);
that SMIB would do a combined PCR for Loans 2004-KO and 2215-IKO; and that
KLB, due to its minor participation in the project, would not prepare a
PCR for its portion but instead furnish the Bank with statistical data.
SMIPC and CNB completed their respective PCRs in March, 1988 and July,
1988. The SMIPC PCR is included as Part II to this report while the CNB
PCR has been included in an earlier report for the Second CNB Project
(Loan 2144-KO).
This PCR is based, inter ala, on the Staff Appraisal Report;
the Loan, Guarantee and Project Agreements; supervision reports;
correspondence between the Bank and the Project Entities; internal Bank
memoranda; the Project Entities' annual reports and project data provided
by the Project Entities.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SMALL AND MEDIUM MACHINERY INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 2215-KO)
EVALUATION SUMHARY
1.         The project loan for US$70 million to the Republic of Korea was
approved on December 16, 1982. It followed a series of lines of credit
to development finance companies (DFCs) serving the small and medium
industry (SMI).   This project represented a new Bank approach to SMI
lending in Korea by: first, including three key DFCs involved in the SMI
sector in a single project; second, explicitly addressing the issue of
industrial extension services to SMIs as a project component; and third,
focusing on a specific developmental bottleneck, in this case, the
machinery industry.  The major project objectives were to:  (a) provide
long-term resources to SMIB, CNB and KLB to support the requirements for
establishment, expansion, modernization, and balancing of facilities by
small and medium machinery producers; (b) provide technical assistance and
training through the Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation
(SMIPC), aimed at upgrading the technical competence and productivity of
the machinery industries; and (c) develop the institutional capability of
SMIPC to provide industrial extension services to SMIs. The project had
three componentss technical assistance, training, and credit (para. 3.01-
3.04).
2.         The project fulfilled its technology upgrading objectives, but
experienced significant difficulties in achieving resource transfer goals.
The technical assistance component was highly successful.  The project
developed a user oriented industrial extension service scheme, the
Production Technology Improvement Program (PROTIP), formulated with Bank
assistance provided in the course of sector work. Under the program,
foreign and domestic consultancy services were provided to assist small
and medium machinery producers to upgrade skills and improve their
productivity at the plant-level by more effectively using existing
technology. Unlike traditional extension services where agents teach what
they know with limited regard to the needs of SMIs, the focus of the
assistance was on solving the basic technical problems routinely
encountered by SMIs. These services, often provided by retired or semi-
retired free lance engineers, foremen and technicians working as
ccnsultants, were highly responsive to SHI needs and were well received.
Some 1,030 man-months of expatriate technical assistance services were
provided under PROTIP, about 162 more than originally anticipated.
Through PROTIP, SMIPC has developed effective approaches to problem
diagnosis, problem solving and systems of documentation conducive to
genuine transfer of technology (para. 5.05-5.07).



- iv -
3.         It had originally been hoped that the project would promote
increased cost recovery for the technical assistance services provided,
but this did not materialize. This was due to the SHIs' limited ability
to pay and their general tendency to expect basic software assistance free
of charge. In an apparent effort to redress its relative neglect of the
SMI sector during the 19709, the Government did not pursue the cost
recovery policy (para. 5.08).
4.         Against the original budget of US$ 800,000, only US$ 373,000 was
disbursed for the training component. This was mainly due to trainIng
grant funds provided by bilateral sources. In addition, overseas training
under the project was limited by difficulties in identifying SMI managers
interested and able to afford such training (para. 5.04).
5.         The credit component experienced major delays due primarily to
competition from a subsidized Government credit scheme for SNI, which was
further expanded during the period.  Utilization of the US$59 million
provided under the loan for this purpose also suffered fromt   the
gene-rally high effective cost of the Bank loan to subborrowers, par-
ticularly considering the foreign exchange risk; the availability of
foreign currency resources through the Bank of Korea's Won conversion
facility entailing no currency risk; and the adverse investment climate
in 1981-82 and 1984-85 (para. 5.01).
6.         In an effort to accelerate disbursement, project funds were
eventually opened up to all SMI subborrowers. The loan c'.osing date was
extended by one year to December 31, 1987. Nevertheless, a substantial
part of the loan amount was eventually cancelled: US$8.8 million of the
US$29 million for SMIB, US$12.9 million of the US$20 million for KLB.
About US$2 million of the USS$ll million provided to SMIPC was also
cancelled as a result of lower than expected consultant rates.   The
performance of the subprojects financed under the project was satisfac-
tory; however, in terms of financial and economic benefits, regional and
subsectoral distribution, and the relatively small sizes of subborrowers
(para. 5.02).
7.         The quality of the portfolio of the three DFCs involved was
excellent except for 1985 and 1986 when the collection rates for foreign
currency equipment loans decreased significantly. This was due primarily
to increased debt service needed as a result of the Won depreciation and
the relative slowdown of Korean economic growth. The financial positions
of the three DFCs remained generally satisfactory throughout the project,
although SMIB and CNB incurred operating losses in 1982 and 1983. This
was due to adjustments in the Government's interest rate policy, which
lowered the rate ceilings for lending and deposits to 102 p.a. and 82
p.a., respectively.   While the lending rate reduction was effective
immediately, the rates for existing deposits were unchanged until
maturity, with many as high as 18X p.a. As the existing savings deposits
matured, profitability improved, and in 1985 both SMIB and CNB became
profitable again (para. 8.01).



- v -
8.         The project entities, SMIB, KLD and CNB are soundly managed and
sustainable institutions. The other entity, SMIPC has also developed its
institutional capabilities in part through strong government support. As
the support continues, the benefits derived from SKIPC's existence are
also assured.   On the whole, the project only partially achieved its
original objectives. With substantial cancellations, the credit component
did not achieve its original objectives. However, the project contributed
significantly to the development and growth of an industrial extension
service scheme.  In aidition, the project introduced a new sector-wide
approach to Bank lending to the Korean SKI sector (para. 6.01-6.03).
9.         The main lessons from the project are as follows (para. 10.01):
(a)  There is a risk involved in limiting the fund eligibility too
narrowly for SMI credit projects (machinery industry subsector,
in this case);
(b)  There are practical difficulties in recovering a significant
portion of costs from extension services to SMIs, and;
(c)  Caution should be taken in resorting to expatriate consultant
assistance in a task which is innovative in nature and requires
intimate local knowledge and local language skills.

2.  BackRround
2.01       Throughout the 1970s, the Government of Korea concentrated its
industrial sector investment on large, capital-intensive industries, often
to the neglect of small and medium industries and eventually resulting in
a sharp rise in capital intensity and overcapacity.   The onset of
international economic recession in 1979 exacerbated the problems of
excess capac±ty and misallocation of investment resources by triggering
a substantial reduction of industrial output, with machinery industries
among the most seriously affected activities. Since continued growth of
the machinery industries was to play a key role in Korea's manufacturing
growth during the Fifth Plan period (1982-86) as the only subsector
capable of generating the -necessary economic expansion, the Bank assisted
the Government to address problems in the industries.   Bank support
focused on the small and medium general machinery producers which Bank
sector work (Korea: Development of the Machinery Industries, Report No.
2130-R0, March 19, 1979) had identified as being particularly in need of
technical assistance to resolve problems in areas such as choice of
equipment, operating practices, labor training, product quality and level
and absorption of technical know-how. Resolution of these problems was
critical if Korea was to compete effectively on the world market as well
as supply its own domestic manufacturing industry with the machinery and
equipment which was then imported.
2.02       The provision of technical assistance and training to the small
and medium industries (SMI) was considered particularly important since
they had less capacity than larger enterprises to obtain assistance on
their own.  They also constituted the core of the general machinery
industries, an area where investment in technical assistance and training
was likely to have the highest pay-offs. Until this project, the avail-
ability of technical assistance to SMI was very limited. The institution-
al base for industrial extension services to SMI was overly fragmented and



- 2 -
lacked coordination, and the absence of well-articulated policies and
objectives in the SKI sector left extension services without any sense of
direction and focus. In 1979, the Government began to correct this situa-
tion by establishing the Small and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation
(SHIPC) to concentrate technical assistance on priority subsectors, train
extension officers and coordinate technical assistance services. Further-
more, under the Bank-assisted Small and Medium Industry Bank Project (Loan
2004-KO), the Government completed a comprehensive study of the industrial
extension services provided to SMIs in Korea and developed a set of action
programs, which were implemented under this project.
3.         Pro3ect Obiectives and Description
3.01       A Bank loan of US$70 million to the Republic of Korea for the
Small and Medium Machinery Industry Project was approved on December 16,
1982. The main project objectives were tos (a) provide long-term foreign
currency resources to support the requirements for establishment, expan-
sion, moderni-zation, and balancing of facilities by small and m2dium
machinery producers; (b) provide technical assistance and training aimed
at upgrading the techni-cal competence and productivity of machinery
industries; and (c) build up SMIPC's institutional capacity for providing
extension services to SMIs.
3.02       The project had three components:
(a)  Technical Assistance.   This component provided foreign and
domestic consultancy services to assist small and medium
machinery producers upgrade their skill levels and improve
their productivity by more effectively using existing technol-
ogy.
(b)  Training.  This component provided training courses on- and
off-the-job for target groups in small and medium machinery
industrie, to improve their skills and knowledge of production
technology and enhance their productivity.
(c)   Credit.  This component provided long-term investment funds to
small and medium machinery industries through three development
finance companies (DFCs), the Small and Medium Industry Bank
(SMIB), the K-rea Long-term Credit Bank (KLB) and the Citizens
National Bank (CNB), all of which catered to small and medium
machinery producers of various sizes, RLB for medium-sized
producers (between 100 and 300 employees); SMIB for small and
medium-sized producers (up to 300 employees); and CNB for small
producers (up to lO0 employees).
SMIPC was the executing agency for the technical assistance and training
components.



4.         Proiect Design and organization
4.01       Prior to this operation, the Bank had extensive involvement in
the Korean $MI sector. However, unlike the prior operations which had
focused on institutional development of the DFCs serving the sector, this
project introduced several innovations.   First, it included three key
financial intermediaries involved in the sector under a single project.
Second, it explicitly addressed the issue of industrial extension services
to SMI as a project component. Finally, it focused on developmental con-
straints to specific segments of the SMI, namely the machinery industries,
in view of their importance and growth prospects. This represented a new
Bank approach to industrial lending in Korea, having a sector-wide focus
and concentrating on a number of key constraints affecting an important
SMI subsector. In general, most of these innovations were introduced at
an appropriate time.
4.02       The Bank sector report mentioned above contributed significantly
to the conceptualization and design of the project's technical assistance
delivery scheme. Under that scheme, SMIPC would develop a roster of for-
eign and domestic consultants, many of whom were retired or semi-retired
free lance engineers, foremen and technicians.  Upon the request of a
client, SMIPC would diagnose problems and identify consultants who were
capable of proviling specific solutions. While some consultant services
were provided on broader subjects such as industrial engineering and
production planning arrangements, the bulk of the services were focused
on the more basic problems routinely experienced by SMIs, including work
method analysis (workplace layout, tools and design), machine tool
maintenance, and basic skills transfer (welding, forging, foundry and
milling).
4.03       As a result of prior Bank operations -- four involving SMIB, two
for CNB and eight for [LB, all financial intermediaries involved in the
project had relatively well developed institutional capacities to execute
the credit component and to manage their assets and liabilities. Orig-
inally, the Korea Production Technology Corporation (KO! EC) was expected
to be the executing agency for the technical assistance and training
components. KOPTEC, established in early 1981, was entrusted with the
responsibility of administering a program of providing in-plant guidance
to upgrade technological capabilities of SMIs. As part of rationalization
of industrial extension institutions, KOPTEC was merged into SMIPC in May
1982, subsequent to the project appraisal mission. The Bank reappraised
SMIPC and considered its institutional capabilities satisfactory.
5.         Proiject Performance
_.01       The Credit Component.   Disbursement under this component,
accounting for US$59 million of the loan amount, experienced major delays,
in part due to competition from the Small and Medium Industry Promotion
Fund (SMIPP), a government-subsidized credit program specifically targeted
to the SMIs (Table 3 of Part III). SMIPF loans had an interest rate of
92 and were denominated in local currency, thus involved no foreign



exchange risks. On the other hand, the relending rate of the Bank loan
for DFCs participating in the project was set at the standard variable
rate plus a 2? spread to cover the CoB' incurred by the DFC in processing
subloan applications and supervising  iubproiects.  This translated into
an onlending rate of 13.6Z p.a. at the start of the project and 12.5 in
1984 before foreign exchange risks. The effective cost of Bank funds rose
even higher after mid-1985 when the US dollar dropped in value vis-a-vis
Swiss franc, German Mark and Japanese Yen. The Bank was not successful
in convincing the Government to scale down the SMIPF scheme, which the
latter considered to be an instrument to accelerate SMI development,
compensating for relative neglect of the sector during the 19709. Also
affecting subborrower response to project credit were the accessibility
of foreign currency resources through the Bank of Korea's Won conversion
facility which entailed no currency risk and the adverse investment
climate in 1981182 and 1984/85 which dampened demand for credit.
5.02       In 1985, the Bank lifted one constraint to disbursement of this
component by agreeing to expand the eligibility for loan proceeds to SNIs
in all subsectors, and in 1986, it extended the loan closing date by a
year (until December 31, 1987). to provide the implementing agencies with
additional time in which to use the loan funds.  These measures were not,
however, sufficient to substantially increase loan commitments and
disbursements, and by loan closing a substantial portion of the credit
component had been cancelleds US$8.8 million out of the original US$29
million for SMIB and US$12.9 million out of the original US$20 million for
KLB. Virtually all of US$10 million allocated to CNB were disbursed.
5.03       However, apart from lower than expected utilization of funds
provided under the component, the project was largely successful in terms
of financial and economic benefits. Based on a sample survey, ex post
financial rates of return (FRR) ranged from 221 to 30X, while ex post
economic rates of return (ERR) ranged 34X to 60X. Subprojects financed
by the three banks were on target in terms of project completion dates.
CNB subprojects were also very accurate in terms of project cost esti-
mates. However, subprojects financed by SMIB and XLB showed much larger
fluctuations, because they included relatively large and complex projects.
Regional and sectoral distribution of subprojects were satisfactory. The
utilization of credit was also satisfactory in view of the relatively
small sizes of subborrowers (Tables 4.A, B and C of Part III).
5.04       The Training Component.   Against  the original budget of
US$800,000, only US$373,000 was disbursed.   This is mostly '-ecause of
training grant funds provided by bilateral sources, notably from Japan.
In addition, SMIPC experienced difficulties in identifying SMI managers
for overseas training since few were interested in and able to afford the
time and expense for even short-term training. In all, 35 SMI technicians
were trained overseas, whose training expenses were borne by SHIPC's
operational expenses.  The Bank funds were used to finance SMIPC's own
staff training program, which included long-term overseas training of 27
extension engineers, and 45 short-term visits (Table 4.D of Part III).
The domestic training provided in Seoul and at SMIPC's training facilities



at Banwohl established in 1982, were generally well attended. At present
about 9,000 managerial, supervisory, engineering, and technical personnel
are trained annually at Banwohl.
5.05       The Technical Assistance Component. This component, which con-
stituted an important part of SMIPC's Production Technology Improvement
Program (PROTIP), progressed smoothly. Under the program, SMIPC assisted
the SMls by (a) identifying and rectifying common problems in priority
areas; (b) providing guidance and consultancy service on plant-level tech-
nology using domestic and foreign experts; (c) gathering and disseminating
information on production technology required to break preduction bottle-
necks; Id) conducting feasibility studies and providing advice to firms
and financial institutions on the technical feasibility of proposed
investments; and (e) arranging for domestic and overseas training to
strengthen manpower capabilities  in the machinery  industry.    These
services were customer-oriented and responsive to day-to-day operational
problems of the SMIs and were a major improvement over the traditional
approach to industrial extension services whereby extension agents teach
what they know to SMIs, with limited regard to its relevance to the
specific needs of the entrepreneurs. The approach taken by SMIPC under
the project to problem diagnosis, problem solving and the system of
documentation were highly effective and conducive to genuine transfer of
technology.
5.06       Given PROTIP's innovative nature, an expatriate consulting firm
was retained to assist SMIPC to launch the foreign technical assistance
program by drafting TORs, identifying and selecting foreign consultants,
and assisting in developing an evaluation and monitoring systems. How-
ever, after about six months, SMIPC management decided to release the con-
sulting firm and to utilize its internal expertise for PROTIP implementa-
tion and management.   SMIPC's efforts were successful and the PROTIP
program has since become one of SMIPC's most dynamic and well regarded
activities.
5.07       Disbursement of the US$10.2 million allocated for this component
under the loan was somewhat slower than originally anticipated due to
lower than estimated consultant man-month rates. Consequently, about
US$1.7 million was cancelled at loan closing. However, some 1,030 man-
months of technical assistance services were provided, about 16X more than
originally anticipated (Table 4.D of Part III).
5.08       The cost recovery ratio for the foreign consultancy services had
originally been expected to increase to 40Z by 1987 and 80Z by 1991. The
ratio only reached 16.5Z in 1987, however, largely due to the lack of
ability of SMls to pay. Furthermore, unlike large fimss with sophisti-
cated management, the Korean SMIs were not used to receiving outside
advice or to paying for technical advice (software), as opposed to hard-
ware (equipment). Given narrow scopes of activities, few SMIs used PROTIP
services more than a few times, thareby limiting the opportunities for
SMIPC to gradually raise its overall cost recovery ratio. In an apparent



- 6 -
effort to redress its relative neglect of the SMI sector during the 1970s,
the Government did not pursue a rigorous cost recovery policy.
6.         Proiect Sustainability
6.01       The project entities, SMIB, KLB and CNB are soundly managed and
sustainable institutions. They have maintained their finan ial viability
and were able to mobilize resources needed to support theih activities in
spite of the changing macroeconomic events and policies that negatively
affected them. They have also maintained their economic contribution by
financing sound projects, creating new jobs in the economy and bringing
about improved competitiveness and skills to the SMI sector.
6.02       The other project entity, SMIPC has also developed its institu-
tional capabilities in part through strong government support.  It has
filled a gap by providing organized extension services and technical
assistance to the SMI sector. It has also contributed to the development
of skills of local entrepreneurs and has been most active in the areas of
innovation,  promotion and introduction of new  technology.   As  the
government's support for it is likely to be maintained, it can be said
that the benefits being derived from the existence of SMIPC are being
-sstained.   SMIPC's financial sustainability is however questionable.
SMIPC has not pursued cost-recovery of services partly because beneficiar-
ies found the charges burdensome and SMIPC views itself as a non-profit
organization.   Moreover, the Government's policy is to assist SSI to
compensate for part discrimination.
6.03      Although the project only partially achieved its original objec-
tives, the sustainability of project benefits is assured. With substan-
tial cancellations in loan amounts, the credit component did not achieve
its objectives. However, on the positive side, the project contributed
significantly to the development and growth of an industrial extension
services scheme. In addition, the project introduced a much needed new
approach to Bank lending to the Korean SMI sector, a move away from
individual DFC focussed operations to sector-wide operations focussing on
specific developmental bottlenecks. The Bank SMI operation subsequent to
this project (Small and Medium Industry Project, Loan 2515-KO approved in
April, 1985) followed this new approach.
7.         Bank Performance
7.01       Bank performance was generally satisfactory.  Given the new
approach introduced to Bank industrial sector lending to Korea (para. 5),
project design and implementation arrangements were discussed thoroughly
within the Bank during project preparation. On the whole, these discus-
sions contributed to sharpening the focus of the project and exploring the
various alternatives available prior to reaching a consensus on project
design and organization. Throughout the project period, the Bank's rela-
tionships with the Government and the project executing agencies were
highly satisfactory.



7.02      Bank performance in supervising the project was good, with fre-
quent missions fielded to address emerging project issues in a profes-
sional and timely manner (Table 6.B of Part III). As the problems in the
credit component became a primary concern of the supervision missions,
however, the Bank's attention was largely focussed on this issue, while
the technical assistance and training components received less attention.
In the meantime, SMIPC had successfully developed itself into a highly
dynamic organization, as a 'one stop* extension service center for all SMI
needs, capable of providing such varied services as the provision of
technical information, assistance in identifying possibilities for joint
ventures and making related arrangements, equipment leasing, and business
start-up programs. Even today, SMIPC is a relatively unique organization
among our client countries as an extension service institution which can
effectively provide a varied range of services to SMls. Unfortunately,
Bank involvement in SMIPC's institutional development in areas other than
those directly related to the project was very limited. Had the Bank been
more intimately associated with the overall institutional development of
SMIPC, it would have been in a better position to replicate such an
organization in other client countries.
8.         Borrower Performance
8.01       The three financial intermediaries, i.e., SMIB, CNB, and KLB,
performed satisfactorily in executing the credit component.   This was
expected since these institutions had been well developed partly through
previous Bank support. The quality of the portfolios of three DFCs was
excellent except for 1985 and 1986 when their collection rates for foreign
currency equipment loans decreased significantly. This was due primarily
to increased debt service needed as a result of the Won depreciation, and
the relative slowdown of Korean economic growth. The financial positions
of the there DFCs were generally satisfactory throughout the term of the
project, although CNB and SMIB incurred operating losses in 1982 and 1983.
These losses were due to an adjustment in the Government's interest rate
policy introduced in June 1982, which lowered the rate ceilings for lend-
ings and deposits to 10 p.a. and 8? p.a. respectively. While lending
rate reduction was effective immediately, the rates for existing deposits
were unchanged until maturity, with many as high as 182 p.a. As the
existing savings deposits matured, profitability improved, and both SMIB
and CNB became profitable in 1985 and thereafter.
8.02           What proved to be beyond expectation was the excellent
performance of SMIPC. At the outset of the project, SMIPC had just merged
with KOPTEC, and its institutional modus operandi was yet to be clearly
defined. Since then, SMIPC has developed its institutional capabilities
in a relatively short period of time, and has successfully marketed its
services for supporting SMI development.   The strong support of the
Government to SMIPC was particularly conducive to its successful institu-
tional development. SMIPC's excellent performance in the Bank-supported
PROTIP scheme and other areas of extension services enabled SMIPC to
become the most important industrial extension organization, and play a
much needed leadership role in this area in the country.   SMIPC also



demonstrated the importance of user orientation in the industrial
extension service.
8.03       Since the project involved several components and executing
agencies, the Government established a Coordination Council (CC) consist-
ing of representatives of the Ministries of Finance and of Commerce and
Industry, SMIPC, and the three DFCs.   CC met regularly and reviewed
implementation of the project. CC also furnished progress reports with
the Bank annually.   CC performed an important function in drawing
attention to major implementational problems and resolving many of them
in a timely fashion.
9.         Consulting Services
9.01       The idea of using foreign technical and skills advisors at the
shop-floor level as 'trouble shooters' for the SMIs was an innovative
scheme when proposed initially by the Bank.   This, together with the
merger/reorganization of SMIPC only seven months before Board approval of
the loan, prompted the Bank to request SMIPC to retain an expatriate
consulting firm to make this scheme fully operational.  With Bank's
agreement, the consulting firm hired by SMIPC was later released, however.
In dealing with SWI personnel, the consultants found that the language
barrier was insurmountable, particularly outside of Seoul.   And, in
retrospect, neither the Bank nor SMIPC could identify a firm with the
necessary expertise and experience for this innovative assignment.
Subsequently, the SMIPC proved that they themselves were best qualified
to do the job, and successfully completed the task. While it is under-
standable that the Bank took a cautious approach by insisting that SMIPC
retain a consulting firm, this experience suggests that the Bank should
be careful in resorting to external consulting assistance when implement-
ing a new and innovative scheme, especially where local language and other
knowledge are crucial for success.
10.       Lessons
10.01      The main lessons learned from the project can be briefly
summarized as followst
(a)  risks involved in limiting the fund eligibility too narrowly for
SMI credit projects (machinery industry subsector, in this
case);
(b)  practical difficulties in recovering a significant portion of
costs from extension services to SMIs;
(c)  cautions to be taken in resorting to expatriate consultant
assistance in a task which is innovative in nature and requires
intimate local knowledge and local language skills.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SMALL AND MEDIUM MACHINERY INDUSTRY PROJECT
(LOAN 2215-RO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Production  Technology   Improvement   Program   (PROTIP)  is  the
technical assistance component under the Small and Medium Machinery
Industry Project (Loan 2215-KO), which was signed on December 20, 1982 and
closed on December 31, 1987. The PROTIP Program was carried out by Small
and Medium Industry Promotion Corporation (SMIPC) as an execution agency
under the above Loan Agreement and Project Agreement.
1.02     The  technical  assistance   component   is   to  provide  foreign
consultancy services to assist small and medium machinery manufacturers,
upgrade their skill capability and improve their productivity at the plant
level by using existing facilities more effectively.
1.03     In addition, the  training  component  also  consists of providing
overseas training opportunities to improve their skills and knowledge of
production technology as well as to enhance the technical and managerial
capability of SMIPC staffs who have to conduct extension services.
II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Development ObJectives
2.01     The objective was, by introduction advanced production techniques,
to help small  and medium  industries  achieve:   (i) quality improvement;
(ii) productivity increase; (iii) cost reduction; (iv) competitiveness in
both the domestic and international markets; and (v) contribution to the
development of new products.
Immediate ObJectives
2.02     To render on the  job  guidance  to  the selected factories and to
hold seminars for upgrading management and techniques in the following
field.
(a) to provide up-to-date business and technical information
to the small and medium industries;
(b) to improve the production techniques of small and medium
manufactures;



- 14 -
(c)  to help  small  and  medium  industry maximize utilization
rate of their present facilities and machineries;
(d) to assist small and medium industry in searching and
penetrating overseas markets;
(e) to contribute to the development of new products; and
(f)  to  provide  advice   on  management  rationalization  and
efficiency.
III. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT RESULTS
Yearly Service Applications and Achievements
3.01     During the period  1983-87,  the  total applications for technical
assistance mount up to  3,110  cases.    It represents about 13.5Z increase
rate on  a  yearly  average.    2,243  cases  among  them were successfully
performed and completed during that period, and the service performance
ratio market 72.12X (see Table = of the Statistical Annex, Part III).
3.02     Achievements,  subdivided  into  industrial  subsectors  show that
service performances were frequent in the machinery industry, followed by
textile and chemicals, electric and electronic products, metals and others
Consultants Invited
3.03     The number of consultants invited during the implementation period
amounted to 1,098 persons or about 219 persons on a yearly mean. Their
total staying amount is 1,028 man-month, and average staying days per year
is about 0.9 month or 27  days.    The number of consultants by nationality
and subsector is stated in Table _ of Part III during the same period.
IV. OVERSEAS TRAINING RESULTS
SMIPC Staff Training
4.01     Twenty-seven  engineers  of   SHIPC   were  dispatched  abroad  to
undertake their programs in eleven fields while 42 staff completed short
visit training programs in advanced countries during the period.
4.02     Overseas trainees  have  increased  gradually  each  year, whereas
short visit trainees have decreased a little, the reason being the greater
effectiveness of overseas training when compared to short visit training.
Details of the various training activities are presented in Table _ of
Part III.

SMI's t8plogses Traiing
4.03     Thirty-five technicians,  divided  into  three missions were also
dispatched to several European countries. Their respective courses consist
of about three months.
V. EPFECTIVE ANALYSIS
5.01     An evaluation  team  consisting  of  extension  officers  from the
Ertension Service Group reviewed and evaluated 240 selected beneficiaries
by visiting them in  1987.    According  to their report, the effectiveness
resulting from the extension services can be summarized and quantified as
followsS
(a)  Management Capability Improvements              17 cases
(b)  Quality Improvement;                           151 cases
*c) Cost-Saving:                                     38 cases
(d)  Production Process Improvements                189 cases
(e)  Technical Development and Innovation:          282 cases
(f)  Export and Import Substitution:                 26 cases
A breakdown of the extension services can be found in Part III.
VI. BUDGET INPUTS
6.01     A loan  of US$ll,000,000.00 was  contracted  for  the Project on
December 12, 1982. By the end of 1987, when the loan was closed, a total
of US$8,917,455.85 was expended during the five years, and the remaining
balance of US$2,082,544.15 was  cancelled  by  SKIPC.   The reasons for the
cancellation was the availability of domestic resources and UNDP funds for
the project.

6.02     The details are shown in Table 1 below.

VII. COST RECOVERY
7.01     According to the Project  Agreement  between IBRD and SMIPC, SMIPC
should levy, by December 31, 1986, a charge of at least 302 of the direct
costs of extension services provided by foreign consultants, and each year
thereafter, increase the charge levied by at least 102, provided that by
December 31, 1991, and for each year thereafter, at least 802 of the direct
costs of such services are recovered.
7.02     However, as of now actual cost  recovery  ratio has not come up to
the target. The actual ratio in 1987 was 16.52 and the planned ratio in
1988 is 20.02 which shows a 352 point increase over last year's.
7.03     There are several reasons  why  SMIPC  did  not reach the targeted
levels.  Among them:
(a)  SMIPC was established  to  provide  assistance  to SMIs in
Korea, and by that reason, it cannot pursue profit
generating  projects.    Therefore,  increasing  the  cost
recovery steeply (by over 102 each year) is a violation of
its original objectives;
(b) SMIs in Korea which benefitted from extension services are
inferior  to   larger   industries   in  size,  managerial
capabilities and finance.   Their financial competence are
limited,  hence   increasing   cost   recovery   has  been
burdensome; and



- 17 -
(c)  The  numbers  of   SMI   enterprises   which  applied  for
consulting services  increased.    Assuming  cost recovery
ratios were increased to the original target, it is feared
that service applications would decrease considerably each
year. Hence SMIPC would not accomplish its production
technology improvement program successfully.
7.04     However, in spite of the above  reasons, SMIPC will do its best in
recovering the  direct  costs.    The  charges  levied  each  year  will be
increased and the ratio regarding actual circumstances will be decided.
The targets agreed between IBRD and SMIPC will be a good guide in its
decision.
VIII. FINDINGS
8.01     On the one hand, training  is  provided  directly to a few certain
production staff on the spot. However, learning from it is not limited to
staff, but is also imparted  to  fellow workers  around  them.  It is also
dispersed to other companies of  the  same  kind by SMIPr. staff and foreign
experts.  On  the  other  hand,  the well-trained staff, trained overseas,
disseminate their knowledge to many  client  companies.  All activities of
the project make for a far-reaching influence, although it is difficult to
quantify.
8.02     The  preliminary  survey  and many  individual  experiences  have
indicated that the Korean-born specialists, when invited to Korea for
technical assistance, are more beneficial in many ways: they are willing
to share their technical know-how and are eager enough to contribute as
much   as   possible   to   their   fatherland's  industrial  development.
Furthermore, the language barrier automatically disappears.
8.03     The SMI client  companies  expressed  a  strong  desire to acquire
follow-up service on a long-term, continuous basis, even after the major
service, thereby further improving and/or maintaining their product quality
and management aspects.
8.04     Other findings include:
(a) some client companies find the contribution (via cost
recovery) justifiable, but burdensome to meet;
(b)  the  recommended   booklets   are   continuously  used  as
reference;
(c) most experts are willing to share their knowledge with the
firms they work for, but some of them are reluctant to do
so; and
(d) foreign experts do not voluntarily provide technical know-
how.

Prepararion of Part II of PCR for Loan 2215-3K0
A.  Comment on  the  adequacy  and  accuracy  of  the  factual information
contained in Part III of the PCR.
We confirm that the factual information contained in Part III of the
PCR prepared by the Bank are adequate and accurate.
B. Cemment on the analysis contained in Part I of the PCR.
The analysis contained in Part I of the PCR is agreeable to us.
C.   Evaluation  of  the  Bank's   performance  during  the  evolution  and
implementation of the project.
We are satisfied with  the  Bank's  performance throughout the prvject
period. Especially, the expansion of the eligibility for the loan
proceeds to SMIs in all subsector from those in machinery subsector in
1985 and extension of the loan closing date by a year in 1986 taken by
the Bank were very appropriate for and has greatly contributed to the
smooth implementation of the project.
D.   Evaluation of the Borrower's own  performance during the evolution and
mplementation of the project.
Our bank's performance was generally satisfactory. However, the loan
was disbursed about three months later than planned, which was attrib-
utable to the sluggish investment in facilities by SMIs and to limit-
ing the fund eligibility to machinery industry subsector. The quality
of CNB's portfolio and its financial position were satisfactory
throughout the term of the project, although it incurred net losses in
1982 and 1983, which was resulted from the interest rate adjustment
measure taken by the Government in 1982.
E.   Assessment of the effectiveness  of  the relationship between the Bank
and the borrower during the evolution and implementation of the
project.
The relationship between the Bank and us during the project period was
very close. We think that the discussions with the missions frequent-
ly visited us on the problems and difficulties occurred in the project
were very helpful for us to implement the project effectively.
F.   Evaluation of the performance  of  cofinanciers  and assessment of the
effectiveness of their relationship with Borrower during the evolution
and implemintation of the project.
This item is not connected with the concerned project of Loan No.
