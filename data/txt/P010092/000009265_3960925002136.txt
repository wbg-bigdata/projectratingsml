SECOND WAPDA POWER PROJECT - Loan 1208T-PAK
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
The Project involved:  the construction of a 500-kV single circuit
transmission line between Lyallpur, Multan and Guddu, covering a distance of
about 336 miles; the installation of a 220-kV switching station at Multan;
the supply of tools and equipment for the transformer bay at Lyallpur; and
the training of Pakistani engineers in the operation of the 500-kV network.
It also involved the design and development of a commercial accounting
system. A Bank loan of US$50 million was made for the Project in February
1976. The Project was to be completed in December 1979, and the loan was to
be closed on December 31, 1980. However, because of delays in the
preparation of the bidding documents and, in turn, in the award of contracts
for transmission towers, the Project was not completed until February 1981
and the loan was not cLosed until December 31, 1982. Despite this delay, the
Project was successfully completed at a substantially lower cost than was
originally estimated, US$71.3 million compared to US$113.8 million, largely
because of the glut in the market for equipment and material, which resulted
in lower bids than were projected at appraisal. As a result, only US$30.65
million of the original loan amount of US$50 million was disbursed. The
remaining US$19.35 million was cancelled in steps: US$15 million on
September 7, 1979; US$3 million on July 1, 1981; and US$1.35 million on
February 7, 1983, following the closing of the loan.
This Project Completion Report was prepared by the South Asia Region
on the basis of the Staff Appraisal Report No. 891a-PAK, dated January 29,
1976; the Loan and Project Agreements, both dated January 19, 1976; and other
relevant documents in the Bank files.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this Project Completion Report was read by the Operations
Evaluation Department (OED), but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft PCR to
the Borrower and the Executing Agency, but no comments have been received
from them.

SECOND WAPDA POWER PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Loan 1208T-PAK
Highlights
Loan 1208T-PAK was for the expansion of the extra high voltage
(500-kV) transmission network and related infrastructural and institu-
tional development activities to be implemented by the Water and Power
Development Authority's (WAPDA) Power Wing, the beneficiary of the loan.
The Appraisal Report had anticipated the Project to be completed by Decem-
ber 1979, but because of delays in the preparation of the bidding docu-
ments and, in turn, award contracts for transmission towers, it was not
implemented fully until February 1981. However, due to the glut in the
steel market which reduced the price of equipment and material needed for
the implementation of the Project, its actual cost, amounting to US$71.3
million, was about 37% lower than the Appraisal estimate of US$113.8
million. Consequently, only US$30.65 million of the original loan amount
of US$50 million was disbursed. The remaining US$19.35 million was can-
celled in steps.
Despite the 14 months delay in completing the Project, it fully
achieved its objectives of developing the infrastructure. As planned, the
transmission lines are functioning at 220-kV and are expected to be
upgraded to 500-kV by the end of 1986. In the area of institutional
development, considerable progress was made in improving WAPDA's financial
position and accounting system and practices. WAPDA's financial position
was improved through a series of tariff increases implemented in com-
pliance with the Loan Agreement. These increases, together with the
institution of the fuel adjustment surcharge, enabled WAPDA to meet the
financial target set in the Loan Agreement of financing, on the average,
30% of its investment program from internal sources. In nominal terms,
average revenue per kfJh was increased from 27.6 paise in 1977 to 56.8
paise in 1982, representing an average annual increase of about 15.4%.
As for improving WAPDA's accounting system and practices, the
Appraisal Report had outlined a two phase program to be implemented by a
local auditing firm in association with an accounting firm with interna-
tional experience. Phase I of this program, which focused on a review of
the organizational structure, asset accounting, inventory and consumer
control, including the billing system and accounts receivable, capital
expenditure accounting, was successfully implemented. The initiation of
Phase II of this program, involving the implementation of recommendations
emerging from Phase I, was delayed because the services of both the local



_v-
and international firms were terminated. However, at the request of the
Bank, the international firm was rehired and substantial progress was made
in implementing Phase II. The accounts, nevertheless, were not suffi-
ciently developed to allow proper auditing, and consequently the Bank
waived the audit covenant. Since substantial effort was needed to raise
the quality to an acceptable level, the Bank recommended that the interna-
tional auditing firm continue to provide assistance to WAPDA under the
Third WAPDA Power Project.

SECOND WAPDA POWER PROJECT - Loan 1208T-PAK
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01    In response to the substantial downturn in the growth of real GDP,
from an average annual rate of about 6.0% in the 1960s to about 3.0% between
FY70 and FY74, the Government had formulated an ambitious investment plan for
the period FY76-FY80 to stimulate growth. The plan gave priority to
accelerating the development of the manufacturing sector, earmarking at least
two-thirds of investments for large steel, fertilizer, petrochemical and
cement plants. As these investments were expected to require more reliable
supply of electricity than had been provided in the past, a substantial
increase in investments was also envisaged for the power subsector.
The Power Subsector
1.02    Public supply of electricity is the responsibility of the Water and
Power Development Authority (WAPDA) and the Karachi Electricity Supply Cor-
poration (KESC). WAPDA, a government-owned utility, is comprised of two
operationally independent wings, a Water Wing and a Power Wing. The Water
Wing is responsible for the national irrigation system and the Power Wing for
the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. The Power
Wing, herein referred to for convenience as WAPDA, supplies electricity to
the entire country, except the greater Karachi area which is served by KESC.
In FY75, WAPDA, the beneficiary of the loan, accounted for about 77% of the
electricity sales and KESC for the remaining 23%.
1,03    WAPDA's installed generating capacity amounted to 1,938 MW in FY75,
consisting of 867 MW of hydro, 720 MW of steam and 351 MW of combustion
turbines (Annex 1). About 80% of the installed capacity was located in the
northern region, 16% in the central region and the remaining 4% was located
in the southern region of the country. The transmission system consisted of
about 340 miles of 220-kV lines, 2,100 miles of 132-kV lines and 3,100 miles
of 66-kV lines. The distribution network consisted of 11-kV lines. The
total grid substation transformer capacity amounted to about 2,700 MVA.
1.04    Until FY70, WAPDA's investment program had kept pace with the growth
of demand and its sales had increased from 2,088 GWh in FY66 to 3,600 GWh in
FY70, representing an average annual increase of about 14.6%. Over the next
five years, however, the rate of growth had dropped to about 7.7% because of
supply constraints precipitated by the inability of the Government and WAPDA
to mobilize resources needed to expand the generating capacity to meet the
growth of demand. WAPDA's financial situation had deteriorated mainly



-2-
because of the failure to introduce tariff adjustments needed to compensate
for the substantial increases in the cost of fuel precipitated by the oil
crisis and high system losses which reduced electricity sales and, in turn,
revenues*
1.05    WAPDA's transmission and distribution losses were inordinately high,
amounting to 35% of gross generation in FY75. According to WAPDA's own
estimates, 5% of the total losses were due to theft which included tampering
with meters and unauchorized connections. The remaining 95Z were due to
inadequate capital expenditures in the expansion and reinforcement of the
transmission and distribution lines and grid substations. As a first step
toward reducing system losses, WAPDA had earmarked a specific construction
budget item in the FY76-FY85 power development program (para 2.01) for the
reinforcement and rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution net-
works.
Bank Group Involvement
1.06    The Bank Group's involvement in Pakistan's power subsector began with
the Indus Basin Development Program for which two credits (60-PAK in 1964 and
581-PAK in 1975) and two loans (266-PAK in 1960 and 548-PAK in 1968), amount-
ing to US$176 million were made as contributions to consortium financing of
multipurpose irrigation and power projects, including Tarbela and Mangla
Dams. In addition, a Credit (213-PAK) was made to WAPDA in 1970 for the
expansion of its distribution network. The Project was the Bank Group's
second lending operation with WAPDA.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Project Origin, Preparation, Appraisal, Negotiations and Approval
2.01    The load forecast associated with the Government's investment program
for the period FY76-FY85 implied an average annual increase in demand of
about 12.0% in the early years and of about 9.5% in the later years of that
period. Accordingly, WAPDA's installed capacity was forecast to increase
from 1,938 MW in FY75 to 5,765 MW in FY85, representing an average annual
increase of about 11.5%. The forecast capacity included 2,300 MW of hydro
and 1,450 MW of thermal capacity (Annex 1). The share of hydrop which was
about 41% in 1975, was expected to increase to 56% in 1985. All of the hydro
capacity was to be located in the north and the most of thermal capacity in
the central and southern part of the country. Consequently, in order to
balance the system, WAPDA was expected to continue the evacuation power from
north to south during the wet season and in the opposite direction during the
dry season. To ensure the efficient evacuation of power, WAPDA had planned
the construction of a strong and reliable extra high volt-ge (500-kV) trans-
mission system.



-3-
2.02    It was in the context of this power development program for 1975-1985
that the Project was prepared by WAPDA. It formed an integral part of the
extra high voltage transmission system, covering a distance of about 800
miles, which would eventually connect Tarbela with Karachi. The Project was
appraised in March 1975 and negotiations were held in Washington in November
1975. During negotiations, the Government agreed to finance 30% of its
investment program from internal sources (para 5.04) and to the tariff
increases needed to achieve that objective (para 5.03).
Project Objectives
2.03    The primary objective of the Project was to ensure the least cost
development of the transmission system for the efficient evacuation of power.
In addition, it was to continue the institutional building efforts initiated
under the Bank Group's earlier lending operations by providing training to
WAPDA's staff in the management and operation of the 500-kV facilities;
strengthening the utility's financial position and improving its accounting
system and practices.
Project Description
2.04    The Project covered:
(a)  the construction of a single circuit S00-kV transmission line over
a distance of about 336 miles, linking Lyallpur, Multan and Guddu;
(b)  the installation of a 220-kV switching station at Multan;
(c)  tools and equipment for the construction of the lines and for
the transformer repair bay at Lyallpur;
Cd)  consulting services for engineering and supervision including
training of Pakistani 3ngineers in the operation of the 500-kV
system and for improving the accounting system, practices and
management.
III r IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness
3.01    The conclusion of satisfactory contractual arrangements with the
engineering consultants was a condition of loan. Following compliance, the
loan was made effective on April 30, 1976.



-4-
Project Execution
3.02    The Project was executed satisfactorily, except for a procedural
delay in the appointment of consultants ar.d, in turn, iri the award of con-
tracts for transmission towers. It was primarily due to this delay that the
Project was completed 14 months later than was originally planned, February
1981 instead of December 1979. Despite the delay in their appointment, the
supervision of the tendering process by the consultants was satisfactory.
3.03    During implementation, the design and routing of a portion of the
transmission line crossing the Indus River had to be modified. In the
original design and routing, the transmission line was to be located adjacent
to a bridge which was to be constructed. As the bridge was expected to
provide adequate protection during floods, the original design had called for
the installation of smaller towers than would have been required otherwise.
However, because the construction of the bridge was delayed, a section of the
line several miles long had to be redesigned, rerouted, and built with
heavier foundation.  This was done without delaying the transmission line
schedule for which the borrower should be commended.
3.04    The Project was well implemented and construction proceeded without
major problems. The transmission lines were completed in almost the identi-
cal time provided for in the contract schedule. All the facilities were in
service in February 1981 and are operating temporarily at 220-kV, as planned.
Originally, the lines were expected to be upgraded to 500-kV by 1982, but
were rescheduled for conversion in 1986.
Project Cost
3.05    The Project was completed at a cost of about US$71.3 million, which
is 37% lower than the appraisal estimate of US$113.8 million. A detailed
.omparison of these costs is presented in Annex 2.  The savings amounting
to US$42.5 million, were realized mainly because of the glut in the interna-
tional market which reduced the price of equipment and material needed for
the implementation of the Project. The actual cost was 41% lower than the
appraisal estimate for the transmission lines and towers, 33% for the 220-kV
switching station, 21% for engineering and supervision, 32% for tools and
equipment and 33% for administration and overhead. As a result, only
US$30.65 million of the original loan amount of US$50 million was disbursed.
The remaining US$19.35 million was cancelled in steps: US$15 million on
September 7, 1979; US$3 million on July 1, 1981; and US$1.35 million on
February 7, 1983, following the closing of the loan.
3.06    Prior to the first two cancellations, the Borrower had sought Bank
permission to utilize the surplus funds to finance WAPDA's other power
projects. In 1919, the Bank refused to finance the construction of distribu-
tion facilities on the grounds that these were outside the scope of the
Project. In 1981, the Bank refused on the same grounds, perhaps with less
justification, the financing of the communication facilities for the 500-kV



-5-
transmission system. I/ As these are essential for the efficient operation of
the 500-kY trarsmission lines, provision for such facilities could have been
considered implicit in the Project description as was done with the relay
protection for the transmission line which was financed by the Loan even
though it was not explicitly mentioned in the description of the Project. In
retrospect, the refusal may have resulted from inadequate justification being
provided to the Bank for redeploying unused funds.
Disbursements
3.07    The appraisaL estimate of disbursements and the actual disbursements
are presented in Annex 3. Notwithstanding the cancellation of US$19.4 mil-
lion of the original loan amount, cumulative disbursements were much lower
than the appraisal estimate during project implementation because of delays
in the award of contracts for transmission towers. In addition, disburse-
ments had to be extended beyond the closing date to enable payment withheld
on a contract under the Perfurmance Guarantee.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01    As noted (para 3.02), despite a delay of about 14 months, the Project
was successfully implemented in February 1981. Since then the transmission
lines are, as planned, functioning at 220-kV and are expected to be upgraded
to 500-kY by the end of 1986 (para 3.04). The overall performance of the
transmission line and the switching station have been -atisfactory.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01    WAPDA's income statements, balance sheets and sources and applica-
tions of funds statements, covering the period FY76-FY83, are presented in
Annexes 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The financial statements compare the SAR
forecast for FY76-FY82 with the actual results; but because the loan was not
closed until FY82, the actual results for FY83 also are presented. As shown
below, revenues from electricity sales increased between FY76 and FY82 at a
higher rate of growth than was forecast by the SAR, averaging about 28% a
year compared to 24% a year. This was due to the introduction of tariff

increases higher than were called for under the Loan Agreement (para 5.03).
The rapid growth in revenues from electricity sales enabled WAPDA to achieve
a rate of return on average net fixed assets, valued at historical costs, of
about 17.3% in FY82, which is about twice as high as the 8.9% forecast by the
SAR.

FY76-FY82 are summarized in the table below.

As shown, the percentage increase in average revenue was substantially higher
than the SAR estimate in all years except FY78. Whereas the SAR had stipu-
lated an ave-age annual increase in average revenue of about 8.2%, the actual
increase amounted to about 15.4% a year. Most of this increase was due to
introduction of a fuel adjustment surcharge in FY18, which enabled WAPDA to
recover part of the increase in the cost of fuel from consumers and thereby
increase its revenues from the sale of electricity.



-7-
5.04    These increases in tariffs also enabled WAPDA to finance at least
30% of its investment program from internally generated cash (para 2.02).
The table below compares the forecast and actual level of self-financing
achieved by WAPDA -ince FY79, when the earnings covenant became effective.
As shown, WAPDA's level of internal cash generation in each of the two years
was substantially higher than the level stipulated by Loan Agreement. WAPDA,
therefore, had complied with the Bank covenants, covering tariff increases
and earnings.

5.05    It is to be noted that WAPDA was able to achieve a substantially
higher level of internal cash generation than was forecast by SAR primarily
by reducing its investment program for FY76-FY82 by about 33%, from Rs 27.9
billion to Rs 18.6 billion. The slippages in project implementation ensuing
therefrom resulted in reducing WAPDA's actual elet.tricity sales substantially
below the SAR estimate during the project implementation period: 5,317 GWh
compared to 6,017 GWh in FY76 and 10,288 GWh compared to 13,454 GWh in FY82.
The reductions in WAPDA's investment program and the accompanying shortfalls
in the supply of electricity were the principal reasons for obtaining an
agreement from WAPDA, under the Fourth WAPDA Power Project, on changing the
basis for the calculation of the level of internal cash generation starting
FY89 by adopting the rule requiring the averaging of the year under con-
s;deration, the preceding year and the forthcoming year, and on setting
tariffs to ensure that, as a minimum, WAPDA would finance 40% of the invest-
ment program from internally generated cash. In the interim, however, WAPDA
has agreed to implement a core investment program amounting to Rs 30 billion
over the period FY86-FY88.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
6.01    rhe Project included consulting services for improving WAPDA's
accounting system and organization. Phase I of the work involved the review
of the organizational structure, asset accounting, inventory and consumer
control, including the billing system and accounts receivable, capital expen-
diture accounting, payroll and codes and manuals. Under Phase II the results
of Phase I were to be implemented. About eight man years of consulting
services were envisaged for the implementation of the two phases.
6.02    A local auditing firm, in association with an international account-
ing firm, was engaged by WAPDA. In March 1977, WAPDA reported that it was
introducing some of the changes in its organizational structure and services
recommended under Phase I. It also advised the Bank that the local auditing
firm had been given access to the information on fixed assets, but the firm
was expecting WAPDA to compile this information. Likewise, the firm had
prepared a stores procedure which it expected the Authority to implement by
itself. In October 1977, WAPDA informed the Bank formally that the services
of the local auditing firm had been terminated as of April 30, 1977, i.e.,
immediately after advising the Bank of the problems it was having with the
firm. The international firm, however, had been assigned the work which it
was expected to finish by end-1977.
6.03    The Authority was advised by the Bank to retain the international
firm until Phase II of the work was completed and proposed to finance it from
the Loan. However, in February 1978 WAPDA informed the Bank that the serv-
ices of the international firm had also been terminated, but before leaving
it had trained a team of WAPDA personnel in the new system and that it had
already implemented new commercial and accounting procedures in four of the
field divisions. Moreover, a Central Accounting Manual and a Generation
Accounting Manual were under preparation. Progress was also being made in
reorganizing the accounting establishment, as per the consultants' recommen-
dations. Two chartered accountants had been recruited as General Manager
(Finance) and the Chief Accountant, The Bank resumed the dialogue in April
1978, recommending that the Authority recruit consultants for implementing
Phase II as its senior staff would be occupied by regular work. Finally, in
September 1978, the Authority did rehire the same international firm.
6.04    Progress in the training activities was reported in March 1979 and
towards the end of the Project the situation was as follows:
(a)  all operating and service divisions were to convert to a full
double-entry accrual accounting system on July 1, 1980;
(b)  comercial procedures had been improved (service connection,
metering, billing, etc.), which accounted for a share of the
the increase in revenue in 1980 (Annex 4); and



-9-
(c)  the staff was more enthusiastic about the prospect of improved
accounting and procedures.
However, as much work remained to be done, the Bank recommended that the
international auditing firms assistance be continued under the Third Power
Project. This was done, inter alia, to improve store management, provide a
proper internal audit system and enhance computer data capability.
6.05    Nevertheless, the Bank continues to waive the audit covenant as the
accounts are still not sufficiently developed to allow for proper auditing of
accounts, a condition that had been realized at appraisal. WAPDA's account-
ing organization is still in a state where a good deal of effort is needed to
raise the quality of its operations to an acceptable level.
VII. ECONOMIC REVALUATION
1.01    The SAR's economic justification of the Project was based only on
unquantifiable benefits to be derived from an interconnected system such as
pooling of generating plants with different operating characteristics, reduc-
tion in the total reserve plant capacity required for a reasonable standard
or service, a reduction in the aggregate demands of the regions by virtue of
diversity, ability to locate power stations at optimum sites and of optimum
characteristics to take advantage of economics of scale and flexibility to
allow the best positioning of load points. This approach, as stated in the
SAR, was adopted because it was difficult to quantify the benefits
attributable to the Project and, therefore, to calculate the economic rate of
return. Although it is true that the benefits attributable to the Project
cannot be isolated from those of generation and distribution, a rate of
return on a time slice of WAPDA's investment program could have been calcu-
lated as a proxy for the return on the Project. In order to remedy this
shortcoming, both the ex-ante and ex-post IERRs have been calculated based on
measurable costs and benefits. The measurable costs include:
(a)  capital and labor costs involved in the development of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities;
(b) the annual operation and maintenance costs; 1/ and
(c) the incremental fuel costs, comprising natural gas, fuel oil,
diesel oil and coal, all valued at their economic cost of supply.
1/ For the calculation of the ex-ante IERR operation and maintenance costs
were assumed at about 30% of capital costs.



The measurable benefits include the incremental revenues associated with the
investment program. The revenues also were expressed in terms of their
equivalent border values. Details of the assumption used are presented in
Annex 7.
7.02    The ex-ante return was estimated at about 10% (Annex 8).  Although
actual sales were lower than those projected during appraisal, the ex-post
benefits were higher mainly because the tariff increases between 1976 and
1985 were significantly higher than projected under the ex-ante analysis. In
addition, the ex-post capital outlays and fuel costs were also lower than
projected during appraisal. As a result, the ex-post return was about 10.6%
(Annex 9), slightly higher than the ex-ante rate of return. This indicates
that the Project continues to be justified on economic grounds as the ex-post
return compares favourably with the opportunity cost of capital of about 11X.
VIII. PERFORMANCE OF THE BORROWER AND THE BANK
8.01    The performance of WAPDA, the executing agent, was satisfactory
despite the delay in appointing consultants and in initiating the implementa-
tion of the transmission facilities. The transmission facilities were well
constructed and were completed in almost the identical time provided for in
the contract schedule. Credit for this should be given to WAPDA which
fostered cooperation among consultants, suppliers and contractors. Such
cooperation is necessary for the timely implementation of any project.
However, WAPDA could have expended more effort in improving its accounting
organization and practices, but this would have required greater Bank par-
ticipation, which was limited. As for GOP, it provided tariff increases as
needed, and enabled WAPDA to comply with the Bank's self-financing covenant
(para 2.02).
8.02    The Bank maintained good relations with the Borrower and the
Beneficiary during loan processing and project implementation. The Project,
as appraised, was technically justified and the Bank's involvement fostered
the completion of a part of the extra high voltage transmission facilities
that would form the backbone of the transmission grid for the efficient
evacuation of bulk power. This involvement has also enabled the Bank to gain
a better understanding, than it had at appraisal, of the issues constraining
the development of the subsector and the measures needed to address them and
has enhanced its dialogue with the Government which has resulted in three
other lending operations with WAPDA (the Third, Fourth and Fifth Power
Projects) and the Energy Sector Loan. Through these lending operations the
Bank is systematically pursuing the goals of promoting the integrated
development of the energy sector and strengthening WAPDA's financial posi-
tion, improving its accounting system and practices, reducing losses in the
transmission and distribution networks, formulating a least cost development
plan for the power subsector and improving the efficiency of WAPDA's thermal
power plants.



IX* CONCLUSIONS
9.01    The Project was entirely satisfactory in that the power transmission
facilities were satisfactorily completed and are functioning properly. This
work was done at a substantially lower cost than was originally estimated.
Eventually almost US$20 million of the Loan had to be cancelled.
9.02    Institutionally, the Project helped initiate improvements in the
organization and methods of WAPDA's accounting establishment.  Although a
good start was made much more remains to be done and is currently being
pursued under the Fourth WAPDA Power Project.
9.03    Financially, WAPDA's position had improved considerably by the time
the Project was completed. This was the result of tariff increases generally
following the plan devised by the Bank at appraisal. It resulted in finan-
cial rates of return on historically valued assets of as much as 18% by
project end, and self-financing of investment of nearly 40X. This improve-
ment, however, masks serious anomalies. The high level of self-financing was
achieved by reducing the investment program and as a result acute shortages
of electricity continue to be experienced. A second is the extent of power
losses, in particular those due to irregularities and theft, which had
remained unchanged at about 10% of gross generation.
9.04    Thus, WAPDA's progress during the Project was mixed.  It was quite
adequate in the context of the Project; but in broader terms, fundamental
problems remain to be resolved, specifically, the ones noted above
(paras 8.02 and 9.03). Thesa are being addressed under the Fourth and Fifth
Power Projects and the Energy Sector Loan.
