REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE
SECOND WAPDA POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equi'Lvalent of US$50 million
to help finance a project for expanding the power transmission capacity of
the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). 'Che loan would be on
standard Third Window terms of 25 years, including seven years of grace,
with interest of 4-1/2% per annum. The loan will be relent to WAPDA for
25 years, including five years of grace, at 8-1/2% interest p.a.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Current Economic Situation and
Issues in Pakistan" (658-PAK, dated March 28, 1975) was distributed to the
Executive Directors on April 11, 1975. Country data sheets are attached
as Annex I.
3.        The economy of Pakistan (then West Pakistan) expanded at an
average annual rate of more than 6% during the decade of the 1960's. In
the Second Plan period (1960-65) this growth was spearheaded by industrial
growth of 13% per annum. During the Third Plan (1965-70) agricultural out-
put grew at 6.2% annually with the aid of new high-yLelding wheat and rice
varieties, compared with less than 4% in the first half of the decade, but
the industrial growth rate fell to 8.6%.   During the 1970's, however, the
growth rate has been considerably lower.   During fiscal years 1970/71 and
1971/72, there was virtually no change in total output as political uncer-
tainties and the conflicts culminating in the separation and independence
of East Pakistan resulted in a decline in industrial activity, while drought
virtually halted agricultural growth. Since the return of civilian rule in
late December 1971, growth has been fairly modest. After two years without
growth, the GNP grew by 7% in FY1973, but the increase declined to 5% in
FY1974 and in FY1975 it was less than 3%. The industrial expansion was
the result primarily of fuller utilization of capacity.
4.        In FY1975, Pakistan suffered a series of setbacks.    These included
record low river flows reducing irrigation and hydroelectric power, a deteri-
oration of about 20% in the terms of trade, and falling export demand caused
by the general world recession. In addition, because of damage to the
stilling basins repairs to the Tarbela Dam have taken longer than expected
and irrigation potential will probably not be availa'ble till late in FY1976.
However, there have also been important positive developments, including an
acceleration of public investment, some upturn in private investment, growing
economic ties with, and capital flows from, the Middle East oil-producing

- 2 -
countries, the reopening of relations with Bangladesh, and prospects for a
slowdown in world and domestic inflation.
5.        In FY1975 the output of the major agricultural crops may have
declined by 3% or more owing to lack of water. River flows during the 1974
summer crop season were the lowest in the past 90 years and fall and early
winter canal supplies were only 40% to 50% of normal. Hleavy rains in the
summer of 1975 make prospects for FY1976 quite bright.    Good harvests are
expected for rice and sugarcane, although some flooding in Sind Province
will reduce cotton production. In late 1974 the government lowered agricul-
tural export duties and in early 1975 it announced higher procurement prices
and higher prices to consumers, which wil:L encourage agricultural output
and eliminate some food subsidies.   Procurement prices will probably need
to be raised further, however, in order to give sufficient incentive to
production. Other government programs which should assist agricultural
growth are those to improve seeds and cultural practices, to increase
availability of fertilizer, and to reduce water-logging and salinity.
With the increasing desire of small and medium-scale farmers to participate
in the "green revolution", agricultural growth in the next five years could
accelerate if appropriate pricing, water management, extension and other
programs are followed. Substantial increases in production in FY1977 can
be expected when water from the Tarbela reservoir becomes available.
6.        Domestic savings rates have declined steadily since 1969/70,
dropping from 13% to 5.6% of GDP in FY1975. Private savings declined from
12.1% to 6.5% of GDP over the same period while public savings moved from
+1% to -1% of GDP. Public saving will have to be substantially increased
if a satisfactory rate of growth in the future is to be maintained and
excessive reliance on external borrowing avoided. In recent months, the
government has taken soume significant steps to reduce subsidies, restrain
other non-development expenditures, and co increase revenues from Govern-
ment enterprises. These have included substantially higher prices for
wheat, vegetable ghee and sugar, a doubling of the price of natural gas,
and higher electric power and petroleum product prices.
7.        After more than a decade during which prices rarely rose more
than 2-3% annually, Pakistan has been experiencing price increases of
20% to 30% annually since early 1972. Since mid-1973 the growth of the
money supply has been limited to about 14% annually by monetary and fiscal
restraint. At the same time (late 1973) that these restraints began to
curb domestic inflation, however, international prices began to increase
sharply. The dollar prices of imports rose by 37% in FY1974 and by a
further 20% in FY1975.   Dollar export prices rose 52% in EY1974, but declined
by 2% in FY1975.   With the presently lower rates of international inflation,
however, the rate of price increase in Pakistan has declined.    From April
to September, 1975, the wholesale price index increased by less than 1%,
compared with a 24% increase during the same period in 1974.
8.        The deterioration. in Pakistan's balance of payments resulting
from increased imports, particularly of wheat, and the adverse changes in
the terms of trade, are reflected in an increase in the current account



deficit plus debt repayment from US$239 million in 1972/73 to US$665 mil-
lion in 1973/74 and an estimated US$1,378 million irn 1974/75. The deficit
in 1974/75 has been financed principally by aid fromi the Pakistan Consortium
and from OPEC countries, which enabled Pakistan to f'inance its balance of
payments deficit in 1974/75 with only about US$116 million of short-term
borrowing and some draw-down of net reserves. Indications of aid at the May
1975 meeting of the Pakistan Consortium amounted to about $660 million and
were significantly higher than in the previous year and, combined with ex-
pectations of assistance from OPEC countries and other sources, suggest that
long-term capital receipts may be sufficient to limi't new short-term credits
in FY76. In subsequent years, rising agricultural, fertilizer and other
domestic production should moderate the increase in trade deficits, but the
balance of payments situation will be adversely affected by rising debt amor-
tization payments, particularly after the end of the debt-relief period in
June 1978.
9.        Pakistan's external public debt at the end of June 1975 amounted
to about US$5.3 billion equivalent, of which US$1.2 billion was undisbursed.
At present Pakistan's debt service problem has been eased by the arrangement
concluded in June 1974 whereby countries participating in the Pakistan Con-
sortium agreed to provide US$650 million equivalent in debt relief over four
years. In FY75 the debt service ratio to export earnings and non-factor
service and factor income receipts was almost 18%. However, with the end
of the debt relief arrangement in FY79, Pakistan's debt service ratio must
be expected to increase somewhat. It is therefore important that Pakistan
should make every effort to increase its domestic savings and exports and
that borrowing on conventional terms should be held to a minimum. For this
reason the major part of Bank Group operations in Pakistan consists of IDA
loans. All the projects scheduled for Pakistan this year, apart from the
one here proposed, will be financed by IDA credits. In view of Pakistan's
poverty and the strains upon Pakistan's creditworth:Lness arising out of its
balance of payments and external debt position, and taking into account the
country's performance in economic development, Pakistan is also considered
eligible for Third Window loans from the Bank.
10.       Including undisbursed amounts, Pakistan's debt to the Bank and
IDA now represents about 16% of its external public indebtedness; by 1980
this ratio is likely to fall to about 13%. The share of the Bank Group in
total debt service (after taking account of the debt relief which Pakistan
will receive from other creditors) is now about 23%, but is expected to
decrease to about 9% in 1980.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAIKISTAN
11.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclu-
sive of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the
former East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.2 billion. During
its long association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in
almost all sectors of the economy. Through FY75, 43% of total commitments
were for public services, 24% for agriculture, 22% for industry, 10% for



industrial imports and 1% for education. Lending for public services has
amounted to nearly US$500 nmillion and has included loans and credits for
railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecom-
munications and water supplies. A large part of past lending for agri-
culture was for Indus Basin projects. The lending for industry has been
mainly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation
(PICIC). For most projects for which loans and credits are being disbursed,
construction is now going ahead satisfactorily. The principal problems being
encountered are that the rates charged by some of the public services have
not kept pace with inflation and, hence, some utilities are not earning the
return which they need. Furthermore, some institutions have financial prob-
lems arising from the loss of assets in the former East Pakistan. These
problems are the subject of current discussions between the Bank and the
Government. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA
credits as of .November 30, 1975, and notes on the execution of ongoing proj-
ects.
12.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three mnain objectives.   One
of these is to support the directly-productive sectors of the economy, to
increase production of import-substitutes such as foodgrains, edible oils,
fertilizer and engineering and capital goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial
and agricultural products.   The main part of Bank Group assistance for
industry will continue to be through financial intermediaries, such as
PICIC, the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and the National
Development Finance Corporation (NDFC) which provides finance primarily
for industries in the public sector. The most important part of future
lending for agriculture is expected to be for the Government's new pro-
grain to increase productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity
and improving the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater.     The
Bank is the Executing Agency for a UTNDP technical assistance grant for
improving agriculture and water planning in the Indus Basin.
13.       Another objective is to continue to support the necessary expan-
sion and to improve the institutions which are responsible for tle prin-
cipal public services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in
the past, namely, Telegraph and Telephone Department, Water and Power
Development Authority, Pakistan Railways, and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines
Company. The present loan will assist in the expansion of the supply of
electric power which is now badly needed to support further growth in
agriculture and industry.
14.       A third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. This proposed shift,
which implies increased lending for agriculture and rural development, will
be accompanied by significant lending for projects complementary to the
Indus/Tarbela works.   This may involve botih large drainage projects and
smaller-scale, more staff-intensive projects tilroughout the sector and the
country. Although not yet reflected in the record of loans and credits
approved, this shift has, in fact, already occurred in terms of staff time

devoted to the preparation of projects in rural development, livestock and
forestry. The Government is giving increasing attention to rural develop-
ment and the Bank has sent a number of missions to discuss the rural devel-
opment program and to assist both the Federal and Provincial Governments to
formulate specific proposals and to prepare a project for Bank Group financ-
ing. However, the implementation of the rural development program is still
in the early stage, and is largely dependent upon the initiative of the
Provinces.
15.       At the Government's request, Bank missions have been working with
municipal authorities on the plans for the urban development of Karachi,
whose population now exceeds 4 million. A Karachi master plan was completed
in 1974 with the assistance of consultants financed by UNDP, and urban
projects are being developed within the framework of this plan. In view of
the preparatory work which has already been done on urbanization problems of
Karachi, there are good prospects for worthwhile participation by the Bank
Group in this area, beginning with a project in the Lyari section of the city.
The Government has also asked the Bank to study urbanization problems in
Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city. Planning in Lahore is at a much
earlier stage than in Karachi and the immediate need is for technical assist-
ance.  A mission to examine problems of urbanization and regional development
of smaller cities and on a country-wide basis visited Pakistan in March 1975.
16.       Among the projects now being prepared for ycur consideration are
a seed project, a third education project, a second water supply, drainage
and sewerage project for Lahore, an urban project ir! Karachi, arid an irrigation
and drainage project in Sind. All of these projects: have been appraised.
Preparatory work is also proceeding on a loan for a fertilizer project, in
which IFC may participate, a livestock project, a rutral development project
and further irrigation and drainage projects.
17.        IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 million by
equity participations (these are shown in Annex II).. About US$11 million
remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three in the
field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one each in steel,
cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
18.       The Electricity Act of 1910 governs the sector and empowers the
Government to issue licenses for the supply of electric power in various
areas of the country. Furthermore, the 1973 Constitution empowers both
the central and provincial parliaments to pass legislation on matters
referring to electricity. It is possible that under this constitutional
provision some provinces will take over from WAPDA certain distribution and
transmission assets within their boundaries and establish their own



electricity supply organizations. An understanding has therefore been
reached that should the Government intend to initiate legislation or action
designed to restructure the power sector, the Bank will be informed in suffi-
cient time to allow an exchange of views with the Bank regarding the effect
on WAPDArs power wing. The public power supply is primarily the responsibility
of WAPDA and the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, Ltd. (KESC). WAPDA,
which serves the whole country with the exception of the Karachi area, accounts
for about 75% of power supply, KESC for the remaining 25%. About 14% of
WAPDA's output is sold to various licensees which distribute within their
area of supply. The 125 MW Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), owned and
operated by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, sells its energy in bulk
to KESC. A number of private industries have their own small plants, mainly
for stand-by purposes, which have an estimated total capacity of 230 St{.
19.       Following the Indus Waters Treaty 1960 between India and Pakistan,
WAPDA was made responsible for implementing the Indus Basin development pro-
gram which consists of a series of multi-purpose installations with a large
power component and many irrigation canals and barrages, as well as tube-
wells for lift irrigation and salinity control. In FY1974 about 25% of WAPDA's
output was consumed by some 64,000 tubewells, which have an average capacity
of 10 kW.
20.       The Government and WAPDA are trying to accelerate the village
electrification program. However, due to financial constraints as well as
implementation difficulties, achievement l1as fallen short of the target.
Planning calls for electrification of 1,000 villages per year, but only
580 villages were electrified in FY1974 and somewqhat fewer than 800 in
FY1975.
21.       At the end of EYt975, WAPDA's installed capacity amounted to
1,935 MW, divided between hydro (45,'), steam (37%) and gas turbine (18%).
The hydro installations are concentrated in the north and the thermal ones
in the center of the cotntry. The transmission system consists of about
340 miles of 220 kV lines, 2,100 miles of 132 kV lines and 3,100 miles of
66 kV lines. Distribution is effected through a network of 11 kV lines.
The aggregate grid substation transformer capacity amounts to about 2,700
MVA.  Systems losses have been higih, exceeding 30% of units generated in
most years. These high losses are due, in the main, to inadequlate invest-
ments in transmission, grid substation and distribution facilities in the
last several years.
22.       From FY1966 through FY1970, when WAPDA's investments were still
capable of keeping abreast of the demand development, sales increased
annually by about 15%-23% (except in 1966/67, a year of exceptionally low
water). Since FY1971 growth rates have dropped to 2%-11%,' per year, indi-
cating not only the effects of political unrest and severe drought, but
also the fact that for many years WAPDA and the Government have been unable
to raise the funds required for an investment programa in step with the
potential power demand. This has resulted in blackouts, load shedding,
high losses and an inability to connect new customers at the required rate.
In mid-1974 WAPDA served about 1.6 million consumers; industrial customers
accounted for nearly half of total sales, followed by agricuilture whichi



took another quarter. The remainder was for domestic and commercial consumers,
public lighting and bulk supply.
23.       The sector expansion program (1975-85) for power generation, which
is based on projected demand growth of an average of 10.7% per year, calls
for the earliest possible development of the hydro potential at Tarbela
(2,100 MW) and the remaining units at Mangla (200 MW) and Warsak (80 MW) for
a total of 2,380 MW. The thermal expansion includes .500 MW of gas turbines,
1,275 MW of steam turbines and 1,200 MW of nuclear power.    The total new
installations during the 1975-85 period will be 5,355 MW of which WAPDA will
be responsible for about 60% or about 3,230 MW. This may be compared with
the country's total installed capacity of 2,448 MW on June 30, 1975. The
total WAPDA development program for the Project const:ruction period, i.e.,
FY76-80, anticipates investment expenditures of almost US$1.8 billion. Of
this amount about US$574 million equivalent is in foreign exchange and about
US$1.2 billion in local currency. In addition to the proposed loan, about
US$490 million of the foreign exchange cost of the program still has to be
secured.  Moreover, about US$700 million in local currency will have to be
found from domestic resources. However, the program is essential for meeting
the increased demand at a reasonable standard of service.
WAPDA
24.       WAPDA, created in 1958 and subordinate to the Ministry of Fuel,
Power and Natural Resources, has responsibility for the coordinated devel-
opment of the country's water and power resources. A:Ltlhough a quasi-auto-
noinous entity, it acts in many respects as a Governmenit agent carrying out
various design and construction tasks for the central and local governments
in the areas of irrigation, water supply and drainage, generation, trans-
mission and distribution of electric power, including construction, main-
tenance and operation of power houses and grids; flood control; inland
navigation; and the prevention of waterlogging and reclamation of water-
logged and saline land.
25.       WAPDA's management, the "Authority", consists of a Chairman and
three members responsible for power, water and finances, all of whom are
appointed by the Government. WAPDA is subdivided into a Water Wing, respon-
sible for all matters concerning irrigation, water supply and flood control,
and a Power Wing, conceived as a revenue earning public utility responsible
for construction and operation of power generation, transmission and distri-
bution facilities throughout the country with the exception of the areas
served by KESC and various small licensees.
26.       In August, 1970 the Association granted a credit of US$23 million
(Credit 213 PAK) to expand WAPDA's distribution faciliLties by provision of
about 900 MVA of transformer capacity, to be installed at about 100 new sub-
stations, and rehabilitation of about 300 MVA of exisiting substation trans-
formers. The project also included the addition of a second circuit to the
132 KV transmission line from Dharki to Rohri.   Implementation of this
project has been delayed about two and a half years. This has been caused
primarily by the unsettled political conditions following the 1971 war,



-0-
which in turn resulted in frequent changes in WAPDA's top management.    More
recently, contractual disputes arising frorn cost escalation claims by a num-
ber of foreign equipment suppliers resulted in further delays. These have
now been settled and equipment deliveries have resumed. The project is now
expected to be completed in late 1976.
27.       WAPDA's complex organization structure has been the subject of a
number of studies, a'l of which have recommended the introduction of systems
to streamline management and accounting, and to provide effective management
information flows. The first WAPDA Power Plroject (Credit 213-PAK) included
a requirement for consulting services to improve management and to supply
the management of the Power Wing with information necessary for planning
its operations, services and future investment needs but because of frequent
management changes, very little lhas been done so far. However, after the
appointment of a new Chairman in January 1975, the climate for introducing
improvements appears to be favorable. In recent discussions with the Bank,
WAPDA and Government officials acknowledged that improvement in accounting
and financial management was urgently required.    Accordingly, under the
proposed Project, WAPDA has hired local management and accounting consultants,
who will assure maximum involvement of WAPDA's staff in their consulting
effort. The assignment will be carried out in cooperation with a foreign
firm under contractual arrangements agreed to by the Bank with the foreign
exchange cost financed from proceeds of the proposed loan. Since part of
these expenses are to be incurred before the loan is signed, retroactive
financing of up to US$100,000 for expenses incurred after September 1, 1975,
for this purpose is proposed.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The proposed project, to be implemented during FY76-80, was
appraised in Aarch/April, 1'975.  The Appraisal Report (No. 891a-PAK) on
the project is being distributed separately. A loan and project summary
is attached as Aninex III.  Negotiations took place in Xashington during
.ovcmber 1975.   The Borrower's delegation was led by Mr. H. U. Beg,
Secretary, Ministry of Fuel, Power and National Resources.
Project Description and Implemerntation
29.       Project components include construction of 336 miles of 500 kV
single circuit transmission line extending south from Lyallpur to Multan
and Guddu; installation of a 220 kV switching station at Multan; provision
of tools and equipment, engineering and supervision services, training in
500 kV system operation, and accounting and management consulting services.
The project forms part of a comprehensive 500 kV transmission system which
will eventually connect the hydro-resources of the north with the thermal
generation in the center and south. Part of this 500 kV transmission sys-
tem, the line from Tarbela to Lyallpur, is being constructed with Canadian
(CIDA) assistance and Kuwait has agreed to finance the Guddu-liyderabad-
Karachi portion.



- 9 -
30.       The transmission lines of the project would be operated initially
at 220 kV with conversion to 500 kV operation not later than mid-1982. The
line Multan to Guddu, to be completed by December 1977, would transmit the
excess thermal energy generated by the 430 MW Guddu plant in the central
area to the load centers in the northern area during the low water season
of the hydro plants. The line Lyallpur to Multan, to be completed by
1978/79, would reinforce the existing 220 kV double circuit line and
enable the transmission of additional hydro energy to the load centers
of Multan and the central area during the high water season of the hydro
plants.
31.       The Lyallpur-Multan-Guddu line will be const:ructed with single
circuit towers and bundled conductors similar to those being used on the
Tarbela-Lyallpur line. The 220 kV switching station is required for the
interconnection at Multan and will later become the low tension side of
the future 500 kV substation. Terminal facilities for the interconnection
at Lyallpur and Guddu are currently being constructed by WAPDA.
32.       Consultants qualified in 500 kV transmission design in association
with a local firm will assist WAPDA in design, preparation of bid documents,
award of contracts and supervision of construction. It is estimated that
500 man months of field and head office time will be required by the foreign
consultant. Consultants have been selected and contract negotiations are
underway. To ensure that the Project does not fall behind schedule, conclusion
of contractual arrangements acceptable to the Bank wit:h the consultants
is a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01(c) of the Loan Agreement).
Costs and Financing
33.       Total project costs, including contingencies, are estimated at
US$113.8 million, including a foreign exchange component of US$50 million
(about 44% of the total cost) which would be financed by the proposed loan.
Major project components and their respective costs are: transmission lines,
US$79.5 million; 220 kV switching station, US$11.3 million; tools, equipment
and transformer repair bay, US$5.7 million; engineering, supervision, and
accounting consulting services, US$8.7 million; and WAPDA administration,
inland freight, local insurance and miscellaneous buildings, US$8.6 million.
The basic prices were determined from the Tarbela-Lyallpur line which is now
under construction. A physical contingency allowance of 10% has been included
in the above estimates; price contingencies of 15% per year on local costs and
12%-10%-8% per year on foreign costs during the construction period have also
been provided for.
34.       The proposed loan of US$50 million would finance the foreign
exchange costs of materials and equipment, engineering consulting services
and training, and accounting and management consulting services. The pro-
posed project is a part of WAPDA's investment program, the local cost of
which is expected to be financed by internal cash generation to tlle extent
of about 20% and by Government equity contributions and loans for the bal-
ance.

Procurement and Disbursement
35.       All major items of material for the project would be procured by
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank's Guidelines.    Some
participation by Pakistani manufacturers is envisaged in which case a 15%
preference on the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing duties, if lower, would
be applicable. However, it is not likely that Pakistani manufacturers will
be able to compete successfully, as the quantitites involved are beyond the
capacity of the local manufacturers after meeting the normal requirements
of the country. If domestic manufacturers are awarded contracts, the loan
would finance the total cost of the local purchases and would to that ex-
tent finance local expenditures. Details of the cost estimates, which in-
clude customs duties, and estimated disbursements are shown in Annex III.
36.       There are competent local contracting firms for construction of
the line, two of which are now engaged in the construction of the Tarbela-
Lyallpur line. These firms should be in a competitive position and will
likely win awards for the construction of the Lyallpur-Multan-Guddu trans-
mission line, which will immediately follow that of the Tarbela-Lyallpur
line. The contracts for this work, which will be awarded on the basis of
local competitive bidding, will be handled and financed by WAPDA.
Financial Covenants
37.       Under the terms of the Association's earlier power credit (Credit
213-PAK), WAPDA was required to earn a rate of return of at least 8% per
year on average net fixed assets in operation. WAPDA has not been able to
reach this target, although up to FY73 it managed to maintain rates of return
of around 6% and net internal cash generation of about 20% of annual capital
expenditures. Beginning in FY74, however, because of heavy fuel cost in-
creases and despite a tariff increase of about 15% in February 1975, WAPDA's
earnings fell sharply and yielded a rate of return of barely 2%. A further
tariff increase of about 13% in June 1975 improved the situation only
slightly. l1APDA's low earnings (with an average sales price at present of
2.3 US cents equivalent per Kwh) have led to extensive borrowing and this,
in turn, has increased debt service requirements and raised the debt/equity
ratio to level of 80/20 in Ff75.
38.       In the light of WAPDA's heavy capital expansion program, a well
balanced financial situation must be restored. Since a single tariff in-
crease sufficient to ensure a proper level of internal cash generation
would not be feasible, it has been agreed that tariffs will be increased
step by step, starting with a 20% increase by March next year, so that by
FY80 net internal cash generation would amount to 30% of the average of power
investment over a three-year period (Section 4.02 of the Loan Agreement
and Section 4.04 of the Project Agreement). This earnings test addresses
itself directly to WAPDA's need to finance a heavy investment program and would
take the place of a rate of return requirement. It would avoid the difficul-
ties of revaluing WAPDA's assets which would be necessary for a meaningful
rate of return covenant.    Moreover, in order to assist WAPDA to meet the
targeted level of cash generation, it was agreed that each year, from 1976



- 11 -
through 1979, the Bank and WAPDA would review and agree upon-WAPDA's financing
plan for the power wing for the following year before submission of the
plan to the Government for approval (Section 4.05 of the Project Agreement).
To strengthen WAPDA's capital base, the Government will make capital contri-
butions, free of dividend or interest, in any given year up to FY80 equivalent
to the shortfall between the net internal cash generat:ion actually earned
and that equivalent to 30% of annual investments (Sect:ion 4.02 of the Loan
Agreement). Effective November 3, 1975, the Government permitted WAPDA to
include a fuel adjustment clause in its tariff. It was agreed (Section 4.08
of the Project Agreement), that WAPDA would continue t:o apply such a clause.
To ensure stricter financial discipline, it was agreed that there would be
no further fund transfers between the power and water wings and that WAPDA
would maintain the amount of outstanding receivables at not more than the amount
billed during the previous three months (Sections 4.06 and 4.07 of the Project
Agreement).
39.       With a tariff increase of 20% by March 31, 1977, and assuming
further increases of 25% in 1978 and 10% in 1980, net internal cash generation
should cover about 20% of WAPDA's proposed power investment of about US$1.8
billion over the next five years. Foreign borrowings would finance about 32%
of the investment program, while local borrowings (38%,) and Government equity
contributions (10%) would provide the balance. During this period, WAPDA's
gross fixed assets would more than triple, its debt/equity ratio would
fall to 74/26 and its rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
would rise to 5.1% in FY76 and vary between 9% and 10% thereafter.
Benefits
40.       Upon completion of Pakistan's 500 kV transmission system, the
large hydro-facilities in the north will be fully interconnected with the
major natural gas-fired thermal facilities, situated adjacent to the Sui
gas fields in the Upper Sind area, and with other thermal plants at the
various major load centers, such as Lyallpur, Multan and Karachi. The
reduction of hydro-capacity in the critical period of March-April-May
as a result of low reservoir levels will be compensated for by the thermal
capacity available in the Upper Sind area.    More importantly, however, there
will be a significant saving in generating capacity requirements due to (i)
seasonal diversity in peak demands between the Northern, Central and Southern
Regions and (ii) pooling of reserves. If these three regions were operated
in isolation, the total required reserve capacity for the Pakistan System
(basically represented by the largest generating unit in each region) would
be of the order of 1,410 MW by 1985. With adequate regional interconnection,
as proposed, the reserve requirement falls to 600 MW. Furthermore, owing to
the difference in the seasonal demand between regions, the coincident peak
demand for the Pakistan System in 1985 would be 340 MW less than it would
be for the three major regions operating in isolation. Thus the intercon-
nection will save 1,150 MW of generating capacity by 1985, which at present
day costs represents a saving of about US$460 million. The cost of the 500
kV transmission line from Lyallpur to Karachi, complete with all necessary
substation equipment, has been estimated at US$234 million at present-day
prices - equivalent to about half the savings in generation investment
referred to above.



- 12 -
41.       The.Project which will connect Lyallpur with Multan and Guddu
(336 miles) forms only a part of the ultimate north-south ihterconnection
and, given system conditions which will exist at the time the Project is
expected to be commissioned (1979) could be satisfactorily operated at 220
kV, thus postponing substantial capital investment in 500 kV substation
terminal equipment. Building the Project for ultimate 500 kV operation
but operating initially at 220 kV is estimated to cost $113 million which
is equivalent to $81 million at present-day costs. With this limited in-
terconnection between the Northern and Central Regions, a reduction in
reserve capacity require-nents of 175 MW and of 30 EMW due to diversity
between the maximum demands of the two regions would be realized. These
reductions would represent investment savings in generating capacity of
approximately US$82 million at present-day costs. To these capital cost
savings should be added the annual savings in operating costs which would
accrue from the greater use of hydro generation at Tarbela and Mangla and
the displacement of oil and higher cost gas-fired generation at Multan
and Lyallpur by cheaper gas-fired generation at the more efficient Guddu
thermal units.
42.       Given the complexities of the operation of the entire system it
is difficult to quantify all the benefits attributable to the Project and,
therefore, to calculate its internal economic return. The justification
of the complete 500 kV transmission scheme and therefore of the Project
rests basically upon the benefits, many of which are difficult to quantify,
brought about by interconnected systems, e.g., pooling of generating plants
of different operating characteristics, reduction in the total reserve plant
capacity required for a reasonable standard of service, a reduction in the
aggregate demands of the regions by virtue of diversity, ability to locate
power stations at optimum sites and of optimum characteristics to take
advantage of economies of scale, and flexibility to allow the best posi-
tioning of tapping of load points. The project is not expected to create
environmental problems. Since one 500 kV is equivalent to approximately
five 220 kV lines, the amount of right of way is greatly reduced and the
appearance improved.

C. Projects in Execution
Credit No. 50 Education: US$8.5 Million Credit of March 25, 1964;
Effective Date: August 14, 1964; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
Project implementation, originally scheduled for four years
has been delayed by eight years, due to cumbersome administrative pro-
cedures, wars, floods, labor unrest and price escalation. Despite delays
and cost inflation, the total project cost in US dollars will be within
the appraisal estimate because of the devaluation of the Pakistan rupee
in 1972. Civil works are 95% completed; equipment procurement is also
virtually completed except for the Polytechnical Institutes at Sind.
The Sind Province is likely to be able to use only about 75% of the
credit funds available for this province. The technical assistance
program has been completed. Disbursements to date amount to 92% of
the Credit and are likely to amount to 98% by June 30, 1976, the final
Closing Date.
Loan No. 548 Tarbela Dam: US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1968;
Effective Date: August 2, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements began
in March 1975.  On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted through
tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction of the
closure sectica of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974, the main
embankment had been completed to full height, and the first impoundment
began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties were encountered
in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one of the tunnels necessi-
tated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course of' which further damage
was incurred. A program of remedial works is nearing completion. The second
filling of the reservoir is now in progress. Agreement has been reached with
the Parties to the Indus Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agreements whereby
special contributions would be made by a number of the parties and IDA to
help meet the costs of the repairs and additional remedial works.
1/       These notes are designed  to inform the Executive Directors
regarding the progress of projects in execution, and in
particular to report any problems which are being encountered,
and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 590 Development Finance Company - PICIC: US$40.0 Million Loan
of March 21, 1ctive Date:, ay 21, 1969; Closing
Date: September 30, 1976
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 1974 was postponed first to September 30, 1975 and then
to September 30, 1976, the current date, to enable disbursements to
be made for the last sub-project.
Loan No. 621 Railways: US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969; Effective
Date: August 28, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Progress on the rehabilitation and improvement of track and
bridges, workshops and depots has been satisfactory. The main outstand-
ing item is construction of the first stage of a new marshalling yard
at Pipri, near Karachi. The location of this yard has been changed
twice, following protracted investigations and negotiations between
various agencies and planning authorities. Consultants are now modifying
the design of the yard for the new location, selected to reconcile urban
planning and railway marshalling objectives. About 80% of the loan has
been committed andit santicipated that the project will be virtually
completed by June, 1977. To provide for reimbursement of commissioning
expenses during the following year, however, the Closing Date -- formerly
December 31, 1975 -- has been extended to June 30, 1978.
Cr. No. 157 Agricultural Development Bank: US$30.0 Million Credit of
June 2Ylt~9 Effective Date:_September _ S 1969:        sing
Date: December 31, 1975
Although the Closing Date of this credit has passed, minor
disbursements are expected to continue into March, 1976, as the last
tractors ordered under the project are shipped. The Government has
requested a further credit for ADBP and discussions are taking place
concerning the measures necessary to remedy ADBP's financial and managerial
problems.
Cr. No. 177 Development Finance Company - IDBP: US$20.0 Million Credit
of Febrar1      1970; Effective Date:  June 25  190   Closing
Date: December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resume utilizing IDA fun.ds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its
liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The



ANNEX II
Page76
original Glosing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to'December 31,
1977. The Credit has been fully allocated by IDA. Progress has been achieved
on the Bangladesh liabilities issue. The major problem remaining is the
large arrears in IDBP's portfolio and its consequent effect on liquidity.
The liquidity problem has been temporarily eased with borrowings from the
Government but the long-term portfolio prospects will depend mainly on
developments in the textile sector which accounts for a large portion of
IDBP's outstandings. Disbursements amounted to 16.2 million as of
January 10, 1976.
Cr. No. 206 Engineering Education: US$4.0 Million Credit of June 29, 1970
Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing Date:   December 31, 1976
The project is now about 24 months behind schedule. The physical
facilities of the project are expected to be complete nine munths before
the Closing Date (December 1976), except for about 15% of the equipment
purchases, which are linked to the Technical Assistance program. This
program, if implemented, will require at least two years extension of
the Closing Date because of delayed recruitment of experts. Progress
in staff development is unsatisfactory, mainly because of low staff
salaries. Suggestions for improvement have been made to the Borrower
during the supervision visit. Project costs on civil works are expected
to exceed the appraisal estimates by 85% in rupee terms, but total project
costs are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3 million
due to the 1972 devaluation of the rupee. Disbursement remains slow but
is expected to improve in FY 76 with the completion of the physical
facilities.
Cr. No. 213 Power Transmission and Distribution: US$23.0 Million Credit
of August 13, 1970; Effective Date: December 11, 1970; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977
Implementation of the project, which had improved during the
past year, has suffered a further setback and the Closing Date has been
postponed for the second time, to June 30, 1977. The new delay is caused
by additional claims of Yugoslavian manufacturers on which negotiations
have now been completed. (See paras. 25 and 26).

Cr. No. 422-PAK  Third Karachi. Port:  US$18.0 Million Credit July 19, 1973:
Effective Date: DecembeEr 14, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The contracts for the construction of four berths and two transit
sheds at Juna Bunder and for the reconstruction of Napier Mole Bridge were
awarded in June and October 1975 respectively. Materials and specialized
equipment are on order and work on site is commencing. Materials for perm-
anent way and for water supply have also been ordered.   Some consultant
services covered by the Credit have been utilized to date.
Cr. No. 492-PAK Fourth Karachi Port: US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8) 1974;
Effective Date: September l, 1974, Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Bids for the oil berth have been evaluated and are presently under
more detailed review by Karachi Port Trust and its consultants.
Loan No. 961 Industrial Investment: US$25.0 Million Loan of January 31, 1974;
Effective Date: April 3, 19_74; Clo _B_Date: June_30   1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign currency
liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. Progress
has been made in solving that problem although some pending matters are still
under discussion with the Government. The other major problem is the large
arrears in FICIC's portfo-Lio and its consequent effect on liquidity. The
liquidity problem has been temporarily eased with borrowings from the Govern-
ment but the long-term portfolio prospects will depend mainly on developments
in the textile sector which accounts for a large portion of PICIC's outstandings.
Disbursements amounted to $8.0 million on January 10, 1976. A new loan is
under consideration.
Cr. No. 466  Flood Rehabilitation:   US$35.0 Million Credit of March 18, 1974;
Effectiv                      Closing Date: June30       1976
The general import;s and civil works categories of this credit have
been fully disbursed.   The original Closing Date of June 30, 1975 was post-
poned one year to permit completion of procurement of specialized spare parts
for the repair of construction and farm machinery.

Loan No. 988 Multan Fertilizer: US$35.0 Million Loan of may 24, 1974;
Effective Date: July 30   97; Closiniate: June 30, 1977
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. Work on major offsites
such as roads, railroad tracks and utilities is complete and plantconstruc-
tion is proceeding vigorously. Staff recruitment and training is increasing
steadily. The most likely potential problem appears to be the late delivery
of a few critical items such as boilers, which could delay startup by several
weeks. Performance of the existing calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer plant
continues to be hampered by breakdowns in the old ammonia plants, thus
adding to the need to complete the expansion project with minimum delay.
Cr. No. 510 Third Telecommunications: US$36.0 Million Credit of September 12,
1974; Effective Date: October 25, 197 ; Closing Date: December 31,
This credit is proceeding satisfactorily though still at an early
stage. Procurement action for all the main equipment items is well-advanced.
Reorganization of T&T to a form more suited to its commercial-typeOperation,
which was an agreement of the first Telecommunications Credit and reiterated
in the Credit Agreement of 510-PAK, has not progressed. A Government appointed
Committee was to have formulated by December 31, 15,75, the steps required
to achieve this reorganization.
Cr. No. 546 National Development Finance Corporatio (NDFC): US$30.C Million
Credit of May 15, 1975:  Effective Date:JXZy 17, 1975; Closing
Date: September 30, 1979
This credit was made effective on July 17,, 1975. No comnitments
had taken place as of January, 1976.
Loan No. 1107 Fourth Sui Northern Gas: uS$60.0 Million Loan of May 15, 1975;
Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closirig Date: December 31, 1975'
Engineering and procurement are on scheduLle, as in construction,
despite unusually heavy rains and floods during late summer. Progress on
the purification facilities is falling behind origiLnal plans. Two probleim
facing the Borrower are delivery delays due to congestion at the port of
Karachi and the loss of skilled craftsmen to the I'iddle East. The project
is expected to be completed on time and well within the estimated cost.
No action has been reported on the government's obligation to make a reservoir
study of the Meyal field by December 31, 1975 and the Bank has taken the
matter up with the Government.

Procurement Arrangements: All major items of materials and equipment financed
under the loan would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding, with domestic
manufacturers accorded a margin equal to 15 percent
of the CIF costs of competing imports or the import
duties for a non-exempt importer, whichever is lower.
Expenditures from September 1, 1975 up to about
$100,000 may be financed retroactively.
Technical Assistance:
(Consultants)            (a)  Design and supervision of construction of
transmission lines and installation of
switching station: To be appointed,
about 500 man-months.
(b) Accounting and Management Services: Tasir,
Hadi, Khalid & Co. (Pakistan) and Peat,
Marwick, Mitchell & Co. (U.K.): appointed,
about 92 man-months.
Rate of Return:            Not quantified.  The justification of the project
rests upon the benefits of interconnected systems,
e.g., pooling of generating plants, reduction in
reserve plant capacity, reduction in aggregate
demand by virtue of regional diversity, ability
to optimize the location of power plants and
flexibility in tapping load points.
