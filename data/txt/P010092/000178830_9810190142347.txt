PAKISTAN
Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)
Appraisal of the Second WAPDA Power Project
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project comprising a 500 kV
transmission line Lyallpur-Multan-Guddu (total length about 340 miles) with
a 220 kV switching station at Multan, construction tools and equipment for
the transformer repair bay at Lyallpur, engineering services including train-
ing of local engineers abroad for 500 kV operation, and accounting and manage-
ment consulting services. The total cost is estimated at US$113.8 million
equivalent including a foreign exchange component of US$50.0 million equiva-
lent. A Loan covering the foreign exchange cost is proposed, financing 44%
of the estimated total cost.
ii.       The proposed Project fntiu part of a comprehensive 500 kV trans-
mission system planned to event,ally create the backbone of a high voltage
grid connecting the hydro resources of the north with the thermal generation
in the center and south thus providing the most economic means of supplying
power throughout the country. Operation of the Project will be initially
at 220 kV to transport the excess energy of the Guddu plant to the Northern
area. Conversion to 500 kV will occur when either Tarbela units 9-12 or
a planned large nuclear plant is installed. Neither of these installations
can be expected to be in operation before the early 1980's; thus the large
investment required for 500 kV substations can be delayed.
iii.      The entire 500 kV system as planned represents the least cost
solution as compared to the alternative offered, i.e. separate development
of the northern, central and southern areas. Savings can not only be ex-
pected through lower reserve capacity (capital cost savings), but also through
lower fuel consumption (use of what otherwise would be excess hydro energy).
iv.       Procurement of the goods and services to be financed from the
proceeds of the proposed Loan will be on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Local preference in
bid evaluation will apply to purchases of equipment and material. Since
negotiations with the engineering consultants have not been concluded yet,
satisfactory contractual arrangements are a condition of Loan effectiveness.
v.        The unfavorable state of WAPDA's Power Wing accounts as well as
the disorganized management information system require a comprehensive
accounting consulting effort closely supervised by the Bank. WAPDA has
contracted local consultants supplemented by expatriate individuals for
certain skills the cost of which will be financed from funds of the Loan.
Bank concurrence was sought for all intended consulting activities.



- ii -
vi.       Over the past several years WAPDA's financial situation has been
progressively deteriorating, Contributing factors were low tariffs and
insufficient tariff adjustments, suppressed sales and revenues due to lack
of funds for financing adequate expansion, and high system losses. Given
the magnitude of the one step tariff increase (about 50%) required to reach
an acceptable level of self-generated funds, the proposed earnings covenant
ais at WAPDA's financial recovery through a combination of gradual tariff
increases permitting eventually at least a 30% internal contribution to
expansion, and capital contributions by the Government.
vii.      WAPDA's power development program is very large, physically as well
as organizationally and financially. However, it constitutes the minimum
requirement for the organized development of WAPDA's supply area and anything
short of the program would prolong the present unsatisfactory system con-
ditions. The program calls for investments of Rs 27,878 million (US$2,816
million equivalent) during the period 1975/76-81/82. The total investment
required during the Project construction period (1975/76-1979/80) is estimated
at US$1,765 equivalent. The total cost of the proposed Project (US$113.8
million) represents 6.5% of the investment requirements, the proposed Loan
(US$50 million) 2.8%.
viii.     The 1973 Constitution of Pakistan has made "electricity" a con-
current subject, i.e. the Central Parliament as well as any Provincial
Assembly have now the right to pass legislation on the matter. Consequently,
two of the four provinces (Punjab and Sind) have indicated their intention
to establish their own electricity supply corporations whereas the Baluchistan
and North-West Frontier provinces wish to continue receiving power service
trom WAPDA. Although it is not certain at present whether regional power
supply companies will in fact be established, appropriate covenants were
agreed on to safeguard WAPDA's financial and operational viability.
ix.       The proposed Loan will be made to the Government which in turn will
lend the equivalent funds to WAPDA with a 25 year term, including about 5
years of grace, and interest at the rate for Bank loans prevailing at the
time of Board presentation of this operation. The Government will be reim-
bursed for part of the interest charge from the "Interest Subsidy Fund" as
laid down in Resolution No. 75-111 for "Third Window" operations.

Appraisal of the Second WAPDA Power Project
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Pakistan has requested the Bank to help finance
a Project consisting mainly of the construction of two segments of the coun-
try's planned 500 kV transmission system which, together with the 500 kV line
Tarbela-Lyallpur, presently under construction with Canadian help, and the
500 kV line Guddu-Hyderabad, financed with assistance of the Kuwait Develop-
ment Fund, eventually will connect Tarbela in the north with Karachi in the
south. Specifically the Project will cover:
(a) 500 kV single circuit transmission lines;
(i) Lyallpur to Multan (136 miles); and
(ii) Multan to Guddu (200 miles);
(b) a 220 kV switching station at Multan;
(c) tools and equipment for construction of the lines and
the transformer repair bay at Lyallpur (Gatti sub-
station);
(d) engineering and construction supervision including
training of local engineers in 500 kV operation; and
(e) accounting and management consulting services.
The lines will be operated initially at 220 kV and converted to 500 kV by
1982. The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$113.8 million equiva-
lent, with a foreign exchange component of US$50.0 million equivalent which
will be covered by the proposed Loan. The Beneficiary will be WAPDA, a
quasi-autonomous entity charged through its Power Wing with the construction
and operation of power facilities.
1.02      The Loan is the second Bank Group operation concerning WAPDA's
Power Wing. The first Credit (213-PAK of August 14, 1970) was made to in-
crease the capacity of WAPDA's distribution network by constructing or extend-
ing a number of substations, adding about 1,000 MVA of power transformer
capacity, related equipment, and management and engineering consulting services.
1.03      Apart from the above Credit, the Bank Group has had a long-standing
involvement in water and power development in Pakistan, principally through



-2-
the Indus Basin Development program. There have been two Credits and two
Loans as contributions to consortium financing of multipurpose projects in the
WAPDA service area:  Credits 60-PAK (1964) for US$58.5 million and 581-PAK
(1975) for US$8 million, and Loans 266-PAK (1960) and 548-PAK (1968),
totalling US$115 million.
1.04      WAPDA's performance has been uneven in the past.  It has done a
remarkable job of Implementation as the executing agency for the Indus Basin
Development works. However, the performance of its Power Wing has been marked
by a number of shortcomings and the completion of the Credit 213-PAK project
was delayed by 2-1/2 years. It is expected, however, that the new manage-
ment together with the help of consultants will improve WAPDA's activities.
1.05      This report was prepared by Messrs. J.D. Carver and K. Stichenwirth
and is based on information collected during an appraisal mission to Pakistan
in March/April 1975.
II. THE POWER SECTOR
Economic Background
2.01      Pakistan covers an area of approximately 804,000 km   and has a
population of about 69 million (1974) growing at an annual rate of 3%.  The
1974 GNP per capita was US$129 at average 1972-74 prices and exchange rates.
After averaging more than 6% annual growth during the 1960's, GDP has been
growing at only around 3.1% per year between 1969/70 and 1974/75, with ag-
riculture at about 0.3Z and manufacturing at about 3.2%.  The slowdown was
a consequence of the political disturbances leading to the separation of
East Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh as well as the world wide eco-
nomic deterioration coupled with a series of setbacks to the country's econo-
my such as drought, higher than anticipated wheat imports, a deterioration of
about 20% in the terms of trade, and the mishap at the Tarbela dam during
the trial filling that will delay availability of irrigation water by about
one year.
2.02      Pakistan's Government has ambitious investment plans in developing
its manufacturing sector during the period 1975/76-1979/80, of which at least
two-thirds is expected to take place in large steel, fertilizer, petro-
chemical and cement plants. These investments together with projects in
rural electrification (in particular expansion of lift irrigation and salinity
control through electrified tubewells as well as village electrification)
require more reliable electricity supply than could be provided in the past.
This in turn necessitates the heavy investment program WAPDA is planning
(para 2.22). The present installed capacity amounts,to 35 watts per in-
habitant, and the per capita annual consumption is about 104 kWh. This,
for instance, compares to per capita indices of 30 watts and 97 kwh in India.
Less than 20% of the country's population have access to electricity.



-3-
Sector Organization
2.03      The Electricity Act of 1910 governs the sector and e.powe uj the
Government to issue licenses for the supply of electric power in various
areas of the country. The public power supply is primarily the responsibility
of WAPDA and the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, Ltd. (KESC). WAPDA,
serving the country with the exception of the Karachi area, accounts for about
75% of power supply, KESC for the remaining 25%. About 14% of WAPDA's
output is sold to various licensees which distribute within their area of
supply. The 125 MW Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), owned and operated
by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, sells its energy in bulk to KESC.
A number of private industries have their own small captive plant, mainly
for stand-by purposes, the installed capacity of which is estimated at about
230 MW.
2.04      Following the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan,
WAPDA was made responsible for implementing the Indus Basin Development
scheme (IBD) which consists of a series of multi-purpose installations with
a large power component - at thp >ment Mangla in operation (600 MW installed
plus another 200 MW under cons cuction) and Tarbela under construction (event-
ually 2,100 MW) - and a large number of irrigation canals and barrages in-
cluding tubewells for lift irrigation as well as salinity control (Salinity
Control and Reclamation Projects - SCARPs). In future the system will depend
heavily on the generating capacity of both Mangla and Tarbela. About 25%
of WAPDA's output is consumed by tubewells, about 64,000 of which (average
capacity 10 kW) were connected by the end of FY 1973/74.
2.05      The Government and WAPDA are trying to accelerate village electri-
fication. However, due to financial constraints as well as implementation
difficulties, achievement normally falls short of targets. Planning calls
for electrification of 1,000 villages per year. In FY 1973/74 only 580 vil-
lages were electrified and the FY 1974/75 actual is not expected to surpass
about 800 (actual data are presently not available).
Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, Ltd. (KESC)
2.06      This company, whose license covers the greater Karachi area, was
formed in 1913 as a privately-owned enterprise and continued as such until
1952 when the Government acquired controlling interest. Presently the
Government holds directly 42% of the shares, but together with the 28%
share of Government controlled banks and insurance companies, its influence
in effect represents 70%. The balance of the share capital is held by private
individuals.
2.07      KESC is well managed by experienced Pakistani officers.  In 1974
it had about 292,000 customers. Sales were 1,617 GWh representing an in-
crease of about 8% over the 1973 level. This is less than the sales increase
of about 16% experienced in 1973 which, however, followed KESC's worst year
with sales only 2% up. This was because KESC's sales, primarily restricted
to the industrial city of Karachi, were particularly sensitive to the crisis



situation in 1972. Its earnings position is satisfactory with a rate of
return of about 8% in 1974.
2.08      KESC's present installed capacity amounts to 383 MW; in addition
it purchases the output of the 125 MW KANUPP nuclear station. With the
exception of 20 MW of diesel units, all its generating plant is steam.
The 1973 Constitution
2.09      Following in part the recommendations of a committee headed by a
prominent retired civil servant, Mr. G. Ahmad, the 1973 Constitution of
Pakistan has designated "electricity" a "concurrent subject" (electricity
generated from nuclear sources is excluded). The Central Parliament and any
Provincial Assembly now have the right to pass legislation on the subject.
It permits provinces to construct or take over power houses, grid substations,
transmission lines and distribution systems within their areas.
2.10      In exercising this right, two of the four provinces (Punjab and
Sind) have indicated their intention to take over from WAPDA certain distri-
bution and subtransmission assets within their boundaries and to establish
their own electricity supply organizations. While Punjab has shown particular
interest in this matter in the past (three committees - technical, financial
and administrative - have tried to work out the modalities of the transfer),
Sind has indicated that it would prefer a more cautious approach, carefully
evaluating all the aspects of the separation of activities before making a
firm decision. The North-West Frontier province and the province of Baluchistan
wish to continue receiving power service from WAPDA.
2.11      At the time of the appraisal, discussions regarding separation of
distribution activities were at a peak in Punjab, however they have subsided
considerably since. At the moment attention focuses on the establishment
of regional "Area Boards" within WAPDA. It is expected that these boards
will deal directly with power related problems in the provinces without
having to refer to headquarters.
2.12      Although the opinion on whether separation of any activity will
occur at all varies widely within the Government and WAPDA, it must be con-
sidered a possibility. In view of WAPDA's size and complexity, it should
be acceptable to the Bank as long as WAPDA is able to continue as a viable
entity and to live up to the financial conditions outlined in Chapter VI.
Consequently agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government
and WAPDA will notify the Bank of any intention to initiate legislation
or action which would change the structure of the power sector. Such noti-
fication will be made sufficiently in advance to allow an exchange of views
with the Bank regarding their effect on WAPDA's power wing.
WAPDA's Existing Power Facilities
2.13      By the end of FY 1974/75 WAPDA's installed capacity amounted to
1,935 MW.  It consisted of 45% hydro, 37% steam and 18% gas turbine capacity.



- 5 -
The installations are concentrated in the north (hydro) and center (thermal)
of the country. The transmission system consisted of about 340 miles of
220 kV lines, 2,100 miles of 132 kV lines and 3,100 miles of 66 kV lines.
Distribution is effected through a network of 11 kV lines. The aggregate
grid substation transformer capacity amounted to about 2,700 MVA.
WAPDA's Market
2.14      Over the past decade, WAPDA's generation and sales developed as
follows:

From 1965/66 through 1969/70, when WAPDA's investments were still capable
of keeping abreast of demand growth, sales increased annually by about 15%-23%
(except 1966/67 with only 0.5% increase due to an excessively low water year).
Since 1970/71 growth rates have dropped to 2%-11% per year, indicating not
only the effects of political unrest and severe drought, but also WAPDA's
and the Government's increasing inability to raise the funds required for an
investment program in step with the potential power demand. This resulted in
blackouts and load shedding as well as inability to connect new customers
at the required rate.
2.15      Transmission and distribution losses (including theft) of the WAPDA
system are high (para. 2.14). WAPDA's own estimate of theft, which includes
tampering with meters and unauthorized connections, amounts to approximately
5%, the remainder of the losses results from inadequate capital expenditures
in transmission, grid substations and distribution during the last several
years. Until additional transmission and grid substations are completed -
they will increase the number and decrease the length of distribution
circuits - it is not expected that any large improvement In system losses
will occur. As an immediate remedy WAPDA has started connecting the distrib-
ution capacitors that have been installed for some years and is investigating
the purchase and installation of low voltage capacitors for tubewells. They
have also earmarked a specific construction budget item for distribution
system improvements.

2.16      By end 1973/74 WAPDA served about 1.6 million consumers grouped
into the following categories and areas (for details see Annex 1):

Above table indicates the high proportion of sales at low agricultural
tariffs and the relative importance of industrial sales. It also shows
that about 85% of WAPDA's market would be affected by a separation of the
Punjab and Sind provinces.
Load Forecasts
2.17      Load forecasting in WAPDA is the responsibility of the Power Market
Survey Division, a separate organization within WAPDA. Its methodology is
based on the actual survey of prospective customers and collection of all
relevant data on proposed agriculture and industrial development from the
public and private sectors. Diversity factors are then applied to arrive at
the resultant demand. Because the latest survey report was published in
June 1972 and, according to the mission's information, has not been updated
since, the WAPDA forecasts have not been used in this report.
2.18      In trying to get an appreciation of the country's future market
requirements, the mission relied on a modified load forecast prepared by the
firm of R.HV Consultants as part of a system planning study carried out for the
Bank (Gtra. 5.02). Their report uses the aggregate approach method which
assumes that for each country its future energy consumption is a function of
its present and past utilization per capita and that its rate of growth will
diminish with market saturation sooner or later than for other countries



- 7 -
according to the way its popula Ion varies. The energy consump, .on derived
is corrected for unusual incremental load additions. The demand is then
derived from the energy consumption by applying appropriate load factors.
2.19      The load forecast used in this report is that prepared by EHV
Consultants, modified by adding the pumping loads considered interruptible
by EHV. This addition was made because of WAPDA's objection to considering
these loads interruptible for planning future generation. This increment
represents approximately 194 MW in 1975 increasing to 345 MW in 1985. The
rate of growth of this forecast varies from 12% in the early years to 9.5%
in.L;he later years. For details of the load forecast stating March and
September peak demands in megawatts refer to Annex 3.
Development Program
2.20      The sector expansion program for power generation between 1975/76
and 1984/85 (Annex 2) used in this report follows essentially the present
plans of WAPDA and KESC. It is baspd on the same development pattern as
previous studies. However, to M'low for physical and financial constraints,
postponements in the implementaLion schedule of various projects, in parti-
cular the nuclear and the coal fired units, have been assumed. The program
calls for the earliest possible development of the hydro potential at Tarbela
(2,100 MW) and the remaining units at Mangla (200 MW) and Warsak (80 MW) for
a total of 2,380 MW. The thermal expansion includes 500 MW of gas turbines,
1,275 MW of steam turbines and 1,200 MW of nuclear. The total new installa-
tions are estimated to be 5,355 MW which compares to an installed capacity
of 2,448 MW on June 30, 1975 and 7,803 MW on June 30, 1985, more than three
times the present capacity. However, the March capability (lowest hydro
capability during the year) will only be increased from the present 1,999 MW
to 6,247 MW, an increase of 4,248 MW (Annex 3).
2.21      WAPDA will be in charge of about 60% of the development program as
outlined above (3,230 MW) with sole responsibility for the investments in
hydro projects. In addition it will have to undertake a large transmission
and distribution construction program, of which the 500 kV transmission system
(this includes the Project) forms part. The schedule for completion of the
500 kV system is estimated as follows:
(i) Tarbela - Lyallpur
- First Circuit 1977
- Second Circuit 1979
(ii)  Lyallpur - Karachi                     1981/82
(iii)  Nuclear Interconnection                1983/84
An operating voltage of 500 kV is required because of the distances involved -
840 miles from Tarbela to Karachi - and the magnitude of the power inter-
changes between areas. The high voltage system will transmit the excess



- 8 -
energy south during the high water season (July, August, September) and the
thermal energy north during the dry season (March, April, May) to provide a
more balanced system than exists now.
2.22      The cost of WAPDA's investment program during the Project
construction period is estimated as follows (Annex 4):

The program, of which financing for about 15% of the foreign exchange cost
is secured, does not comprise all of WAPDA's power sector investments since
the common cost of multi-purpose facilities is not allocated to power, leaving
out a sizeable amount of power-related investments. The investments as
planned constitute the minimum requirement for the organized development
of WAPDA's supply area and anything short of above program would prolong the
present conditions of overloaded distribution and transmission (high system
losses), suppressed demand and frequent blackouts. However, carrying out the
program will place heavy demands on the organization and capability of
WAPDA. This re-inforces the need for the technical assistance provided
under the proposed project.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
WAPDA's Corporate Existence
3.01      WAPDA was created in 1958 by Government Act No. 31 (Annex 5).
Its responsibility is the coordinated development of the country's water
and power resources. Although a quasi-autonomous entity, it acts in many
respects as a Government agent carrying out various design and construction
tasks for the central as well as local governments. In particular, it is
responsible for preparing schemes for:
(i)  irrigation, water supply and drainage;
(ii)  generation, transmission and distribution
of electric power including construction, main-
tenance and operation of power houses and grids;
(iii) flood control;
(iv)  prevention of waterlogging and reclamation of
waterlogged and saline land;
(v) inland navigation; and
(vi)  prevention of damage to the ecology.
3.02      WAPDA's supervisory agency is the Ministry of Fuel, Power and
Natural Resources which, in cooperation with other public bodies, keeps
tight control over WAPDA's activities. Particular fields of Government
involvements are tariffs (para 6.15), approval of the investment budget
(central and regional governments, depending on source of funds), and
borrowing.
Organization
3.03      WAPDA's management, the "Authority", consists of a Chairman and not
more than three Members responsible for power, water and finances (Annex 6).
All Authority members are appointed by the Government; the Chairman for five
years and the Members for three years. They may be re-appointed.



- 10 -
3.04      The Authority has a double function:  it is on the one hand the top
management of WAPDA, on the other hand should participate in policy-making
decisions. Day-to-day management matters, however, prevent the Chairman and
the Members from meaningful participation in policy aspects. Consequently,
the responsibility for policy matters rests almost exclusively with the
Government authorities.
3.05      WAPDA is subdivided into the following groups, called "Wings":
(a)  Power Wing:  Responsible for construction and operation
of power generation, transmission and distribution
facilities throughout the country with the exception of
the areas served by KESC and various small licensees which
buy in bulk from WAPDA and distribute.
(b)  Water Wing:  Responsible for all matters concerning
irrigation, water supply and flood control.
The Water Wing includes a sub-group charged with the execution of
the huge Indus Basin Development Scheme (IBD). Until recently WAPDA also
operated the Machinery Pool Organization (MPO), a construction equipment
pool, now separated and functioning as an independent company called
"Mechanized Construction of Pakistan, Ltd."
3.06      The Power Wing has been conceived as a revenue earning public
utility, the Water Wing as an agency charged with the construction of
projects on behalf of the Central or Provincial Governments which provide
financing entirely through their respective budgets. Upon completion, the
projects are transferred for operation to federal or regional bodies or,
as in the case of the Mangla multi-purpose facility, to the Power Wing.
Management
3.07      WAPDA's complex organization structure and disorganized accounting
and management system have been the subject of studies and recommendations,
such as the "Lieftink Report 1969 (actually finished in July 1967), the
"Report of the Indus Basin Review Mission 1969" (C. Willoughby and T. Berrie
- May 1969), the "Study for WAPDA's Need for Future Consulting Services
1969" (U.S. AID-financed team headed by K. Holum - June 1969), and "An
Enquiry into the Organization of the Water and Power Development Authority
of West Pakistan" (Lord Hinton - November 1969). All of these studies
recommended the introduction of systems to streamline management and
accounting, and to provide effective management information flows. Credit
213-PAK also included the requirement for management improvement consulting
services.
3.08      Until recently no serious attempts have been made by the Government
or WAPDA to correct the situation. This is largely the result of the political
situation in the country and the frequent changes in top management. In
addition, the large number of qualified personnel in headquarters in relation
to the limited number of available jobs frequently created dissatisfaction.



- 11 -
Accounting and lanagement Info, nation
3.09      WAPDA keeps separate accounts for the following major groups:
(i) The Power Wing: The accounting consists of a conglomerate
of single and double entry procedures, based on accrual as
well as cash concepts. This is understandable from a
historic point of view since the Power Wing acquired the
Government accounting procedures practically unchanged.
(ii) The Water Wing, based on more modern accounting standards.
(iii) The Indus Basin Development - within the Water Wing - on
behalf of the Government.
3.10      UJnder Credit 213-PAK, WAPDA undertook to develop and implement
for the Power Wing an effective accounting system which would supply the
management with information neceEsary for planning its operations, services
and future investment needs. FH.wever, almost nothing has so far been
achieved.
3.11      The accounting systems and procedures as presently used have a
number of peculiarities which considerably slow the recording process.  The
important ones are:
(i) the Chief Accountant WAPDA, at the same time Chief
Accountant Water, is responsible to the Member Finance.
Apart from the water accounts, his department is in
charge of keeping the construction and project accounts
for new power stations and grid systems (500 KV through
66 KV lines including grid substations). At the end of
the fiscal year, the balance of these accounts is passed
on to the Chief Accountant Power for incorporation in the
balance sheet of the Power Wing;
(ii) the Chief Accountant Power reports to the Member Power.
His duties are:
(a)  construction accounts for distribution from
11 kV down;
(b)  minor construction in completed generation and
transmission projects;
(c)  revenue and cost accounts Power Wing; and
(d)  finalization of the Power Wing balance sheet after
incorporation of power assets transferred from
"Chief Accountant WAPDA;"



- 12 -
(iii) in the case of multi-purpose projects, the power component
is transferred to the "Power Wing" upon completion. Basic-
ally, it is WAPDA's practice to transfer components clearly
associated with electric power (turbines, generators,
switchyard); no attempt has so far been made to allocate
common costs; and
(iv) transfer of the power component of multi-purpose projects
is often done according to the source of finance rather
than the technical significance. For instance, the portion
of the Tarbela powerhouse associated with Units 1-4 is
being financed from funds for the dam; consequently, only
the cost of the power equipment is included in the assets
of the Power Wing. ADB, however, recently committed funds
for financing Units 5 and 6 and the powerhouse extension
for Units 5-8. Since these assets are being financed by
a power loan, equipment and powerhouse extension will be
included in the Power Wing assets. Years after their
completion, the assets of the Warsak and Mangla stations
are still recorded at preliminary values.
Furthermore, proper asset revaluation is not permitted (the foreign
exchange component was revalued to the extent of the devaluation of
the Pakistan Rupee in 1972 for outstanding foreign borrowings). This
is because Government assets must be recorded at cost and WAPDA is
considered a Government department for this purpose. It also appears
that part of the asset accounting information never reaches the respon-
sible accounting unit.
3.12      In discussions with the mission, WAPDA and Government officials
acknowledged that improvement in accounting matters of the Power Wing is
urgently required. Accordingly WAPDA has hired the local firm of Taseer, Hadi,
Khalid and Co. as accounting consultants who have commenced the assignment
in cooperation with Peat, Marwick and Mitchell of the United Kingdom under
a contractual arrangement agreed to by the Bank Group.
3.13      The consulting activities, details of which are shown in Annex 7,
will be carried out in two phases. During Phase I the consultants will review
the present status of WAPDA's accounting systems, make proposals on improve-
ments, where required, and design the necessary accounts, manuals and forms.
Phase II will be concerned with the implementation of the systems established
during Phase I. The following main activities are planned:
(i)  review of WAPDA's present organizational structure and
recommendations on its reorganization particularly with
regard to the establishment of Area Boards within WAPDA;
(ii) design of accounting systems;
(iii) evaluation of the existing budgeting and budget control
systems (investment and operation) and recommendation
on their improvement;



- 13 -
(iv) design of an efficient management information system; and
(v) training of WAPDA personnel in the application of the new
systems.
3.14      Maximum involvement of WAPDA employees in the consulting effort is
envisaged. This has the advantage of familiarizing as many persons as
possible with the procedures and systems thereby reducing training and imple-
mentation time, and of shortening the time for data collection. The assign-
ment is estimated to require 92 man-months and to take about 20 months to
complete. About 46 man-months, at an estimated cost of US$300,000 equivalent,
will be required for expatriate personnel. Financing of this expense is
included in the proposed Loan. Since part of these expenses will occur
before Loan signing, retroactive financing is proposed for up to US$100,000.
Personnel
3.15      WAPDA is one of the largest employers in Pakistan.  It has about
61,000 permanent employees and with the contractors and temporary labor it
usually hires, the labor force utilized can amount to 75,000. About 60%
(45,000) are employed in the Power Wing. Although its activities cover all
aspects of power generation, transmission and distribution, and the area
served is large, the number of employees is high. Reductions, however, are
unlikely because of the Government's employment oriented policy.
IV. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
4.01      The proposed Project comprises:
(a) construction of a 500 kV single circuit transmission
line Lyallpur to Multan (136 miles);
(b) construction of a 500 kV single circuit transmission
line Multan to Guddu (200 miles);
(c) installation of a 220 kV switching station at Multan;
(d) tools and equipment for construction of the lines and
to equip the transformer repair bay at Lyallpur (Gatti
Substation);
(e) engineering and supervision including training of
Pakistani engineers in 500 kV system operation; and
(f) accounting and management consulting services.



- 14 -
4.02      The transmission lines will be operated temporarily at 220 kV
with conversion to 500 kV operation not later than mid-1982. The line Multan
to Guddu, to be completed by December 1977, will transmit the excess thermal
energy generated by the 430 MW Guddu plant in the central area to the load
centers in the northern area during the low water season of the hydro plants.
The line Lyallpur to Multan, to be completed by 1979/80, will reinforce the
existing 220 kV double circuit line and enable the transmission of additional
hydro energy to the load centers of Multan and the central area during the
high water season of the hydro plants.
4.03      The 220 kV switching station is required for the interconnection
at Multan and will later become the low tension side of the future 500 kV
substation. Terminal facilities for the interconnection at Lyallpur and
Guddu are being provided under projects presently under construction by WAPDA.
4.04      The Project forms part of a comprehensive 500 kV transmission
system planned to form the backbone of a high voltage grid connecting the
hydro resources of the north with the thermal generation in the central and
southern areas thus providing the most economic means of supplying power
throughout the country. The first section of the system, the line Tarbela-
Lyallpur, is presently under construction with the help of a Canadian In-
ternational Development Agency (CIDA) credit of about US$40 million. With
the installation of Tarbela units 5 to 8 a second Tarbela-Lyallpur line in-
cluding substations will be required and will take 2 years to complete.
Operation of both lines will be at 500 kV from the beginning. The sections
Lyallpur-Multan-Guddu (the Project) and Guddu-Hyderabad-Karachi (financing
of the foreign exchange cost secured through a US$44 million loan from the
Kuwait Development Fund) will initially be operated at 220 kV with conver-
sion to 500 kV bv 1982.
4.05      The section Lyallpur-Multan-Guddu included in the Project will be
constructed with single circuit towers and bundled conductors similar to
those being used on the first Tarbela-Lyallpur line. The route will follow
the right of way surveyed some years ago with slight modifications to enter
the substations. It is WAPDA's practice to purchase the land for tower
footings and secure an easement between towers. No delays due to rights of
way are expected. The only major problem will be the Indus river crossing
where caissons will have to be placed in the river bed to support the towers.
The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1979. The imple-
mentation schedule is attached in Annex 8.

/a   Local costs include duties and taxes on foreign materials of 32% (141.4
million rupees).
4.07      The basic prices were determined from the Tarbela-Lyallpur line
(214 miles) being constructed 1975/76 and materials purchased in 1974. A
physical contingency of 10% has been included to allow for unforeseen
events. Price contingencies of 15% per year on local costs and 12%-10%-8%
per year on foreign costs have been included in the estimate to cover
expected price increases during the construction period. The overall price
contingencies amount to 32% of the basic cost of the project including
physical contingencies.
Amount of the Loan
4.08      The proposed Loan (US$50 million equivalent) covers the foreign
exchange cost of the Project (44% of the total cost) consisting of:



- 16 -
(i) material and equipment;
(ii) engineering consulting services including training abroad
of Pakistani engineers for 500 kV operation; and
(iii)  accounting and management consulting services (para. 3.13).
Financing of construction contracts is not proposed.
Engineering and Construction
4.09      Consultants qualified in 500 kV transmission design in association
with a local firm will assist WAPDA in design, preparation of bid documents,
award of contracts and supervision of construction. It is estimated that
500 man months of field and head office time will be required by the foreign
consultant. Contract negotiations between WAPDA, the local firm of National
Engineering Services of Pakistan (NESPAK) and Harza Engineering Company
(United States) are underway. The arrangement is subject to Bank approval
and it was agreed during negotiations that the Loan would become effective
only after conclusion of satisfactory contractual arrangements with the
consultants.
4.10      There exist competent local contracting firms for construction of
the line, two of which are now engaged in the construction of the Tarbela-
Lyallpur line. These firms should be in a competitive position and will
likely win awards for the construction of the Lyallpur-Multan-Guddu trans-
mission line, the construction period being immediately following that of
the Tarbela-Lyallpur line. The contract(s) for this work will be handled and
financed by WAPDA. Since no Bank Group financing is proposed for this
purpose, the question of domestic preference for the local contracting indus-
try does not arise.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      All major items of material for the transmission line, substation
equipment, tools and equipment for construction of the line, and tools and
equipment for the transformer repair bay, except those costing less than
US$50,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of US$500,000, will be procured by
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Guidelines.
Some participation by Pakistani manufacturers is envisaged in which case a
15% preference on the c.i.f. price, or the prevailing duties, if lower, will
be applicable. However, it is doubted that Pakistani manufacturers will be
able to compete as the quantities involved are beyond the capacity of the
local manufacturers when considering the normal requirement of the country.
Disbursements from the proposed Bank Loan would cover:
(i) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of all imported material
and equipment or 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally
manufactured material and equipment;



- 17 -
(ii) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the consultants; and
(iii) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of overseas training.
The disbursement schedule is attached as Annex 9.
Ecology
4.12      No ecological problems are expected.  Conductor sizes and spacing
will be designed to keep corona losses and radio interference within accept-
able limits. Since one 500 kV line is equivalent to approximately five
220 kV lines, the amount of right of way is greatly reduced and the appear-
ance improved.
V. JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The Project forms part of a 500 kV transmission system to inter-
connect the system between the Tarbela project in the north and the port
and industrial city of Karachi in the south. The first of two 500 kV circuits
between Tarbela and Lyallpur is presently under construction. On completion
of the 500 kV system the large hydro facilities in the north would be fully
interconnected with the major natural gas-fired thermal facilities, situated
adjacent to the Sui gas fields in the Upper Sind area, and with other thermal
plant at the various major load centers, such as Lyallpur, Multan and
Karachi.
5.02      In early 1972 a "System Planning Study of the Pakistan Network"
was undertaken for the Bank by Meta Systems Inc. assisted by EHV Consultants
of Montreal. The basic conclusions of that study were that the installation
of all 12 units at Tarbela (2,100 MW) should be undertaken as quickly as pos-
sible and completed by 1983; the installation of Units 7 and 8 (200 MW) at
Mangla should be completed by 1978; gas turbines (200 MW) should be installed
at Multan by 1976; thereafter with the exception of the Karachi-Hyderabad
area, thermal capacity should be concentrated near the gas fields of the
Upper Sind. The plan concluded that all major markets and centers of gene-
ration should be integrated by a 500 kV transmission system, extending from
Tarbela to Lyallpur in 1977, and to Karachi-Hyderabad by 1981. M4any alter-
native development plans were analyzed in developing this basic scheme. With
a few minor variations, principally in timing, WAPDA is following these
recommendations. The cost of generating plant, transmission lines and sub-
station equipment has increased considerably since 1972 but the general
conclusions of the study hold good today.
5.03      Interconnection of the overall system by means of a 500 kV link
from Tarbela to Karachi-Hyderabad will result in significant savings in
fuel costs by the use of hydro capacity during the wet season. Further,
the reduction of hydro capacity in the critical period of March-April-May
as a result of low reservoir levels is compensated for by the thermal



- 18 -
capacity available in the Upper Sind area. More important, however, is a
significant saving in generating capacity requirements due to (i) seasonal
diversity in peak demands between the Northern, Central and Southern
Regions, and (ii) pooling of reserves. If these three regions are operated
in isolation, the total required reserve capacity for the Pakistan System
(basically represented by the largest generating unit in each region)
would be of the order of 1,410 MW by 1985. With adequate regional
interconnection, as proposed, the reserve requirement falls to 600 MW.
Further, due to seasonal demand diversity between regions, the coincident
peak demand for the Pakistan System in 1985 is 340 MW less than it would be
for the three major regions operating in isolation. Based on these two
factors alone, at present-day costs of generating plant, the equivalent
reduction of 1,150 MW of generating capacity by 1985 represents a saving
of an order of magnitude of $460 million. The cost of the transmission
line interconnecting Lyallpur and Karachi at 500 kV, complete with all
necessary substation equipment, has been estimated at US$335 million. This
would be US$234 million based on present day-cost - about half the cost,
at present day-prices, of the savings in equivalent generation investment
referred to above--which makes this transmission line the least cost long-
term solution at any interest rate.
5.04      During the course of their study META Systems Inc. devoted con-
siderable effort to the choices between 500 kV and 220 kV transmission
systems and concluded that interconnection at 500 kV was clearly prefer-
able. This conclusion was based on the system configuration expected
in the early 1980's. The Project which will interconnect Lyallpur with
Multan and Guddu (336 miles) forms only a part of this ultimate north-
south interconnection and, given system conditions which will exist at
the time the Project is expected to be commissioned (1979) could be
satisfactorily operated at 220 kV, thus postponing substantial capital in-
vestment in 500 kV substation terminal equipment. Building the Project for
ultimate 500 kV operation but operating initially at 220 kV is estimated
to cost $113 million or about $81 million at present day-costs. With this
limited interconnection between the Northern and Central Regions a reduction
in reserve capacity requirements of 175 MW and of 30 MW due to diversity
between the maximum demands of the two regions would be realized. These
reductions would represent investment savings in generating capacity of
about US$82 million. To these capital cost savings should be added the
annual savings in operating costs which would accrue from the greater use
of hydro generation at Tarbela and Mangla, and the displacement of oil
and higher cost gas fired generation at Multan and Lyallpur by cheaper gas
fired generation in the more efficient Guddu thermal station.
5.05      The alternatives to the transmission line Lyallpur-Multan-Guddu
for s   lying the deficits of the Northern area are as follows:
(i) installation of a 200 MW steam plant at Multan with
furnace oil or Bunker C as fuel as additional natural
gas is not available due to gas pipe line limitations;



- 19 -
(ii)  installation of an additional 200 MW of gas turbine in
the northern area using diesel as fuel due to gas pipe
line limitations;
(iii)  installation of either the steam plant or the gas
turbines and construction of an additional gas pipe
line from Guddu to the site of either of these
installations.
These alternatives can be eliminated as either (i) and (iii) would cost more
than the proposed transmission line and (ii) would require high cost diesel
as fuel which has a higher priority use for transportation. The transmission
line leads to the least cost development of the power sector in Pakistan.
5.06      Given the complexities of the operation of the entire system it
is difficult to quantify the benefits attributable to the Project and,
therefore, to calculate its internal economic return. The justification
of the complete 500 kV transmission scheme and therefore of the Project
rests upon the unquantifiable benefits brought about by interconnected
systems, e.g. pooling of generating plants of different operating character-
istics, reduction in the total reserve plant capacity required for a reason-
able standard of service, a reduction in the aggregate demands of the regions
by virtue of diversity, ability to locate power stations at optimum sites
and of optimum characteristics to take advantage of economies of scale, and
flexibility to allow the best positioning of tapping of load points.
VI.  FINANCIAL ASPECTS
General
6.01      Since the proceeds of the proposed Loan would be entirely al-
located to power development, the information in this section applies only
to WAPDA's Power Wing unless otherwise stated. The financial statements
and projections have been derived from WAPDA's Power Wing accounts. As
mentioned in Chapter III, these are not as reliable as they should be, given
the period of time WAPDA has been in existence, the past focus on these
very inadequacies and the attempts made to correct them. They nevertheless
provide an acceptable basis for judging future financial trends. Further-
more it has been assumed that WAPDA will retain its present responsibilities,
and separation of certain activites as permitted under the 1973 Constitution
(paras. 2.09-2.12) will not occur.
Past and Present Financial Situation
6.02      The documents of Credit 213-PAK require that WAPDA's revenues be
sufficient to earn a rate of return of at least 8% per year. As a general
understanding (Side Letter No. 2 dated August 13, 1970) WAPDA undertook in
addition to work towards the following goals:



- 20 -
(a) a rate of return of at least 10%;
(b) a contribution to future capital expenditures of at least
30% from net internal cash generation; and
(c) a limit on money borrowed so that gross internal cash
generation shall be not less than 1.5 times the maximum
future debt service for any succeeding fiscal year.
6.03      WAPDA did not reach these targets for the following reasons:
(a) low tariffs and insufficient tariff adjustments (in
addition to the latest tariff increase - see paragraph 6.11
another adjustment of about 20% would be required to achieve
a return of 8%);
(b) lack of funds for financing adequate expansion resulted in
rationing and demand suppression and consequently lower than
normal sales and revenues; and
(c) high system losses (para. 2.14).
In addition, the low earnings required excessive borrowing. These increased
the debt service requirements considerably and worsened the debt/equity
ratio to a level of about 80/20 in 1974/75.
6.04     ,WAPDA's financial situation as developed over the past several
years can be summarized as follows (for details see Annex 10):

- 21 -
Above table indicates a progressively deteriorating picture. Up to about
FY 1972/73 WAPDA has managed to maintain rates of return of around 6% and
net internal cash generation of about 20% of annual capital expenditures.
From mid-FY 1973/74 heavy fuel cost increases and the failure to introduce
compensating tariff adjustments, brough WAPDA to a critical financial position
in FY 1974/75 with a rate of return of barely 2%. As an emergency measure,
WAPDA's Power Wing had to "borrow" from the Water Wing (in effect Government
funds provided for irrigation projects) the cash for debt service payments
falling due, and additional borrowing had to be arranged with the Government.
The 13.3% tariff increase effective June 7, 1975 (para. 6.11) eased the
situation only marginally.
Earnings Covenant
6.05      It is clear that, particularly in the light of WAPDA's heavy
capital expansion program (para. 2.22), a well balanced financial situation
must be restored. Given the magnitude of the one-step tariff increase
(about 50%) required to reach an acceptable level of self-generated funds,
which in the light of the Government's past reluctance to raise rates as
and when required would be unlikely to materialize, the proposed earnings
covenant aims at gradually increasing tariffs. In addition the Government
undertook to make capital contributions during the early years when WAPDA
will be unable to finance internally the required percentage of annual power
investments. Consequently the following was agreed:
(a) tariffs will be increased step by step during the period
FY 1976/77 - 1979/80 to permit financing on average 30%
of the power investments (including those undertaken by the Water
Wing and later transferred to the Power Wing) through net
internal cash generation in every consecutive three-year
period. This level should be reached during the period
1977/78 - 1979/80 at the latest. The performance test would
be made on the basis of historic three-year periods, for
the first time in 1979/80 for the 1977/78 - 1979/80 period,
and annually thereafter for the respective past three years
(the detailed calculation can be seen in Annex 10, page 4);
(b) the first increase will be at least 20% effective not later
than March 31, 1977;
(c) to strengthen WAPDA's capital base, the Government will, in
any given year until FY 1979/80, make dividend and interest
free capital contributions equivalent to the shortfall between
the net internal cash generation actually earned and that
equivalent to 30% of annual investments; and



- 22 -
(d)  up to and including FY 1979/80 WAPDA will seek
annually, not later than one month before the
end of each current fiscal year, Bank Group
concurrence for its financing plan of the follow-
ing fiscal year.
6.06      The proposed earnings covenant addresses itself directly to the
need for financing a very heavy investment program by judging the adequacy
of WAPDA's revenues against required investments. It also avoids probable
controversies with the Government over the question of asset revaluation
(para. 3.11) which would be a prerequisite for a meaningful rate of return
covenant. The projected rates of return on assets based on above cash contrib-
ution vary between 9% and 10%, with 3.5% in 1975/76 and 5.1% in 1976/77 when
the covenant is only partially operative (para. 6.09 and Annex 10, page 1).
Financial Forecasts
6.07      Following is a summary of WAPDA's financial projections for the
Project construction period (for details see Annex 10) based on the proposed
earnings covenant. In addition to the stipulated tariff increase of 20%
(para. 6.05 (b)) additional tariff adjustments of 25% effective January 1,
1978 and 10% effective January 1, 1980 have been assumed. It must be re-
alized, of course, that other combinations between tariff actions and equity
inputs are possible.

6.08      During the Project construction period net internal cash generation
is expected to finance about 20% of the investment program of which the
Project represents 6.5%. The lower than stipulated percentage is due to the
fact that the earnings covenant is not fully effective before the period
1977/78 through 1979/80. The proposed Bank loan will cover about 9% of
the expected foreign component of all investments and about 44% of the
Project cost. WAPDA's gross fixed assets are estimated to increase by about
200% during FY 1975/76 through 1979/80. Despite the improving overall fi-
nancial situation and assuming that all foreign loans can be secured, the
heavy investment program still requires raising of local funds of the order
of 880 million dollars equivalent. These will have to be provided from the
Government budget due to the limitations of the domestic capital market.
This is a formidable amount but, judging from past experience (in particular
Tarbela), feasible.
6.09      For illustration purposes following is a summary of the projected
financial results based on the above-described earnings covenant (for details

Tariffs
6.10      WAPDA's Act states that electricity tariffs should be set to meet
"operating costs, interest charges and depreciating of assets, the redemption
at due time of loans other than those covered by depreciation, the payment of
any taxes and a reasonable return on investment." The Government has never
specified what constitutes a "reasonable return" and, although it agreed to
the 8% return stipulated in the 213-PAK documents, never granted tariff
adjustments sufficient for WAPDA to reach this return.
6.11      WAPDA's present tariff schedule together with the fuel clause and
the local duties levied on power consumption are attached as Annex 11. Over
the past several years the following tariff adjustments were made:



- 25 -
(a)  mid-1971        ;   overall increase of about 10%;
(b)  July 1, 1973   :    10% increase on public lighting and bulk
supply, and 20% on industrial and commercial
consumption. Overall increase 12.8%;
(c)  July 1, 1974   :    10% increase except for domestic consumers.
Overall increase 8.9%;
(d)  February 1, 1975:   Overall increase 15%; and
(e)  June 7, 1975   :    15% increase except for domestic.
Overall increase 13.3%.
6.12      The above indicates the cautious approach the Government takes in
granting tariff increases for WAPDA (much higher adjustments had been applied
for, the most recent one was 35%). In addition, it eliminated residential
and tubewell customers from part of the increases, distorting WAPDA's tariffs
to a point where residential and tubewells are paying less than cost while
commercial and industrial customers are paying somewhere near cost. Conse-
quently an overall tariff study is not required. The subject has been
discussed during negotiations and will be followed up during supervision in
the context of future tariff adjustments.
6.13      Effective November 3, 1975, the Government permitted WAPDA to
include a fuel adjustment clause in its tariff. Although not as important
as an overall rate adjustment, it will provide protection from the adverse
effects of further increases in the price of gas and oil. During negotia-
tions agreement was reached that WAPDA keep a fuel clause adjustment in
effect.
6.14      The Power Load Control Study of WAPDA issued by Boggis and
Westfield on August 11, 1971 gave two main recommendations that could be
initiated by WAPDA in order to mold system demand to system capability.
These two recommendations were that seasonal maximum demand tariffs, perhaps
of the price-linked-to-month kind, be introduced for industrial customers,
and that an experiment be undertaken to explore the practical possibilities
of introducing a time-of-day tariff for private tubewell operations. These
proposals will be further discussed during supervision.
6.15      Tariff adjustments are subject to approval by the Government.
After application with the Ministry of Fuel, Power and Natural Resources,
a number of meetings are held with representatives of various agencies
concerned, in particular the Planning Board, the Economic Affairs Division
and other groups of the Ministry of Finance. Final decision is made by the
Secretary General of the Ministry of Finance. Recently the "Standing
Power Rates Advisory Board" was created. It consists of representatives
of the four provincial governments, one representative of WAPDA, one of
the Planning Board and a varying number of members of the National Assembly.



- 26 -
It is headed by the Chief Engineering Advisor of the Ministry of Fuel, Power
and Natural Resources. Its function is to advise all parties concerned
on the necessity of tariff adjustments, their timing and implications.
Audit
6.16      Under its Act, the Authority is required to be audited annually
by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of Pakistan. The
Comptroller is appointed by the President of the Republic and responsible
to the legislature. A special group of the Auditor-General, called "Director
WAPDA Audit", carries out the audit on a permanent basis. The auditor claims
that after about 2 months of closing of the books WAPDA is supplied with
the "Preliminary Audit Observations." This is a loose-leaf report containing
the auditor's findings and provides the Authority with an opportunity to
respond. Discussions have in the past taken more than one year and the final
audit report to the legislature is normally not issued earlier than about
three years after the end of the respective fiscal year.
6.17      This situation is not satisfactory.  Furthermore, the mission was
not able to form an opinion on the quality of the audit due to the unsatis-
factory state of WAPDA's accounts and the lack of any kind of recent auditor's
reports. Imposing external auditors on a deficient accounting system,
however, would not be satisfactory either. It is therefore proposed to accept
the WAPDA audit for the Bank Group's auditing purposes until WAPDA's accounting
system is improved with the help of consultants (paras. 3.12-3.14). WAPDA's
accounts together with the "Preliminary Audit Observations" will be sent
to the Bank not later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal year.
After establishing a modern accounting system in WAPDA's Power Wing (Annex 7),
a decision on whether the Government audit is satisfactory will be made.
Insurance
6.18      At present WAPDA is only insuring a minor portion of its property
in operation but insurance against hazards of acquisition and transportation
and delivery of goods is regularly arranged.  Premiums for full operation
insurance would be exorbitantly high in Pakistan. However, WAPDA is evaluat-
ing the cost of insuring major equipment. To provide a minimum protection
WAPDA will in the meantime allocate annually 0.2% of net fixed assets to a
self-insurance reserve.
Inter-De?artmental Cash Transfers
6.19      Before the critical liquidity situation of the Power Wing (para.
6.04) M<ich led to temporary transfers of funds from the Water Wing to the
Powe. Wing, borrowing by the Water Wing from the Power Wing had reached
the approximate total of Rs 173.4 million in FY 1973/74 before charging
interest, and about Rs 232.9 million when interest is included. This is
an undesirable situation. Consequently, agreement was reached during nego-
tiations that cash transfers between the two wings will no longer occur.



- 27 -
Billing and Collection
6.20      With the exception of the Lahore area where bills are issued with
the help of a WAPDA-owned computer, all billing is done manually. With
roughly 1.6 million customers this is a formidable task and it is commenda-
ble that WAPDA managed to keep its accounts receivable slightly below
three-months billing levels. To maintain this acceptable record, agreement
was reached during negotiations that WAPDA would make all efforts to keep
accounts receivable at the end of any month to not more than the amount
billed during the previous three-months period.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points and appropriate covenants were included in the documents:
(a) future changes in legislation affecting the power
sector (para 2.12);
(b) earnings covenant (para 6.05);
(c) fuel adjustment clause (para. 6.13);
(d) audit (para 6.17);
(e) inter-departmental cash transfers (para 6.19); and
(f)  maximum level of accounts receivable (para 6.20).
7.02      A condition of loan effectiveness is the conclusion of satis-
factory contractual arrangements with the engineering consultants (para
4.09).
7.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$50 million, on "Third Window" terms.

10. comprehensive financial, accounting and other statistical
statements (including trial balances, revenue account, balance
sheets and cash flows).
B. Other Activities
1. Review of WAPDA's present organizational structure and recommenda-
tions on its reorganization particularly with regard to the
formation of Area Boards;
2.  design of accounting and statistical manuals and charts;
3. evaluation of the existing budgeting and budget control systems
(investment and operation) and recommendation on their improvement;



Annex 7
Page 2 of 4 pages
4. recommendations on the gradual implementation of accounting
mechanization for part or all of WAPDA's power wing accounts; and
5. training of WAPDA personnel in the application of the new
accounting systems.
II. Work Program
The work program willbe carried out in two phases. During Phase I
the consultants will review the present status of WAPDA's accounting
systems, make proposals on improvements, where required, and establish
and design the necessa-ry accounts, manuals and forms. Phase IT will
be concerned with the implementation of the systems established during
Phase I. The following detailed activities are envisaged:
A. Phase I
1. Review of WAPDA's Organizational Structure
This review will provide the organizational framework on which
the consultants' suggestions will be based. They will include
the hierarchy and format of the management information systems,
the line/staff relationship, the code of accounts, the job
description for senior and middle management, the formation of
Area Boards for distribution, and other similar problems.
2. Fixed Asset Accounting
The consultants will compile the register for all existing
assets and will make proposals on asset valuation and depreciation
rates.
3. Inventory Accounting and Control
As a pre-requisite to establishing a revised system, the pattern
of stock movements will be reviewed. Based on the results of
this analysis, a new system will be developed to improve
recording, control and accounting of stores. The major objective
of this exercise is the establishment of an optimum inventory
level.
4. Consumer Control
A thorough review of the billing and collecting system will be
carried out and proposals for improvement made. In reviewing
the current situation of the accounts receivable, particular
attention will be paid to the prospects of their collection.



Annex 7
Pagc 3 of   pq:J,s
5. Accounts Payable and Accruals
The introduction of a reliable system of debt management is
important in the light of WAPDA's reputation as a trustworthy
debtor.
6. Capital Expenditure Accounting
The system envisaged will be related to the investment budget
and budget control, and consequently will include the
following criteria:
(i) commitments placed;
(ii) expenditures incurred;
(iii) cash flow requirements; and
(iv) comparison of original versus revised estimates.
7. Payroll
Review of the existing system and recommendations for
improvements will be made, in particular with a view to
facilitating cost data.
8. Code of Accounts and Accounting Manuals
The accounting system will be documented in the form of
procedure manuals, incorporating specimen forms and instructions
on their use.
Upon completion of Phase I the consultants will issue a comprehensive
report.
B.  Phase II
During Phase II the recommendations made in Phase I will be
implemented throughout WAPDA with the help of the consultants.
On-the-job training of WAPDA's personnel will form an important
part. The consultants will submit quarterly reports describing
the achievements of the past quarter and outlining the program of
activities of the following quarter.
III. Time Schedule of the Services
The assignment is estimated to take 20 months, involving a requirement of
92 man-months on the part of the consultants. In detail the following
is envisaged:

IV. Assistance by WAPDA Personnel
The consultants will attempt to involve the maximum number of WAPDA
employees in order to:
(i) ensure that as many persons as possible are familiar with the
procedures and systems devised, thereby reducing both the
training and implementation time subsequently required; and
(ii) minimize the time required for data collection on fixed assets.
V.   Consultants' Staff
The consultant will assign four senior and three junior personnel. Three
of the senior personnel will be expatriates, two on a full-time basis
(20 man-months each) and one part-time during Phase I (about 6 man-months).
The remaining personnel will be local.

Second WAPDA Power Project
Project Description and Cost Estimate
1.        The project is the construction of a 500 kV transmission line
Lyallpur to Multan (136 miles) and Multan to Guddu (200 miles), to be operated
initially at 220 kV, and e 220 kV switching station to be installed at Multan
for interconnection at that point. The interconnection facilities at
Lyallpur and Guddu are being provided under schemes already under construc-
tion by WAPDA. Also included are tools and equipment for construction of
the line and for the transformer repair bay at Lyallpur (Gatti Substation)
as well as the foreign exchange cost of the consultant to design, assist
in bid documentation, award of contracts, supervision of construction, and
training of Pakistani engineers.
2.        The line Lyallpur-rNultan-Guddu is required to interconnect the
northern and central areas in order to make available to the northern area
the surplus power that will be available in the central area with the com-
pletion of the Guddu 3 unit of 210 megawatts scheduled for operation late
1977 and to provide a market for part of the excess hydro generation availa-
ble in the Northern area. The initial operation at 220 kV will be satis-
factory until mid 1982 at which time either Tarbela units 9 to 12 or a nu-
clear plant will have been completed in the northern area and the magnitude
of power interchanges will require the conversion to 500 kV operation.
3.        The project is the first stage of a scheme to interconnect the
northern, central and southern areas of Pakistan with a 500 kV transmission
line of approximately 630 miles in length from Lyallpur to Karachi with
intermediate substations at M4ultan, Guddu and Hyderabad. This intercon-
nection will be necessary in order to transmit the excess hydro energy in
the northern area to the central and southern areas during the high water
months of July, August and September and to firm  up the hydro energy in the
northern area with the thermal energy available in the central and southern
areas during the low water months of March, April and May.
4.        WAPDA's original plan was to complete a 220 kV double circuit
transmission line from Multan to Hyderabad/Karachi by 1979 and then to paral-
lel this line with a 500 kV single circuit line to be completed in 1982.
Further investigation indicated that the cost of a 500 kV single-circuit
transmission line was only approximately 20 to 25% greater than for a 220
kV double-circuit transmission line while the carrying capacity of a 500
kV single-circuit line operated at 220 kV was nearly the same. However,
when the 500 kV single-circuit line is converted to 500 kV operation with



ANNEX 8
Page 2
the addition of the 500 kV substations the capacity of the 500 kV single-
circuit line is approximately 2.5 times that of a 220 kV double circuit line.
Therefore, the decision was made to build the interconnection with 500 kV
construction, operate initially at 220 kV and convert to 500 kV operation
by 1982 or earlier. This would eliminate the need for the proposed 220kV
double circuit line from Multan to Hyderabad/Karachi and would provide the
least cost solution for the interconnection and for the power development
of Pakistan.
5.        As early as 1966, Stone and Webster recommended voltages higher
than 220 kV for the North to South interconnection. Again in 1972 in
studies financed by the Bank, EHV Consultants and Meta Systems, Inc. recom-
mended 500 kV as the required voltage for the interconnection between the
Northern, Central and Southern areas to be in operation in 1981 as the
least cost solution to the power development of Pakistan. CIDA has recently
made available a grant of $900,000 to the Government of Pakistan to study
the routing and costs of the second Tarbela-Lyallpur line.
6.        A detailed cost estimate of the project is given below:

Notes and Assumptions on Financial Projections
Sales of Energy
The projected energy sales are a function of expected plant com-
missioning rather than estimated market requirements. This is justified
since the demand potential is estimated to be higher than WAPDA's capability
to supply, a situation which is likely to continue for a number of years.
The resulting sales increases vary between about 13% and 18% per year.
Average Revenues per kWh Sold
The average revenues include the overall 13.3% tariff increase which
became effective on June 7, 1975.  Further increases of 20% on March 31, 1977,
25% on January 1, 1978 and 10% on January 1, 1980 have been assumed.
Purchased Power
WAPDA purchases power from KESC. Up to March 1975 the price
charged was 5.5 paisa/kWh plus fuel adjustment. Tentative agreement was
reached with KESC on a price of 7.3 paisa/kWh plus fuel adjustment, retro-
active to January 1, 1974. The maximum cost to WAPDA should not exceed its
average revenues. The contract, when finally effective, will be valid for
two years.
Fuel
At the time of appraisal the cost of fuel to WAPDA was as follows:
1.   Guddu
(a)  Raw Gas     : Rs 0.51 per 1,000 cu ft
(b) Purified Gas: Rs 6.46 per 1,000 cu ft
In addition the following charges are levied on raw gas:
(a)  excise tax    : Rs 0.75 per 1,000 cu ft
(b) regulating tax: Rs 0.45 per 1,000 cu ft

US$8.00/barrel.
9.   High Speed Diesel Oil

The projections assume annual fuel cost increases of 10% to allow
for:



ANNEX 10
Page 7
(i)  possible increases of domestic prices.  Present oil
prices in Pakistan are below world market levels and
gas price increases planned; and
(ii)  the rising share of oil-fired versus gas-fired plant.
Oil prices are presently higher than gas prices in
Pakistan.
Operation, Maintenance and Administration
Increases of 15% per year have been projected. This assumes
that the sharp rise in cost of the recent past will somewhat level off.
Depreciation
WAPDA is presently applying an overall rate of 3.5% per year.
This rate has been used in the forecasts.
Allocation to Insurance Reserve
0.2% of net fixed assets in operation starting FY 1975/76.
Debt Service
The data available on debt service for loans and credits incurred
before January 1975 appear unreliable. It seems that the interest payments
are too high and the amortization payments too low. Due to lack of more
reliable information, the data provided by WAPDA have been used as the
basis for calculating future debt service. For future borrowing the fol-
lowing terms have been assumed:
1.   Foreign:  (a) 20% of the total foreign borrowing requirement
as loans and suppliers' credits made directly
to WAPDA. The assumed conditions are 8%
interest (interest during the grace period
financed from funds of the credits) and a 15
years' term including 2 years of grace.
(b) 80% of the total foreign borrowing requirement
as loans channelled through the Government at
present standard terms which are: 4% interest
(interest during the grace period not financed
from funds of the loans), 5 years of grace, and
20 years repayment.
2.   Local:  All local borrowing channelled through the Government
at present standard terms which are: 8.25% interest
(interest during the grace period not financed from
funds of the loans), 5 years of grace, and 20 years
repayment.

Consumers' Contributions
Due to deficient recording no reliable data on consumers' contri-
butions are available although such payments are in fact being made. In
the majority of cases these contributions seem to be recorded directly
against asset account. Consequently it can be assumed that the fixed assets
are largely stated net of consumers' contributions.
