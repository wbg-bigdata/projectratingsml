The Philippines ODS Phase-out Project lasted 17 years and consisted of two phases. Phase 1,
implemented from 1994-2003, was largely successful in meeting its objective to assist the
Government to phase-out the use of ODS within its territory by the Year 2000 through (a) the
introduction of appropriate technology measures; (b) the institutional strengthening of responsible
governmental entities; and (c) the implementation of specific cost-effective priority investments
to reduce consumption of ozone depleting substances. Phase 2, implemented from 2003-2011,
was less successful, largely due to the fact that many of the outcomes achieved were the result of
a shrinking global supply of CFCs driven by Montreal Protocol implementation of timed
production sector phase-out and availability of less expensive alternatives in the market, as
opposed to specific Project investments. In particular, the largest component of Phase 2, a
voucher system designed to provide tools and equipment to service shops, failed to support
phase-out in the servicing sector mainly due to poor management and lack of oversight.
This Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report, as all World Bank ICR reports, is an
independent assessment of Project preparation and supervision 1 . It was prepared by staff
members who were not involved in Project preparation or supervision. The ratings assessed in the
ICR report are independent of those assessed by the supervision team during Project
implementation.
1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
The Montreal Protocol: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer
(MP) is a multilateral environmental agreement that was adopted in 1987 based on international
recognition of the need for firm measures to protect the earth’s ozone layer. The Protocol
established time-bound targets to reduce the production and consumption of a number of ozone-
depleting substances (ODS), initially (i) chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), used in refrigeration, air-
conditioning, and aerosol, solvents and foam applications, and (ii) halons, used in fire protection.
The Government of the Philippines ratified the Montreal Protocol in 1991 and has since ratified
the Protocol’s four subsequent amendments. Developing countries, such as the Philippines, that
ratify the Montreal Protocol are classified as Article 5(1) Parties. The Philippines neither
produced, nor exported, any of the substances controlled under the Protocol and hence, its
consumption demands were met solely through imports. Ratification of the Protocol made the
Philippines eligible to receive grant funding from the Protocol’s financial mechanism, the
Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the MP (MLF), to support its ODS phase-out targets.
Project background: In the early 1990s, ODS consumption in the Philippines was dominated by
the use of CFCs2, namely CFC-11 and CFC-12, (consumption breakdown, by year and chemical
outlined in Table A2.3 of Annex 2) used in the manufacture of refrigerators, coolers and freezers,
as a blowing agent in foam production, as a propellant in aerosol products, as well as in the
servicing of refrigeration and air-conditioning, including mobile air-conditioning, equipment.
CFC-113 and small amounts of methyl chloroform were used in the solvent sector for cleaning
applications in the electronics industry. In 1993, total consumption of CFCs, as reported by the

Government to the MP, was 3,779 ODP tons3. The Philippines Country Program (CP), a strategic
document that outlined incremental costs, policies and actions required to achieve ODS phase-out,
was completed in June 1993 with the assistance of UNDP. The CP spelled out regulatory
measures needed to control ODS imports, and fiscal and technology transfer measures to
encourage the use of ODS substitutes and of non-ODS technologies.
In line with the CP’s strategic objectives, and informed by two engineering studies supported by
the Bank and extensive consultation with stakeholders, the Project was designed to furnish grant
funds approved by the MLF for the targeted phase-out of ODS. The Project’s implementation
structure was governed by an umbrella Grant Agreement instrument that had been created
specifically for the Bank’s Montreal Protocol investment activities. In this instrument grant
commitments were not received upfront but rather, were dependent on MLF approvals received
over the life of the agreement, thereby allowing for the development of future additional sub-
projects that might be required to assist the Government in meeting its MP phase-out targets. The
Grant Agreement was signed in October 1994 with an initial umbrella amount of $15.049 million,
a ceiling which was raised to $30 million in 1995 to accommodate the possibility of new MLF
approvals.
A first phase of the Project (Phase 1), which ran until 2002, set out to support a) sixteen priority
investment sub-projects; and b) technical assistance to build implementing agency capacity. A
second phase of the Project (Phase 2) was prepared in the early 2000s, while Phase 1 was being
completed. In 1999, MP control measures for Article 5 countries like the Philippines - beginning
with a freeze of CFC consumption at 1995-1997 average levels and leading to complete phase-out
by January 2010 – came into effect. In 2000, DENR issued a Chemical Control Order (CCO) for
ODS, that banned importation of CFCs for use on new equipment and/or products, and limiting
availability of CFCs for servicing of existing equipment. The CCO established an import
licensing and quota system gradually restricting the amount of virgin CFCs that could be
imported, consistent with the said MP control measure. The Government, with Bank support,
prepared a national CFC phase-out plan (NCPP), a multi-year, performance-based, nationally-
executed implementation strategy that spanned 2002-2008 and introduced measures to support
reduction in consumption demand by various CFC-using sectors in line with the import
restrictions. The MLF Executive Committee (ExCom) approved the NCPP in 2002. Overall,
Phase 2 of the Project supported three components: a) CFC phase-out interventions through
investment sub-projects, training, and TA for policy and regulatory measures laid out in the
NCPP; b) an Institutional Strengthening Project; and c) a methyl bromide phase-out sub-project.
Rationale for World Bank Support to the Philippines’ ODS Phase-out Objectives: As an
implementing agency of the MLF, the Bank assisted the Government of the Philippines in
identifying opportunities for ODS phase-out in the manufacturing sector through the preparation
of two engineering studies that served to lay the technical foundations for the design of the ODS
Phase-out Project Phase 1. At the time, a number of similar projects were under development by
the Bank in the region in countries with similar levels of ODS consumption, including Thailand,
China and Malaysia. The Bank had a strong technical team that was involved in these operations
and able to transfer experiences between countries. The Bank’s focus on economic development
while ensuring environmental sustainability placed it in a good position to support ODS phase-
out where sustained and sustainable industrial expansion would need to include environmental
considerations. The Project was consistent with “sustainable development?, one of six core
elements of the World Bank’s 1993 Country Strategy for the Philippines.

 ODP is the ratio of the impact on ozone of a chemical compared to the impact of a similar mass of CFC-11. The ODP
of CFC-11 is defined to be 1.0. Other ODS have ODPs that range from 0.01 to 12.0.


                                                        2
Strong working relations between the Philippine Government agencies and the Bank during Phase
1 led to cooperation in the preparation of the NCPP and preparation of Phase 2. For the second
phase, The World Bank coordinated the NCPP and prepared the plan’s investment components,
while the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), under its bilateral
cooperation programme, prepared the refrigeration servicing components. In the early 2000s, the
Bank’s ODS team was supporting similar multi-year, strategic operations in the region, such as in
Indonesia and Malaysia, and elsewhere, such as in Turkey and Brazil, which again facilitated
transfer of experiences. Given the Bank’s recognized ability to support large-scale, complex
projects, and given the opportunity to link environmental efforts more closely with development
objectives spelled out in country assistance strategies (CAS), the Bank remained an important
partner for ODS phase-out in the Philippines. The Project supported the World Bank’s 2002-2005
CAS for the Philippines, which aimed to assist the Government in reestablishing a pattern of
rapid and sustained poverty reduction. By initiating programs, including those funded by the
MLF, to protect the environment and natural resource base, the World Bank program would
support national efforts to empower the poor to participate more fully in development.
As spelled out in the Bank’s Operational Policy 10.21, Investment Operations Financed by the
Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, funding for the
implementation of MP projects is channeled to recipients through the Ozone Projects Trust Fund
(OTF), which the Bank established and administers. The OTF is constituted by funds approved by
the MLF ExCom. Projects, and umbrella grant sub-projects, greater than $500,000 are prepared
and pre-appraised by the World Bank, following which they are submitted for approval to the
MLF ExCom. Such operations are then processed according to the procedures set out in Bank
Procedures 10.21, which include project documents and reviews similar or identical to those that
apply to regular investment projects, and then approved at the regional vice president level. The
World Bank Procurement and Consultant Selection Guidelines apply.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
As stated in the original Grant Agreement (GA), dated October 6, 1994, the overall objective of
the Project was to assist the Recipient to phase-out the use of ODS within its territory by the Year
2000 through, inter alia: (a) the introduction of appropriate technology measures; (b) the
institutional strengthening of responsible governmental entities; and (c) the implementation of
specific cost-effective priority investments to reduce consumption of ozone depleting substances.4
The overall ODS consumption phase-out target was 800 ozone depleting potential (ODP)5 T, as
specified under ‘Project Benefits? in the Memorandum to the Country Director 6. This objective
was, for the most part, achieved, as discussed in Section 3.
1.3 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

  The Memorandum to the Director stated the objective as follows: “To support the Government's program to phase out
ODS by: (a) establishing an efficient mechanism for executing ODS phase-out projects through local institutions; and
(b) implementing an initial group of cost effective priority subprojects.?

5
 ODP is the ratio of the impact on ozone of a chemical compared to the impact of a similar mass of CFC-11. The ODP
of CFC-11 is defined to be 1.0. Other ODS have ODPs that range from 0.01 to 12.0.

6
    The GA did not specify key indicators.


                                                         3
The GEO was revised in 2003, in consultation with Government and with World Bank Country
Director approval, in order to broaden its scope further to include support for the implementation
of a multi-year National CFC Phase-out Plan. As stated in the revised GA, the new GEO read:
“The overall objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient to phase-out the use of ODS within
its territory through, inter alia: (a) the introduction of appropriate technology measures; (b) the
institutional strengthening of responsible governmental entities; (c) the implementation of
specific cost-effective investments to reduce consumption of ozone depleting substances; and (d)
the implementation of Sector Plans, including the National CFC Phase-out Plan.?
The formally revised targets under Phase 2 of the Project, as defined in the Project Document
submitted to the MLF ExCom, were based on remaining consumption of CFCs – a target of
2,017.6 ODP T - and aligned with the official control measures of the MP 7 (50% reduction
against base level by 1 January 2005; 85% reduction by 1 January 2007; and, 100% reduction by
1 January 2010).
The revised GEO was achieved during the Project period; however, as discussed in Section 3,
most outcomes are not attributable to the activities funded by the Project.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The beneficiaries of the Project, as it was originally conceived, were local enterprises introducing
ODS reducing technologies, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)
and the Project’s financial agent, Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), which were in charge of
implementing the Project. DENR and LBP would benefit from capacity-building and institutional
strengthening related to large-scale project management. National ODS-using enterprises would
receive financing to cover the incremental costs of conversion from ODS to non-ODS
technologies. The bulk of the enterprises eligible for funding through the program included
manufacturers of household and commercial refrigeration equipment and of mixed technology
circuit card assemblies used in electronics applications.
Following the inclusion of the multi-year National CFC Phase-out Plan (NCPP) in 2003:
(i)    Additional small and medium-size enterprises in the refrigeration, air-conditioning and
       mobile air-conditioning sectors benefitted from training and subsidies provided for
       technological conversion;
(ii)   The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and other local training
       institutes benefitted from training of trainers and receipt of training equipment; and,

(iii) Other municipal, provincial and national government agencies - including the DENR
      Environmental Management Bureau and its regional offices, the Department of Agriculture
      Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of
      Justice, the Bureau of Customs, the Department of Transportation and Communication, the
      Land Transportation Office, the Department of Health Bureau of Food and Drug, and
      various local government units – benefitted from institutional strengthening and inter-
      institutional coordination, which would allow them to contribute to the sustainable phase-
      out of ODS in the Philippines.

1.5 Original Components
The Project, as originally approved, included two components:


7
  MP “control measures? are regulatory measures to control ODS through restrictions in production, consumption and
trade of those substances. A summary of the control measures of the MP relevant to the Project is included in Annex 9.

                                                          4
a)      Sixteen pre-identified investment sub-projects under the umbrella grant to support
ODS phase-out including, through (i) fourteen sub-projects in the manufacturing (refrigeration,
foam blowing, solvents, and tobacco fluffing) sector, which would aim to support transition to
non-CFC technologies whereby MLF grant funding would cover the incremental costs associated
with the adoption of such technologies; and (ii) two sub-projects in the servicing sector, namely
the establishment of a central refrigerant recycling scheme in Manila and a mobile air
conditioning (MAC) recycling scheme in the Philippines. $14.74 million were allocated to this
component. At the time of Project approval by the World Bank, 10 of the sub-projects had been
approved by the MLF and funding was allocated. The remaining six sub-projects were to be
appraised and submitted to the MLF ExCom for approval during Project implementation. Sub-
project appraisal would be carried out by the LBP. The Philippines Ozone Desk (POD), which
was to be established under the DENR and supported by funds drawn against the TA component
(below), would ensure that the sub-projects were consistent with the goals set forth in the Country
Program for ODS phase-out and applied cost-effective technologies. The LBP, which also acted
as the Project’s financial agent, would be responsible for supervising sub-project implementation
and disbursement of grant funds to enterprises, as well as preparing regular status reports to the
World Bank and the MLF ExCom.
b)       A Technical Assistance (TA) Component to strengthen the institutional capacity of
responsible governmental entities and to establish an efficient national mechanism for the
management of ODS phase-out projects through local institutions. This encompassed (i) an
Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP) which, renewed periodically (on average every two
years), sought to build institutional capacity within DENR to manage ODS phase-out in the
country on behalf of the Government, including the establishment of a POD. The scope of the
ISPs extended to all MP related issues, with emphasis on instituting MP-related policy and
regulatory measures to control ODS imports and monitor ODS use in the country, to meet data
reporting obligations under MP Article 7, and to carry out targeted outreach and awareness
activities; and (ii) Technical Assistance to the Financial Agent to enhance LBP’s capacity for
appraising and supervising the investment sub-projects and handling the financial management
and disbursement aspects of the overall Project.

1.6 Revised Components
Phase 2 had a significantly larger scope than Phase 1 and included three components:
a)      Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP) (Initial allocation of $0.09 million, a total
of $0.70 million including four additional tranches approved later). Ongoing institutional
strengthening within DENR to institutionalize ODS management within the Department to
support effective coordination of the overall phase-out program by ensuring compliance with the
MP phase-out timetable, strengthening procedures for restricting ODS imports through
coordination with relevant government agencies, monitoring phase-out results, and collecting and
reporting data on ODS consumption as required by Article 7 of the Protocol. The Project would
be implemented by the POD.
b)      CFC Phase-out – National CFC Phase-out Plan (NCPP) Implementation. The
ExCom of the MLF approved the NCPP in November 2002 with a funding window of $10.58
million with which to phase out remaining CFC consumption of 2,017.6 ODP tons8 by January 1,
2010. The Government of Sweden, using its bilateral funding allocation under the MLF ($0.29


8
  A total of 2,049.3 ODP T remained in use in 2001 however, 31.7 ODP T was already being phased out through an
ongoing project in the foam sector that had been approved during the Project’s first phase. The resulting target was
therefore, 2,017.6 ODP T.

                                                         5
million), joined the Project as Co-Implementing Agency to support technical assistance and
training activities in the servicing sector, as well as to provide Project specific institutional
support to the POD. Of the total amount, $9.20 million were allocated to:


       1) TA for policy and regulatory measures in support of CFC phase-out, including
       development of an import quota and licensing system, development of a Code of Practice in
       the residential air conditioning (RAC) and mobile air conditioning (MAC) servicing sectors,
       incorporation of ODS concerns in Department of Trade and Industry service shop registration,
       and establishment by the Department of Transportation and Communication of a vehicular
       registration and inspection system for CFC-use in MAC. Key policy measures would be
       developed through collaboration with an Inter-Agency Technical Working Group, and
       introduced to support sustainable CFC phase-out.
       2) Investment sub-projects providing partial grants for procurement of production
       equipment that uses CFC alternatives in up to six foam manufacturers, 15 small foam
       blowing enterprises, three industrial/commercial refrigeration equipment manufacturers, and
       nine aerosol sector enterprises. Sub-projects would be prepared by enterprises and appraised
       and supervised by DENR. A target of 417.5 ODP T phase-out was projected to result from
       implementation of these investment sub-projects, thereby reducing 25% of the remaining
       CFC consumption in the Philippines.
       3) Phase-out of CFC-using metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) used in treatment of asthma and
       chronic pulmonary diseases. The Project would support the Bureau of Food and Drug of the
       Department of Health to organize stakeholder workshops and awareness raising among users.
       Through regulatory and awareness-raising means, CFC-using MDIs would be eliminated
       from the market in the Philippines.
       4) Support to the RAC/MAC servicing sector, where ODS consumption represented 75% of
       the national total. Import restrictions introduced in compliance with MP control measures
       were gradually reducing available virgin9 CFCs for the servicing of residential and mobile air
       conditioning (RAC and MAC) units and chiller equipment through the end of their useful life,
       which, in some cases, could span multiple decades. This sub-component therefore, sought to
       ensure availability of recovered and reclaimed CFCs to address the servicing needs in the
       country and to sustain reduced demand in consumption in line with the diminishing import
       quota, through:
            i)   Training of service technicians in the code of good management practices, notably
                 not venting and proper recharging and CFC recovery followed by certification and
                 accreditation of service shops. The Technical Education and Skills Development
                 Authority (TESDA) would train and accredit training centers distributed across the
                 country. Ninety (90) training centers would be provided with basic equipment for
                 training, so they would train and certify some 5,000 service technicians.
            ii) A voucher system, through which DENR would provide subsidies to some 2,200
                RAC service shops to purchase service tools to support retrofitting of existing CFC-
                using systems to non-ODS using systems, and to some 2,900 MAC service shops to
                purchase recovery & recycling (R&R) equipment to allow for recovery and re-use of
                CFCs from automobile air-conditioners. The voucher system was expected to lead to
                phase-out of 1,531 ODP T of CFCs by improving servicing capacity through

    As opposed to recovered or reclaimed.

                                                   6
            retrofitting to alternatives (HFC-134a) in the MAC and RAC sectors, and reuse of
            recovered and recycled CFCs in the MAC sector. Most service shops were small to
            micro-size enterprises. DENR would competitively pre-select and annually accredit
            qualified suppliers, based on standard technical specifications, who would honor
            DENR vouchers. To receive vouchers, service shops were required to employ at least
            one technician who should have successfully completed the prescribed training
            program. The voucher would cover only part of the cost of the tools and equipment;
            the service shop’s equity contribution was required to enhance ownership. Initially
            central DENR, through a Project Management Unit, was to implement the system.
            The Project Operating Policy Guidelines (OPG) outlined key aspects of the system’s
            administration.
        iii) Establishment by DENR, in concert with a private sector entity, of a reclamation
             facility to reclaim, for re-use, CFCs recovered through the voucher system so as to
             ensure availability of CFCs to support the servicing of existing MAC and building
             chiller equipment.
In contrast with Phase 1, and consistent with the MLF ExCom’s new policy to give countries
more control and ownership over the phase-out process, under Phase 2 the Government was to
prepare annual work plans for the implementation of the NCPP. Each annual work plan would
specify a target reduction in CFC consumption levels and the interventions, through which it
would achieve the said reduction. Unlike under Phase 1, individual interventions, such as
investment sub-projects, were not approved by the MLF ExCom but by the Government, in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the MLF. In order to maintain overall performance
oversight, at the end of each year the country’s performance in reaching the reduction target for
the year would be verified through an independent audit (see section 2.3) and presented to the
ExCom.
This new arrangement required much larger institutional capacity than had been necessary and
available under Phase 1. Specifically, the development of annual work plans required DENR to
be responsible for identifying remaining uses and users of CFCs, verify consumption, assess the
level of assistance required to ensure sustainable phase-out, and assist preparation of sub-projects
eligible for funding under the NCPP, in addition to the Project implementation responsibilities
mentioned above. All these activities had to be monitored closely with regard to targets sets in
the annual work plans, as failure to meet the phase-out targets contained in the NCPP Agreement
with the ExCom in a timely manner would lead to funding penalties being levied against future
year allocations.
A project management unit (PMU) was established at a projected cost of $ 1.38 million, to assist
the DENR Philippines Ozone Desk (POD) in meeting these responsibilities.
c)       Methyl Bromide (MB) Sub-project ($0.33 million). The Project would aim to phase out
nine tons of methyl bromide used as a soil sterilant, a stored products protectant and a pesticide
for treatment of structures, by training pest control operators in integrated pest management
techniques and use of alternatives and substitutes; providing flour mills operators with personal
protective equipment for use when fumigating with the toxic MB substitute, phosphine; and
drafting of regulations to ensure sustainable phase-out of MB. This sub-project, initiated in 2004,
was implemented by the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority of the Department of Agriculture.
Under Phase 2, the role of the LBP as financial agent was confined to disbursing funds to Project
beneficiaries for eligible expenditures.

1.7 Other significant changes
Grant Agreement Amendments and Closing Date Extensions: The original Grant Agreement
(GA), dated October 6, 1994, was approved with a funding ceiling of $15.049 million. Over the
life of the Project, the GA was amended five times, all at the request of the Government:
    1) The first amendment, dated July 31, 1995 and approved by the World Bank Country
       Director (WB CD), increased the ceiling to $30 million, and revised the GA into an
       “umbrella GA? that would accommodate future additional sub-projects. The Project’s
       closing date was extended from June 30, 1998 to June 30, 2000. (Over the life of the
       Project a total of $26.97 million were approved and $20.65 million disbursed.)
    2) On June 7, 2000, the GA was further amended through WB CD approval, to allow for
       reallocation of $300,000 in grant proceeds from the Sub-project Category to the Training
       and Consultant’s services for the Institutional Strengthening Category of Schedule 1 of
       the GA. The closing date was also extended to 30 June 2008, in expectation of approval
       of the NCPP that was under preparation.
    3) On March 24, 2003, the GA was amended through WB CD approval to accommodate
       new and/or additional Phase 2 activities, including the newly approved NCPP, which also
       entailed a revision of the GEO, and a closing date extension to 30 June, 2010 to fully
       align with the MP phase-out target date.
    4) In September 2006, the GA was amended with WB CD approval to re-categorize certain
       expenditure items and to clarify the remuneration categories for the LBP.
    5) In June 2010, the Closing Date was extended to June 30, 2011 through a Regional Vice-
       President-approved restructuring. The extension was granted to enable the Government to
       refund un-liquidated cash advances, conclude independent monitoring and assessment of
       the NCPP voucher system, and finalize corrective measures to address the delivery of
       faulty equipment under the NCPP.
A Grant Agreement for the $290,759 Government of Sweden co-financing (TF056617),
providing technical assistance and training activities in the servicing sector, and specific support
to the POD, became effective on October 4, 2006.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
PHASE 1:
The Project design was consistent with the operational mechanism of the MLF during its first
decade, wherein investment projects were approved based on ODS phase-out potential, technical
merit and cost-effectiveness.
The Bank was one of four implementing agencies under the MLF. Protection of the ozone layer
was an area of new business development for the Bank and a number of similar projects using
Ozone Trust Fund resources were under development at the time. No similar projects however,
had yet advanced sufficiently in implementation to provide comprehensive lessons learned.
The GEO had been informed by preparatory engineering studies undertaken by the Bank in the
sector, as well as by experience gained during preparation and pre-appraisal of the investment
sub-projects. Both demonstrated that technical training and institutional strengthening would be
required to overcome limitations that could impede the effective appraisal, implementation and
management of the Project. The adoption of an umbrella approach was conceived to facilitate the
processing and management of multiple sub-projects under one single Grant Agreement. A
technical assistance (TA) component was put in place to address institutional strengthening needs.


                                                 8
The Project’s design was not complex. The number of implementing agencies was limited to two,
each with well defined, separate responsibilities. The number of investment sub-project
beneficiaries targeted (sixteen) and their geographical dispersion was limited and therefore,
manageable. While the Project’s approach was novel, the TA component was to build capacity in
its implementation. There were no significant social and environmental factors.
The Government’s commitment had been demonstrated by ratification of the Montreal Protocol
and acceptance of the ODS control schedule therein. Documentation on stakeholder involvement
in the preparation of the Country Program was not available to the ICR team; however, based on
MLF guidance in place for CP preparation in the early 1990s, the team assumes that the
Philippines’ CP preparation also involved stakeholder consultations. The sixteen manufacturing
enterprises were actively involved in sub-project preparation.
The Memorandum of Recommendation to the Director identified possible risks associated with
inadequate technical capacity on the part of the implementing agencies, DENR and LBP, which
could slow appraisal and the subsequent approval and implementation of sub-projects. The TA
component of the Project, which focused on training and institutional strengthening, was expected
to mitigate these risks. In hindsight, the training and technical capacity building appear to have
been successful, as sub-project appraisal and implementation proceeded without major problems.
Institutional problems that did occur were related to frequent DENR Management and staffing
changes, and financial management issues (see Section 2.2). It would appear that no measures
taken at Project preparation could have prevented these problems.

PHASE 2:
Phase 2 of the Project was also consistent with the evolving operational mechanism of the MLF,
wherein funding approval was shifting from a project-by-project approach to a performance-
based national phase-out approach aligned with the MP’s control measures for CFCs. Importantly,
responsibility for sub-project level management, including determination of ODS phase-out
potential, technical merit and cost-effectiveness, devolved at this stage from the ExCom to the
national Implementing Agencies. Project preparation took place mainly during calendar year
2002, during which World Bank Project preparation missions were combined with the
supervision of the ongoing Institutional Support Project component of Phase 1. The mission aide
memoires provided detailed accounts of discussions with DENR and LBP, and other stakeholders
on planned components and implementation arrangements, as well as the result of the
procurement capacity review carried out by the World Bank team. An Operating Policy
Guidelines (OPG) document was prepared by the implementing agencies and cleared by the Bank
team. A new Project Document was prepared for this expanded phase of the Project. It was
technically reviewed by the independent Ozone Operations Resource Group, then submitted to
the MLF Secretariat for review and onward forwarding to the ExCom for approval.
The amended grant agreement was approved by the World Bank country director following
clearances by the World Bank’s central units responsible for financial management and
disbursement, trust fund operations, procurement, Montreal Protocol Operations, the regional
procurement advisor (RPA), and regional sector director. The RPA also reviewed the OPG.
Despite the substantial changes to the Project’s scope, duration, funding, and implementation
arrangements, no other internal review or approval was required for MP operation amendments at
that time. In hindsight, given the extensive changes to the project design and structure, it would
have been more appropriate to close the initial Project after completion of Phase 1 activities and
process Phase 2 as a new operation. As such, the new activities would have been subject to a
formal appraisal and the Bank’s internal review process, as outlined in Bank Procedure (BP)



                                                9
10.21, which would have considered the proposed implementation plan, sustainability, lessons
from Phase 1, and risks10.
At the time, the Bank held the highest percentage share of MLF business of all the implementing
agencies. Aware of the impending control measures facing countries to phase out CFC
consumption by 2010, the Bank promoted the adoption of a national, multi-year, performance-
based approach in order to allow the country to put in place effective strategies to address its
phase-out targets. As with Phase I, a series of similar national projects were under development at
the time across the region and beyond. None had yet advanced sufficiently in implementation to
provide comprehensive lessons learned.
The Project’s intended outcomes continued to be relevant to the original GEO and were informed,
on the one hand, by policy decisions taken by the MLF ExCom following the start of the MP’s
CFC compliance period, which began on 1 January 1999 with the freeze in consumption (see
Annex 9), and on the other, by experiences gained during Phase 1 as well as by similar efforts
being undertaken by the Bank in neighboring countries and in other regions.
The NCPP represented the country’s largest and most complicated ODS phase-out project
approved at the time, involving an expanded number of government agencies both at the central
and regional levels, as well as several manufacturing sectors and the servicing sector, which was
composed of thousands of small to micro-size enterprises, principally service shops. In hindsight,
the complex nature of the NCPP should have called for a highly structured, committed and
effective management structure. In particular, the support to the RAC/MAC servicing sector sub-
component posed significant institutional challenges. The design of the voucher system was
incorrectly guided by the assumption that a central PMU would be able to identify, recruit, and
monitor 5,000 small and micro-size service shops spread around the country. In hindsight,
management of the voucher system should have been devolved to the regional Environmental
Management Bureaus offices from the outset and these offices should have been provided with
sufficient staff resources. Furthermore, the Operating Policy Guidelines should have included a
detailed, costed, and well-funded monitoring and inspection plan, the lack of which later proved a
key impediment in controlling equipment supplied by suppliers and service shop practices. On a
related point, the voucher system might have also benefitted from an outcome-based payment
arrangement, whereby suppliers would be compensated only after an independent party verified
that the equipment supplied was consistent with specifications and was used as intended by the
service shop. Unfortunately, at the time of Project preparation, while the voucher system was
implemented in neighboring countries, none was advanced enough to provide lessons learnt. In
fact, none of the above issues were identified by the Quality of Supervision Assessment carried
out by the Bank-internal Quality Assurance Group (QAG) in September 2004, which rated the
Bank team’s performance in Phase 2 preparation as “highly satisfactory?.
Lessons learnt from Phase 1 with regards to fiduciary management capacity building needs were
incorporated in Project design, as recognized by QAG, by working with the client to improve its
technical and management capacity in procurement and assisting counterparts to improve
financial management arrangements. Yet, in hindsight, fiduciary management proved to be one of
the most difficult implementation issues in Phase 2, suggesting, as in Phase 1, that project-based
interventions may not be sufficient to address systemic weaknesses.
As in the first phase, no significant social and environmental factors were noted. Project design
included adequate measures to mitigate potential environmental risks (see section 2.4).

The Government’s ongoing commitment to its ODS phase-out obligations had been demonstrated
by ratification of two of the MP’s amendments. A rigorous survey carried out during the
preparation of the NCPP, involving interviews with chemical and raw material suppliers, as well
as enterprise site visits, allowed for detailed sectoral consumption to be determined, and outreach
activities funded by the Institutional Strengthening Project contributed importantly to raising
awareness amongst the private and public sectors regarding the NCPP’s objectives.
The NCPP Project document, prepared for the consideration of the MLF ExCom, addressed the
risk related to the possibility of the Philippines being out of compliance with the 2005 control
measure of the MP (50% reduction in CFC consumption), as well as relevant mitigation measures.
However, no institutional risk assessment was conducted.
Overall, Phase 2 should have been treated as a new and separate operation, rather than as an
extension of the existing Project as this would have generated a) a thorough internal review of
Phase I results and lessons learned which could have informed Phase 2 design and further, b) a
full appraisal of Phase 2 as a separate project given the expansion in focus of the Project’s design
and added elements of implementation complexity involved in Phase 2.

2.2 Implementation
PHASE 1
Phase 1 of the Project generally achieved its objectives, as discussed under section 3.2, but
implementation was not without delays and problems. Phase 1 activities were initially planned to
be completed by June 1998. Investment sub-projects were completed by December 2000,
including conversion to non-ODS technology in their manufacturing process and demolition of all
ODS equipment. The delayed implementation was to a 4-month delay in GA effectiveness and to
enterprise-specific technical reasons including: (i) technical problems with the process
modifications; (ii) changes in the choice of technology, and (iii) new business developments, such
as relocation of plants or changes in ownership. However, besides this delay, the sub-project
implementation did not pose excessive challenges and led to a phase-out of more ODS than
originally envisaged, despite the reduced number of enterprises supported.
The implementation of the Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP) was originally envisaged to
be completed in two years, or by about the end of 1997. Due to change of DENR Management
and Government budgetary rules, funds were not disbursed on time and DENR requested an
extension of the ISP implementation until June 30, 1998 and then until December 31, 1998. When
the ISP budget of $200,000 was fully disbursed, the Bank, on behalf of the Government, twice
requested two-yearly renewals of the ISP through additional MP grants to continue supporting the
POD’s activities through 2002. A key regulatory contribution of the ISP to the Philippines ODS
program was the enactment by DENR of the 2000 Chemical Control Order for ODS, which
established ODS import control restrictions and contributed to the Philippines’ compliance with
MP control measures in the later years of the decade.
The POD was established under DENR as early as 1993; however, throughout Phase 1 it was
understaffed or staff was not adequately qualified. Furthermore, the POD was also impacted by
frequent changes in high level DENR Management, which led to staffing changes. World Bank
supervision missions repeatedly urged DENR Management to appoint adequate and qualified
personnel to the POD and stressed the need for Government commitment and POD dedication to
the ODS program. ISP implementation was marred with administrative and financial
mismanagement, resulting in funds being spent without an ISP work program cleared by the
World Bank and lack of proper recording and accounting according to GA requirements.
However, the World Bank’s response to these issues was less than proactive. Shared with the
client, the IP rating was kept at an unrealistic “satisfactory?, with the justification that a newly

                                                11
assigned POD team should be given a fair chance. Not being considered part of mainstream
World Bank operations, the ODS Project, like other trust fund financed activities, was not part of
regular Government-Bank joint portfolio reviews until 2001.
A mid-term review was not carried out during Phase 1, neither was an implementation
completion and results report. Such reviews might have provided a systemic and objective
analysis of the above implementation issues and drawn lessons for Phase 2, as was recommended
by the report of a Bank-internal Quality of Supervision of Risky Projects review in 2001.




                                               12
PHASE 2
Phase 2 implementation was more problematic than Phase 1, with fewer Project outputs than
planned being achieved and contributing to the Philippines’ achievement of the NCPP ODS
phase-out targets (see section 3.2.) Key factors were a shrinking global supply of CFCs driven by
Montreal Protocol implementation of timed production sector phase-out and availability of less
expensive alternatives in the market, as opposed to specific Project investments. In particular, the
largest component, a voucher system designed to provide tools and equipment to service shops,
failed to support phase-out in that sector mainly due to poor management and lack of oversight.

NCPP Implementation
The NCPP was a large and complicated Project to implement, with numerous partner agencies
and stakeholders involved in its implementation, including several manufacturing sectors and
thousands of small to micro-size refrigeration and air-conditioning service shops.

Technical Assistance for Policy and Regulatory Measures

Those Project-supported policy initiatives and regulations (listed in Annex 2) that were
adequately enforced, contributed to the CFC phase-out in line with NCPP targets. Coordination
and formal partnerships facilitated the implementation of some Project activities.

Manufacturing Sector Sub-projects
The Project supported CFC phase-out at six (of which one was an umbrella project comprising
three small enterprises) out of the originally targeted 53 (of which 20 were small) enterprises.
Many of the manufacturers identified as potential beneficiaries during the preparatory phase had
already begun to prepare for the transition earlier, driven by reduced availability and the resulting
higher price of CFCs, and ready availability of CFC-substitutes, in addition to the knowledge that
more stringent national regulatory measures were afoot. By 2005, in spite of the availability of
potential investment support, market considerations and the new regulatory environment, in part
put in place with Project support, had compelled many smaller manufacturers to convert on their
own to CFC-free alternatives, while others shut down operations completely or changed the
nature of their business.
The component started with delay due in part to a lack of interest on the part of enterprises and in
part to interested enterprises’ inability to produce adequate documentation for sub-project
appraisal. The latter issue was resolved through an inclusion of clarifications in the Operating
Policy Guidelines. A few enterprises that expressed interest in participation either pulled out later
on their own due to lower than expected grant levels or were rejected because of lacking permits
and limited remaining Project implementation time. The implementation of the six sub-projects
that went forward proceeded without any noteworthy complications.

Support to the RAC/MAC Servicing Sector
Training
Training of trainers followed by training, assessment and certification of service technicians was
a critical first step in the support to the RAC/MAC servicing sector under the Project, since only
certified service providers were eligible to receive vouchers. While the training of trainers was
completed relatively rapidly, as most trainers were affiliated with the Technical Education and
Skills Development Authority, training of service technicians did not commence until well into
2006. Causes for this delay were a deficiency in the original criteria used for selecting training
institutions, which did not include the service shop density distribution as a factor, as well as

                                                 13
differing views on the length, content, and fee for the service technician training course. The
former issue was settled by redistributing most of the deployed equipment according to the
expected number of trainees per training center. The length of training was eventually fixed at 2.5
days and the charge, to be covered by the service technicians, was agreed not to exceed PhP 2,500.
Further, it was agreed that there would be no charge for assessment of service technicians and a
training certificate would be sufficient for the award of the voucher. Nevertheless, the cost, length,
and effectiveness of training would continue to be problems affecting the voucher system
implementation, as discussed below.
The Voucher System
The voucher system was the most problematic aspect of Project implementation, achieving only
part of its envisaged outputs and little, if any, contribution to the Project GEO. The system had a
slow start in 2005 and initially drew little interest from service shops, despite the PMU’s
promotion efforts, due to associated monetary and time costs. A “catch-up plan? including
devolution from the PMU to Environmental Management Bureau regional offices of outreach and
administration functions, including through hiring area and regional coordinators; an increase in
the voucher amount; and simplification of the processing steps quickly boosted the number of
vouchers issued from less than 1,000 in late 2005 to over 2,500 in 2007.
However, during 2006 a number of serious problems with system implementation started to
surface. The PMU received several written and verbal complaints citing non-transparent practices
involving the suppliers, training institutes, and area coordinators, and that authorities responsible
for implementing the system did not always follow the PMU voucher guidelines. There were
charges that some area coordinators were exclusively promoting specific suppliers in exchange
for extra remuneration. There were reports of cases, where service shops were not given a choice
of suppliers and were not apprised that they could choose from several suppliers and a variety of
tools and equipment brands, capacities and prices so as to suit their needs. It appears that
suppliers took control of the system due to oversight and capacity limitations on the part of the
regional authorities. One regional EMB Director interviewed by the ICR mission indicated
inadequate funding support for the ODS implementation task, which was outside their regular
mandate, as a key cause for this shortcoming.
By September 2007, various surveys carried out by the PMU (over 400 shops), LBP (23 shops)
and the World Bank team (14 shops) revealed that a collection of intertwined issues could impact
the degree of success of the subsidy scheme, and more critically, the entire servicing sector
approach. All reviews confirmed that, 1) implementation of the voucher scheme progressed
differently than planned, being more equipment supplier-driven than service-shop driven,
resulting to the inconsistent adherence to the voucher requirements as well as the application
processing procedures; 2) the framework created to implement the voucher scheme has
intentionally and unintentionally promoted the procurement of recovery, as well as recovery and
recycling equipment (R and R&R equipment respectively) over tools, going beyond the 288 R
and R & R equipment proposed in the NCPP in 2002; 3) servicing shops are not necessarily
employing skills learned in training and may not be fully equipped due to the uneven training of
technicians, lack of proper demonstration of equipment use, the equipment selected and the
equipment performance; and, 4) there are obstacles to effective realization of policy and
regulatory objectives (namely accreditation and control of illegal trade of refrigerants) which are
potentially undermining aspects of the project design Because of these serious concerns, the
World Bank asked that voucher distribution as well as payment to suppliers be stopped until all
issues were resolved. DENR and the Bank agreed that DENR would commission an external
audit of the voucher system, including a survey of 15 percent of the voucher recipients
(henceforth the “15%-audit?), or 387 shops, covering all 17 regions in the country except the
Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao.

                                                 14
Completed in early 2008, the findings of the audit confirmed the issues identified earlier. It
recommended a series of policy related actions to address violations in the system, re-
appropriation of equipment provided to ineligible shops, enhancing the screening and evaluation
procedures for voucher grantees, applying strict monitoring conditions at the central, regional and
service shop levels, regulating the bad practices in service shops, and expediting the completion
of the reclamation facility. As a follow-up, in order to have conclusive evidence on the existence
of possible misconduct and shop-by-shop documentation of misallocation of equipment or faulty
equipment delivery, DENR and the Bank agreed that an audit of the remaining 85% of voucher
recipients (“the 85% audit?) be carried out by an independent third party. However, DENR
follow-up on this recommendation was protracted and the consultant selection process only began
in late 2009. Further delays occurred due to several back and forth exchanges between DENR and
the Bank on the scope, methodology and cost of the audit and qualifications of the auditors; lack
of interest by larger consulting groups in the assignment due to limited resource allocation, and a
change in task team leadership. It was eventually agreed that an assessment of the remaining 85%
voucher recipients would be carried out by the DENR Environmental Management Bureau
instead of an audit by a private firm. In early 2011, DENR hired, with World Bank no objection,
nine regional coordinators to carry out data collection. The assessment had not been completed
when the Project closed in on June 30, 2011.
To make matters worse, the 15%-audit and the Mid-term Implementation Review Mission of
May-June 2008 uncovered apparent non-compliance by suppliers with specifications and
misrepresentation of equipment; safety and liability issues related to equipment delivered; and
qualification of a supplier that possibly did not meet DENR requirements. Further inspection
revealed that around 41% of the total 2,364 recovery and R&R equipment had performance and
safety issues. Not one supplier of the five accredited suppliers had conformed with all of DENR’s
original accreditation specifications. Key factors leading to this result were institutional and
fiduciary gaps identified as changes in the voucher presentation, voucher guidelines and supplier
accreditation process, in addition to incomplete record keeping and follow-up, including technical
verification of all suppliers’ compliance with specifications. Non-compliant equipment threatened
the Project objective to provide incentives to service shops to improve service practices in a
sustainable manner and the cost-effective and transparent use of grant funds. Upon
recommendation of the November – December 2008 mission, outstanding payments for the
supplies were withheld. DENR formed a focus group to evaluate the alleged non-conformity and,
in consultation with the Bank, instituted corrective actions with regard to equipment with
technical issues, including provision of weighing scales, replacement hoses and refrigerant
cylinders. Two of the three suppliers complied and provided the additional equipment to grantees.
These companies were subsequently compensated for outstanding vouchers. One supplier denied
responsibility. A court case could not be brought against the company as DENR did not have at
its disposal funds to cover the legal fees and such fees were not eligible under the Project Grant
Agreement. Instead, the supplier was blacklisted and will not be able to participate in future
DENR procurements until it complies with the corrective measures issued by DENR.

Establishment of a CFC Reclamation Facility
The operational design of the CFC reclamation facility was developed through consultation with
a Swedish International Development Agency consultant and the Philippine Association of
Refrigerant Importers, Inc. (PARII), supported by the Swedish bilateral grant. Although a
Memorandum of Agreement was signed between DENR and PARII in May 2005, PARII later
withdrew based on growing concerns regarding the facility’s technical and financial viability, as
most of the refrigerants that could be reclaimed from MAC service shops were mixed and could
not be reused, obviating the need for reclamation. After considering alternative models, DENR
commissioned the collection, transport and storage of recovered refrigerants from service shops

                                                15
and chiller facilities, with a view to possibly securing a future ODS disposal project. The facility,
established in September 2010 and operated by Delsa Chemicals, is equipped with a refrigerant
recycling machine, weighing scale, refrigerant identifiers, vacuum pump, and storage tanks.
The structural readjustment made to the conceptual design of the CFC Reclamation Facility
component of the NCPP therefore also fell short of its goal to reclaim recovered CFCs for re-use
to ensure availability of CFCs to support the servicing needs of existing RAC/MAC and chiller
equipment. By Project closure, only 7.4 metric tons of ODS and other refrigerants had been
collected from the National Capital Region alone, much of the collected materials being HCFC-
22 and HFC-134a, which Delsa expects will be able to sustain the facility through income earned
from resale of recycled HCFC-22 and HFC-134a. The low level of CFCs collected reflects the
small amounts of the refrigerant being recovered from the service shops and signals more broadly
that by the time it became operational, the levels of CFC still circulating in the economy were
negligible, a reflection that was corroborated by several service shops visited by the ICR mission.

Phase out of CFC-using Metered-dose Inhalers
The small TA Component for the Phase out of CFC-using Metered-dose Inhalers under the NCPP
was implemented successfully and smoothly due to a dedicated implementing agency, the Bureau
of Food and Drug of the Department of Health, and its effective cooperation with the DENR and
other stakeholders.

The Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP)
During Phase 2, the ISP supported the introduction of important policy initiatives in support of
the NCPP as discussed in Annex 2. It was also active in working to educate the country’s industry
sectors and the general public about ozone protection and related Government policy. These
efforts could not have been achieved without fostering inter-agency cooperation and raising the
profile and relevance of the ozone issue within the national context, both of which the ISP
promoted.
Key issues emerging in Phase 2 ISP implementation included, as in Phase 1, frequent changes in
DENR leadership and the POD staff, which impacted POD operations, as well as cases of
misguided financial management practices, including ineligible cash advances. The latter issue
was resolved when Government refunded these to the Bank as a condition for the third Closing
Date extension. Another issue was the presence in the local market of unregistered / illegally
imported CFCs as well as fake refrigerants, which undermined the effectiveness of ISP-supported
regulations on CFC consumption. This issue required stronger enforcement efforts, supported by
national oversight agencies, but such support was not always forthcoming. Lastly, while the POD
Program Manager is a DENR staff member, all other POD staff have been, and continue to be,
contractors funded through the ISP, which raises concerns regarding the long-term sustainability
of ODS related efforts in the absence of MLF project funding. The Government has indicated
that, while it will continue to implement the ISP through a POD staffed with consultants as long
as funding is available from the MLF to do so, it is planning to allocate two positions to handle
ODS related matters within the Chemicals Management Section of the EMB.

The Methyl Bromide Phase-out Sub-project
The Methyl Bromide Phase-out Sub-project initially suffered from some implementation
performance issues concerning staffing of the PMU and work plan development, which were
principally attributed to the limited experience in the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA) in
implementing foreign-assisted projects and were eventually resolved, following which the pace of
implementation progressed and the intended component outcome was achieved. Generally,
implementation of this Component was aided by good inter-institutional cooperation, in particular

                                                 16
among DENR, FPA and the Bureau of Customs, all of which acted according to their well-
defined and mutually exclusive technical roles.

The 2010 and 2011 Extension Requests
In June 2010, the Bank agreed to a DENR request to extend the Project’s Closing Date by one
year to June 30, 2011 to “complete some activities that will ensure sustainability of the project
gains and efforts?. Against a background of unsatisfactory financial management and the history
of poor voucher system execution, the Bank first hesitated to grant this extension but then agreed
when the Government agreed to refunding ineligible cash advances of PhP 1.4 million by
September 2010, took concrete actions to resolve the issue of faulty equipment delivery, and
formally accepted and issued a management response to the 15%-audit. The extension was to
allow DENR to fulfill the 15%-audit conditions, commission the 85%-audit; ensure that DENR
regional offices continuously monitor the voucher grantees, including retrieval of unused of
servicing equipment and identification of missing/closed shops; maintain accounting records and
ensure adequacy of accounting staff; and strengthen internal controls on fiduciary matters. In
retrospect very few of these actions were carried out during the extra year of implementation, as
witnessed by the request for an additional six-month extension in 2011. On this latter point, the
Bank’s refusal of a further extension request beyond 2011 was appropriate.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design: In Phase I, responsibility for the overall monitoring of the Project’s achievements
in attaining its ODS phase-out targets lay with DENR. As per MLF practice, progress towards the
GEO was to be gauged through (i) enterprise-level phase-out through sub-projects, and (ii)
monitoring of CFC imports recorded by the Bureau of Customs and provided to DENR. Both sets
of data were well established and readily available. Monitoring included preparation of semi-
annual Project progress reports for submission to the Bank, including a review of implementation
progress and audit reports prepared by LBP, covering grant disbursements and progress of
implementation of sub-projects.
With the advent of Phase 2, broad M&E requirements outlined in the NCPP Project document
called for tracking changes in ODS consumption (e.g., amount of imports, number of importers,
import quotas levied, inventory stocks, uses and distribution), as well as audits of safety and
technical aspects for all projects undertaken under the plan. These requirements were spelled out
in the Project’s logical framework, but the only formal M&E framework appears to have been
that associated with the performance-based nature of the Project, spelled out in the agreement
signed with the MLF ExCom. Monitoring was a quarterly requirement, as spelled out in the OPG.
Responsibility for the monitoring of the NCPP rested with the PMU housed in DENR.
Monitoring of results and effectiveness of the ISP and other individual sub-projects remained
with the POD.
A key missing element in the Project’s M&E arrangements was the lack of a system to track the
application of good management practices by voucher grantee service shops and of equipment
supplied by suppliers was not put in place.
M&E Implementation: The data collected through calculation of enterprise-level phase-out
achieved in sub-projects, as well as CFC imports recorded by the Bureau of Customs, allowed the
government to meet its reporting obligations under Article 7 of the MP, which in turn allowed the
MP to assess the Philippines’ compliance status. In addition and, in line with MLF guidelines,
this data was also used for preparation and submission of project completion reports for Phase 1
projects and, eventually, the annual verification reports required under the NCPP agreement



                                               17
signed with the MLF ExCom. Appropriate consumption data was collected on an annual basis to
satisfy these requirements.
In contrast however, sub-project level data under Phase 2, specifically in the servicing sector,
were not collected in a standardized manner or on the quarterly basis called for in the OPG. While
broad quantitative data on the number of vouchers that had been issued were tracked, data
collected on critical sub-project aspects, including training, verification of use of good
management practices in servicing and equipment being supplied were ad hoc. The failure to
apply a structured monitoring system and the lack of rigor in terms of data collection impeded the
Project management’s ability to track overall results, which in turn contributed to DENR losing
effective management control over the voucher program.
M&E Utilization: Appropriate data were submitted in project completion reports (PCRs) as
required by the MLF in Phase I. PCRs were prepared for all sub-projects completed or cancelled
and presented comprehensive details on equipment procured by enterprises, grants payments
received and financing provided by enterprises, confirmation of ODS and alternatives consumed,
actual production post- conversion, cost effectiveness thresholds achieved, ODS equipment
disposed of, and issuance of certificates related to safety, health, and environmental impact.
With the introduction of the NCPP, macro-level data collected was included in annual ODS
consumption phase-out reports that were audited by a third party as per the Project’s ExCom
Agreement. Verification reports prepared post-audit confirmed the Philippines’ compliance with
the annual reduction targets agreed upon with the MLF ExCom.
At the sub-project level however, it was not until the discovery of suspicions of non-conformity
with the voucher system in 2008 initiated a third party audit, that concrete recommendations were
made to apply strict monitoring conditions at the central, regional and service shop levels in order
to allow for the collection of standardized data. In 2009, an M&E framework was developed for
the servicing sector’s voucher system. DENR committed to enhancing the tracking system to
facilitate analysis at the national level and to avoid future discrepancies between regional and
national level data, and national and regional DENR ODS officers were trained in data collection
and capture. DENR regional offices also committed to embarking on regular monitoring of
voucher recipients in order to retrieve unused equipment, regulate bad practices (e.g., venting of
refrigerants to the atmosphere), and facilitate collection of recovered refrigerants. However,
regular data collection and the periodic monitoring of changes in the behavior and practices of
service technicians and service shops was never carried out, ostensibly hampered by heavy
workloads, as reported by the PMU. And, while DENR had also committed to completing the
monitoring of the 85% voucher grantees that had not been included in the survey so as to
effectively address the system’s problems across the full spectrum, by Project closure this too
remained incomplete.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Environmental Safeguards
The MOD stated that the overall Project objective was to protect the environment by reducing
ODS emissions of ozone layer damaging substances and as such, no adverse environmental
impacts were expected. As per MP MLF guidelines, only mature and proven technologies could
be used. The MOD noted however, that the conversion to non-ODS technologies or substitution
of ODS with other chemicals could involve other environmental risks, such as inadvertent
releases of substitute chemicals to the atmosphere, in particular hydrocarbons, and water pollution
resulting from the use of aqueous base solvents. Countermeasures to address such risks were to be
included in each sub-project proposal and verified prior to issuance of Environmental Compliance
Certificates (ECC) which, under Philippine law, each participating enterprise would be required

                                                18
to obtain. The LBP, in its appraisal of sub-projects, was tasked with ensuring that each sub-
project had the required ECC. In late 1999, the World Bank Environmental Assessment Policy
began to apply to the Project and the Project was classified as Category C.
To the extent the ICR team could determine, there were no issues during the implementation of
the first phase, as suggested by the “highly satisfactory? rating of the Project in the Project Status
reports (PSRs) where such rating was provided.
The amended GA for Phase 2 of the Project included the requirement that investment and
voucher sub-projects be implemented in accordance with sound environmental and ecological
standards. An overall environmental assessment for the Project was not carried out during Phase
2 preparation, but the Project OPG required that for each investment sub-project an
environmental assessment be carried out. Under the Methyl Bromide (MB) Phase-out sub-project,
obsolete MB storage facilities were required to be registered by DENR as hazardous waste
storage sites. Finally, good environmental housekeeping was one of the eligibility criteria for
service shops to receive grants under the voucher program.
During Phase 2 implementation, the environmental requirements were met satisfactorily.
Specifically, investment sub-projects prepared satisfactory EAs and EMPs, and the MB storage
facilities obtained hazardous wastes handling permits from the DENR. The DENR monitored the
implementation of the EMPs on a regular basis. Proper pollution control management systems,
personal protection equipment and air quality monitoring devices were operated as well. In
awarding vouchers DENR ensured that the service shops complied with environmental
requirements. The reclamation facility obtained the required safety certificate.
The Bank verified environmental safeguards compliance. However, it would have been helpful if
mission aide memoires, the project status reports and, later implementation status reports had
offered justification for the “highly satisfactory? rating during most of the implementation period.

Fiduciary Safeguards
Financial Management. The maintenance of acceptable Financial Management (FM)
requirements for the ODS Project were, for the most part during Phase 2, rated as unsatisfactory,
primarily because of delays in submitting reports, inadequate or incorrect FM supporting
documentation and non-resolution of outstanding issues (e.g., voucher system, long outstanding
supplier obligations). Such issues were a constant point of discussion between the Bank and
DENR’s FM unit throughout the Project. While DENR attempted to correct the deficiencies and
weaknesses, the lack of resolution would seem to reflect a culture of inadequate financial
accountability.
An evaluation of DENR-EMB's FM system showed a significant need to strengthen its system of
internal control and reporting which has not substantially changed before, during and after Project
implementation as shown by: i) delays in report submission; ii) delay in the reconciliation
between general ledger and subsidiary ledger accounts; iii) absence of regular reconciliation
between the physical count and the subsidiary ledger with the general ledger balance; iv)
existence of operating policies and procedures covered by the Manuals and administrative orders,
but lacking strict enforced by Management; v) lack of resolution of operational issues that have
FM implications; vi) delayed liquidation of advances to LBP and ix) inability to produce accurate,
regular and timely reports on the financial status of the Project. 11

 There is disagreement between DENR and the Bank on these issues. See table with “DENR’s Specific Comments? in
Annex 7.

Procurement
Project Status Reports (PSRs) produced during Phase 1, and a post review in early 2002 focusing
on the Institutional Strengthening Project Component, did not raise any issues.
A procurement assessment for Phase 2 carried out in late 2002 as part of NCPP preparation found
an overall risk rating of high because more than 70% of the amended grant amount would be
implemented by enterprises using commercial practices. The PSR stated that the risk would be
mitigated by close supervision and monitoring of PMU-POD and LBP as well as the various
levels of reviews and audits that would be periodically conducted. A procurement supervision
and post review carried out in mid-2004 of the Type II Subproject Voucher System and the NCPP
Component considered the performance to date satisfactory. However, a similar review in
February – March 2005 found significant non-completion and/or long delays in procurement-
related actions that DENR needed to do. Notably, DENR kept on revising the procedures for the
Voucher system without prior approval of the Bank, failed to update the Procurement Plan or the
OPG to show changes, and did not obtain the Bank’s clearance for changes in the OPG.
Consequently, the procurement rating was reduced from satisfactory to moderately unsatisfactory.
Procurement performance continued to be moderately unsatisfactory almost throughout the
remaining implementation period 12 due to significant problems in the implementation of the
Voucher System, including questions about service shop eligibility and the appearance of non-
compliance of procured equipment with the technical specifications, and the delay in the
equipment procurement for the Recovery Facility.
In hindsight, the Voucher System was new to DENR and contained procurement processes that
were new and deviated from normal procedures prescribed under the Bank’s Guidelines, as well
as the government’s Procurement Law. DENR staff may have been very careful and somewhat
risk averse on account of the passage of a new Procurement Law in 2003, that provided for a six
years imprisonment for offenders. For future projects similar to the voucher system, more
intensive technical assistance at the beginning of implementation by experts of such schemes, in
particular its procurement aspects, would likely build confidence and mitigate implementation
risks.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
Manufacturing: The investment sub-projects undertaken during both Project phases allowed for
the successful uptake of alternative technologies and rendered existing CFC-using equipment
unusable, as per MLF requirements, thereby eliminating the need for any follow-on operations.
Servicing: A follow-on phase is not required, given that the servicing sector, in response to the
situation in the market which has been influenced by policies and regulations adopted during the
Project’s implementation, has transitioned to the use of non-CFC alternatives. Indeed, spot site
visits to service shops conducted during the ICR mission indicated that in the last year of the
Project’s implementation, very little to no CFCs were being recovered.
ISP: With the closing of the umbrella ODS Phase-out project, on June 30, 2011, the Government
expressed concern regarding the continuity of its ongoing ODS phase-out program, which now
includes addressing the phase-out of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). It therefore requested
assistance from the Bank in ensuring a smooth transition of the ISP to another of the MLF’s
implementing agencies, including transfer of remaining funds under the current (7th) renewal.
While the ICR was being prepared, the World Bank processed the transfer of remaining funds to

  Some improvements in the EMB procurement system were observed in late 2008 prompting an upgrade to
“moderately satisfactory?; however, the rating was reduced again a year later.

                                                20
the United National Environment Program (UNEP), as requested by DENR, pending evaluation
of all Project accounts. At the behest of the Government, and following discussion between
DENR and UNEP, at the 64th meeting of the ExCom in July 2011, the Bank informed the ExCom
and the ExCom accepted that the 8th renewal of the ISP should be approved against UNEP's work
program given the closure of the ODS Project.
Country Level: Based on experience gained and lessons learned during implementation of the
ODS Phase-out Project, the Bank has assisted DENR in preparing a strategic program for the
phase-out of HCFCs. Specific sector activities within the HCFC Phase-out Management Plan
strategy that has been designed will be developed and implemented by other implementing
agencies of the MLF including UNDP, UNIDO and UNEP.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The Project’s objectives, and its results, are of overall relevance to a number of current country-
level and global environmental priorities. The Bank’s current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS),
through its fourth strategic objective, supports sustainably managing the environment to
safeguard livelihoods. The Project has generated important lessons learned in terms of managing
and sustaining ODS phase-out that will prove invaluable as the Philippines addresses the next set
of control measures under the Protocol, namely the phase-out of HCFC. The experience gained in
tackling ODS phase-out to date has established important foundations for strategic planning and
ongoing multi-stakeholder cooperation as the country prepares to begin the phase-out of HCFCs
in use in the manufacturing and servicing sectors where again, the sustainability of phase-out will
rely on the lessons generated during the years of CFC phase-out, including the importance of
instituting appropriate policy and regulatory measures, putting in place effective monitoring and
enforcement mechanisms, and making available best available technologies and technological
advice to support sustainable phase-out. The Project outcomes were also of high overall relevance
with respect to ozone-climate co-benefits, generating important greenhouse gas emission
reductions as an indirect benefit of CFC phase-out (see section 3.5.c).
The Project has also demonstrated high overall relevance to another of the CAS objectives: weak
governance. As the CAS highlights, this has long been recognized as a key constraint to sustained
growth and poverty reduction in the Philippines. Management and institutionalization issues
encountered during implementation of the ISP and NCPP components serve to underline some of
the endemic governance issues that will need to be faced and effectively addressed in future, if
the Government seeks sustainability of its future phase-out efforts under the MP and more
broadly, of its global environmental obligations.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives
Phase 1:
Under Phase 1, the GEO was mostly achieved. Phase I sub-project activities, which targeted the
phase-out of 800 ODP T, allowed the Philippines to phase-out a total of 850.2 ODP T. The
Project introduced appropriate technology measures [GEO, Part (a)]. The appropriateness of the
technological alternatives proposed for adoption was discussed with each enterprise and reviewed
and approved, on a sub-project by sub-project basis, by an independent technical expert, as
required by the rules and regulations of the MLF. A total of twelve cost-effective, priority
investment sub-projects identified during Project design, achieved successful conversion to the
use of non-CFC-using technologies in a variety of the country’s manufacturing sectors (Annex 2
Table A2.1) [GEO, Part (c)].


                                                21
Where the Project was less successful was with respect to institutional strengthening of
responsible government entities, as evidenced by under-staffing and staffing changes, reliance on
contractual staff, and a lower than desirable level of staff capacity, which resulted in
administrative and financial mismanagement issues during Phase I implementation. This points to
a lower than intended level of institutionalization and commitment on the part of the Government
[GEO, Part (b)]. On the other hand, the Philippines Ozone Desk and inter-agency coordination
mechanisms that were established during Phase 1 achieved some of the key regulatory and policy
measures which paved the way for the ODS phase-out during Phase 2. Therefore, this part of the
Phase 1 GEO may be rated moderately satisfactory.
Phase 2:
The revised GEO was also broadly achieved during Phase 2; however, only part of the phase-out
achieved may be attributed to the Project’s implementation. Analysis of Project outputs versus
outcomes (see Table A2.1 in Annex 2) indicates that the Project output contribution was uneven
and limited in its key components.
Best available, appropriate technology measures [revised GEO, Part (a)] continued to be provided
in the manufacturing sector, though the number of investment sub-project implemented was much
lower than had been projected at the time of project design, due largely to the influence of
external market forces. Appropriate technology measures were also introduced in the servicing
sector however, a series of surveys conducted during project implementation showed that the
technology introduced, though technologically appropriate, was not, to any real extent, effectively
adopted and used by beneficiaries. The Project’s success is therefore considered moderately
unsatisfactory for this GEO component.
With regard to institutional strengthening [revised GEO, Part (b)], the Project’s success was less
than satisfactory. Despite seven ISP renewals, DENR capacity to manage a complex national
ozone management process remains moderately unsatisfactory, as illustrated by the
implementation difficulties encountered in the largest sub-component of the Project, support to
the RAC/MAC servicing sector. Staff capacity for ODS management has not been
institutionalized and remains heavily dependent on outside funding, calling into question the
enforceability and sustainability of such efforts into the future, particularly if outside funding
should no longer be available. (It is worthwhile noting however, that the Philippines is not alone
in this respect because across the MP spectrum, all Article 5 Party governments continue to rely
on institutional strengthening funds to support their ODS management activities.)
With regard to the implementation of specific cost-effective investments to reduce ODS
consumption [revised GEO, Part (c)] in the manufacturing sector, where 25% of the remaining
total consumption targeted resided, of 487 ODP T projected for phase-out, a 280 ODP T (57%)
reduction was achieved through implementation of Project activities. This is due to the fact that
the Project supported only six of the originally planned 32 enterprises to convert to non-ODS
technologies, as detailed in Annex 2 Table A2.1. Certain external factors, notably the reduction in
the supply of CFCs available in the market and technology advances drove a number of
enterprises to phase out on their own, thereby contributing to the reduction of CFC consumption,
as witnessed by the low number of investment sub-projects implemented under the auspices of
the NCPP. Here too, Project outcomes are considered as moderately unsatisfactory.
In the National CFC Phase-out Plan servicing sector component [revised GEO, Part (d)], where
75% of the remaining total consumption targeted was in use, external factors, much more than
Project outputs, which were not all successfully completed (Annex 2 Table A2.1), were to a large




                                                22
extent responsible for the successful phase-out. Of the more than 1,500 ODP T consumption13
that was to be addressed through implementation of the voucher system, attribution of phase-out
outcomes to Project outputs is inconclusive at best, as witnessed by the uneven application of
good practices and limited use of servicing tools and equipment that was noted during the 2008
                               14
MTR and external 15%-audit. Indeed, as early as 2005, when the voucher system remained
non-functional, the Philippines had already reached compliance with that year’s MP requirement,
having reduced its consumption by 50% relative to the 2001 level. Furthermore, ODS
consumption reductions continued even after the voucher system was put on hold, and complete
ODS reduction was achieved even though only 52% of the country’s MAC/RAC service shops
were trained and received equipment (Table A2.2, Annex 2). In the face of the delays experienced
in the servicing sector voucher system, it seems clear that regulatory actions and the external
factors noted above were driving reductions in demand for virgin CFCs. The overall rating for
outcomes achieved in the servicing sector is therefore unsatisfactory.
On the policy front, national regulatory measures introduced to comply with the MP measures
[revised GEO, Part (d)], including the import quota system, a licensing scheme, and taxes that
changed the relative price of CFCs and substitutes, as well as a regulation governing the transition
away from the import of CFC-using MDIs in the health sector, contributed in important ways to
encouraging transition away from CFC use. Success in enforcement however, was uneven. It was
achieved in collaboration with the Land Transportation Office in the MAC sector, through
institution of a focused roadside inspection program. The seizure of some illegal imports by the
Bureau of Customs speaks to the enhanced inter-agency collaboration initiated by DENR;
however, the prevalence of illegal CFCs in the market, as noted in the MTR mission of 2008,
underscores the fact that the overall effectiveness of the import ban on CFCs was compromised
by lack of effective monitoring and enforcement. In terms of the application of the Code of Good
Practices for service technicians, training efforts fell short and enforcement was lacking.
Contrasted with the initial target of 5,000 compliant service shops, a PMU assessment showed
that among 228 beneficiary service shops surveyed (of a total of 2,580 beneficiary shops) at best
69.1% complied (self-reported). Assuming representativeness of the survey sample, this
corresponds to about 1,783 beneficiary service shops. In other words, only about 35% of the
5,000 service shops in the country actually implemented the Code (Annex 2 Table A2.1). This
figure is corroborated by the findings of the 15%-audit among beneficiary shops (below).15
The paradox witnessed within the Project, where phase-out was achieved in an accelerated
manner attributable to regulatory and external factors, while funded investment activities
advanced more slowly than projected and disbursements lagged, is not unique to the Philippines
or to Bank-implemented MP projects, and was noted in an evaluation of national phase-out plans
conducted by the Senior Monitoring and Evaluation Office of the MLF in 2005.
Through implementation of the MB strategy sub-project, the Government was successful in
eliminating 9 ODP T consumption of Annex E substances that had been used to fumigate stored
products, flour mills, mill structures and soil. This phase-out was achieved well in advance of the
official MB 100% control measures of the MP of 1 January 2015.




13
   1,531 ODP tons = 934 ODP tons in the MAC sector + 597 ODP tons in the RAC sector
14
   The 85%-audit, had it been completed, would have provided, together with the 15%-audit, a complete picture of the
practices applied by all 2,580 voucher recipients. However, 15% is a sizeable sample of 2,580, which would yield
statistically significant results at a 95% level of confidence with a margin of error of slightly less than +/- 5%.
15
   In 2005, the World Bank and DENR agreed to reduce the target number of service shops to 3,030, as the per service
shop subsidy level was increased and total available funds would not be sufficient to cover 5,000 shops. Applying the
ratio of shops implementing the Code to this revised target yields 59%.

                                                        23
3.3 Efficiency
Consistent with the MLF ExCom project approval regime, efficiency is assessed based on the
cost-effectiveness (CE) of the phase-out achieved. CE is the amount of MLF grant per unit weight
of ODS phased-out in ODP kg. CE values at approval and at Project closure are presented below.
For details refer to Annex 3.
During Phase I, the Project worked with eligible enterprises to agree on the most-cost effective
means to achieve sustainable reduction of ODP per unit of funds expended. CE thresholds varied
by manufacturing sub-sector and were approved on a sub-project by sub-project basis. The
average CE of 16 sub-projects during Phase 1 at approval was $18.43/ODP kg. Actual CE
achieved across the 12 manufacturing sub-projects was $12.29/ODP kg. In other words, Phase 1
achieved better cost effectiveness than required by the MLF.
With the advent of Phase 2, the manner in which CE was calculated was changed to reflect the
requirements of a more flexible national phase-out approach to achieve aggregate reductions in
consumption of ODS. An average CE value of $6.64/ODP kg was negotiated by the Bank for the
NCPP as a whole, based on historical CE averages in the region. Based on the fact that the
Philippines achieved the phase-out total of 2,017.49 ODP T projected in the NCPP, and taking
into consideration the total amount of funds disbursed, one might conclude that the overall CE for
Phase 2 is $4.28/ODP kg, indicating that it achieved better efficiency than that projected.
However, as indicated by the output-outcome analysis in Annex 2, and further elaborated in
section 3.2, only a portion of this ODS reduction may be attributed to the Project’s sub-projects
and policy/regulatory measures, while external factors, notably global reduction in CFC supply
played a large role. While precise quantitative attribution is impossible, conservative estimations
were made based on evidence provided by the 15%-survey. As detailed in Annex 3, in the
servicing sector phase-out of 790 ODP T may be attributed to the Project. This coupled with the
280 ODP T phase-out that were achieved in the manufacturing sector, yields a total of 1,069.99
ODP T and a CE ratio of $8.06 / ODP T, which exceeds the negotiated CE of $6.64/ODP kg. This
conservative estimate is preferred over less favorable estimates presented in Annex 3, in order to
account for the impact that Project-supported policy measures, notably the 1999 import licensing
and quota system gradually restricting the amount of virgin CFCs that could be imported, had on
the phase-out.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
It is challenging to determine an overall outcome rating for a project that spanned over 17 years,
and contained two distinct operations, which had similar funding levels but differed in
performance. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that the Project was part of a global
initiative, from which it was strongly influenced. It should be underlined that the Philippines did
achieve the objectives assigned to the Project and the Project did contribute to this achievement.
However, this contribution was limited and the outcomes could have been achieved at a
significantly lower cost during Phase 2. Given the performance of Phase 1, the MU rating should
be considered borderline rather than a strong MU.
The Project’s concept and design were, and remained, relevant to the Philippines’ CFC phase-out
obligations as a signatory to the MP, as well as the Bank’s CAS, as the country prepares to phase-
out HCFCs. Phase 2 implementation experienced serious problems. Not only did it not deliver all
the planned output, but it also was not responsive to evolving and emerging global changes or to
the changing circumstances these brought about in various sectors in the country. Ultimately, the



                                                24
Project failed to innovate itself, which reduced significantly the relevance of its results to the
country’s achievements of MP phase-out objectives.
ODS phase-out objectives were, overall, supported principally through the introduction of
appropriate, cost-effective technology measures, particularly during Phase I. During Phase 2, only
a portion of the outcomes achieved may be attributed to the Project’s direct outputs, due to weak
attribution factors, and an important supporting role played by external global drivers. While
similar amounts of funding were disbursed during both Phases of the Project, the deficit of results
that may be directly attributable to Project investments during Phase II points to the fact that the
Project’s overall cost effectiveness is likely significantly less favorable than it appears and could
very possibly have been achieved at a lower per unit cost.
Also important to consider is the fact that while the Project did support the adoption of key policy
measures, enforcement has remained patchy. In addition, the Project achieved less than
satisfactory results in supporting effective institutional strengthening of responsible government
entities, most noticeable in the lack of management exhibited with respect to the RAC/MAC
servicing sector sub-component, which underlined institutional weaknesses in managing complex
projects.
Based on these factors, the overall outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Not applicable.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The national ozone management function has not been fully institutionalized within DENR, and
remains reliant on ISP funding for its operation, despite the ongoing need for individuals
knowledgeable in the objectives and workings of the MP to be mainstreamed into the
Government as the country prepares to address HCFC phase-out.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
Indirect global environmental benefits: The phase-out of CFCs contributed significant additional
global environmental benefits through reduction of global warming potential (GWP). Estimated
GWP impact achieved in the context of the ODS Phase-out Project’s implementation, based on
total consumption phase-out targets approved by substance (2,892 ODP T), is 29.3 million tons
CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The GWP of the relevant CFCs and CO2e calculations are presented in
Annex 3.

Constructive engagement of the private sector: Particularly during the design phase and
implementation of Phase I, the Project actively invited the engagement of the private sector,
which resulted in Phase I going beyond the ODS reductions that had originally been projected at
the Project’s outset. Based on the relationship established by the Project, DENR was able to use
this public-private partnership model to actively and successfully promote such partnerships in
other national environmental projects.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
The risk to development outcomes is rated as moderate. Positive aspects include that:
a. All the ODS investment sub-projects resulted in the conversion of ODS to non-ODS substances
and destruction of former ODS-using equipment was verified;
b. The global supply of CFCs has been exhausted. China and India, the main regional producers,
as well as other producing countries, have ceased their CFC production;
c. RAC/MAC units prevalent in the Philippines now largely use non-CFC chemicals, therefore
the demand for CFCs in the servicing sector has diminished significantly;
d. Appropriate legislation and regulatory controls were enacted by the Government.
On the other hand,
e. Enforcement of some activities key to ensuring effectiveness of regulations has been shown to
be weak including, for example, the adoption rate of good management practices in RAC/MAC
servicing shops, the result of which could include ongoing venting of ODS substances;
f. The noted prevalence of illegal CFCs in the market during the Project’s implementation calls
into question the overall effectiveness of the import ban on ODS and raises concerns regarding
the continued use of controlled substances in the market; and
g. High staff turnover in the Philippines Ozone Desk due to low levels of institutionalization
endangers skills retention and transfer of knowledge and lessons learned from this Project to the
next phase of ozone interventions (notably HCFC phase-out).

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Quality at entry at both Phases 1 and 2 was guided by operational criteria and guidance
established by the MLF ExCom. Technical and financial criteria requirements were accurately
followed. Given the conceptual and structural differences, quality at entry is assessed at Phase 1
and again at Phase 2.
Phase I:
Quality of entry at Phase 1 is rated Moderately Satisfactory. From Project identification to
appraisal, the Bank relied on a team that possessed the relevant experience on the Montreal
Protocol, technological innovations with respect to ozone layer protection, policy and technical
criteria and guidelines of the Protocol’s MLF, Bank operations and financial management. The
team worked well with stakeholders, including DENR and LBP, as well as with enterprises
throughout the preparation, appraisal and implementation of sub-projects.
In hindsight, given the Bank’s policy of national execution, the complexities associated with
Bank operations, and their application with respect to the Project’s umbrella grant/sub-project
design, Phase 1 implementation might have benefited from a more in-depth appraisal of
institutional capacity, especially with regards to fiduciary management. Indeed, the Bank-internal
FY00-01 Quality of Supervision of Risky Projects assessment questioned whether problems
encountered during implementation of Phase I could have been identified at entry. As stated

                                               26
earlier, it would appear that the fiduciary management problems appear to be part of broader
governance issue, which is difficult to address through individual Project interventions.
Phase 2:
Quality at entry for this phase is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory. Here again, the Bank relied on
a team of experts skilled in MP policies and MLF and Bank operations. From a design
perspective, the Project followed the MLF policy and technical guidance and embraced the
opportunities presented by the adoption of a national phase-out plan. The team worked closely
with the client and made an effort to enhance fiduciary management capacity.
However, more attention should have been given to the institutional requirements for the
management of the RAC/MAC servicing sector support sub-component which involved
thousands of small and micro-size servicing shops scattered around the country. For example, the
team could have considered involving regional offices of the DENR Environmental Management
Bureau from the beginning and allocating sufficient resources for adequate management. Most
importantly, the team should have guided the client in putting in place a robust M&E system for
this component. Although at the time the voucher system was being prepared no lessons were
available from other countries that were implementing such a system, M&E was a key part of
World Bank operations and therefore should have figured more prominently in the Project’s
design.
In hindsight, Phase 2 of the Project should have been treated as a new and separate operation,
rather than as an extension of the existing Project. Had this been done, a more thorough internal
review process of Phase I results would have been undertaken, which could have helped the team
learn more effectively from the Phase 1 issues encountered and, equally as importantly, Phase 2
would have undergone a full appraisal as a separate project, a process during which certain future
implementation issues may have been pre-identified and addressed.
The Bank’s overall performance to ensure quality at entry is therefore rated as Moderately
Unsatisfactory.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Throughout Project implementation, the Bank team provided Government counterparts consistent,
timely and best available policy and technical advice as well as guidance on fiduciary
management through regular, bi-annual supervision missions, as evidenced by thorough aide
memoires. Following the launch of Phase 2, supervision was decentralized to the country office in
2004, thereby providing the client greater access to the Bank’s Project team and vice versa.
Further, as the Bank technical experts also worked on similar projects, this permitted the Bank to
bring experiences from the East Asia and Pacific region, as well as others, to the table in order to
inform planning and implementation of the Project components. However, the Bank’s
performance could have been better in the following aspects:
During Phase 1 implementation, the Bank might have been more proactive in reflecting fiduciary
management issues in the implementation progress (IP) ratings and raising them with national
oversight agencies. In this respect, it was unfortunate that this MP funded Project, like other trust
fund operations, was included in the joint portfolio reviews with the Government only from 2001.
During Phase 2, Project ratings for implementation progress (IP) and for GEO achievement failed
to reflect the problems on the ground possibly precluding more proactive World Bank
Management action in cooperation with Government oversight agencies. IP ratings also failed to
mirror fiduciary mismanagement issues, the Project’s failure to produce intended outputs in its
largest component, and the implementing agency’s liberal interpretation of MLF policies and

                                                 27
procedures that governed the Project in revising Project components, related not only to
technology appropriateness but also to cost-effectiveness of phase-out, as discussed in detailed in
section 2.2. IP ratings remained solidly “S? until early 2008 when, following the unearthing of
significant problems in the voucher system the rating was downgraded, but only to “moderately
satisfactory?. Given the magnitude of the issue leading to the stopping of the voucher system, the
IP should have been rated “moderately unsatisfactory? (MU) at best. Even well before this point
though, risk signals were not properly reflected in IP ratings. For example, one case of fiduciary
mismanagement noted in early 2005, which resulted in the procurement rating being downgraded
to “MU?, did not register in the IP rating, which remained “S?. Progress towards GEO
achievement also kept being rated “satisfactory? (S) despite the weak link between Project
outputs and outcomes and resulting low attributability and possible cost effectiveness issues.
Restructuring of the Project, using the flexibility inherent within NCPP, to improve outputs
and/or enhance the sustainability of the outcomes through for example, strengthening DENR
enforcement capacity, expanding the scope of training in good practices to all technicians, was
not considered. In general, the Bank could have been more proactive in engaging national
agencies to resolve the problems that the Project faced.
The Bank’s decision to put the voucher system on hold upon discovery of serious problems and to
request an audit of the system was adequate, as was its insistence, albeit somewhat delayed, that a
robust monitoring system be put in place and third party audits be carried out. The 2010 extension
of the closing date was logical as it was intended to rectify the problems with the equipment
supplied and reclaim equipment from ineligible voucher grantees, all which would have
supported the GEO. Perhaps the Bank could have gone one step further and agreed with the client
on a restructuring of the Project by allocating savings from the investment components to a
strategic work plan aimed at enhancing monitoring and enforcement.
In 2010, due to a change in Project task team leadership, the Bank’s supervision was less
consistent then it had been resulting in delayed provision of the no-objection for the selection of
consultants for the 85% audit. More importantly, the Bank might have suggested early on in the
discussions on the 85%-audit that a larger budget to the 85%-audit would attract a larger pool of
suitable independent consultants, and insisted that a third-party audit, rather than an assessment
by DENR, be carried out. A fraction of funds saved under Sub-component 1b or Sub-component
1c could have been used for this purpose. The Bank could have also considered commissioning
an independent audit on its own.
The Bank’s refusal to extend the Project beyond June 2011 was justified based on the
Government’s overall failure to implement agreed activities and the Project’s unsatisfactory
financial management status.
In summary, the quality of supervision over the full implementation period is considered
Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The Bank provided consistent and reliable policy and technical advice during the 17 years of the
Project’s implementation. However, a number of factors, related especially to Project supervision,
impacted the Bank’s overall performance. Of primary consideration is the persistent unrealistic IP
and GEO ratings, which, had they been better aligned, could have assisted both the client and the
Bank team to respond more effectively to challenges in Project implementation performance and
attributability. For example, a restructuring could have been proposed during Phase II when it
became evident that external factors were affecting phase-out results more so than project inputs
which had not yet been initiated, as well as to address mismanagement issues within the Project’s

                                                28
servicing sector component. Overall, the Bank failed to act proactively in response to cumulative
attribution and management issues, resulting in an overall performance rating of Moderately
Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Government performance, rated across the spectrum of the Project’s full implementation is
moderately satisfactory. Positive inter-departmental cooperation allowed the Philippines to fulfill
its commitment to phase-out consumption of ODS in accordance with the MP control schedule.
Agencies involved (see section 1.4) all played a role, some to lesser degrees, in ensuring the
adoption of a comprehensive policy framework, and supporting regulations, for ODS phase-out,
in building national capacity to comply with the objectives of a multilateral environmental
agreement, and in promoting awareness about the importance of protection of the ozone layer. On
the other hand, oversight and national agencies involved – the Department of Finance (signatory
to the GA), the National Economic Development Agency (national planning office), the
Department of Justice - Bureau of Customs, the Department of Transportation and
Communication - Land Transportation Office – took little action to strengthen the Government’s
regulatory and monitoring systems to ensure that the ODS concerns are addressed, a need that
World Bank supervision missions’ pointed out repeatedly.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
DENR: Through implementation of the ISP, DENR was successful in enabling the country to
implement the Protocol. This included ratification of all four MP amendments, the issuance of
national ODS regulation - the Chemical Control Order (CCO) – as well as amendments to support
enforcement of the CCO. DENR also introduced a licensing and import quota system, considered
within the MP community to be the single most important piece of legislation to control ODS
consumption. Such milestones were achieved by fostering inter-agency cooperation and
promoting the importance of the ozone issue from an environmental, economic and human health
perspective. DENR, through the POD, was also diligent in delivery of data reporting required
under Article 7 of the MP, and effective in educating both the public and private sectors about
ozone protection and related Government policy, based on the frequency of ozone stories in the
mass media and the level of general understanding observed across stakeholder groups reported
in ISP reports.
However, in terms of committed Project management contributing to sustainability of efforts,
performance was less positive. Over the lifetime of the Project, a number of leadership changes
were experienced within DENR including six at the Department Secretary level, five at the
Director level, and four at the Project management level. Project staff turnover was also high, and
management response to vacancies was slow. With each change, disruptions in the momentum of
Project implementation ensued, compounded by changes in management approach and Project
implementation systems and strategies.
The lack of DENR management coordination, oversight and monitoring, in particular with respect
to the voucher system, translated into an uneven application of administrative and fiduciary
responsibility, leaving the Project’s implementation open to serious financial, procurement and
technical mismanagement, all of which occurred to varying degrees during the course of the
Project, compromising its overall implementation and effectiveness. Therefore, the performance
of DENR is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                                                29
LBP: During Phase 1, LBP’s performance as financial agent, as well as manager of sub-projects,
was satisfactory, even though the ODS Project was one of the first environmental programs LBP
undertook. This rating is justified by the satisfactory sub-project cost-effectiveness, disbursement
rates and duration, as well as the initiative in developing Operating Policy Guidelines (OPG) and
mainstreaming environmental considerations into its operations through creation of an
environmental unit.
In Phase 2, LBP’s performance in its role as disbursement agent for the sub-projects, notably the
voucher system, was moderately satisfactory. While it did raise some flags which ultimately
prevented suppliers from using grant equipment as collateral, overall it did not go above and
beyond the duties prescribed in the OPG providing, for example, assistance in reviewing
vouchers issued, even when it became clear that evolving circumstances in the implementation of
the voucher scheme merited greater scrutiny. There were also instances where disbursements to
suppliers were made without cross-checking the accounting of goods purchased with the vouchers
it paid out. The 15% audit report noted that there were cases when suppliers did not submit a
Delivery Receipt or Sales Invoice to LBP despite the fact that such documents were requirements
as proof of delivery for payments to be released to suppliers, even though LBP did confirm
delivery with EMB representatives. Due diligence would have required full adherence to
disbursement procedures. Its support for the ongoing ISP and the MB Phase-out Strategy was
satisfactory.
Overall, LBP’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The overall borrower performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory, taking into
consideration and weighing Government performance with the performance ratings of both
DENR and LBP, as indicated above.

6. Lessons Learned
Project duration. The Project combined two operations in one over a 17-year period. While this
approach may have had advantages from the point of view of bureaucratic processing, it also had
disadvantages. Notably, closure of Phase 1 when the investment sub-projects were completed
would have allowed a formal valuation of the Phase 1 implementation experience which could
have contributed to Phase 2 design. Furthermore, having been designed as part of an ongoing
project rather than a self-standing new operation, Phase 2 did not benefit from a formal World
Bank appraisal, which might have uncovered some of the design weaknesses that plagued Phase 2
implementation. Furthermore, due to the long duration of the Project, the evaluation of the earlier
implementation years was significantly constrained by staff changes in the relevant Government
agencies and the Bank, and changes in the enterprises that benefitted from the Project.
Monitoring outcomes vs. outputs. A limited number of the planned Project outputs were achieved
and contributed to the achievement of the GEO during Phase 2. The Philippines was reaching the
objectives set for the Project mainly due to factors external to the Project, while a number of
planned Project outputs were either not being generated or poorly generated. Better monitoring of
outputs and their linkage with intended Project outcomes would have allowed to assess options
for a possible restructuring of the Project so as to cancel ineffective activities and channel funds
to activities that would have contributed to the sustainability of the Project.
Implementation progress monitoring. The Project demonstrated that the Bank could have better
assessed implementation progress. More accurate IP ratings reflecting shortcomings in producing
the outputs that the Project was designed to generate might have led to more attention by

                                                30
Management and accelerated their resolution. In addition, Government oversight agencies’
attention could have been drawn more proactively to the implementation issues phased by the
Project.
Voucher system design and implementation. The experience with the voucher scheme
implementation under the Project highlighted the need to make sure that financial and time costs
for service shops’ participation in the scheme are minimal, and a rigorous, adequately funded
monitoring system is in place from the very beginning to ensure that no parties in the system
engage in abuses, all eligible beneficiaries receive proper equipment and use them properly. It
will be important that DENR incorporate these lessons in the design of any new system that will
address the consumption of HCFCs in the servicing sector in the future. Furthermore, the Project
showed that lack of implementation experience, especially with the procurement aspects, leads to
risks. Provision of international technical assistance might boost national implementing agencies’
confidence and mitigate risks. In general it would be useful for MLF ExCom or MLF
implementing agencies to take stock of CFC voucher schemes implemented around the world and
develop operational guidelines on voucher scheme implementation.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
Substantive comments received from the two implementing agencies, DENR and the Land Bank
of the Philippines are reproduced in Annex 7. Below is a summary of the DENR and LBP
comments and World Bank ICR team responses.
DENR comments and responses:
       The rating of Moderately Unsatisfactory does not accurately reflect the significance of
the outcomes and outputs achieved by the project, and it is inconsistent with ratings assessed
during project implementation.
        Response: The justification for the MU rating is provided in detail in relevant parts of the
        ICR. The ICR ratings are independent of the ratings assessed during implementation and
        in fact, the latter are evaluated as part of the Bank’s performance.
     A number of Project design issues that led to implementation problems are beyond
DENR control.
        Response: Project design is as much the responsibility of DENR as it is of the World
        Bank. Page i of the Project Document, which laid out the design of Phase II and was
        submitted to the 38th Meeting of the MLF ExCom states: “This NCPP has been prepared
        by the Government of the Philippines (DENR/POD) with assistance from the World
        Bank and the Government of Sweden in a cooperative undertaking.? Joint evaluation of
        the World Bank and DENR reflects this joint responsibility.
      CFC-using enterprises originally included in the project design but phased-out on their
own without Project grant support did so due to Project supported regulations and enforcement.
        Response: The ICR recognizes the role of the CCO in encouraging CFC-using enterprises
        to phase-out these substances. However, the key CCO was already issued in 2000, under
        Phase I of the Project. Monitoring and enforcement of the CCO under Phase II
        contributed to the phase-out, although its effectiveness has been compromised by a lack
        of consistent enforcement which appears to have contributed to presence of illegal CFCs
        in the Philippine market. . The key point is that the global supply reduction of CFCs
        played a significant role in encouraging enterprises to adopt alternatives, while the


                                                31
        investment component did not contribute significantly to the phase-out achieved by the
        enterprises.
       DENR/EMB could have fully exercised its fiduciary responsibility over the project, had
cashiering and bookkeeping been centralized following the Government of the Philippines (GOP)
accounting system.
        Response: A number of financial management (FM) issues came about because the FM
        functions were handled by POD staff hired on a contractual basis and would leave the
        agency without proper notice and proper turnover of financial records. Cashiering and
        bookkeeping using the GOP FM systems would have strengthened the FM and internal
        controls as FM would have been handled by personnel with thorough experience and
        knowledge of government processes. Having said this even though FM was handled by
        the POD, DENR/EMB should have fully assumed fiduciary responsibility and ensured
        that funds were used for the intended purpose.
        The ICR should highlight the positive aspects of project implementation and downplay
the issues, which have already been resolved or corrected during project implementation.
        Response: The ICR seeks to provide a balanced evaluation of all aspects of the Project’s
        implementation. Positive aspects are highlighted, as are issues that persisted and
        impacted the achievement of the PDO. Where appropriate, the resolution of issues that
        arose during implementation is acknowledged.
       Some issues or problems encountered in the implementation of the NCPP voucher system
were more of exceptions rather than the rule and therefore should not be blown up as if it was the
general practice.
        Response: Several surveys, including those conducted or commissioned by DENR,
        including the 15%-audit documented significant irregularities in the implementation of
        the voucher system, as discussed in the ICR Annex 2. “Eight out of 2,521? is misleading,
        since the referenced visits by a World Bank supervision mission in September 2007 were
        to 14 randomly selected service shops, rather than 2,521.
      The Project, despite the implementation challenges cited, was able to achieve its target
outcomes and deliver substantially its planned outputs.
        Response: We agree on the Phase I outputs and outcomes. With regards to Phase II, ICR
        underlines that the Philippines achieved the targeted CFC phase-out, but only a limited
        amount of this may be attributed to the Project. Project outputs that contributed to these
        outcomes are acknowledged in the ICR.
      Having achieved the phase-out targets, and having successfully overcome the
implementation challenges, we strongly believe that the Project should at least be rated as
Moderately Satisfactory.
        Response: The overall rating is a combination of Moderately Satisfactory (MS) for Phase
        I and Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) for Phase II. Based on World Bank ICR
        guidelines on ratings, the lower rating takes precedence over the higher rating. This said,
        the rating is considered borderline MU.
LBP’s main comment was that its performance rating should be upgraded from Moderately
Satisfactory (MS) to Satisfactory. The ICR team considered that during Phase II the instances of
voucher payments to suppliers without Delivery Receipt or Sales Invoice, as required in the
disbursement procedures, warrant maintaining an MS rating for Phase II.

Comments from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) (received
by from Sara Stenhammar, Senior Advisor, Environmental Matters, SIDA, on February 20,
2012:“For Sweden it was a very important project since it was the first large country where the
servicing sector was addressed. The MLF had thus far not decided on support for that sector.
Perhaps it even changed the policy of MLF to support projects encompassing whole countries,
NCPPs.
Sweden had very positive experience with Phil industry that they wanted to learn and contribute.
The Code of Conduct was accepted. The Phil Government was more difficult, partly because of
frequent staff changes. However, the legislation passed was adequate.?

** Only 48.2% of these same service shops were DTI accredited and only 29.4% employed TESDA-certified technicians.

PHASE I:

Manufacturing Sector Sub-projects
Of the 16 individual investment sub-projects identified in the original Grant Agreement, a total of
14 received grant funding from the MLF to pursue phase-out activities. Two of the approved sub-
projects, establishment of a central recycling scheme in Manila and the establishment of a MAC
scheme in the Philippines, were ultimately not undertaken due to a perceived risk that the
recovery and reuse of CFCs would be undermined by the ongoing availability of unlimited
amounts of low-cost, virgin CFCs in the market. Of the 12 sub-projects implemented, a total of
850.16 ODP T of CFCs were phased-out as follows:
       Eight sub-projects were approved in the refrigeration manufacturing sector, four within
        the context of one group sub-project (the conversion of refrigerant and foam at four
        refrigeration appliance manufacturers), resulting phase-out of 395.7 ODP T.
       Of five sub-projects approved by the MLF ExCom for the solvent sector, three were
        successfully implemented resulting in phase-out of 104.6 ODP T. Two of the sub-projects
        approved were cancelled, one because the enterprise was no longer eligible for funding
        under the MLF as a result of a change to foreign ownership, and the other because the
        enterprise itself elected not to complete the project.
       One sub-project in the tobacco fluffing sector resulted in phase-out of 350 ODP T.
       Two sub-projects in the servicing sector – the establishment of a central recycling
Project completion reports required by the MLF were prepared for all sub-projects approved,
including those cancelled.

Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP)
The ISP, first approved in March 1993, was intended to equip the Department of Natural
Resources (DENR) with central capacity to sustainably manage and phase out ODS. It remained a
constant throughout the life of the Project, sustained by a total of seven funding renewals.
During Phase I, the ISP project allowed DENR to establish the Philippine Ozone Desk (POD),
which was tasked to facilitate and coordinate implementation of the Country Programme and
enforce the 1993 Chemical Control Order (CCO) for ODS by establishing an inter-agency ozone
policy dialogue that laid the foundations for:
       ensuring compliance with the MP’s timetable for ODS phase-out and report consumption
        data required under Article 7 of the MP;
       strengthening procedures for restricting ODS imports;
       supervising/monitor phase-out projects;
       evaluating effectiveness of phase-out activities; and
       collecting national data on ODS consumption.
The ISP helped foster inter-agency cooperation and promote the importance of the ozone issue
through targeted a targeted information, education and communication program.

PHASE II
The Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP)
Ongoing institutional strengthening within DENR continued during Phase 2, with the aim
remaining institutionalization of ODS management within the Department to support effective
coordination of the overall phase-out program and compliance with the MP phase-out timetable,
strengthening of procedures for restricting ODS imports through coordination with relevant

                                                                                                41
government agencies, monitoring of phase-out results, and collecting and reporting data on ODS
consumption as required by Article 7 of the Protocol.
During the nearly two decades of its implementation, the ISP allowed the Philippines to ratify all
four MP amendments and issue corresponding national regulation, the Chemical Control Order
(CCO) for ODS, under which a licensing and import quota system, defined by the MP as the
single most important piece of legislation to control ODS consumption, was introduced. During
implementation of phase II the ISP further supported the introduction of key policy initiatives in
support of the NCPP, as detailed under “Technical Assistance for Policy and Regulatory
Measures? below. It was also active in working to educate the country’s industry sectors and the
general public about ozone protection and related Government policy. These efforts could not
have been achieved without fostering inter-agency cooperation and raising the profile and
relevance of the ozone issue within the national context, both of which the ISP afforded.

NCPP Implementation
The introduction of the NCPP into the project in 2003 allowed the Government to tackle the
phase-out of remaining CFC consumption in a manner consistent with the control schedule of the
MP. The agreement between the MLF ExCom and the Government of the Philippines required
that the country meet annual performance targets in exchange for the release of subsequent
tranches of funds which had been pre-approved ‘in principle’ by the ExCom. Achievement of
these annual performance targets would also necessarily serve to support achievement of the
GEO. A total of 2,017.49 ODP T of CFCs were to be phased out over the period 2003-2010, with
the intent to eliminate all CFC consumption in the manufacturing sector by January 1, 2005 and
all remaining sectors by January 1, 2010 (Table A2.2). Upon submission of the NCPP annual
verification audit of March 2008, the last funding tranche of the NCPP was made available to the
Government, indicating that the Philippines had consistently stayed within the CFC control
targets defined under the MP. By project closure, the Philippines had achieved its target of 100%
phase-out of consumption of CFCs.

Technical Assistance for Policy and Regulatory Measures
In order to strengthen communication and to extend co-operation with other stakeholders, the
project worked through the Inter-Agency Technical Working Group that had been created during
Phase I in order to build consensus and partnership in achieving the environmental program
targets and objectives of the project. It comprised different relevant government departments,
institutions of technical education, the Bureau of Customs, the Coast Guard, representatives of
importers and related industrial companies. Formal partnerships, through a series of Memoranda
of Understanding with the following institutions, were established to coordinate the phase-out
process:
    a) the Bureau of Customs, to strengthen the monitoring and control of ODS importation;

                                                                                               42
    b) the Technical Education and Skill Development Authority (TESDA), to train-the-trainers
       in the code of good ODS management practices and training of RAC/MAC service
       technicians;
    c) the Department of Trade and Industry, to incorporate ODS certification into its service
       shop accreditation program;
    d) the Department of Transportation and Communication, to mainstream ODS concerns into
       vehicular registration and to develop an inspection system for CFC-use in MAC; and
    e) the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority of the DA for the orderly phase-out of Methyl
       Bromide. Accordingly, a broad basis for the implementation of the NCPP has been
       created.
Key policy and regulatory initiatives adopted under the NCPP included:
       amendment to the Department Administrative Order (DAO) 8 series of 2004 that revised
        the Chemical Control Order for Ozone Depleting Substances;
       formulation of a Joint Administrative Order 003 series of 2006 between DOTC and
        DENR to regulate usage of CFC in motor vehicles;
       formulation of DAO 156 series of 2004 by the DOH providing for the transition from
        metered dose inhalers (MDIs) containing CFC/ODS to CFC/ODS-free alternatives;
       amendment to DTI DAO 003 series of 2006 providing for standard classification of air-
        conditioning and refrigeration service and repair enterprises; and
       incorporation of new standards in the Philippine National Standards (PNS) in monitoring
        and control measures in the use of CFCs in various equipment and appliances.
Overall, despite a number of implementation challenges, the project contributed to laying the
foundations necessary to allow the Government to address its phase-out targets under the MP
through support for development and adoption of crucial policies and regulations and provision of
best available technical advisory services regarding good management practices and cost-
effective, efficient and reliable technologies.
Manufacturing Sector Investment Sub-projects
The NCPP included funding for a series of investment sub-projects, referred to as Type 1 projects,
to address remaining consumption of CFCs in the manufacturing sector. Partial grant funding was
available to a number of enterprises that had been identified and deemed eligible, in accordance
with MLF eligibility guidelines, during the NCPP project preparation process. These included 6
foam manufacturers, 15 small foam blowing enterprises, three industrial/commercial refrigeration
equipment manufacturers, and nine aerosol sector enterprises. Sub-projects were to be prepared
by enterprises and appraised and supervised by DENR.
At the time of preparation of the NCPP, total ODS consumption in the manufacturing sector was
487 ODP T used in the production of foams, aerosols and commercial and industrial refrigeration
equipment and water coolers, as well as through the import and sales of CFC-containing MDIs.
Through the NCPP, the Government proposed to enforce a ban on the use of CFCs in the
manufacturing sector by January 1, 2005, ahead of MP compliance targets, while providing
technical and financial assistance to enterprises in the sector to support the transition. On April 13,
2004, the revised CCO for ODS under DENR Administrative Order (DAO) 2004-08 was signed.
The amended CCO operationalized some of the clauses that figured in the 2000 version including,
attendance at DENR–Bureau seminars on ODS for importers and retailers and accreditation of
dealers, retailers and re-sellers through DTI. The revised CCO also introduced new clauses
regarding the need for importers and retailers to commit to using a reclamation scheme for
refrigerants, and for dealers, retailers and service shops to adhere to the Code of Good
Management Practices.

                                                                                                   43
In the period during which the NCPP was under development and implementation, many of the
remaining manufacturers identified as potential beneficiaries during the preparatory phase had
already begun to prepare for the transition, driven by concerns about the changing global market
and decreasing availability of CFCs, and the knowledge that more stringent national regulatory
measures were afoot. By 2005, the landscape had changed, and in spite of the availability of
potential investment support, market considerations and the new regulatory environment had
compelled many smaller manufacturers to convert on their own to CFC-free alternatives, while
others shut down operations completely as a result of a shift in market demand and technology or
changed the nature of their business.
In the aerosol sector, only one of the nine enterprises that had been identified as eligible during
the NCPP preparation process remained active in 2005, and while this last enterprise accepted
assistance to develop a suitable conversion plan, it ultimately elected to convert on its own in
2006 because the MLF funding threshold level for the sector was considered to be too low to
pursue. This situation was repeated in the foam sector, where of the 26 enterprises identified at
the outset, only 6 eventually participated in the project, and again in the refrigeration
manufacturing sector, where of the 3 producers of refrigerated counters, freezers and water
coolers, 2 had already converted before project launch.
As a result, though phase-out in the sector was fully achieved, as demonstrated by the Philippines
compliance with MP control measures, this result is only partially attributable to the investment
component of project, as seen in the comparison of projected and actual outputs to outcomes
above, with regulatory measures and external market forces playing an important role in phasing
out final CFC use in the sector.
Of the $0.99 million originally budgeted for this component, $0.26 million were granted to the
beneficiary enterprises, $0.24 was reallocated to the independent audit of the voucher scheme by
SGV & Co. (Ernst & Young), PMU expenditures, and awareness raising activities, while the rest
was returned to the MLF.

Support to the RAC/MAC Servicing Sector
i) Training: Curriculum Upgrading, Training of Trainers, Accreditation of Service Shops and
Regulating the MAC sector
The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) upgraded and field tested
its draft Competency-Based Curriculum on Learning Materials for Refrigeration and Air-
conditioning and Mobile Air-conditioning Technicians in 2003 to incorporate good service
practices as called for in the NCPP.
In June 2004, an international consultant for the CFC servicing sector, funded by the Swedish
bilateral component of the project, undertook a mission to the Philippines to provide advice on
the accreditation and certification process, the Code of Practice for Refrigeration and Air-
conditioning and the reclamation facility, the latter of which is discussed further on. The Code of
Practice (COP) for Refrigeration and Air-conditioning was finalized in June 2004 after a series of
meetings by a Technical Working Group (TWG), who organized themselves into subgroups to
tackle various sections of the Code. An information campaign on the COP for Refrigeration and
Air-conditioning was launched. A notice to all concerned stakeholders was also published in a
major daily (Philippines Star) on May 1, 2005.
As reported by the PMU in the PCR, 17 lead trainers from TESDA were trained and over the
course of 2003-2004, 164 additional trainers from TESDA and TESDA-accredited centers
nationwide were trained as trainers using the draft competency-based curriculum. In 2005,
following the completion of the procurement process for the supply of training equipment to


                                                                                                44
training institutions, 150 sets of training equipment were delivered to training centers in
September 2005. Supervision reports noted the need, in 2007, for retrieval of some of the training
equipment originally distributed, to allow for redeployment to training centers in other priority
areas.
Figures related to the number of MAC and RAC service technicians trained and accredited are
difficult to confirm. At approval, the project proposed to train and certify up to 2 service
technicians per service shop in 5,000 shops nationwide. As reported in the PMU PCR, the target
figure was revised downwards by Project Management during implementation to a target of 3,510
‘trained and assessed’ service technicians. At completion, the PMU PCR reported that national
training institutions completed training of 7,710, and assessment of 2,383, service technicians
against the reduced target. The PCR further indicated that, based on an assessment of outcomes of
training activities, almost 70% of service shops ‘claimed’ to have adopted better servicing
practices. The findings of the 2008 15% audit, which found that of a survey sample of 387 service
shops, 277 (72%) demonstrated 'low' to 'no' use of equipment, and observed 25 shops
intentionally venting CFCs, call into question the scope of adoption of appropriate services
methods amongst technicians in the sector. Given that the follow-on 85% audit recommendation
that emanated from the 15% audit was never completed, it is not possible to corroborate the
claims made in the PMU PCR.
In March 2006, the 1978 decree on the accreditation of enterprises engaged in the service and
repair of motor vehicles, heavy equipment, engine and engineering works, electronics, electrical,
air-conditioning and refrigeration was amended through provisions contained in the DTI DAO 03,
Series of 2006. The amendments incorporated the following new provisions:
       That recovery machines were mandatory equipment for the accreditation of RAC and
        MAC service shops which, as is discussed further on, was not in line with the original
        project concept regarding subsidies for equipment through the voucher system outlined in
        the NCPP.
       Requiring RAC and MAC service shops to adhere to the Code of Practice on
        Refrigeration and Air-conditioning.
       Providing for the cancellation of accreditation in cases of violation of any provision of
        the DENR DAO Number 8, Series of 2004 on revisions to the Chemical Control Order
        for ODS, specifically those related to back conversion of RAC and MAC to CFC-based
        systems and the venting of refrigerants.
The PMU and DTI Bureau of Trade Regulation and Consumer Protection (BTCRP) conducted a
series of capacity building seminars for DTI regional and provincial staff, EMB ODS Officers
and TESDA focal persons on the implementation of DTI DAO 03, Series of 2006 nationwide.
In 2004, 306 inspectors from various regional and district offices nationwide of the Land
Transportation Office (LTO) of the Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC)
were trained in the identification and proper handling of MAC refrigerants. An information
technology consultant hired the same year, was engaged to include the variable “refrigerant type?
in the LTO database, to allow the database to consolidate information and generate reports on the
volume of registered vehicles equipped with MAC and the refrigerant type used. This information
was henceforth noted on the official receipt at time of vehicle registration, which was then used
for verification during random roadside inspections.
A Manual on MAC Inspection and Refrigerant Identification was developed, produced and
distributed to LTO and DENR Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) regional offices in
2005. That year, the PMU purchased 65 refrigerant identifiers which were distributed to LTO
and EMB regional offices.

                                                                                               45
A Joint Administrative Order (JAO) between DENR and the DOTC on the Mandatory Inspection
of Motor Vehicles with MAC Systems was signed by the DENR and DOTC Secretaries on
January 16, 2006. Nation-wide random roadside inspections jointly conducted by LTO and
DENR started in 2007. Based on LTO records, the number of registered vehicles equipped with
CFC-based air-conditioning systems (R12) decreased by 14% in 2009 from 2007 figures and the
use of mixed refrigerants was rampant. As of 2012, registration and renewal of registration of
vehicles still equipped with CFC-based air-conditioning systems will no longer be permitted.
ii) Voucher Subsidy System for the RAC/MAC Servicing Sector
The guidelines for the NCPP voucher system were finalized in May 2005, following consultations
with TESDA and DTI to agree on a checklist for requirements and evaluation and documentation
processes. These were later developed into a NCPP Voucher Systems Manual. The PMU
conducted several orientation meetings with service shop owners and technicians.
A total of 3,030 vouchers, to cover about 61% of the estimated 5,000 RAC/MAC service shops
nationwide were prepared by the PMU. DENR’s Environmental Management Bureau (EMB)
satellite Regional Offices were involved in the conduct of orientation seminars on the voucher
system and in promoting the voucher system to the general public through radio interviews and
press releases. At the national level, a full-page advertisement on the voucher system was placed
in the Manila Bulletin, a major daily. Six thousand copies of a brochure on the voucher system in
English and Filipino were also printed and distributed nationwide. Initial interest in the scheme
was low.
The voucher system for the servicing sector under the NCPP proposed to provide a set of service
tools to MAC and RAC technicians comprising a vacuum pump, 1 pressure gauge (for HFC-
134a), 1 leak detector, and charging equipment to strengthen the capacity of service shops to
effectively retrofit existing CFC-12 systems to the use of HFC-134a, as well as prevent
retrofitting back to CFC-12 use. A total of 288 R/R&R machines were proposed to be provided
to a limited number of service shops to recover CFC-12 from MAC systems only. DENR-PMU
decided however, to modify the terms of the voucher system. Service shops, both MAC and RAC,
were invited to select the equipment their shop required from a modified list - portable leak
detector, vacuum pump, vacuum meter, electronic weight scale, N2 regulator with gauges, an
electronic thermometer, and R/R&R machine including cylinder - provided they owned a R/R&R
machine in good condition. If the service shop did not own a R/R&R machine, the modified
voucher system made it compulsory for them to include this piece of equipment in their voucher
grant order. The PMU indicated that the standardized use of R/R&R machines would better equip
service shops to comply with the revised Chemical Control Order (CCO DAO 2004-08) that
prohibited intentional venting of ODS into the atmosphere, and would also help support
successful and sustainable operation of the reclamation facility to be established under the NCPP.
As a result of the changes in the equipment list, the level of the subsidy also changed. The revised
voucher system offered a maximum level of subsidy of PhP 100,000 which at the time (exchange
rate of 43.5 PhP to 1 US $), was worth approximately US $2,300. This translated into a 185%
increase over the original level of subsidy at approval.
In 2005, the PMU conducted a series of capacity building workshops in the screening and
evaluation of voucher applications for personnel of EMB Regional Offices and Provincial
Environment and Natural Resources Offices (PENRO) nationwide to enhance the scope for
uptake of the system at the provincial level. In 2006, 14 area coordinators were hired by the
PMU to assist in the implementation of the voucher system. The PMU also met with local
government units (LGU) who approve annual business permit applications for service shops to
explore possibilities for cooperation. This resulted in the Quezon City LGU providing grant



                                                                                                46
funding for training for 24 of its service technicians, and the Marikina City LGU committing to
subsidize the training of 47 of its service shop technicians.
Eight applications for the Qualification of Suppliers were received by the PMU, of which 5 were
approved by the DENR/AMB Bids and Awards Committee. Eventually, only 3 major suppliers -
SJ Gas and Appliance Center, Power-check Inc. and DNS Company – provided equipment
through the voucher system.
By 2006, the level of interest expressed by service shops wanting their technicians to be trained
remained low. A number of reasons were cited including: an unwillingness to pay the 2,500 PhP
training fee, not to mention the other expenses associated with participation in the scheme such as,
DTI accreditation of 400 PhP, business permit fees and the equipment equity, which was in the
order of 12,000 PhP; and, the time associated with training and the long process involved in
issuance of the voucher grant.
A voucher grantee catch-up plan, instituted over a period of less than one year, finally saw a jump
in the number of vouchers issued from less than 1,000 in late 2005 to over 2,500 by early 2007.
Key elements of the plan were (i) devolution from the PMU to Environmental Management
Bureau regional offices of outreach and administration functions, including through hiring area
and regional coordinators; ii) an increase in the voucher amount from PhP 75,000 to 100,000 and
exclusion from the list of required equipment of some pieces which the shops could procure more
easily on an individual basis; iii) simplification of the processing steps; and (iv) establishing
databases of unregistered service shops and of technicians.
However, project mismanagement stemming from uneven, and sometimes questionable, practices
regarding the provision of training in good management practices, the determination of eligible
recipients of equipment, the sourcing of equipment, as well as a lack of compliance with regard to
specifications on the part of equipment suppliers was soon uncovered within the voucher system.
It was discovered that several written and verbal complaints had been received by the PMU citing
non-transparent practices involving the suppliers, training institutes, and area coordinators, and
that authorities responsible for implementing the scheme did not always follow the PMU voucher
guidelines. One written complaint received by the PMU indicated that DENR had requested that a
blank application for a voucher be submitted; several others charged that some area coordinators,
hired by the project to facilitate the participation of the service shops and speed up the application
process, were exclusively promoting specific suppliers in exchange for extra remuneration.
Service shops were not all given a choice of suppliers and were not apprised that they could
choose from several suppliers and a variety of tools and equipment brands, capacities and prices
so as to suit their needs. Not all were required to provide counterpart funding, many were not
provided with full or functioning equipment, and some were ineligible to receive equipment.
In late 2007, the Bank requested that voucher distribution and payment to suppliers be stopped.
Equipment that had been provided to ineligible shops or to those that had subsequently changed
the nature of their business was to be confiscated. An external audit was commissioned by DENR
and undertaken by SGV & Co. (Ernst & Young) in 2008. The terms of the audit included:
      Assessment of the implementation process and accomplishments of the voucher system
       in relation to the NCPP servicing sector objectives and targets;
    Conducting a system and technical specification audit on the voucher system to
       determine if procedures were properly followed and intended results achieved; and
    Identification of issues and concerns, and submission of proposals for corrective actions
       to ensure program objectives would be met.
A survey of 387 service shops in all 17 regions in the country except the Autonomous Region of
Muslim Mindanao (15% survey) confirmed a number of issues at all levels. These included:

                                                                                                   47
       at the DENR-PMU, where voucher system guidelines were found to be lacking,
        particularly on the issue of penalties for violators of the system,
       at the DENR-PMU, where management over data and information regarding the
        implementation of the voucher system across the regions had shifted to equipment
        suppliers, on whom service shops had become reliant (32% of the service shops had
        learned of the program from suppliers);
       in DENR Regional Offices, where eligibility of service shops improperly assessed, poor
        monitoring of equipment deliveries were poorly monitored, and monitoring of use of
        equipment and requisite accreditation was poorly performed and not prioritized;
       with equipment suppliers, where instances were recorded of inadequate provision of
        assistance in servicing malfunctioning or broken equipment and, more importantly, cases
        were noted where the service shop equity requirement of the program was shouldered by
        the supplier, which was contrary to the system’s design;
       with LBP, where there were instances where payments had been released to suppliers
        without complete documents being submitted; and
       with service shops, where equipment supplied was noted to be improperly, rarely or
        simply not used in an important percentage of shops surveyed, and where noncompliance
        with the RAC/MAC Code of Practice, taught through training, was in evidence.
Writ large, the survey found that 49% of surveyed shops rarely used the equipment supplied (of
which 38% were R/R&R machines), 22% had unused equipment (21% of which were R/R&R
machines), and 20% did not have the requisite accreditation from the Department of Trade and
Industry. In addition, venting, improper storage and lack of monitoring of refrigerants used were
recorded. The audit concluded with a recommendations roadmap that included a series of policy
related actions to address violations in the system, re-appropriation of equipment provided to
ineligible shops, enhancing the screening and evaluation procedures for voucher grantees,
applying strict monitoring conditions at the central, regional and service shop levels, regulating
the bad practices in service shops, and expediting the completion of the reclamation facility.
With respect to the issue of non-conformity with technical specifications, a focus group
composed of technical experts from relevant government agencies and industry players was
convened by the PMU to evaluate the alleged non-conformity. Based on the results of this
evaluation, corrective actions with regard to equipment with technical issues – including
provision of weighing scales, replacement hoses and refrigerant cylinders - was proposed,
endorsed by the Bank and instituted. Two of the three suppliers accepted the terms of the
corrective actions and provided the additional equipment to grantees. One supplier refused to
rectify the situation, resulting in DENR considering pursuit for breach of contract.
The introduction of changes to the voucher system, notably the type of equipment provided to
service shops, in the absence of sufficient national technical support (there was a reliance on
external technical support, particularly with respect to design and implementation of the servicing
sector voucher system and the CFC reclamation facility) and an effective monitoring system,
created additional challenges. The NCPP servicing sector voucher system design had favored
standardizing practices across a predominantly informal servicing sector through training and
provision of subsidized basic tools, as well as by building up a recovery network that in turn,
would support, and be sustained by, the proposed reclamation facility. In practice however,
priority ended up being placed on procurement of recovery (R) and recovery & recycling (R&R)
equipment over basic tools in order to meet the conditions imposed under the revised Chemical
Control Order (CCO DAO 2004-08), which made it compulsory for every service shop to have, at
the least, a recovery machine to encourage prevention of intentional venting of CFCs into the
atmosphere, and in order to support the sustainable operation of the reclamation facility.

                                                                                                48
iii) Establishment of a CFC Reclamation Facility
The operational design of the CFC reclamation facility was developed through consultation with
a Swedish International Development Agency consultant and the Philippine Association of
Refrigerant Importers, Inc. (PARII), supported by the Swedish bilateral grant. Although a
Memorandum of Agreement was signed between DENR and PARII in May 2005, PARII later
withdrew from participation in the facility based on growing concerns regarding the technical and
financial viability of the facility’s operational design, as most of the refrigerants that could be
reclaimed from MAC service shops were mixed and could not be reused, obviating the need for
reclamation. The facility’s operational design was therefore revisited. Alternative models were
explored, including the possibility of qualifying for carbon emission revenues through the proper
disposal of ODS. In the end, DENR commissioned the collection, transport and storage of
recovered refrigerants from service shops and chiller facilities, with a view to possibly securing a
future ODS disposal project.
The transport, collection, and storage facility was established in September 2010. The facility,
operated by Delsa Chemicals, is equipped with a refrigerant recycling machine, weighing scale,
refrigerant identifiers, vacuum pump, and storage tanks.
The structural readjustment made to the conceptual design of the CFC Reclamation Facility
component of the NCPP therefore also fell short of its goal, i.e., to reclaim recovered CFCs for
re-use to ensure availability of CFCs to support the needs of the servicing tail of existing
RAC/MAC and chiller equipment. By project closure, only about 4 tons of ODS and other
refrigerants had been collected from the National Capital Region alone, much of the collected
materials being HCFC-22 and HFC-134a, which Delsa expects will be able to sustain the facility
through income earned from resale of recycled HCFC-22 and HFC-134a. The low level of
collection of CFCs reflects the small amounts of the refrigerant being recovered from the service
shops and signals more broadly that by the time it became operational, the levels of CFC still
circulating in the economy were negligible, a reflection that was corroborated by several service
shops visited during the ICR mission.

Phase-out of CFC-using Metered-dose Inhalers (MDIs)
In order to tackle CFC consumption from CFC-containing MDIs, consultations were held
between DENR/PMU, the Bureau of Food and Drug (BFAD), pharmaceutical companies,
medical practitioners and interested stakeholders from November 2003 to March 2004. A survey
was than undertaken by an MDI consultant that determined that by 2004, only 20% of the MDIs
being sold in the market were still CFC-containing MDIs. In order to address this remaining
consumption, a phase-out strategy was developed and a corresponding Department
Administrative Order (DAO), DOH AO 156 series, was signed on June 24, 2004. The DAO
outlines the implementing rules and regulations for the transition from MDIs containing
CFC/ODS to CFC/ODS-free alternatives by end 2010. An awareness-raising program for health
professionals, patients and the general public on the need for transition from CFC to non-
CFC/ODS-free MDIs was also formulated.
BFAD conducted a continuous information campaign on the phase-out of CFC-based MDIs
targeted at asthma patients and those suffering from cardio-pulmonary obstructive diseases until
2009. In 2009, the BFAD technical working group issued a memorandum circular (MC 2009-
004) for all drug establishments specifying the end dates for the importation and distribution of
MDIs containing CFC. Based on the market monitoring by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), there are no more MDIs containing CFCs in the market.

         Methyl Bromide Phase-out Strategy
         Approved in 2006 by the ExCom, the MB Phase-out Strategy proposed a gradual phased
         reduction of 20%/year of a total of 9.03 ODP T of MB consumption in the structural/flour-mills,
         stored commodities/grains and soil fumigation sectors through a combination of investment and
         non-investment activities. A PMU was established in the Department of Agriculture’s (DA)
         Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA).
         The project was successful in its objectives, phasing-out the Philippines consumption of
         controlled uses of MB by 1 January, 2009, well in advance of the MP’s 100% compliance target
         of January 1, 2015. In order to ensure the sustainability of the phase-out of controlled uses of MB,
         an amendment to the consolidated guidelines for handlers of MB in the implementation of
         quarantine and pre-shipment (QPS) uses23 of MB was introduced in 2009.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Original MLF ExCom-approved and actual cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios are used to evaluate the
efficiency of the Project. CE is the amount of MLF grant per unit weight of ODS phased-out in
ODP kg.
MLF financing approved during Phase I was provided to beneficiary enterprises in the
manufacturing sector as an incentive to remove technical and financial barriers associated with
adoption of alternative non-CFC technologies. Approved CE, which was negotiated with the
Secretariat of the MLF on a sub-project-by-sub-project basis against established sub-sector CE
thresholds, aimed to achieve the maximum reduction of ODP per unit of expenditure.24 CE was
not used as a criterion in appraising technical assistance activities. The average CE for the 16
Phase I CFC sub-projects at approval was $18.43/ODP kg. The CE ratios achieved by the three
sub-sectors under the project range between $10.54/ODP kg and $17.45/ODP kg, with an average
of $12.29/ODP kg (Table A3.1).

* The average CE has been calculated based on the 800 ODP T consumption stated in the MoD for 16 proposed projects.
** The total funding approved by the Multilateral Fund included $10,216,876 from the Fund itself plus $358,534 in Swedish bilateral funds, of which $290,758.90 was made available
to the Project and the remainder was managed by SIDA to cover the costs of the Swedish expert affiliated with the Project.
*** An average CE was negotiated by the Bank for the first group of NCPPs approved in Asia (Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand), based on historical CE averages in the countries
in question. The agreed upon average CE value of $6.64/ODP kg, would allow each country the flexibility to distribute funds within their NCPP based on national circumstances and
needs.

At the time of the inclusion of the NCPP into the project (Phase 2), the manner in which CE was
calculated changed, reflecting the less prescriptive structure of the national phase-out plan versus
the sub-project-by-sub-project approach, which allocated flexibility to the country to distribute
funds based on circumstance and needs in order to achieve aggregate reductions in consumption
of ODS. In order to respond to this change in scope, and to facilitate negotiation of these large-
scale projects with the MLF, an average CE value of $6.64/ODP kg was negotiated by the Bank
for its initial group of NCPPs prepared in Asia (the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand). This
value was based on historical CE averages across the various manufacturing subsectors in the

  CE values are found by dividing the total funding levels approved by the total ODP T phase-out projected, and
dividing by 1,000 to obtain CEs in $/ODP kg terms.

countries in question and helped establish a level playing field for NCPP preparation and
negotiation.
The actual cost effectiveness ratio under Phase 2 of the Project would be $4.28/ODP kg, if all
ODS reduction achieved during the Project period, 2,017.49 ODP T, could be attributed to
project-supported NCPP activities (Table A3.1). As such the NCPP CE would be much lower
than the approved CE value of $6.64/ODP kg.
However, as indicated by the output-outcome analysis in Annex 2, and further elaborated in
section 3.2, only a portion of this ODS reduction may be attributed to the Project, and external
factors, notably global reduction in CFC supply, and Project-supported policy and regulatory
measures (notably the 1999 import licensing and quota system gradually restricting the amount of
virgin CFCs that could be imported) may have had a much larger impact on ODS reduction than
investment sub-projects and the voucher system combined.
An analysis of the cost effectiveness of CFC phase-out that is attributable to Project Phase 2
activities was carried out. Given the uncertainties regarding attributability conservative
assumptions were made:
1) During Phase 2 implementation, a total of 2,017.50 tons were phased out. The breakdown by
   component is presented in Table A3.2.

       * The total ODP T phase-out objective for the manufacturing sector was 518.2 T figure,
       minus the 31.7 ODT T already under implementation by UNDP, so the projected phase-
       out in the manufacturing sector that would be supported by this Project was 486.5 ODP T.

2) In the manufacturing sector only 280 ODP T of a projected 417.54 ODP T was phased-out as
   a result of project outputs (Table A2.1 in Annex 2).
3) Phase-out of 1,531 ODT T was to be supported by the NCPP Servicing Sector Support
   Component through provision of equipment and training on good management practices to
   the country’s 5,000 servicing shops. Of the 5,000 servicing shops, only 2,580, or 51.6%,
   received training and equipment from the project. Assuming that these shops also consumed
   51.6% of the CFCs, a maximum of 51.6% of the phase-out from this sector, 790 ODP T, may
   be attributed to the Project. Consequently, together with the manufacturing sector phase-out,
   a total of 1,069.99 ODP T may be attributed to the Project (Table A3.3). This corresponds to
   a CE ratio of $8.06/ODP kg, which exceeds the ratio negotiated for NCPP implementation.
The above CE calculation is conservative because the 15%-survey provided evidence that in fact,
less phase-out may be attributed to the Project. Notably, the survey indicated that 22% of the
beneficiary service shops never carried out the activities required for sustainable CFC phase-out.
(The 15%-survey indicated that of the 387 service shops surveyed 191 rarely used and 86 never
used the equipment purchased under the voucher system.) Therefore, it could be said that only
40.2%, or 615ODP T of the 1,531 ODP T phased-out in the servicing sector may be attributed to
the Component's outputs. This would lead to a total of 895 ODP T attributed to the Project and a
CE ratio of $ 9.64/ODP kg in total. Furthermore, if one were to assume that those shops that
rarely used their servicing equipment also did not contribute to the phase-out, only 14.7% of the
CFC reduction from the servicing sector would be attributable to the Component's outputs,


                                                                                                  52
leading to an overall CE ratio of $55.87/ODP kg. However, we chose the conservative estimate of
$ 8.06 ODP kg in order to also account for the policy and regulatory efforts carried out during
Project implementation, which partly contributed to the phase-out.

  A. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT ON THE
                   NATIONAL CFC PHASE-OUT PLAN
The objective of the National CFC Phase-out Plan (NCPP) Project is to enable the Government of
the Republic of the Philippines to phase out its CFC consumption in accordance with the phase-
out schedule stipulated by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
Under the Montreal Protocol, a total of 2,049.36 ODP -T of Annex A, Group 1 chemicals will be
phased out in the Philippines over the period 2003 to 2010, with the intent to eliminate all CFC
consumption in the manufacturing sector by January 1, 2005 and in all sectors by January 1, 2010.
The overall phase out strategy of the NCPP is a combination of policy, investment and non-
investment activities (training, capacity building and public awareness). The phase-out strategy
was broken down into specific strategies under two (2) sectors: the manufacturing sector that
accounted for twenty-five percent (25%) of CFC consumption and the servicing sector that
accounted for seventy-five percent (75%) of consumption.
The key policy initiatives under the NCPP included the following: amendment to DAO 8 series
of 2004 that revised the Chemical Control Order for Ozone Depleting Substances; formulation of
a Joint Administrative Order 003 series of 2006 between DOTC and DENR to regulate usage of
CFC in motor vehicles; formulation of DAO 156 series of 2004 by the DOH providing for the
transition from MDIs containing CFC/ODS to CFC/ODS-free alternatives; amendment to DTI
DAO 003 series of 2006 providing for standard classification of air-conditioning and refrigeration
service and repair enterprises; incorporation of new standards in the Philippine National
Standards (PNS) in monitoring and control measures in the use of CFCs in various equipment and
appliances
The investment, and non-investment activities carried out under the NCPP has enabled the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines to phase out its CFC consumption in accordance
with the phase-out schedule stipulated by the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the
Ozone Layer. The NCPP has achieved the Project’s objective of reducing CFC consumption from
2003 to 2009. The aim of completely phasing out the importation of CFCs by January 1, 2010 has
also been achieved. The manufacturing sector (foam, aerosol, and MDI) has completely
converted to the use of non-CFC refrigerants. Almost seventy percent (70%) of the service shops,
based on an assessment of the outcomes of the training activities, have adopted better servicing
practices. Although a smaller number of service shops have DTI accreditation (48.4%) and have
TESDA-certified technicians (29.1%).
The key issues identified for the future are:
the fact that the NCPP Project management unit is not mainstreamed within the structure of
EMB-DENR and has been treated as a temporary structure;


                                                                                               58
        ? the lack of capacity of EMB-DENR in monitoring and enforcement especially in
          relation to overseeing how RAC and MAC servicing practices are carried out ; and
        ? the need to allocate government funds for the continuous operation of the NCPP
          PMU.
The key lessons learned from the Project include:
        ? the need for capacity development and bigger role for LGUs with RAC and MAC
           service shops;
        ? the need for dedicated focal persons in each government department involved in
           implementing the Project to ensure tighter coordination;
        ? the need to address the issue of how to cope with constant changes in Project
           management due to political considerations; and
        ? the need to address the challenge of changing behaviors and practices among service
           shop technicians, enterprises and end-users (owners of mobile air-conditioners and
           refrigerators).
            
       B. A SUMMARY OF THE “NATIONAL METHYL BROMIDE PHASE-OUT
                            STRATEGY: TERMINAL REPORT?
RA 6969 “AN ACT TO CONTROL TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND HAZARDOUS AND
NUCLEAR WASTES, PROVIDING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS THEREOF, AND FOR
OTHER PURPOSES? otherwise known as The Toxic Substances and Hazardous Wastes Control
Act of 1990 empowers the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), as the
lead Agency with respect to Montreal Protocol related issues, to regulate, restrict or prohibit the
importation, manufacture, processing, sale, distribution use and disposal of chemical substances
and mixtures that present unreasonable risk and/or injury to health or the environment. Through
the issuance of a Revised Chemical Control Order, all Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS),
including methyl bromide (MB) were placed under the control of the DENR.
On November 2003, the DENR-Environment Management Bureau (EMB) together with the
Department of Agriculture, Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (DA-FPA) executed a
Memorandum of Agreement on the preparation of a National Methyl Bromide Phase-out
Strategy. The MOA designated the Philippine Ozone Desk (POD) of the EMB as coordinator of
the MB Phase out Project. In 2004 a project proposal to phase out of Non-Quarantine and Non-
Pre Shipment (Non-QPS) use of methyl bromide was presented for approval. The phase out
project covered non-QPS use in stored products, flour mills, mill structures and soil. One of the
prime concerns of the FPA and the DENRPOD in planning the phase-out strategy was to make
sure that MB-dependent sector of the economy will not be severely affected. The sector affected
by The National Phase-out Strategy is the controlled or non-QPS use of MB.
At the time the project was started MB was used as a soil sterilant, stored products protectant, a
pesticide for treatment of structures, and quarantine and pre-shipment (QPS) treatments. In a
preliminary study conducted for the project, it was determined that of the non-QPS use of MB,
soil treatment comprised 1.4% usage, structural fumigation (silo and flour mills) constitutes
45.32% of MB usage, and commodity/stored product fumigation made up 53.3% of non-QPS MB
consumption. Soil fumigation was conducted by plantation fumigators; structural (silos and flour
mills) and commodity/stored product fumigations were conducted by either in-house mill
fumigators or contracted out to service providers; while QPS treatments were contracted out to
professional/commercial service providers. The preliminary study also determined the correct
baseline consumption (average consumption in 1995-1998) of the Philippines to be an average of
10.3 ODP tons. The corrected Philippine baseline consumption of non-QPS use of MB as 10.3
Ozone Depleting Potential (ODP) tons, was scheduled to be phased out by the year 2009.

                                                                                                59
The Phase Out:
The gradual phase out was pegged at a consumption reduction of 20% per year. The phase out
began with a 20% decrease on the baseline consumption in 2005 and subsequent reduction which
culminated in a total phase out of non-QPS use by the year 2009. To mitigate the impact of the
phase out of methyl bromide for non-QPS use, the project conducted a needs assessment and
consultation with all sectors affected by the phase out of MB. As a result of the assessment and
consultations, the project developed and provided training programs for Integrated Pest
Management (IPM), hands-on training on the use of alternatives (i.e. hermetic storage) and
substitutes (i.e. phosphine and eco2 fume). The project also provided correct tools and equipment
for use of those who transitioned from MB to other fumigants. Flour mill operators, the sector
most affected by the phase out were given Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) [such as full face
masks and/or self contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)] and gas monitoring devices (i.e.
detector pumps and tubes). The project also included policy regulation, and strengthening of
institutions involved in the use of Methyl bromide.
Sustainability:
To ensure the sustainability of the non-QPS MB phase out strategy, the project focused on:
Strengthening Institutions, through linkages, information dissemination, policy formulations,
trainings and research.
End- users like Pest Control Operators (PCOs) and in-house fumigators were trained on the use of
alternatives like Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and substitutes like Phosphine fumigation for
commodity fumigation and “Basamid? for soil application. Research was also directed at other
alternatives that have been successfully employed by others in the same industry like solarization
and rice hull burning.
Government regulations were supported and strengthened through Executive Orders (EO) and
Circulars, like the EO that lifted the moratorium on registration of category 1 products, the
classification where fumigant substitutes belong, giving rise to the registration of Eco2fume
(phosphine and Co2 combination) for fumigation of structures and commodity. And the
processing of other substitutes such as methyl iodide and other soil fumigants.
This also resulted in the issuance of Memo circulars 1 and 2 (Annexes C and D respectively),
further restricting purchase and use of MB through new requirements like Permits to purchase
and the required liquidation report on all MB used and consumed, providing paper trails that will
allow FPA to verify that MB for QPS does not find its way to the Non-QPS sectors.
Institutional linkages were also enhanced through the cooperation of the Bureau of Plant
Industry-Plant Quarantine Services (BPI-PQS) involvement in monitoring of QPS usage and
issuances of certificates as supporting documents in the liquidation of MB usage and
consumption. Information dissemination was also enhanced by distribution of publications, poster
presentations during Earth Day celebrations and the organizing of information seminars
nationwide.
