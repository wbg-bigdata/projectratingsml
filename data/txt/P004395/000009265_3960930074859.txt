MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE INDEPENDENT STATE OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA
FOR A SPECIAL INTERVENTIONS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Independent State of Papua New Guinea for $30.0 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. It would help to finance a Special Interventions
Project which is intended to assist in mitigating the social costs of the
Government's ongoing adjustment program. The proposed loan would be at the
Bank's standard variable rate with a twenty year maturity including five years
of grace. Part of the proceeds of the loan ($12.0 million equivalent) would
be onlent at the Central Bank's variable discount facility rate (currently
10.3 percent) for periods of 10 to 20 years to refinance mortgage loans made
by commercia tanks at market rates. The Government of Papua New Guinea would
bear the foreign exchange risk.
2.        Background.  After having deteriorated during the-first part of the
1980s, the overall economic performance of Papua New Guinea vPNG) improved
substantially in the second half. However the recovery came to a halt in late
1989 primarily because of (a) the indefinite closure of the Bougainville
copper and gold mine (BCL) which resulted from the actions of militant
landowners in the North Solomons province and (b) sharp falls in PNG's
commodity exports (coffee, cocoa, oil palm). Until its closure, BCL had
contributed about 35 percent of export earnings and 15 percent of government
revenue. Also, the adverse security situation in the North Solomons disrupted
other important economic activities, especially the production of cocoa, which
is the third most important non-mineral export item of PNG. These
developments entail severe implications for economic activity in PNG. It is
estimated that. during 1991, they will have a net negative effect on the
balance of payments of about 12 percent of GDP and cause a loss of fiscal
revenues equivalent to 4 percent of GDP. The estimated impact of these shocks
to the economy places PNG close to the upper end of the magnitude of shocks
sustained by countries undertaking adjustment programs in the 1980s.
3.        Government Strategy.  The Government recognized that shocks of this
magnitude called for prompt stabilization measures. The Government also
recognized that the shocks underscored the need, and provided an opportunity,
to undertake more fundamental structural adjustments to accelerate the
development of the non-mining economy and diversify the productive base.
Consequently, in consultation with the IMF and the Bank, it decided to embark
on a stabilization and structural adjustment program and asked both
institutions to provide financial support. In response, a stand-by
arrangement was concluded with the IMF in April 1990 and subsequently a
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) was approved by the Bank in June 1990. While
the Government is making good progress in implementing the adjustment program,
the accrual of the full benefits of the program will take time. During this
transitional period some components of the program would, in the short run,
affect particularly urban residents negatively which could endanger the
sustainability of the program. The Government has therefore approached the
donors to support, as a complement to the SAL and the IMF stand-by
arrangement, a program of special interventions to help mitigate the short-
term social costs of economic adjustments. However, other than this
complementary feature, the SAL conditionality does not include any actions
directly related to the program of special interventions.



- 2 -
4.        Objectives.  For the overall program of special interventions, the
main objectives include (a) addressing the more urgent social needs arising
from PNG's ongoing economic adjustments by enhancing employment opportunities
among low income, unemployed and underemployed urban workers; and
(b) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Government to better
formulate and implement projects. Also, if the structural adjustment program
as agreed can be sustained and the public and private flow of external funds
is maintained it should be possible for econon'&c growth to resume in the
medium term. The program of special interventions would make an important
contribution to this effort.
S.        Program of Special Interventions.  Based on the foregoing, a
multisector program consisting of investments in health, water supply,
agriculture, housing, industry and road drainage was identified by the Bank in
March 1990. These components are all ready for implementation and have a high
priority in the Public Investment Program which was reviewed by the Bank
during the preparation of the SAL operation. The program, including the
components financed by the Bank, is expected to provide about 10,000 person-
years of productive jobs over a two- to three-year period beginning January
1991 and thus help to alleviate urban and rural poverty and cushion the
effects of layoffs in the public sector. The program is therefore timely as
it will be implemented during the very difficult, initial years of adjustments
in the economy.
6.        The Government wished to finance the program (estimated cost of
$76.8 million) using grant and/or concessionary funding as much as possible.
As a result of consultation among the donors and with the Government, it was
agreed to separate the program into components of interest to the donors.
Specifically, this meant that (a) ADB would provide concessional funds for the
health, water supply and agriculture components, (b) the Bank would finance
housing, industry, and most of the drainage component, and (c) the EEC would
provide concessional funding for the remainder of the drainage component. In
total, the Bank and the donors are expected to provide $60.8 millIon or about
79 percent of the estimated cost of the program of special interventions. The
Department of Finance and Planning (DFP), through the Structural Adjustment
Committee (SAC), would provide a management umbrella for the components, and
monitor the performance of the program, particularly employment generation and
the rate of program implementation.
7.        Donors subsequent actions have so far been satisfactory.  The
Government and the ADB have completed negotiations for $10.6 million on
concessionary terms for a Health and Water Supply project ($13.2 million
cost). A separate Agriculture Project ($15.6 million tentative cost) is
scheduled for ADB's approval in early 1991. Funds ($3.5 million) were also
reallocated from an ongoing ADB project to be used for the purchase of medical
supplies. Taken together, these projects are estimated to cost a total of
$32.4 million and will provide for (a) Water supply: minor but urgently
required extensions to water supply systems; (b) Health: construction of
urban clinics, health posts, hospital expansion, staff housing and the
provision of medical supplies; and (c) Agriculture: equipment and operational
support for coffee research and extension activities. As for its road
drainage works ($4.1 million total cost) the EEC has already hired consultants
to prepare dossiers (similar to preliminary engineering). It will fund
100 percent of contracts awarded through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) for
drainage works and is on schedule for implementation start-up in the second
quarter of 1992.

8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Due to its long association with
the key sectors of the economy, in the form of sector work and lending and
also its chairmanship responsibility for the Consultative Group (CG) for PNG,
the Bank is well placed both to help formulate the program of special
interventions and to act as a catalyst in coordinating donors' support for it.
Although some of this program's components may have a lasting impact on the
endemic problems facing the unemployed and underemployed, they have been
designed to address largely the more pressing short-term challenges presented
by the adjustment program. While the Bank continues to perform a catalytic
role and assists PNG through its first adjustment program, Bank involvement is
also needed to fill the financing gap and to help strengthen program
management. In addition PNG faces the combined challenges of undertaking
structural reform and managing the adjustment process while laying the
foundations for sustainable growth. Hence the inclusion of a component such
as housing which will provide both an immediate employment impact and will
also begin institutional reforms and encourage the financial sector to
participate more fully in housing finance. This will help to lay the
foundation for sustainable housing development in PNG.
9.        Project Description.  As mentioned earlier, the components of the
program of special interventions supported by the Bank under the proposed
project consist of the following: (a) Housing ($23.7 million): a line of
credit for refinancing housing mortgages made by Commercial Banks, and
technical assistance for the National Housing Corporation (NHC), (b) Road
drainage ($11.3 million): provision of earth and concrete drains, including
culverts, at road sections where pavement failure due to saturated soils is a
threat, and (c) Small industry development ($2.6 million): provision of
technical assistance to the Small Business Development Corporation (SBDC) for
the development of small contractors and entrepreneurs. The Bank will also
fund technical assistance for project management, monitoring, and studies
($2.7 million). Where required, designs and documentation for this proposed
Special Interventions Project (SIP) have been substantially completed and it
is ready for implementation.
10.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be $40.3 million in
December 1990 prices, including foreign exchange costs of $26.1 million.
Details of costs and financing are shown in Schedule A. The proposed Bank
loan of $30.0 million would finance 75 percent of project costs, net of taxes
and duties. The Government, commercial banks and the beneficiaries will fund
the remainder ($10.3 million).   Retroactive financing in an amount not
exceeding $3.0 million is proposed for expenditures incurred on civil works,
equipment, incremental operating costs, and consultants services after July 1,
1990.
11.       Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank operations in Papua New Guinea are
given in Schedule C and D. A map is also attached. A Staff Appraisal report,
No. 9139-PNG dated January 3, 1991 is being distributed separately.
12.       Actions Agreed.  At negotiations, the Government agreed mainly on:
(a) the basic principles for the operation of the housing refinancing facility
(HRF); and (b) a timetable for the strengthening of the NHC. Conditions of
effectiveness are the (i) signing of a subsidiary agreement with the Central
Bank (BPNG); (ii) hiring of an expert to assist in operating the HRF; and
(iii) employment of a project manager acceptable to the Bank. Finrlly, for
the housing component it was agreed that the condition of disbursement will be



- 4 -
the signing of participating agreements between the BPNG and the eligible
commercial banks.
13.       Benefits.  The new employment opportunities and increases in urban
income would help the Government maintain the adjustment process while at the
same time laying the foundation for progress on social objectives.
Improvements in road drainage would help protect costly investments and extend
the useable life of the roads. The provision of long-term financing, and
associated policy and institutional development, would meet part of the
critical needs for housing, and lay the foundation for sustainable housing
development. Technical assistance to small businesses would help them to
develop the capacity that is essential to their growth prospects and to
employment generation in the future.
14.       Risks.  The main risk is that project implementation could be slow
due to inadequate managerial capacity particularly in NHC and DFP. To
alleviate this risk, Government has established, and will retain, a special
committee in DFP for overseeing project implementation. Also institutional
strengthening will be provided for NHC. Delays in land titling could also
adversely affect new housing sites development. However, this will not delay
the project much since the project depends mainly on the sale of existing
serviced plots. Finally, their assurances notwithstanding, Commercial Banks
could be slow or reluctant to finance mortgages for low- and middle-income
applicants. This is mitigated by the fact that house and plot buyers will be
allowed to use their accumulated savings in the Provident (pension) funds for
their downpayments and that payroll deductions will be permitted for periodic
payments. Government determination to improve housing must also be considered
to be an overall risk mitigating factor.
15.       Environment.  The environmental aspects of the project have been
reviewed and the findings are summarized in a brief report. The project would
not have any adverse impact on the environment; it would improve on the
contrary, living conditions of the vulnerable groups. Major physical
components such as housing and drainage, are dispersed over several provinces
and would follow Bank approved design standards. Design standards for the
housing component will also incorporate appropriate safeguards for water
disposal. Although the Bank is not financing sites development, and NHC will
not accept a site for development if there are environmental or resettlement
issues, the NHC policy statement does include adequate provisions for handling
these issues whenever they should arise.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank. I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
