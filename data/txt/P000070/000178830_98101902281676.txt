REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN
FOR A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Republic of Benin for the equivalent of
US$1.7 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a technical assistance
project. FAC (Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation) would provide co-financing
for the project in the form of a grant of US$0.7 million.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        There has not been any economic mission to Benin recently, although
a mission to review Benin's next plan is scheduled for later this year.
Annex I contains basic country data. The last economic report (Report No.
191a - DA) entitled "Economic Situation and Prospects of Dahomey" was issued
on August 20, 1973. The following analysis is based on information gathered
by the 1975 IMF Article XIV consultation mission and by various Bank missions
that visited Benin in the course of 1976 and early 1977.
Past Development
2.        With a GDP per capita of only US$140, Benin is classified by the
UN as one of the world's 25 least developed countries. It is an overwhelm-
ingly rural nation: 80 percent of the population is dependent on agricul-
ture which accounts for 30 percent of GDP and 90 percent of foreign exchange
earnings. Insufficient and irregular rainfalls limit the production of high
value tree crops. Seventy percent of the total agricultural output consists
of subsistence low-value root crops (yams and cassava). Palm oil, cotton and
groundnuts are the country's major export crops. GDP per capita in the rural
sector is very low, averaging about US$50.
3.        Transport and commerce are the second most important activities in
Benin. The port of Cotonou has traditionally been the door to the sea for land-
locked Niger and a transit port for the western part of Nigeria. A large share
of the imports of consumer goods (beverages, tobacco, radios, etc.) and ex-
ports of agricultural products registered as Benin trade, is in fact unofficial
border trade to and from Nigeria. Due to the recent congestion of the port
of Lagos, the transit function of the Cotonou port has further developed. In
1976 it is estimated that about half of the port's total traffic (960,000
tons) originated in or was destined for neighboring countries (30 percent to
Niger and 20 percent to Nigeria). Transport and commerce generate about one
third of Benin's GDP (at factor cost), account for 10 percent of its foreign
exchange earnings, and employ about 12,000 persons.

4.        The country has an embryonic industrial sector and the known
mineral resources - limestone and phosphate - have not yet been exploited.
There are plans to start exploiting the Onigbolo limestone deposit in the
near future. There are also indications of the existence of oil offshore.
Political Situation and Recent Economic Development
5.        Since independence in 1960, there have been numerous changes of
Government. This instability has been due in part to regional and ideological
differences. A major turning point occurred at the end of 1974, when the
military Government that had been in power since 1972, decided to establish a
Marxist-Leninist system. The declaration of the new regime was accompanied by
measures aimed at decreasing foreign influence and increasing the country's
self-reliance. Nationalization of foreign private interests in key sectors
(banking and credit, gasoline distribution, services related to the port and
industry) took place and the various technical assistance programs were scaled-
down. These measures disrupted the economy, since there was an inadequate
number of Beninese to replace the departing expatriates. The situation was
further aggravated by drastic changes in the public service which resulted in
further losses of productivity.
6.        The agriculture sector was affected by these developments which
lead to a deterioration of support services, especially input distribution.
Furthermore the Government's pricing and marketing policies did not provide
enough incentive to farmers, being mainly guided by the Government's desire
to keep the cost of living and the level of salaries low in the urban centers.
Production of most agricultural products stagnated during 1974-76 and cotton
production dropped sharply from 50,000 tons in 1972/73 to less than 20,000
tons in 1975/76. Maize production was also affected by the Government's
decision to prohibit maize exports by private traders to Nigeria, a tradi-
tional outlet for Benin. The Government intends to establish a state grain
trading monopoly.
7.        The Government decided in 1976 to implement measures aimed at
encouraging farmers to produce more. Farmgate prices were increased to
generally more satisfactory levels for the 1976/77 season. Farm inputs were
distributed on time for the first time in four years. Preliminary results for
the 1976/77 season are, however, not encouraging. The farmers' response has
been limited. Low rainfall also contributed to a further decrease in output.
8.        In the modern sector, transport and other economic activities
have been stimulated by the rapid growth of transit trade with Nigeria.
Transport was the only growing sector in Benin over the 1971-75 period. In
1976, the Government took further measures to improve the port's handling
capacity which had fallen to a low 12 tons/hour in 1975 as opposed to 23 tons/
hour in 1972/73. To attract Nigerian traffic away from the congestion at



-3-
the Lagos Port, border formalities are being simplified.    The ad valorem
transit tax of 2.08 percent on the Nigerian traffic has been dropped. 1/ A
study of the feasibility of extending the port facilities is underway. The
Government of Nigeria is financing the coastal expressway linking Cotonou
with the N4gerian border, to be completed in 1977, and is planning to build
several other roads linking the western part of Nigeria to the Benin-Niger
axis.
9.        Public investment in recent years has been at a low level.    Total
gross investment is estimated to have stagnated at about $50 million per year
over the 1971-75 period, (i.e. a low $16 per capita compared with US$32 in
neighboring Togo and $89 in the Ivory Coast), while public investment is esti-
mated to have averaged about US$25 million per year, (i.e. also a low US$8
per capita compared to US$27 and US$55 in Togo and the Ivory Coast respec-
tively). Public investments were concentrated in road infrastructure and
agriculture. Benin has not had a national plan since 1972, but the Govern-
ment is now working on the preparation of an interim 3-year plan covering the
1977-79 period.
10.       While Benin has not been successful recently in spurring economic
growth, it has maintained a strict financial orthodoxy. The Central Govern-
ment's current budget, which was in chronic deficit during the sixties (requir-
ing support from France until 1970), has been in equilibrium since then, even
generating a small surplus of about 7 percent of current revenues between 1971
and 1975. This was achieved through an austerity policy of freezing civil
servants' salaries, which have not been increased for 10 years, and limiting
expenditures on materials. Revenues (in real terms) increased very little due
to the zero growth of the economy.
11.       Benin has succeeded in maintaining the equilibrium of its balance
of payments despite the sharp deterioration of its trade balance, the deficit
of which increased to US$40 million in 1974/75 (11 percent of GDP). The
improvement of the service account, due to increased transit shipments to
Nigeria, helped to compensate for this. At the end of the first quarter of
1976, Benin's net foreign exchange reserves amounted to only US$16.5 million,
i.e., the equivalent of one month of imports.
12.       Recent trends in the agricultural sector have inevitably resulted in
a growing gap between the incomes of the urban population and the farmers,
some of whom shifted back to subsistence crops. The cash income of farmers is
estimated to have declined by 50 percent between 1972 and 1976.
1/   The resulting loss of tax revenues is negligible compared with the
incremental value added created by the development of the Nigerian
traffic.



-4-
Prospects
13.       Benin's economic prospects are for only limited growth.    GDP is not
expected to grow by more than 3 to 4 percent per annum over the next decade,
assuming perseverance with the recent efforts to improve the economic situa-
tion. The measures taken in 1976 mark an improvement in economic policies.
The proposed technical assistance project, which would help the Governxment
strengthen agricultural institutions and prepare a long-term development
program for the Zou-Borgou area, is a reflection of this.
14.       Cooperation with Nigeria could become a major factor for Benin,
since Nigeria could provide what Benin lacks most, a neighboring large
market and a financial base. The two countries are already associated in the
extension of the Cotonou clinker grinding plant (100,000 tons) to be completed
in early 1978. They are also considering joint investment in a project to
produce 40,000 tons of refined sugar at Save for the Nigerian market; and a
cement plant based upon the Onigbolo limestone deposit producing between
500,000 tons and 1 million tons per year. The implementation of these proj-
ects could considerably improve the balance of payments outlook for Benin
given adequate price and marketing guarantees by Nigeria.
15.       The stimulation of Benin's economy implies an increase in public
investment to at least US$50 to US$60 million per year, in constant 1977
prices, in the late seventies and early eighties. Such a program, in view
of the limited local financial resources, would have to be financed, as in
the past, mostly by foreign aid. Public savings will continue to be limited,
especially in view of Government's decision to increase civil service sal-
aries starting January 1977, which will result in a 15 to 20 percent increase
in the Government's wage bill.
16.       Benin's total external debt was relatively high at the end of
1975, amounting to US$160 million, or about 40 percent of the country's GDP.
External public debt service amounted to about 10 percent of the country's
exports in 1975/76. This constitutes a relatively high burden for Benin
considering its poverty and limited foreign exchange earnings possibility.
Debt service as a share of Government revenues is probably substantially
higher.
17.       Given Benin's extreme poverty, limited development prospects, dif-
ficulty in mobilizing domestic resources, and relatively high debt service
ratio, foreign donors should continue to provide aid on the softest possi-
ble terms and also to cover a high proportion of local costs if necessary.
In any case the volume of external aid to Benin is likely to be limited
until a greater effort is made by the authorities concerned in project pre-
paration and implementation.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BENIN
18.       To date the Bank Group has extended 5 credits to Benin, totalling
US$39.6 million. Two of the Credits were for agriculture (2Q percent of
total lending) and two for highway construction and maintenance (61 percent).
The fifth and most recent operation was an education project with a large
rural training component. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
Group operations in Benin as of March 31, 1977, as well as notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
19.       The Hinvi Agricultural Development Project (1969) which financed
the construction of an oil palm mill as well as palm plantings and food crop
improvement, was IDA's first operation in Benin and has been completed satis-
factorily (see para. 29). IDA's second involvement in agriculture in Benin
was the Zou-Borgou Cotton Development Project (1972). The project failed to
achieve its objectives for the reasons given in paras. 30-39.
20.       The Bank Group's involvement in the transport sector began in
1960, when the Bank acted as Executing Agency for a UNDP "Land Transport
Study". This study led to the financing of a four-year highway maintenance
project in 1970, successfully completed in 1974, followed by a Second Highway
Project in 1973. The Second Highway Project, co-financed by USAID, which
comprises principally the reconstruction of 320 km of the Parakou-Malanville
road, Benin's most important North-South trunk road, and the continuation of
the road maintenance program, is progressing satisfactorily. However, severe
cost overruns due to inflation and unforeseen technical difficulties led the
Association in FY76 to provide a supplementary credit of US$9 million.
21.       The first Education Project, which became effective in 1976, pro-
vides for the improvement of the ongoing rural youth training program, and
the construction and equipping of a skills upgrading center in Cotonou.
The project also includes a preinvestment study for a follow-up training/
education project. The project is progressing on schedule.
22.       Another IDA operation expected to be presented to the Board on the
same day as the proposed project, is a feeder road project designed to support
agricultural development and to strengthen the institutional framework for the
improvement and maintenance of the feeder road network. IDA is also consider-
ing financing a Third Highway Project, to be submitted to the Board within the
next few months, and a project for the extension of the port of Cotonou for
the preparation of which IDA has already advanced $500,000 under the Project
Preparation Facility. IDA's future involvement in the agriculture sector will
depend very much on the outcome of the proposed technical assistance project.

PART III - THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
Background
23.       Benin may be broadly divided into northern Sudanian and southern
Guinean type climates. The annual precipitation ranges, on average, from
1,300 mm in the South to 900 mm in the far North, although there are wide-
spread local fluctuations and differences from year to year. Rainfall is
generally insufficient for coffee, cocoa and rubber, and oil palm yields are
lower than in neighboring countries. However, favorable climatic conditions
exist for the cultivation of food crops, cotton and groundnuts. The quality
of soils is generally mediocre throughout the country, and in the South
there are signs of soil depletion due to over-cropping. Benin has an estimated
9 million ha suitable for cultivation. Of this area only about 1.1 million ha
are cultivated. The agricultural population is about 2.1 million, mainly
smallholders cultivating about 2.5 ha per family. In the North, a substantial
area of potentially productive bottomland is left uncultivated because of
onchocerciasis.
24.       Benin produces about 1 million tons of yams and cassava and
320,000 tons of cereals (including 210,000 tons of maize and 90,000 tons of
sorghum/ millet). Rice production, although relatively modest (15-20,000
tons), has developed rapidly in recent years. The country produces a surplus
of maize which is exported to Nigeria through border trade while at the same
time it imports about 5,000 tons (18,000 tons during the drought years 1972
and 1973) of wheat and rice mostly for urban consumption, i.e. about 3
percent of total cereal consumption. Export crops consist of unshelled
groundnuts (40,000 tons), seed cotton (20,000 tons in 1975 and 1976), and palm
oil (25,000 tons). The country's main sources of foreign exchange earnings
are oil palm products (about one-third of total exports including border trade
with Nigeria), followed by cotton and groundnuts. Livestock is important in
the North, but Benin is a net importer of about 10,000 head of cattle annually
from Niger.
Organization
25.       The organization of the agriculture sector, which was entirely
changed in 1975, is now as follows. The Ministry of Rural Development and
Cooperative Action (MDRAC) is responsible for policy matters and coordination
in the agricultural sector. It comprises six directorates for agriculture,
livestock, fisheries, rural engineering, forestry and planning. The Ministry
of Rural Development and Cooperative Action also coordinates the activities of
six Regional Action Centers for Rural Development (CARDERs) responsible for
regional agricultural development (extension work, credit delivery and primary
marketing of cotton and food crops) and seven crop-oriented state agencies of
which SONAGRI (National Company for Agricultural Development) is one of the
most important. SONAGRI is responsible for providing management and technical
support to the CARDERs and also for cotton ginning operations. The National
Company for Marketing and Exports, controlled by the Ministry of Finance, has
the monopoly for the export of all agricultural products.



- 7 -
26.       Benin has been relying on French aid to carry out research,
essentially the Institute of Tropical Agronomic Research and Food Crops
(IRAT) for food crops, and the Institute of Cotton and Exotic Fiber Research
(IRCT) for cotton. In February 1977, the Government created a national re-
search agenc-- in the Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperative Action to
supervise all research activities in Benin, with continuing French support.
27.       There are no well-defined sectoral objectives for agriculture in
Benin. The Government's traditional policy in agriculture is directed to-
wards encouraging the development of industrial export crops such as oil
palm, groundnut and cotton. To capitalize on the country's good potential
for food crops, the Government also aims at increasing cereal production
to meet the growing demand from urban centers in Nigeria. The Government's
policy on the organization of agricultural production is not clear.     Several
attemps have been made to create large collective farms but by and large it
is assumed that individual small farms will prevail. Producer cooperatives
remain limited, although the grouping of farmers was one of the most success-
ful achievements of the Zou-Borgou Project.
28.       Public investments in the agricultural sector have remained at the
relatively low level of $10 million per year during 1971/75. The two projects
jointly financed by IDA and FAC, the Grand Hinvi Oil Palm and Zou-Borgou
Cotton Development, represented about half of the overall agriculture invest-
ment over the 1971-75 period. FED has been another important source of
financing. Because of the lack of well-prepared projects, agricultural
investment is not expected to increase substantially through the early
eighties.
The Hinvi Agricultural Development Project
29.       The project, which dates back to 1969, aimed at establishing 6,000
ha of oil palms, preparing 6,000 ha for annual crop production, constructing
an oil mill, and developing tree plantings and beef production. Development
was organized through cooperatives, and the project managed by the National
Rural Development Agency of Dahomey. Oil palm plantings were completed as
scheduled in 1970, but two consecutive years of drought have delayed the
growth of trees. Because of limited rainfall, yields are expected to be
only about 80 percent of appraisal estimates. While only 1,500 ha of food-
crops were planted, the project has been successful with respect to the in-
troduction of ox-traction, and the strengthening of the project agency. The
future of the cooperatives is compromised by financial difficulties and low
producer prices. The mill which started operation in 1974, one year behind
schedule, is running satisfactorily.
Zou-Borgou Cotton Development Project
30.       The main objective of the project was to increase seed cotton pro-
duction in the Zou and Borgou provinces from 25,000 tons in 1970 to 56,000
tons by 1974, through increasing the areas under cotton from 29,000 to 59,000
ha, and the number of growers from 29,000 to 41,000. The productivity of
other crops grown in rotation with cotton was to be improved through the
residual effects of fertilizers applied to cotton.



- 8 -
31.       The project was to comprise the provision of staff and equipment
to the National Agricultural Company for Cotton (SONACO) to administer agricul-
tural extension, credit and primary marketing services; the establishment
of a revolving fund to supply short and medium-term credit to cotton growers;
construction of two new ginneries; rehabilitation of 620 km of feeder roads;
applied agronomic research; and a feasibility study for agricultural diversi-
fication in the project area. The original concept was to have the National
Agricultural Company for Cotton responsible for the planning and supervision
of extension work carried out by two French consulting firms. The ginning of
raw cotton and marketing of lint and cotton seed was entrusted to CFDT 1/
under a joint venture agreement with the Government. The project cost was
estimated at $12.7 million with IDA financing $6.1 million, FAC $3.1 million
and the Government $3.5 million.
32.       The project initially reached appraisal production estimates for
seed cotton. In 1973 production reached 19,000 tons in Zou and 23,000 tons
in Borgou, with yields of 1,100 and 1,200 kg/ha respectively. However, this
pace was not sustained because of institutional problems which led to the
direct control of the marketing of cotton and management of extension ser-
vices, and low producer prices. In 1973, the Government decided to take
over cotton marketing and all ginning facilities from CFDT and make the
National Agricultural Company for Cotton directly responsible for the organi-
zation of extension work, and the National Company for Marketing and Exports
responsible for the marketing of cotton lint and seed. IDA agreed to these
changes after the Government agreed to maintain expatriate technical assis-
tance. However this was phased out faster than expected. Consultants were
asked to withdraw in 1974 and 1975, although the Government did not have
adequate staff to replace them.   Government also decided to shift key proj-
ect extension personnel from one region to another and from one service to
another, thus disorganizing extension work.
33.       At the end of 1975, Government set up the CARDERs and turned the
National Agricultural Company for Cotton into SONAGRI whose functions are
spelled out in paragraph 25.   This resulted in coordination problems with
the CARDERs, the production agencies.   In addition, SONAGRI suffered from
financial problems since the Government did not pay its contribution to
project costs in 1974 (US$1.6 million), and has not repaid SONAGRI for the
subsidies granted to farmers since the beginning of 1974. The Government
has given assurances that the $1.6 million would be paid to SONAGRI during
1978 in three equal payments, the first of which would be made not later
than March 31, 1978 (Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.03(b)), and
that FAS (Autonomous Support Fund) would reimburse SONAGRI for the unpaid
1/   CFDT is a company which, in accordance with the Credit Agreement, man-
aged its own and the Government's ginneries in the project area, and
supplied technical and marketing services to the Project.

subsidies before the end of September 1977 (Development Credit Agreement,
Section 4.03(a)). The Government also agreed to include in the "bareme" paid
to SONAGRI, in addition to production and operating costs, the amount of input
subsidy (Development Credit Agreement, Section 4.03(c)).
34.       The Government pricing policy also acted as a disincentive.   Cotton
producer prices were too low in both absolute terms and compared with ground-
nuts and maize to make cotton attractive to the farmers, until the 1976/77
season, when they were raised to CFAF 50/kg. This together with the organi-
zational changes, affected the farmer's confidence in the project. As a re-
sult there has been a sharp decline in cotton production in the project area
from 42,000 tons in 1973 to 17,600 tons in 1975 and perhaps less in 1976.
Yield and quality have also deteriorated. This has resulted in heavy losses
to the economy estimated at US$10 million for 1974 and US$25 million for 1975
and 1976, i.e. about 10 percent of Benin's annual foreign exchange earnings.
35.       No reliable data are available on foodcrops, but their production
is believed to have suffered from attempts to restrict the traditional border
trade with Nigeria.
36.       Other components of the project were implemented more successfully.
The Glazoue ginnery financed under the project is operating satisfactorily.
A proposed second ginnery was not built since cotton production never reached
the expected level. A nonquantifiable but important benefit has been the
organization of effective farmer groups. These groups operate like small
cooperatives and some of them have demonstrated their ability to handle pri-
mary cotton marketing and to organize the distribution of farm inputs. The
project has also been successful in expanding the production of rice and
hybrid maize and introducing ox-drawn cultivation. SONAGRI (formerly SONACO)
has maintained its activities reasonably well, especially the operation of
the ginneries. Accounting procedures are being improved, and the 1975
and 1976 accounts were properly audited. However the feeder roads con-
struction program had to be reduced from 620 km to 450 km because of cost
overruns.
37.       In 1973, a Government delegation visited Washington to seek IDA's
agreement to the then proposed organizational changes. Later, with IDA's
agreement, the Government entered into a new technical assistance agreement
with CFDT. Upon the creation of the CARDERs in 1975, another delegation
came to Washington and it was agreed that the newly created SONAGRI should
be strengthened by certain key appointments, its accounts audited, its rela-
tionship with the CARDERs more clearly defined and the Government's pricing
and marketing policies made more growth oriented. Measures taken since
then have been responsive to these agreements except with respect to
marketing policies.
38.       The Credit Agreement provided for IDA financing of the purchase of
incremental inputs for 1973 and 1974. However, a portion of the funds allo-
cated for this purpose were left undisbursed at the end of the period con-
cerned. In early 1977, the Association decided to disburse this amount,



- 10 -
together with the funds originally allocated for the second ginnery and the
unallocated funds, a total of $1.1 million, for expenditures for fertilizers
and pesticides purchased for the 1974 and 1975 seasons. This decision was
made despite the problems encountered by the project, to enable SONAGRI to
maintain the area presently under cotton production.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
39.       The proposed project was identified by an IDA mission in May
1976. An appraisal mission visited Benin in October 1976, and a follow up
appraisal took place in February 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington
from April 20, through April 22, 1978. The Beninese delegation was led by
Mr. Akpo, Minister of Rural Development and Cooperative Action.
Rationale for a Technical Assistance Project
40.       It was always intended that there should be a follow-up project
to Zou Borgou I. But the failure of the first project and the prevailing
structural problems (lack of a clearly defined pricing and marketing policy,
financial and technical weaknesses of the agricultural institutions such as
SONAGRI, deterioration of the support and extension services) in the agri-
culture sector indicate that a full-scale second project is presently not
feasible. Yet in view of the key role of the agriculture sector, especially
cotton, and the recent more determined approach taken by the Government, both
the Government and IDA have agreed that it was important to maintain IDA's
involvement in the sector. The proposed technical assistance project would
be an appropriate means of providing the expertise required to improve the
institutional situation and prepare a follow up project. It would also allow
more time for the farmers to regain confidence in the project.
Project Description
41.       The proposed project, which is summarized in the Project and Credit
Summary (Annex III), would be of an interim nature designed to prepare the way
for a regional development project. It would be carried out over two years
and would include:
(a) the provision of technical assistance to SONAGRI through
the assignment of consultants and equipment to:
(i) strengthen the accounting and financial management;
(ii) set up an Evaluation and Planning Directorate
within SONAGRI to help the CARDERs in their
technical and other farm support services, and
to prepare development projects for the Borgou
and the Zou; and



- 11 -
(iii) reorganize and reinforce the training capability
of SONAGRI and the CARDERs, especially in the
Borgou area;
(b) providing trucks and staff vehicles to SONAGRI;
(c) setting up within SONAGRI a development fund for pilot
projects to be carried out by the CARDERs in Borgou
and Zou;
(d) providing consultant services to make investment pro-
posals for the area to be cleared of onchocerciasis,
and establishing a field station in the area to develop
land use programs;
(e) providing additional personnel and equipment to the
Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Rural Devel-
opment and Cooperative Action to carry out a detailed
agricultural survey in the Zou and Borgou; and
(f) pursuing adaptive research in cotton and food crops
and organizing seed multiplication for food crops.
Detailed terms of reference of the various components were agreed upon during
negotiations, together with various covenants governing their implementation.
These requirements are described in their context in Annex III. The more im-
portant covenants are listed in Annex IV.
Project Implementation
42.       The General Manager of SONAGRI, who reports to the Ministry of
Rural Development and Cooperative Action, would be the Project Manager. He
would be directly responsible for all project activities, except the applied
research and agricultural survey. The applied research activities would be
under the responsibility of the Director of Research of the Ministry of Rural
Development and Cooperative Action , but the program would be designed in con-
sultation with SONAGRI. The Director of Planning of this Ministry would be in
charge of the agricultural survey.
43.       All expatriate staff financed under the project would report
directly to the Project Manager except for the research specialist. The tech-
nical assistance posts would be filled by expatriates, since it is unlikely
that nationals with the required experience and qualifications would be avail-
able. Government agreed that it would cause the General Manager of SONAGRI to
employ for all expatriate staff posts and consultant assignments, specialists
whose qualifications, experience, terms of reference and conditions of employ-
ment are satisfactory to IDA. The terms of reference were agreed upon during
negotiations (Development Credit Agreement Section 3.02).

Project Costs and Financing
44.       The total cost of the project, based on March 1977 prices and
including contingencies, would amount to US$2.5 million (net of taxes of
US$0.1 million). Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$1.7 million
or 65% of total costs. The proposed IDA credit of US$1.7 million would be
complemented by a grant from FAC of US$0.7 million. Total external financing
(IDA and FAC) would amount to 96 percent of total costs, thereby financing
US$0.7 million of local costs. Both the IDA credit and the FAC grant would be
passed on by the Government as grants to SONAGRI (Development Credit Agreement
Section 3.01(b)). The FAC participation would be pari-passu (2/3 IDA: 1/3 FAC)
except for the cost of expatriate staff (three fully financed by FAC, three
fully financed by IDA), short term consultants and onchocerciasis studies
(both fully financed by IDA). IDA would finance $0.3 million of local costs.
Total expatriate staff services would amount to 9.5 man-years and consultants
services to 68 man-months for a total cost of US$1.0 million. The average
cost would be US$65,000 per man-year of expatriate staff, and US$80,000 per
man-year of short-term consultant. A condition of effectiveness of the
proposed credit would be the effectiveness of the FAC grant (Development
Credit Agreement Section 6.01). The Government contribution of $0.2 million
would cover 45 percent of incremental local staff salaries (including taxes).
Procurement
45.       Contracts for the purchase of goods or civil works of more than
$10,000 would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally in accordance with the applicable procedures of the borrower which
are considered acceptable to the Association. To the extent feasible, vehicles
totalling $220,000 would be grouped for bulk procurement. Contracts of less
than $10,000, would be purchased locally in accordance with other applicable
procedures of the Borrower including sollicitation of price quotations from
local suppliers. It is expected that the Government would request the Bank's
West Africa Agricultural Project Management Unit to assist in recruiting
expatriate staff to be financed by IDA. The expatriate research and training
specialists already in place would be retained by SONAGRI. The services of
short-term consultants would be procured in accordance with IDA's guidelines.
Disbursement
46.       The IDA credit would be disbursed against:
(a) 100% of the total cost of expatriate staff - with the
exception of the research and training specialists,
and the agricultural economist - (US$278,000);
(b) 100% of the total cost of consultants (US$421,000);



- 13 -
(c) 39% of incremental local personnel costs (US$150,000);
(d) 67% of the costs of equipment (US$240,000), and of
expenditures under the development fund (US$133,000);
(e) 67% of the costs of buildings (US$32,000); and
(f) 67% of the operating costs (US$176,000).
(g) unallocated (US$270,000).
Disbursements for local personnel and operating costs would be made against
certificates of expenditures, the documentation for which would not be
submitted for review, but would be retained by SONAGRI and made available
to supervision missions. Expenditures under the Development Fund would
be subject to IDA's prior approval.
Benefits and Risks
47.       The general situation in the agricultural sector can only be charac-
terized as unsatisfactory. But there have recently been some more favorable
trends such as the increase in the producer price for cottonl and improvement
in the financial management of SONAGRI. The main purpose of the technical
assistance provided under the project, would be to build upon these trends
and help prepare a full-scale, second-phase project. Without the technical
assistance, it is difficult to envisage that the conditions would be created
in the sector in a reasonable amount of time, sufficient to warrant further
IDA involvement. Even with the technical assistance there is an inherent
risk that the Government may not create the necessary conditions. There is
a risk that technical advisers would not be able to achieve a constructive
dialogue with the authorities concerned. The Association would take special
care to ensure this does not happen by intense supervision efforts.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's Republic
of Benin and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association
and the draft resolution approving the proposed Development Credit, are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
49.       Features of special interest of the draft credit document are listed
in Annex IV. A condition of effectiveness included in the Credit Agreement,
would be the effectiveness of the FAC agreement. A condition of disbursement
would be the approval by IDA of sub-projects to be financed under the Develop-
ment Fund.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

Credit.

Procurement Arrangements
Contracts for the purchase of goods or civil works of more than
$10,000 would be procured on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally in accordance with the applicable procedures of the borrower which
are considered acceptable to the Association. To the extent feasible, vehi-
cles totalling $220,000 would be grouped for bulk procurement. Contracts of
less than $10,000, would be purchased locally in accordance with other appli-
cable procedures of the Borrower including sollicitation of price quotations
from local suppliers. It is expected that the Government would request the
Bank's West Africa Agricultural Project Management Unit to assist in recruiting
expatriate staff to be financed by IDA. The expatriate research and training
specialists already in place would be retained by SONAGRI. The services of
short-term consultants would be procured in accordance with IDA's guidelines.

DETAILED FEATURES OF THE PROJECT
A.   Strengthening of the Financial Management of SONAGRI
1.        SONAGRI, formerly SONACO, has been hampered by the lack of com-
petent financial management. Under the Zou Borgou Cotton Development Project,
a consultant initiated work on the reorganization of SONACO, and the SONAGRI
accounts were reviewed by an independent auditor. These activities would be
pursued under the proposed project. In order to set up an effective account-
ing and cost system, the project would provide for (a) a financial advisor for
18 months to initiate the reorganization of accounting procedures, (b) three
consultant missions (totalling 15 man-months) to support the reorganization
program, and (c) the services of an external auditor to ensure an independent
audit of SONAGRI's accounts for three years (1976-77 through 1978-79). Funds
would also be made available for vehicles and the operating costs of the sup-
port. No later than the end of March 1978, the financial advisor should
prepare an administrative and accounting reorganization plan to be reviewed by
Government and IDA (Development Credit Agreement Section 3.06).
2.        Since an important role of the financial advisor would be to train
nationals for the financial management and accounting of SONAGRI and the
CARDERs, Government agreed to appoint five accountants to work with the con-
sultants not later than by September 30, 1977 (Development Credit Agreement
Section 3.03). Cost of these accountants for a two year period is covered
under 'the project.
B.   Evaluation and Planning Directorate
3.        There is an obvious need to strengthen the organization and man-
agement of SONAGRI and to endow it with the capability of designing devel-
opment programs. This would be the task of the Evaluation and Planning
Directorate to be established within SONAGRI. This Directorate would be
responsible for identifying the main technical problems, preparing regional
development projects for the Zou and Borgou, and also monitoring the impact
of prices on farmers' incomes and making recommendations to the Government
on pricing and marketing policies.
4.        The proposed project would provide for (a) an agricultural eco-
nomist (18 man-months), (b) an agronomist (1 man-year), (c) 10 man-months
of consultants (livestock, maize, cotton, rice, small irrigation schemes),
(d) two qualified nationals for a two-year period, and (e) equipment vehicles
and operating cost of the unit. Government agreed that (a) the two nationals
would be appointed to the Directorate by September 30, 1977 (Development
Credit Agreement, Section 3.03); (b) it would cause the Evaluation and Plan-
ning Directorate to submit to IDA quarterly reports on its activities (Devel-
opment Credit Agreement, Section 3.07 (a)); (c) forward to IDA for its com-
ments proposals for a Borgou project by June 1978, and a Zou project by



ANNEX III
Appendix A
Page 2
December 1978 (Development Credit Agreement, Section 3.07 (c)), and (d) by
December of each year, review with IDA the findings of the Evaluation and
Planning Directorate on pricing and production incentives (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.07 (b)).
C.   Training
5.        The training program carried out by consultants in the Zou under the
first project would serve as a basis to reinforce the training capability of
SONAGRI and the CARDERs, especially by training the trainers, preparing a com-
prehensive overall training program for a follow up project, and reinforcing
the current training program in the Borgou. Funds would be provided under
the project for (a) the extension for another two years of the training spe-
cialist already in place, including vehicles and operating costs, (b) the
training of senior CARDER personnel in crop production (maize, rice, ground-
nuts) by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), in
Nigeria, (c) missions to study other agricultural development projects in
West Africa, (d) equipping and upgrading the audio-visual workshop established
in the Zou under the first cotton project, to transform it into a national
workshop serving all CARDERs, (e) since ox-traction implements are currently
imported, and the progress of ox-traction depends on proper repair and main-
tenance facilities, a blacksmith training program carried out at Parakou
(under UNDP financing until early 1977) would be pursued under the project,
with the help of a specialist assigned for 18 months. The workshop would be
used to meet the needs of all its agricultural services (Development Credit
Agreement, Section 3.08).
D.   Reinforcement of SONAGRI's Transport Fleet
6.        SONAGRI has responsibility for transporting the cotton crop to the
ginneries and for leasing its trucks to the CARDERs for the transportation of
inputs and the food crop output. SONAGRI purchased 15 new trucks, which now
enable it to meet transport needs until the end of 1977. To ensure that the
fleet continues to meet the needs, provision would be made under the credit
to purchase 4 new trucks in 1978.
E.   Development Fund
7.        While the project is essentially limited to technical assistance
at the management level to prepare for subsequent projects, ongoing field
development would be carried out on a pilot scale, to test the project imple-
mentation capability of the CARDERs. Among possible small sub-projects that
could be promoted are: (a) bottomland development for low-land rainfed rice;
(b) the purchase of rice mills by village groups; (c) building of grain stor-
age facilities; (d) animal traction; and (e) the purchase of ULV equipment
for cotton spraying. To make provision for such activities, a development
fund of US$200,000 equivalent would be created within SONAGRI. Sub-projects
would be presented by the CARDERs of the Zou and Borgou to SONAGRI for review,



ANNEX III
Appendix A
Page 3
then by SONAGRI to IDA for approval for disbursement from the Fund (para-
graph 3(b) of Schedule 1). Criteria for approval would include technical
and economic feasibility, costs, implementation schedule, credit terms and
conditions, and provision for credit recovery.
F.   Development of Areas Freed from Onchocerciasis
8.        The rich potential of the valleys of North Benin can be devel-
oped after completion of the ongoing program of onchocerciasis eradication
scheduled to be completed by mid-1978. To prepare for this development, a
resource inventory will be carried out by earth satellite under USAID financ-
ing, and through ground surveys under UNDP financing. In order to prepare
investment proposals for these areas, once the resource surveys are completed,
provision would be made under the project for 25 man-months of consultant
services. Since little is known about possible land use (crops and varieties,
management, fertilization, pest control), a field research station would be
equipped under the project in the onchocerciasis area to initiate work to
develop the needed information. Government has agreed that it would submit
to IDA a program for the station by December 30, 1977 (Development Credit
Agreement Section 3.10). The station would be operated under the Directorate
of Research of the Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperative Action, while
it is anticipated that the investment studies would be made by SONAGRI.
G.   Detailed Agricultural Survey
9.        UNDP has supplied the services of an agricultural economist and a
statistician to the Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Rural Development
and Cooperative Actiqtn to start a base line data survey on agriculture in
the country. This survey, of a reconnaissance nature, will not supply suf-
ficient data on which to base comprehensive development programs. In addi-
tion, the Ministry has not been provided with enough surveyors, transport and
calculating equipment. Under the project, therefore, the Directorate would be
supplied with additional personnel and equipment to carry out a more detailed
survey in the Zou and Borgou by focussing on the input-output relationships of
typical farms depending on ecology, cropping patterns and level of technology,
thus providing a better basis for preparation of a second stage project.
H.   Adaptive Research
10.       Under the Zou Borgou Cotton Project, technical improvements on cot-
ton and food crops were tested and extended to farmers, through the adaptive
research work sub-contracted by IRCT and IRAT. Because of lack of financing
in 1977, the ongoing cotton research program, currently financed by IRCT,
will soon be stopped, and jeopardizing future cotton improvement.     There-
fore, cotton research would be financed under the project, and would focus
on pest control, variety testing (including seed production) and agronomy,
and other priority aspects of research, namely rice improvement, and variety
testing of sorghum and groundnuts in the Borgou, not hitherto covered.



ANNEX III
Appendix A
Page 4
11.       Funds would be provided under the project for:   (a) four man-months
of consultants, (b) two years of a cotton research specialist, (c) six quali-
fied nationals to carry out the programs, (d) training of Beiinese personnel
at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture or other suitable
organizations and (e) construction equipment and operation of a field experi-
mental unit at Okpara for foodcrops. Government would (a) appoint the na-
tional personnel to carry out the research program by September 30, 1977
(Development Credit Agreement Section 3.03) (b) give IDA an opportunity to
review the qualifications and programs of consultants who would visit Benin
in support of the research activities, and (c) submit by end December 1977 a
detailed research program for the 1978 season (Development Credit Agreement
Section 3.10). All research activities under the project would be carried out
under the responsibility of the Director of the newly-created national Re-
search Agency in the Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperative Action in
close liaison with SONAGRI and the CARDERs of Zou and Borgou. The national
research programs would greatly benefit from a liaison with neighboring na-
tional research programs, and those of the regional and international research
institutes such as IITA, IRAT, IRCT, and the West Africa Rice Development
Association. This liaison would be encouraged under the project.
I.   Seed Multiplication
12.       Cotton seed multiplication has been satisfactorily carried out as
part of the cotton research program and would be pursued under the project.
Seed multiplication of hybrid maize is to be undertaken by SONAGRI to cover
the increasing demand of farmers. Under the project, a seed multiplication
farm would be equipped, and funds would be made available to cover the operat-
ing costs of maize seed production. This program, designed with consultant
support (2 man-months) would help set up a national seed production service
with SONAGRI, with technical support by the Research Directorate of the
Ministry of Rural Development and Cooperative Action. It is expected that
the program would be incorporated in a future development project. Govern-
ment would cause SONAGRI to submit a maize seed multiplication program (in-
cluding a budget) to IDA for approval by September 30, 1977 (Development
Credit Agreement, Section 3.09).
