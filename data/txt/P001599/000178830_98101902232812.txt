INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO MALAWI
FOR A SECOND HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Malawi, for the equivalent of $10 million, on
standard IDA terms to help finance a Second Highway Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report, "Recent Economic Developments and Prospects of Malawi"
(67a-MAI), was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 17, 1973
(R73-77); Country data are provided in Annex 1. An updating economic mission
visited Malawi in May 1974. Its report will be discussed with the Govern-
ment at the end of November and is expected to be distributed to you by
the end of 1974.
3.        Since Independence, in 1964, Malawi's gross domestic product has
grown by an annual average of 8 percent. However, with a per capita income
of only $105, Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in the world and
is included in the United Nations list of the 25 least developed countries.
Natural resources are limited to moderately fertile soils, substantial water
resources and a climate favorable to crop production. Although bauxite and
coal deposits have been discovered, their exploitation has not yet been found
commercially viable. Forests, which cover about 23 per cent of Malawi,
constitute the main essentially unused resource which could be exploited on
a significant scale in the near future.
4.        The economy is however still heavily dependent on agriculture and
is subject to annual fluctuations in output. For example, real GDP dropped
by 6 percent in 1968, but rose by 18 percent in 1971. Agriculture has also
stimulated much of the high growth in other sectors. The increasing output
of export crops has directly caused a comparable increase in processing,
distributive and commercial activities, while indirectly higher farm incomes
have stimulated the local production of consumer goods. Government policy
is oriented towards rapid growth of agricultural production and, indeed,
real per capita farm incomes have risen faster during the last two years
than incomes in the non-agricultural sectors.
5.        A substantial savings and investment effort and generally effi-
cient management of the economy have contributed to economic growth. At
Independence, domestic savings were negligible and gross domestic invest-
ment was only 8.7 percent of GDP. By 1973, domestic savings had increased



to In percent of GDP and gross domestic investment to 20 percent, leaving
a resource gap of US$48 million.   A significant improvement in the financial
position of the Government has contributed to this impressive rise in savings.
At Independence, the Government was able to finance only about half of re-
current expenditure from local resources, the deficit being met by grants
and loans from the U.K. Between 1964 and 1973, however, improvements in
tax administration and some changes in the tax system caused domestic reve-
nue to rise annually by 15 percent, in comparison with an average increase
in recurrent expenditure of only 8 percent.    Consequently, the Government
Was abAe to balance its recurrent budget in 1972173 for the first time.
6.       lThe Government hias increased development expenditures at an
aiinual average rate of 20) percent over the last five years. and nas laid
-ieavy eimphasis otl infrastructure and agriculture. Infrastructure investments
hcive included tLle construction and improvement o- roads, particularly those
openirLg up the central and northern region, and the construction of a rail
l_n tro Nacala in Mozambique, which hias providedi a secoud rail outlet to
the sea.  Since 1969, the construction of a new capital at Lilongwe has
taken ufp about 10 percent of the Governmuent's annual development budget.
Since 1968, several large-scale agricultural scheries, including the provi-
sion of credit to small scale farmers and the supply of inputs, marketing
facilities and some basic infrastructure, lhave also been started near Salima
(wvith IDA credits).  Approximately one-fourth of total Government investment
has been in agriculture. Greater emplhasis is now being placed on this sec-
tor, and one-third of the US$176 million public. investment program over the
next three years will be devoted to agricultural development.
7.        Total investment was US$100 million in 1973 and it is expected to
grow by 8 percent (in real terms) througlhout the 1970's. A substantial role
is expected to be played by the private sector in Xalawi's future development,
and private investments are expected to equal those of the public sector.
Government has liberal policies to encourage both domiestic and foreign private
investment.  Domestic private capital is concentrated mainly in agriculture
and small trading enterprises. Larger scale business is dominated by foreign-
owned companies.
8.        WThereas Malawi has benefited fror, a very rapid1 expansion of agri-
culture, since indepen(ience, the room for future expansion is smaller. A1n
annual economic growth rate of over 6 percent seens likely in the 1970s.
Much of this will occur in the agricultural sector, as a result of increased
production of export crops such as tobacco, tea and _otton.    Small but growing
surpluses of maize, pulses, groundnuts, cassava and sugar are also expected.
Malawi's agricultural exports, which increased, in constant prices, at an
average rate of nearly 10 percent thirough 1973, are projected to rise by an
average of over 6 percent annually until 1980. lJith the increasing investment
program and growing consumer demand that can only be partly met by domestic
manufactures, it is likely that the country's import requirements will grow
more rapidly than in the past, increasing bv 6 percent annually in volume
until 1980. In 1973, the deficit on goods and services was US$52 million.



-3
Capital inflow has generally been adequate to finance deficits and build up
moderate reserves. In 1973, net capital inflow was US$70 million.
9.        The sustained improvement in the mobilization of domestic resources
for economic development is likely to continue during the rest of the decade.
Public savings, which have been negative in the past, shiould in the future
make a positive contribution to investment. In 1973, Malawi financed 52
percent of its investment from domestic resources; this proportion should
grow to about 60 percent by the end of the decade. The external capital re-
quirements will, however, continue to be in excess of the foreign exchange
component of projects and external aid should, thierefore, also cover some
local costs.
10.       At the end of 1973, Malawi's external public debt totalled $263
million of which $189 million had been disbursed. Debt service in that year
amounted to $11.2 million, or about 10 percent of export earnings. As Malawi's
need for external capital is expected to increase in the next few years, the
Government may encounter increasing difficulty in borroviing on terms as soft
as those it has received in the past. Debt service is likely to increase and
the debt service ratio could reach 15 percent by the. end of the decade. In
view of its low per capita income and the fluctuations of its export earnings,
Malawi should still continue to receive substantial amounts of external
assistance on concessionary terms but could also receive a limited amount
of assistance on harder terms.
PART I1- BANK GROUP OPL%kTIONS
11.       To date, eleven 1/ IDA credits amounting to US$66.6 million hiave
been made to -alawi.  Five of these credits, representing US$34 million
(51 percent of the total IDA investment in Malawi) were for projects in the
agricultural sector. The others consist of a US$11.5 miillion credit for
highways in 1968, a USS6.4 million credit for education in 1967, two credits
totalling US$12.75 million for power projects in 1970 and 1973, and a US$2
million credit for the planning and engineering of the infrastructural and
technical assistance requirements of a proposed pulp development scheme in
Northern Malawi. There have been no Bank loans or IFC investments. Annex Il
contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of September 30, 1974 and notes
on the execution of on-going projects. Project execution is generally satis-
factory.
12.       At the end of 1973, IDA's share in Malawi's total external debt
was 22.6 percent but servicing of IDA credits accounted for only 2.7 percent
of total debt service.
1I/ Excluding Credit No. S-2-MAI of US$0.49 million of 1967 for highway
engineering, which was made in 1967, and which has since been refinanced.



13.       Bank Group operations in Malawi will continue to emphasize rural
development. In accordance with the recommendations of the Agricultural
Sector Review Report on Malawi (No. 235a-MAI distributed to you on January 14,
1974), several projects are currently being prepared. Among these, the next
stage of the Lilongwe Rural Development program is scheduled to be presented
to you this fiscal year. A water supply project for Blantyre recently pre-
pared with U.K. assistance may be ready for presentation in fiscal year 1976.
Discussions on the development of the education sector are being held with
the Government and may well lead to IDA's consideration of a second education
project. Finally the Bank Group is assisting (through Credit S-17-MAI) the
Governm.ent in the preparation of a major pulp development project whose total
cost is currentlv estimated at over $300 million. If it is established that
the proiect is economically viable and satisfactorv arrangements can be made
for its implementation and for marketing, and if financing can be arranged on
an enclave basis so as not to burden Malawi's debt servicing capacity, we
expect to recommend that the Bank contribute to its financing.
PART III - TIIE TRANSPORT SECTOR
General
14.       A landlocked country, Malawi depends on several neighboring coun-
tries for the transportation requirements of its international trade. Its
terrain is varied with mountains in the north rising to 8,000 feet, and the
Shire Valley in the extreme south rising approximatelv 300 feet above sea
level.  The bulk of the population is in the lower half of the country which
has the most productive agricultural land. All these factors together make
the problems of economic and political integration verv difficult. As part
of its effort to overcome these difficulties, the Government has transferred
the capital of the country northwardl to Lilongwe in the Central Region and
is executing several development projects in the Nortlhern Region.   In recog-
nition of the important role which an adequate and efficient transport system
can play in integrating and developingg the countrv politically and economi-
cally, the Government has formulated a transport policv which has three
broad aims:   (i) to improve the adminiistrative, social andi economic integration
of the countrv bv linking all three Regions witlh reliable all-weather con-
nections; (ii) to encourage agricultural development by ir;proving access to
rural areas; and (iii) to ensure efficient and reliable access to the sea for
the transport of exports and ir,iports. Guided by this policy, the Government
has invested heavily in the transport sector and between 1964. when the
country became independenit, and 1970, 37 percent of pub,lic investrmient went
to the transport sector.
15.       The surface transport network is now made up of 6,750 m;iles of
road, 440 miles of railway and shipping routes on lalae lalawi.   Civil avia-
tion is relatively smialler, offering services to nine airports and airfields
spread around the country.   The southern half of the countrv, which is more



- 5 -
active economically, is served by fairly well developed transport facilities.
The northern half of the country and most of the rural areas have less de-
veloped transport facilities.
Railways
16.       The main railway line in the country is about 276 miles long.
A 63-mile branch offering an alternative route to the sea was completed in
1970 and an extension to the main line from Salima to Lilongwe is scheduled
to be built within the next five years. The railway carries mostly agri-
cultural products for export, and imported manufactured items. In 1972,
the railway carried about 1.1 million tons of freight and about 900,000
passengers. Despite the diversion of some traffic to roads, rail traffic in
ton-miles has grown at an average rate of over 12 percent annually over the
past ten years largely due to increasing import-export traffic. Malawi
Railways is wholly owned and controlled by the Government. Its financial
and operational management is competent and, in 1972, it had an operating
surplus of about US$1.3 million equivalent.
Lake Transport
17.       Freight and passenger transport on Lake Malawi is provided by
Lake Service Limited, a subsidiary of Malawi Railways. In 1972, Lake Ser-
vice Limited moved an estimated 28,000 tons of freight and some 105,700
passengers. Though these traffic volumes are relatively small, the Lake
provides an important alternative means of transport for the remote northern
parts of the country. About three-quarters of the lake traffic is northbound
but this will change as the impact of the IDA-assisted Karonga Rural Develop-
ment Project is felt. It is estimated that lake freight traffic will rise
to about 40,000 tons by 1975. In addition, lake transport will increase
sharply if the proposed pulp mill in the Northern Region is developed. Until
recently, the Lake Service incurred heavy operational deficits for many years.
Under the Karonga Rural Development Project (Credit 282-MAI), a review of
the rate structure was undertaken and increased freight rates recommended
by the review were implemented in September 1972. As a result of these
rate increases, revenue on goods traffic rose and an operating surplus was
achieved in 1973. Lake passenger service is expected to continue in deficit
because it is operated primarily as a social service to the remote parts of
the North and its rates have not been changed for many years.
Roads
18.       Roads are the most important mode in the transport sector.    In
1972, roads accounted for about 440 million ton-kilometers of freight or
two-thirds of the total freight moved by all modes of transport. Trunk
roads connect Blantvre (the major commercial city) in the Southern Region
and Lilongwe (the new capital city) in the Central Region. The strategy
which the Government has adopted for road development aims at providing
a basic trunk road system serving key points in the three Regions of the
country.



- 6 -
19.       The Government has evolved a Planning organization which is playing
an -increasin.g role in coordinating investments in the transpor. sector.  The
Ministry of Works and Supplies (MWS) prepares investment proposals for roads
while the Mlinistry of Transport and Communications (MrTC) prepares proposals
for all other modes.  These proposals are submitted to the Economic Planning
Division (EPl)) of the Office of the President and the Cabinet. The EPD has
the responsibility for ensuring the coordination of proposed investments
within the transport sector, and between the transport sector and the rest of
the economy. Until recently, coordination was inadequate because of staff
limitations. Since the development of particullar modes of transport in the
past has tended to he complementary rather than competitive, coordination of
investment in transport was not critical. IHowever, since the Government is
now embarking on an extensive transport development program encompassing the
various modes of transport, coordination has become essential. The Government's
'Statemenit of Development Policies 1971-1980' fixed prospective investment in
transport at about 30 percent of total public investment. The analysis re-
quired for this level of investment represents an important responsibility for
the EPfi. In recognition of this, the LPD has recently employed a transport
i-conomist with experience in sector investment analysis; in addition, a United
Klingdom-financed consultant is undertaking a transport planning study to
determine priorities for the period 1975-1985.
20.       The responsibility for planning, constructing and maintaining all
classified (except district) roads belongs to the Roads Department of the
Ministry of Works and Supplies. District roads are the responsibility of
District Councils. The Department has efficientlv met its responsibilities.
Most engineers in the Department are expatriate civil servants provided
through an aid program of the British Ministrv of Overseas Development under
2 to 2-1/2 year contracts. The Government is implementing a program of educa-
tional training of Malawian nationals for senior engineering positions, but
because of the long periods involved in the training of engineers, the program
is necessarily long-term. Both the United Kingdom Ministrv of Overseas
Development and the UNDP are assisting the Government in flnancing lower
echelon personnel such as road supervisors, foremen, equipment operators
and mechanics.
21.       The Roads Department maintains divisional offices in all three
regions of the country.  The maintenance operations are largely mechanized
though manual labor is used whienever feasible. In order to minimize expen-
ditures on the required equipment and also mnaximize the utilization of
available equipment, the MWS, in 1971, created a Plant and Vehicle Hire
Organization wlhich is responsible for procuring and maintaining all Government-
owned equipment and vehicles. The organization rents equipment to the Roads
Department at rates based on the cost of purchasing and maintaining the
equipment.  This centralization has improved the availability of equipment
to all regions of the country. Nevertheless, and in spite of the existence
of a reasonably well-trained cadre of maintenance personnel in each of the
regions, the level of maintenance operations is not adequate largely because
the funds allocated for this purpose have been consistently insufficient.



-7-
This problem has been discussed with the Government and the Government has
agreed that it would ensure that sufficient funds are allocated to the MWS
from time to time for proper maintenance of the road network. (See Section
4.04 of the draft Development Credit Agreement.)
22.       Road use is regulated by laws which cover such matters as limits on
vehicle weights and dimensions, vehicle and driving licenses, vehicle inspec-
tion, etc. These regulations are adequate though they have not had to be
strictly enforced because the majority of trucks now in use are of small capa-
city. There is, however, a trend towards larger vehicles which increases the
likelihood of serious damage to the roads. The Government has accordingly
agreed that vehicle weight and size regulations consistent with the structural
and geometric design of roads will be properly enforced. (See Section 4.02
of the draft Development Credit Agreement.)
23.       Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and duties
on fuel, lubricants, vehicles and spare parts and through licenses and regis-
tration fees. No data are available on the total revenues collected from these
sources, but the rates charged indicate that road users are already making a
substantial contribution to Government revenues.
24.       It is essential that improved data on road traffic trends be available
to strengthen the basis for road planning, enable the formulation of the appro-
priate road use regulatory policies and provide a more reliable basis for anti-
cipating the requirements of the road transport industry. The Government has
agreed to establish and maintain a suitable traffic data collection svstem
(See Section 4.03 of the draft Development Credit Agreement.)
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The preparation of the project was undertakeni withl the assistance
of a consulting engineering firm financed by the LIDP. The project was
appraised in Malawi in March 1974.   An Appraisal Report entitled "Appraisal
of the Second Highway Project, Malawi" is being circulated separately. A
credit and project summary is provided as Annex III. The proposed credit
was negotiated in Washington, D.C. in October 1974; the Government negotiating
team was led bv the Minister of Finance, the llonorable D. T. Matenje.
26.       The project consists of the following two parts:    (i) improvement
and bituminous paving of two lanes of the Lilonge-Kasungu Road (about 73
miles) including a bypass around the Lilongwe industrial area and the recon-
struction of the Lingadzi Bridge; and (ii) a pilot program for the improvement
of the development and maintenance of district roads. The total cost of the
project is estimated at about US$11.8 million equivalent (net of taxes)
including about US$4.3 million equivalent (about 36 percent) in local cur-
rency. The proposed IDA credit of US$10.0 million would meet about 84 percent



of total project costs net of taxes and will cover the required foreign exchange
(US$7.6 million) and make a substantial contribution to the local currency
requirements.  The Government will provide the balance from i-s own funds.
Execution of the project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1977.
27.       The Lilongwe-Kasungu road is a 73-mile segment of Mlaliwi's mLin
trunk road which runs from the M1ozambique border in the Soutih throug.h Lhe
country's main cities to the Zambian border in the North.    It is ctrrently
unpaved and its width varies between one and three lanes in different segments.
A section adjacent to it from Lilongwe to Zomba was recently iruprn;ed under
the first highway project finarnced through IDA credit No. 112-MAI of 1968.
Though the alignment of the road crosses flat to rolling terrairn and is, for
the most part, satisfactory, drainage is poor and the gravel surface is rough
wnder present traffic conditions.   Under the proposed project, the roaf v.ili
bo reconstructed for improved drainage and paved.
Construction, of the Road, bypass and the Bridge
28t       The Government department which will be in charge of the project
will be the Roads Department of the Ministry of Works and Supplies.     I;] recent
years, the Department has successfully undertaken several road coastrcz.ion
projects (about US$2.5 million equivalent annually) using its own equiplu2ent
and staff and employing direct labor. Its performance has been satisfactory.
For major road projects or whenever its own resources are fully oa,mnitted,
the Department employs contractors following suitable prequalific.rIton and
tendering procedures and contracts are usually let on a unit-price basis.
The capacity of the available Malawian contractors is very limit-< and major
road construction works can only be undertaken bv foreign contractc-s,     It
was therefore agreed that the contract for the construction of the _ilongwe-
Kasungu road, including the bypass and the Lingadzi Bridge would be submitted
to international competitive bidding in accordance with the Association's
procurement guidelines.   Since there has not been a -major road work 1hne
under contract in Malawi in recent years, it was considered desirable to
receive tenders prior to presenting the project to you to ensure that the
cost estimates are realistic. The pre-qualification of contractors was
conpleted in June 1974.   Of the 19 firms fror) X countries which submitted
pre-qualification documents, 15 were pre-qualified and 6 of them submitted
bids.  The bids have been reviewed by thie Government and the lowest bid, which
the Government proposes to accept, is within the estirmates calculated during
appraisal. Construction work is scheduled to beg;in in Marchi 1975 and be
completed by the end of 1976.   Thie pavement structure will be composed of
natural gravel subbase and cement-stabilized-base course with a double
bituminous surface treatment.   If the quality of the base gravel when placed
on the road proves adequate, cemient stabilization will be omitted. In that
event, some savings in the project costs may be realized.    The Government
will consult with the Association before a decision is made on tlhe type of
base course to be used (See Section 3.01(c) of the draft Developrment Credit
Agreement.)



- 9 -
29.       The supervision of the construction work under the project will be
undertaken by the consultants who conducted the feasibility study and prepared
the detailed engineering for the project. The consultants will be retained
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. (See Section
3.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
PilotPrormfrteIrovement MdMaintenan e                  Dsrc      od
30.       District Councils have the responsibility for the maintenance of
district roads. Performance has, however, been poor. They are inadequately
staffed, poorly funded and short of maintenance equipment. District roads
are largely in poor condition and consequently impede agricultural develop-
ment in several rural areas. The Government is anxious to build an effective
maintenance organization. However, before modifying the existing system, it
wishes to demonstrate the greater effectiveness of alternative arrangements.
It has accordingly decided to undertake a pilot program in Kasungu District
(one of the country's twenty-three districts) which has 250 miles of district
roads and is an important agricultural area in which development has particu-
larly been impeded by the poor condition of its feeder road network.
31.       Under the project, Kasungu District's road maintenance capacity
will be strengthened by the provision of essential road maintenance equipment
and the construction of a small workshop cum office and several road camps
for maintenance crews. The necessary personnel will be employed to program
and supervise operations. Also, under the program, MWS will carry out a
study to determine (i) the most suitable method of road maintenance in terms
of combinations of labor and equipment; (ii) the appropriate level of opera-
tional and training funding; and (iii) the feasibility of extending the pro-
gram to other districts.
32.       The pilot program will be controlled by the MWS working in close
cooperation with the District Council of Kasungu. The maintenance equipment,
estimated to cost about US$36,000 equivalent, will be procured locally and
in accordance with usual Government procurement procedures which are satis-
factory. The few buildings required under the program will be constructed
by local contractors after competitive bidding. The program is expected to
start in mid-1975 and yield preliminary results in late 1976. The MWS will
review these results and thereafter make recommendations to the Government
on the possibility of extending it to other districts. The Government has
agreed that prior to implementation, it would discuss with the Association,
its proposals for extending the district roads maintenance program to all
other parts of the country. (See Section 3.07 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
Disbursement
33.       Reimbursements covering 80 percent of the total cost of the civil
works under the Lilongwe-Kasungu road will be made to the Government on the
basis of work certificates prepared by the Ministry of works and supplies;



- 10 -
for consultant services, disbursements covering 100 percent of foreign expen-
ditures will be made directly to consultants and, under the pilot program,
reimbursements covering 100 percent of the foreign expenditures and 50 per-
cent of local expenditures will be made to the Government.
Justification
34.       As part of the main trunk road system of the country, the Lilongwe-
Kasungu rcad is a vital link in the national transport network.    Lilongwe,
the new capital of the country, is also an important transsihipment point for
goods transported to and from the nortlhern half of the countrv. It's present
population of 75,000 is expected to reach 175,000 by 1980 when it is also
expected to have a direct rail connection to the Indian Ocean.
35.       The project will serve about one-half million small farmers who
grow and market maize, grotndnuts and tobacco.    Two important schemes de-
signed to increase agricultural production are also underway in the project
area:  the Lilongwe Agricultural Development for which the Association has
made two credits (Credit 113-MfAI of 1968 in an amount of US$6.0 million and
Credit 244-MAI of 1971 in an amount of US$7.25 million), and a program for
flue-curing tobacco which has become an important processing industry near
Kasungu. The Kasungu Game Reserve is an important tourist attraction in the
project area.
36.       Traffic on the project road is projected to grow at about 9 percent
annually until 1986, levelling off thereafter to about 8 percent annually.
Taking into ac-:ount savi:s iin vehicular operating and road ma.:1tL-na-a:ce uo_sts,
the proposed iTnvestLmzents are expected to yield an econaomic return of 14
percent. If it proves unnecessary to cement-stabilize the base of the road,
thle economic return will be 16 percent.   If traffic is more conservatively
estimated to grow at only 7 percent annually throtughout the project life,
the economic return on the proposed investment (with a cement-stabilized base)
remains satisfactory at 13 percent; a 10 percent decrease in savings in
vehicle operating costs would also have the effe:t of reducing the return to
about 13 percent. If both the traffic growth rate and vehicle operating
cost savings fall to 7 percent and 10 percent respectivelv, the economic
return remains satisfactory at 12 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRM .NTS A:M1) AUTliORITY

national primarv teacher training college and the provisioll of technical
instruction facilities irn 12 secondarv schools.   The project has been
implemented satisfactorily and school premises have been in use for about
two years.  At the request of the Government, the Closing Date was first
extended from the original date of December 31, 1972 to June 30, 1973 to
allow di3bursement for the completion of construction of the college, which
was delayed by a chiange in site.  A second extension, to March 29, 1974, was
agreed to allow disbursement for installation of electricity in the secondary
schooL at Dedza.   A request fronm the Government to use savings under the
credit, amounting to about US$420,000 for the construction of a post and
telecommunications school was agreed to by the Executive Directors on
December 4, 1973. The closing date has consequently been furtlher postpc.ed
to June 30, 1977. Implementation of the telecommunications school is pro-
gressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 244-MAI - Agriculture - Liwe Development Project Phase II:
$7.3 million credit of Mav 13, 1971; Closing date Mlarclh 31, 1976:
The project is designed to add approximately 375,000 acres of
smallholder crops and a 160,000 acres of cattle ranch to the 500,000 acres
developed under the Phase I Project. Physical execution of the project is
progressing most satisfactorily. Both the staffing of senior posts and
stocking of the cattle ranch which had previouslv fallen behind schedule
have now improved.
Credit No. 282-M4AI - Agriculture - Karonga Development Project: $6.6 million
credit of January 26, 1971; Closingdate December 31, 1977:
The project is the first phase of an agricultural development pro-
gram for the Karonga area. It includes development of irrigated rice culti-
vation, dry-land crop production, livestock development, extension services,
credit, health services and the rehabilitation of freight service on Lake
Malawi. Cost overruns are expected on the improvement of the lake ports

the progress of proJects in execution, and in particuilar to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action taken to remedy
them.  They should be read in this sense, and with the understandirg
that they do not purport to present a balaniced evaluation ot strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

involved, due to lack of experience with marine works in Malawi, remoteness
of the northern terminal and basic material price increases. The latter also
affects the cost of civil works under the agricultural component. Discussions
are underway with the Government on how best to meet the expected cost over-
runs.
Credit No. 363-MAI - Agriculture - Shire Valley Development ProLect
Phase II: $10.5 million credit of March 28, 1973; Closing date
December 31 1978:
The project is a continuation and expansion of the program completed
under Phase I and includes, in addlition to extension services, credit and
marketing facilities, a livestock component, health facilities, fisheries
developnment, feeder road construction, research on irrigated and rainfed crops,
land registration and wildlife protection. Project execution is satisfactory.
Credit No. 426-MAI - Second Power Project: $7.5 million credit of
September 7, 1973; Closingdate December 31, 1978:
The project provides part of Malawi's power generation development
program for the period 1973-1977 and consists of: (a) the construction of a
barrage and 20 MW hydroelectric power station at Tedzani, as an extension to
the station financed under Credit 178-MAI; (b) the installation of a 12 MW
gas turbine, to be constructed at Blantyre; and (c) a tariff study. The pro-
ject is being financed jointly with CDC which will lend up to US$6.1 million
equivalent. As a result of recent world-wide increases in prices, cost over-
runs of about $6.0 million over the appraisal estimate of $14.3 million are
anticipated and the Government is considering measures to meet additional
financing requirements. In spite of the cost overruns the project remains
the best choice among the various alternatives to meet projected power demand.
Credit No. S-17--MAI - Transport Engineering and Services Project:
US$2.0 million credit of June 137 1974; Closing date June 30, 1978:
The project consists of the determination of the infrastructural
requirements and the provision of technical assistance for the exploitation
of the Viphya forest resources. A contract for the study of the project
roads has been awarded and another contract for the study of the ports is
being negotiated. Execution of the project is proceeding according to schedule.
