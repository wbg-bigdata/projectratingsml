IGDIR-AKSU-EREGLI-ERCIS(IAEE) IRRIGATION PROJECT
Borrower:          Republic of Turkey.
Beneficiaries:    General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI).
General Directorate of Land and Water Conservation
(TOPRAKSU).
General Directorate of Agricultural Affairs.
Amount:            US$115.3 million (including capitalized front-end fee).
Terms:             Fifteen years including five years of grace, with standard
variable interest rate.
Project            The project supports the Government's efforts to accelerate
Description:    completion of priority irrigation schemes.  Four subprojects
have been selected: Igdir, Aksu, Eregli and Ercis (IAEE) and
for each the project would assist in financing (i)
completion of irrigation and drainage infrastructure; (ii)
on-farm development works; (iii) strengthening of the
extension system; (iv) operation and maintenance equipment;
and (v) staff training. The project would also include
preparation of an irrigation investment master plan and
strategy review.
Benefits and       At full development, about 113,000 hectares (net) will
Risks            benefit from new or more efficient and secure irrigation,
and improved extension services. About 25,000 farm families
will have their average net incomes increased to about 2.5
times their income without the project. About 20,000 more
people will find temporary employment during the three
months of peak farm labor. Incremental annual agricultural
production is estimated at about $107 million equivalent in
1982 prices. The irrigation strategy review is expected to
lead to a significant improvement in the Government's
investment priorities and implementation capabilities in
this subsector. There are no unusual technical risks. The
major risk is that inadequate budgetary support could delay
project implementation. Arrangements for an annual review
of the local currency budget should give the Bank an early
opportunity to press for additional funding, if necessary,
and the establishment of a revolving fund for payments on
civil works contracts should facilitate timely payments to
contractors.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR THE IGDIR-AKSU-EREGLI-ERCIS (IAEE) IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$115.3 million (including
capitalized front-end fee) to help finance completion of four irrigation
subprojects. The loan would have a term of 15 years including 5 years grace
at the standard variable interest rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       A report entitled "Turkey:  Policies and Prospects for Growth"
(No. 2657a-TU) and the Postscript thereto, were distributed to the Executive
Directors in December 1979 and March 1980, respectively. Updating of economic
prospects has since been undertaken through the continuing work on structural
adjustment loans (SALs) to Turkey and several special economic missions. The
report of a mission to evaluate the investment program and entitled "Turkey:
Public Sector Investment Review" (No. 3472-TU) was distributed to the
Executive Directors in December 1981. The report of a mission to review
Turkey's industrialization and trade strategy entitled "Turkey:
Industrialization and Trade Strategy" (No. 3641-TU), was distributed to the
Executive Directors in March 1982. The report of a mission to review energy
sector policies entitled "Turkey: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector"
(No. 3877-TU) was distributed to the Executive Directors in March 1983.
Missions to review recent economic developments and analyse the medium-term
prospects, to study the agricultural sector and the financial system visited
Turkey at various times in 1982. Their findings are reflected in this section.
3.       Turkey is about as big as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 46 million and an estimated GNP per capita of US$1540.
The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of agricultural
land), and about 45 percent live in urban centres. Although population growth
is below the median for middle-income countries (2.2 percent per annum), and
despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as substantial
emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the Middle
East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an unemployment
rate currently about 16 percent. There is, however, little or no absolute
poverty, although income distribution is relatively skewed. There are also
considerable regional differences and large rural-urban disparities. Recent
data indicate a probable worsening in income distribution, especially of wage
and salary earners, and a sharp real decline in the minimum wage. Educational
enrollments have expanded greatly but the rate of adult literacy remains
relative low (60 percent in 1975).



- 2-
Development Strategy Prior to 1980
4s.      Turkish development strategy during the 1960s and 1970s aimed at
rapid growth through high rates of investment with the main emphasis on
industrialization. Import substitution was favored over exports, with State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs) playing an important role in the industrialization
strategy as well as in regional development. These policies, supported by
agricultural expansion and growing workers' remittances, helped to bring
about a favorable growth record throughout the First and Second Plan periods
(1963-72). A continuation of these policies in the face of the various
exogenous shocks of the 1970s, including the rise in world oil prices and
stagflation in the OECD economies, helpted to maintain growth well into the
1970s, but finally proved unsustainable.
5.       To maintain its growth momentum in the Third Plan (1973-77), Turkey
financed a large part of its investment and import requirements through
reserve decumulation and heavy external borrowing, particularly short-term.
The rapid GNP growth, averaging around 7.7 percent per year in 1973-76, came
to an abrupt halt in mid-1977 as the massive external debt burden led to a
sharp deterioration in credit-worthiness, severe shortages of imports and
disruptions in industrial production with a rise in urban unemployment; GNP
growth slowed down sharply to 4.0 percent in 1977 and to a negative figure in
1979. At the same time, domestic inflation accelerated from 24 percent in
1977 to an average of 64 percent in 1979.
6.       By the end of 1979, the rate of domestic inflation had reached over
100 percent and had become an issue of critical importance. Although
international price increases and domestic cost-push factors influenced the
inflationary process, as substantial monetary expansion was the main cause.
The monetary imbalances originated mainly from the Government's budget
deficits and the huge financing requirements of the SEEs. Political and
social unrest aggravated the economic difficulties. It was in these
exceptional circumstances that the January 1980 reform measures were adopted.
The Government's New Policy Priorities and Actions
7.       The Government's program for stabilization and restructuring of the
Turkish economy was initiated in January 1980 and is now entering its fourth
year. The program has involved policy measures which have effects both in the
short- and medium-term. In an effort to stabilize the crisis situation, a
series of urgent measures were introduced to restrict domestic demand. These
measures included enforcing tight credit ceilings by the Central Bank,
reducing the budget deficit through expenditure control and increased
taxation, and restraining growth of wages and salaries. Over the medium-term,
the program is designed to restore a better balance between the public and
private sectors of the economy and achieve sustainable growth. The key
elements of this program are: the adoption of a realistic and flexible
exchange rate and incentives to encourage producers to export; deregulation of
interest rates to reflect market conditions and encourage private savings; the
strengthening of public finances through tax reform; measures to improve
institutional efficiency in key sectors; a rationalization of the public
investment program; and a reform of the SEEs designed to reduce their burden
on the budget and improve their efficiency.



- 3 -
8.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
three structural adjustment loans, involves far-reaching changes affecting all
facets of the Turkish economy. It entails substantial changes in attitudes,
institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which take time and
face considerable resistance. In view of the severity of the crisis, and the
urgent need to bring down inflation and stabilize the balance of payments as
quickly as possible, the Government accepted the need for a temporary
sacrifice of growth and social objectives. Drastic structural changes were
made in the operation of the exchange rate regime, the tax system, interest
rate policy, export strategy, the SEE sector and public investment policy.
9.       The implementation of the program is being carried out by a military
regime which assumed power in September 1980 following a period of sustained
unrest, terrorism and deterioration in the parliamentary process.  This
Government, like previous military regimes in 1960-61 and 1971-73, has
emphasized its commitment to restore civilian rule. A Consultative Assembly
was set up to draft a new constitution, which was overwhelmingly endorsed in a
nationwide referendum in November 1982. New election and party laws are
expected to be promulgated soon, and parliamentary elections are scheduled for
October 1983.
Effects of the Structural Adjustment Process -- 1980-83
10.      The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the program
launched in 1980, and in many cases actual performance has met or exceeded the
Government's own targets. Real GNP, after falling for two consecutive years,
expanded by 4.2 percent in 1981 and 4.4 percent in 1982. Growth has been
mainly export-led, with less than one quarter of the growth in 1982 due to
domestic demand. Demand for consumption increased by 3 percent while fixed
investment grew at a modest 4.1 percent (both in real terms) in 1982, and
depletion of inventories helped to expand supply. Public investment grew
significantly slower than private investment, thus reversing the trend of
previous years. However, unemployment continued to grow in 1981 and 1982, as
employment opportunities did not increase fast enough to absorb the expansion
of the labor force.
11.      Through a combination of fiscal, monetary and income policies, the
Government has been remarkably successful in reducing the rate of inflation.
After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the annual average rate of increase in
the wholesale price index declined to 37 percent in 1981 and around 25 percent
in 1982, which was the program target. However, the degree of credit
restraint needed to reduce inflation this rapidly, has had a marked effect on
liquidity in the economy and has helped to maintain interest rates at high
real levels.
12.      Commercial bank interest rates which were deregulated in July 1980
have increased substantially; with inflation gradually coming down, they are
now markedly positive in real terms. As a result, total bank deposits
increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and in 1981 this trend accelerated,
with total deposits growing by 104 percent and time deposits by 263 percent.
Growth in deposits slowed somewhat in 1982, and the bankruptcy in late June
1982 of a major non-bank financial institution shook depositor confidence and



- 4 -
was followed by a shift of funds into the larger banks. While the Government
has averted an immediate crisis in the banking sector, additional actions to
reform and strengthen the financial sector as a whole are urgently required.
Tbe Government is at present preparing a new banking law which aims to
strengthen the equity position and management of banks.
13.      While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to
save, they have also meant high borrowing costs. The current real interest
rate for non-preferential credits is about 28 percent. These high interest
rates, together with the limited availability of credit, have led to
considerable liquidity problems for the private business sector, particularly
for businesses supplying the domestic market. The banks have taken steps to
lower rates on deposits and reduce the tax on interest received by banks with
the aim of reducing interest on credit. But the liquidity problem of the
private business sector is compounded by under-capitalization which had been
erncouraged by easy access to cheap bank credit in the past. Tax changes and
other measures are under preparation to encourage the corporate sector to
raise paid-up capital to levels commensurate with those in other countries.
14.      There has been encouraging progress in the fiscal area.  The budget
deficit was reduced from 4.6 percent of GNP in 1980 to 1.2 percent in 1982.
Government expenditures as a percentage of GNP declined from 22.6 percent in
1981 to 21.5 percent in 1982, but the impact on the deficit was offset by a
slower growth in revenues than programmed. The SEE accounts showed a marked
improvement, with net profits climbing to 0.5 percent of GNP in 1982 from 0.1
percent in 1981 and their financing requirements falling from 8.8 percent of
GNP in 1981 to 5.7 percent in 1982. Moreover, supplementary appropriations
were cancelled. Public sector borrowing requirements dropped from a level of
6.,5 percent of GNP in 1981 to 5.2 percent in 1982.
15.      On the external account, the flexible exchange rate policy under
which the Turkish lira has been adjusted daily since May 1981, together with
the new export-oriented policies, led to an unprecedented export growth in
1981 when exports amounted to US$4.7 billion, or 63 percent higher in dollar
terms than the 1980 level. Increases were concentrated in manufactured goods
which experienced a rise of nearly 120 percent; product groups with the
largest increases included textiles, clothing, cement, iron/steel, and
non-electrical equipment, with the Middle East becoming an increasingly
important market. Exports in 1982 reached US$5.75 billion, about 22 percent
increase over 1981, despite a significant decline in export prices,
particularly prices of agricultural products. As in the previous year,
manufactured exports were the major source of expansion, as exporters
continued to make inroads into the Middle East.
115.     A new and rapidly growing source of foreign exchange is income earned
from construction contracts (with a gross value of around US$11 billion in
1982) in the Middle East and North African countries. These activities are
also expected to add to the normal flow of worker remittances, which remained
strong throughout 1981, although declining slightly in 1982, reflecting the
appreciation of the US dollar vis-a-vis European currencies as well as the
iimpact of the recession in Western Europe.



17.      Imports declined in dollar terms by 2.3 percent in 1982 compared to
1981, due mainly to weaker prices of oil and raw material imports, a stronger
US dollar, a reduction in stocks and the elimination of a risk premium
previously paid by Turkish importers. As a result of these developments, the
current account balance showed a significant improvement in 1981 and 1982,
with the deficit reduced from 5.6 percent of GNP in 1980 to 3.5 percent in
1981 and about 1.7 percent in 1982, well below program targets. By the end of
1981, outstanding external disbursed debt amounted to US$17.5 billion
equivalent or about 30 percent of GNP. Multilateral agencies and official
bilateral sources accounted for about two-thirds of the total outstanding. Of
the total, only 12 percent constituted short-term debt, a marked contrast to
the position in 1978 when short-term debt accounted for half of total
outstanding debt.
18.      A modest pickup of growth (4.8 percent) is anticipated in 1983
concurrent with a slowdown of inflation (to about 20 percent), based on a
slight recovery in private investment and higher capacity utilization rates.
The current account deficit is expected to decrease to US$870 million in 1983
from US$1 billion in 1982, representing a slight fall in relation to GNP
(1.5 percent as against 1.7 percent). These results are based on a 17 percent
projected growth in exports, a marginal improvement in workers' remittances,
(both predicated on a revival of growth in the industrial economies) and a
13 percent growth in imports (required by the upturn in domestic demand).
Medium-term Prospects
19.      It is expected that the draft Fifth Five Year Development Plan
(1984-1988) will be completed by mid-1983. Projections prepared by the recent
Economic Mission indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilization
program until 1985, which can be followed by a growth strategy aiming at about
6-6.5 percent per annum GDP growth consistent with a manageable balance of
payments.
20.      Two basic assumptions on the sustainability of export growth and on
fiscal discipline have guided the projections. The continued growth of
exports is based on the view that conditions that have made possible the
1981-82 upsurge are not temporary. Specifically, it assumes continuation of a
flexible exchange rate policy, export incentives and import liberalization.
Secondly, it also assumes that the monetary and fiscal policy restraints will
not be relaxed to a point that will revive inflation, thus disrupting the
basic shift in development strategy.
21.      The projections of key economic variables for the period 1983-1990
are presented in Table below. Merchandise exports are projected to continue
to grow at 9.5 percent in real terms into the late 1980s on the basis of a
continuation of present policies for export promotion. Such a scenario would
also require improvement in the pace of import liberalization in order to
reduce the profit bias against exports.

22.      Merchandise imports are projected to grow slowly in real terms
through 1984 and then to pick up from 7-8 percent to an average of a little
over 9 percent for the 1985-90 period in line with the growth of demand.
23.      The current account balance, under these assumptions, would show a
decreasing deficit for 1982-85 as stabilization curtails imports while
encouraging exports. As growth sets in, the trend would be reversed for the
1985-90 period, and Turkey's current account deficit would increase again.
The terminal year 1990 would show a deficit of US$1.8 billion as compared to a
1985 projected deficit of US$485 million.
24.      The projected capital account would remain manageable throughout the
projection period given the need to restrain the growth of debt and maintain a
reasonable debt service ratio. This would permit Turkey to meet the
amortization and interest payments arising from the US$9.6 billion of debts
rescheduled between 1978-82 and maintain an exchange reserve equivalent to two
months' imports.
25.      Consistent with this scenario, the projections indicate a GDP growth
of 5 percent per annum for 1982-85 (stabilization period), and a higher figure
of 6.1 percent per annum for 1985-90 (growth period). Achievement of these
growth rates will be necessarily dependent on the growth of the productive
sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing. The achievement of sectoral
growth will depend to a large extent on the Government's determination to
render the public sector more efficient and to create a more favorable
investment climate for the private sector.



26.      The medium-term scenario presented above assumes an increasingly
important role for private sector investment in line with the policy of
rationalizing public sector investment in the manufacturing sector.
Accordingly, private investment is expected to grow at an average annual rate
of 9.6 percent during 1982-85 and 11 percent during 1985-90. As a corollary,
the real growth of public investment will slow down from a high of 7.8 percent
per annum during 1980-82 to a more moderate 5.0 percent during 1982-85 and
eventually to 4.4 percent per annum for 1985-90. This is consistent with the
framework of achieving the medium-term goal of an equal balance in the ratio
of private and public fixed investment by 1990.
Creditworthiness
27.      At the end of 1978, Turkey faced an overwhelming debt burden of
US$7.5 billion in short-term debt and US$6.8 billion of medium- and long-term
debt. Turkey was faced with service payment ohligations (mostly on short-term
debt) of US$5.1 billion (including arrears), or nearly three times the value
of merchandise exports in 1977. Following the resolution of the 1978 debt
crisis, Turkey pursued a very conservative policy of external borrowing which
was restricted almost entirely to long-term borrowing. Much of this was
arranged through the OECD Consortium for Turkey and was extended on
concessional terms. Also, between 1978-1980 Turkey rescheduled some
US$9.6 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of rescheduling
arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors. Approximately
US$6.0 billion of short-term debt, including US$2.6 billion in convertible
Turkish lira deposits and bankers credits and US$1.2 billion of non-guaranteed
suppliers credits, were consolidated into medium-term loans or partially
converted into Turkish lira obligations. As a result of the these measures,
short-term debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent
in 1978 to 12.5 percent in 1981. Inflows were mostly from official sources --
major creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the
total debt outstanding at end-1981, 87 percent constituted medium- and
long-term debt. Based on the growth scenario outlined earlier, debt
outstanding and disbursed as a percent of GDP is projected to rise from 28
percent in 1981 to 31 percent in 1982 and then fall to 29 percent in 1985 and
26 percent in 1990.
28.      Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the coming
years. Accordingly, the debt service ratio is projected to increase to
24.2 percent in 1982 from about 14 percent in 1981 as a result of a large
repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier OECD agreements.
Projections beyond 1982 show a decline of the debt service ratio to
19.4 percent in 1984, an increase to 20.6 percent in 1985 (again on account of
repayments of rescheduled debt), and then a fall to 18.1 percent in 1990. The
debt burden should remain manageable, provided current policies are
successfully implemented, the export drive is sustained, and Turkey continues
to receive further international support from private and official donors.
29.      On all aspects of economic analysis, the IMF and the Bank have
coordinated closely with each other, and Turkey continues to be in good
standing with the IMF. A three-year standby arrangement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1,250 million was approved by the IMF's Board and became
effective on June 18, 1980. Under the arrangement, Turkey has thus far made
ten purchases totalling SDR 1,060 million. The present standby is to expire
on June 17, 1983 and a one year extention is being sought by the Turkish
authorities.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
30.      Through May 31, 1983 the Bank/IDA have lent US$3,939 million to
Turkey, through 71 projects. Agriculture accounts for 18 percent of funds
lent, industry and DFCs for 34 percent, power for 13 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 26 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education and tourism for the remaining 9 percent. As of
March 31, 1983, IFC commitments to Turkey totalled about US$236 million, of
which about $82 million were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a summary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1983,
with notes on the status of ongoing projects.
31.      The execution of Bank-financed projects in the public sector has been
slow, due in part to weak management, limited coordination amongst ministries,
staffing problems, and the serious external and domestic financial crisis from
1977 to 1979. There has been notable improvement since September 1980.
Nevertheless, problems persist in many cases, reflecting difficulties in
staffing the public sector at current salaries, over-centralized bureaucratic
structures, and continuing constraints on the availability of local funds.
The implementation of private sector projects has generally been more
satisfactory. Recently, however, the high interest rates for working capital
combined with depressed domestic demand and reluctance of investors to take
the foreign exchange risk, have led to slow commitments under DFC lending.
Disbursements average 53 percent of appraisal estimates (excluding structural
adjustment loans) as compared to 55 percent for Tunisia and 45 percent for
Morocco.
32.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of redirecting the Turkish economy towards a development path placing more
reliance on market forces and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy.
These objectives also include increasing domestic savings and reorienting a
restrained public investment program to reflect the Government's priorities of
completing ongoing projects faster and emphasizing quick-yielding new
investments with positive balance of payments impact. The main vehicle for
the Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program. Three SALs have so far been approved and a
fourth is expected to be ready for Board presentation shortly.
33.      Agriculture, industry, transportation and energy will continue to be
the key sectors for project lending. In agriculture, projects are expected to
emphasize irrigation, credit, and reform of the extension and research
services. In industry (including DFCs), the emphasis will he on the promotion
of exports, employment, and increasing operational efficiency. Energy
projects underway are for power generation based on domestic hydro and lignite
resources, as well as enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas exploration.
Future projects will emphasize both the oil/gas and coal/lignite sub-sectors.
In addition, transportation projects will focus on developing the
infrastructure to facilitate exports and improve the efficiency of
operations. Projects for industrial training, urban and regional development
and public utilities may supplement these efforts.



- 9 -
34.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work undertaken recently includes studies of the agricultural and financial
sectors. Topics likely to be covered in the future include a review of the
next five-year development plan, employment, SEEs, transportation and the
agro-industrial subsector.
35.      This is the first loan to Turkey to be presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year. Loans for agricultural credit, power
transmission, development of the Thrace gas field, and a fourth loan for
structural adjustment are also expected to be ready for Board presentation
shortly. Other projects being processed include: technical assistance to
SEEs, industrial training, agricultural extension, gas utilization and
rehabilitation of the paper industry.
36.      The Bank Group's share of the estimated total external debt was
9 percent in 1981, and is expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1985; its
share of total debt service payments is projected to increase from about
13 percent in 1981 to about 14 percent in 1985.
37.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum,
iron and steel products, meat processing, motor bicycle engines, truck
manufacture, piston rings and cylinder liners, and tourism. It has also
invested in the Turkish Industrial Development Bank (TSKB). New investment
opportunities are being pursued.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
38.      While the importance of the agricultural sector in the economy is
declining, it still represents about 20 percent of GDP, about half of export
earnings and about 60 percent of civilian employment. The growth rates of
agricultural GDP and exports are projected to remain below those for the rest
of the economy. Nevertheless, agricultural growth has a significant role to
play in providing foreign exchange earnings and employment.
39.      Through the 1970s, Turkey's agricultural policies were
inward-looking, stressing food self-sufficiency through subsidized inputs and
producer prices. This led to relatively rapid growth of production initially,
but this could not be maintained due to the strain placed upon the budget and
competing demands for resources from the manufacturing sector. An over-valued
exchange rate discouraged exporting and exports in 1979 amounted to less than
one percent of production. The foreign exchange crisis in the late seventies
led to the adoption of new policies in 1980 featuring the maintenance of a
realistic exchange rate and reduction of agricultural subsidies. These
policies, combined with improved export incentives, led to an increase in
agricultural export earnings in 1980 and 1981 at an annual average rate of 29
percent. This trend is expected to continue, although at a less rapid rate,
over the next few years. The rate of growth of agricultural production fell
initially with the reduction of subsidies, but has rebounded in 1982 due to
good weather and an adjustment by farmers to a more market-oriented farming
environment.



- 10 -
4-0.     The possibilities for growth through expansion of the cultivable area
were largely exhausted by the mid-1970s. Growth must now come primarily from
increased productivity and changing the crop mixture to reflect better
rurkey's comparative advantage.  The demands of an export oriented approach
imply a change of emphasis from food self-sufficiency to increased net
agricultural contribution to the balance of trade, and thus food imports must
increase if food consumers are not to be penalized. Increased productivity
will require expansion in the irrigated area through increased efficiency of
The implementing agencies, better extension and research programs, and
i:ncreased imports of improved seeds and appropriately-sized equipment. Other
important issues in the sector include improved sector planning, continued
progress in reduction of subsidies, increased availability of credit
(particularly for small and medium scale farmers), and reform of agricultural
SEEs and marketing agencies. With adequate progress on these issues and
continued adherence to policies designed to encourage exports, it should be
possible for agricultural sector GDP to grow at about 3 percent per year over
the next decade.
The Irrigation Subsector
4F1.     One of the most important opportunities available for increasing
agricultural production and employment is through expansion of irrigation.
Out of a total cultivated area of about 27.7 million hectares (ha) only about
3 million ha are irrigated and substantial potential exists for increasing the
irrigated area. Most of the currently irrigated area is not used very
intensively. Most of about 1 million ha of private irrigation schemes is
handicapped by unreliable sources of water, use of traditional irrigation
methods, lack of land levelling and suboptimal cropping patterns. Of the 2.0
million ha under the command of public irrigation infrastructure, about 0.3 -
0.4 million ha have not yet been fully equipped with on-farm works to make
efficient use of the water provided. Finally, part of the area with adequate
facilities is inadequately operated leading to low water efficiency and less
than optimal yields.
42.      Two public agencies are responsible for construction of irrigation
facilities. The General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) of the
Ministry of Power and Natural Resources is responsible for the construction of
the basic irrigation infrastructure of large scale projects (requiring water
supply of more than 500 liters/second). The General Directorate of Land and
Water Conservation (TOPRAKSU) of the Ministry of Village Affairs handles the
development of small-scale projects and the construction of on-farm
development works on DSI's schemes. These agencies have not been able to
contribute fully to agricultural productivity increases because of budget
constraints, attempts to work on too many projects, excessive reliance upon
force account work, and poor supporting services resulting in slow project
completion and limited agricultural benefits. Whereas about 50-60,000 ha were
being completed annually by DSI in the early 1970s, this has declined to less
than 30,000 ha per year in the last 3-4 years. Similarly TOPRAKSU has
recently been able to complete only 20,000 ha per year of small-scale
projects, as compared to 45-50,000 ha annually in the early 1970s. TOPRAKSU's
backlog of work for on-farm development on DSI's schemes is now about
300-400,000 ha.



- 11 -
43.      To meet the 3 percent per year growth target for agricultural GDP,
sufficient budgetary allocations will have to be made to these two public
construction agencies, and their capability to complete irrigation projects
will have to be increased. This particularly applies to TOPRAKSU, considering
the magnitude of its work backlog. TOPRAKSU has a theoretical capability to
irrigate only 30-50,000 ha/year by force account. Therefore, much more
extensive use of contractors under TOPRAKSU's supervision is essential, and
could increase the capability to about 100,000 ha/year. To support a public
investment program of this magnitude, the following will also be required:
(i)   a continuation of the emphasis given since 1980 to quickly gestating
irrigation investments and completion/rehabilitation of areas
presently under the command of existing or nearly completed
infrastructure;
(ii)   the preparation by DSI and TOPRAKSU of a detailed medium-term
investment program to establish investment priorities among the
various partially completed projects and to develop implementation
plans, taking account of financing constraints and availability of
staff and equipment;
(iii)   in parallel with a rapid expansion of the agencies' construction
capacity (in particular through a marked increase in the use of
private contractors by TOPRAKSU), a corresponding expansion of the
agencies' technical and engineering staff to refine their longer term
scheduling and planning as well as project identification and
evaluation capabilities, accelerate the rate of project prepa-
ration and finalization of designs, and expand their construction and
operation and maintenance (O & M) training capabilities;
(iv)   improved measures for recovery of construction and 0 & M costs and
collection of on-farm development costs so as to generate additional
resources for sustaining further public investments in the subsector
and foster more intensive and efficient land use in irrigated areas;
and
(v) the development of effective agricultural extension services able to
introduce irrigated techniques to first time users and to forge a
link between applied research and the farmers for the dissemination
of improved technology.
44.      In accordance with the recommendations of the Public Sector
Investment Review (para 2), the Government has reoriented its annual
irrigation investment budgets to concentrate on projects close to completion.
It has also agreed (see para. 58) to complete a detailed irrigation investment
master plan embodying the above objectives. In an effort to intensify the use
of existing irrigated areas, the Ministry of Agriculture has started a project
in 1981 in 15 provinces in the southern and western parts of the country,
which aims at introducing a second crop and providing agricultural supporting
services in irrigated areas. The Ministry of Agriculture has also started a
general reorganization of its extension services which will include an
emphasis on improving services to irrigated areas.

Water Charges
45.      With regard to DSI major irrigation works, legal provision exists for
recovery of investment and 0 & M costs. These charges have to be approved by
the Council of Ministers. In practice DSI computes the capital charges for
completed irrigation works on the basis of recovery over 50 years without
interest and without any adjustment for inflation. Moreover, the 0 & M
charges approved by the Cabinet have normally been significantly below actual
costs. Collection averages less than two-thirds of assessed charges. A
one-time 10 percent late penalty surcharge for delinquency of over one year
has been insufficient to induce adequate recovery. With respect to TOPRAKSU
minor irrigation and on-farm development works, there is currently no
legislation permitting cost recovery.
46.      The Government has recently taken measures to improve cost recovery.
Thle Government has agreed to increase 0 & M charges for DSI works
progressively to 100 percent of the previous year's actual 0 & M charges
(]oan Agreement, Section 4.05 (a)(i)). For 1983, charges have been increased
to cover 37.5 percent of 0 & M costs, and coverage would be increased to 50
percent in 1984, 75 percent in 1985 and 100 percent in 1986. The Government
has also agreed, to adjust its capital recovery charge to include interest
(loan Agreement, Section 4.05 (a)(ii)) and to institute appropriate legal
procedures in cases of delinquency of over 12 months (Loan Agreement, Section
4.05 (b)). In addition, the Government has indicated its intention to seek
legislation to increase substantially the penalties for delinquency in payment
of such charges. With respect to TOPRAKSU, the Government has agreed (Loan
Agreement, Section 4.06) to take necessary action, not later than September 1,
1]984, to cause TOPRAKSU to assess and collect from farmers receiving on-farm
development investments under the project, charges sufficient to recover the
cost of such investments, including interest, amortized over a period not to
exceed 20 years from the completion of such investment. Completion of sucb
action is a condition of disbursement for DSI or TOPRAKSU force account work
after September 1, 1984, for DSI or TOPRAKSU contracts entered into after
September 1, 1984, or for disbursements exceeding $30 million equivalent on
DSI contracts (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para 4). Since most operation and
maintenance for TOPRAKSU investments is carried out by the farmers concerned,
no 0 & M charge is considered necessary.
47.      In 1981 the Government adopted a sales tax of 5 percent on
agricultural products. This is intended to compensate for the difficulty in
collection of income taxes on agricultural income. The increase in sales tax
collection due to irrigation is estimated to be about equal to current 0 & M
costs for DSI works.
Performance under Previous Irrigation Projects
48.      The Bank and IDA have provided financing for five irrigation projects
in Turkey through loans and credits totalling about $159 million. Some of
these projects also included power components. All but one have been
completed, with the last one (Ceyhan Aslantas - Loan 883-TU and Credit 360-TU
of 1973) expected to be completed by December 1983. Aside from components
under rural development projects, no irrigation lending has taken place since
1973 due to failure hitherto to agree on adequate measures regarding cost
recovery (see paras. 45 and 46). Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) on



- 13 -
the two projects completed most recently found them to have been generally
successful and to have high economic benefits. But, in addition to the issue
of cost recovery, the PPARs noted inadequate extension support, initial delays
in establishing project implementing units and periodic delays in providing
adequate local cost financing as major problems. The proposed project has
been designed to take full account of these lessons. In the areas served by
the Ceyhan-Aslantas project and the Corum-Cankiri Rural Development Project
(Loan 1130-TU, 1975) the extension service is performing well using an
improved approach pioneered under several Bank projects. The Government has
recognised the need to reorganize and strengthen its extension activities and
is developing a plan to introduce the new extension system on a nationwide
basis. A first phase extension project is expected to be ready for appraisal
this calendar year. Since the proposed project is accelerating on-going
works, most of the implementation units already exist. Arrangements are
proposed for Bank review of proposed project budget provisions (para 59) which
would provide an early warning system and facilitate compliance with
Government undertakings to provide adequate financial support for the project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
49.      The proposed project originated with the Government's request to the
June 1980 Agricultural Sector Identification Mission for Bank financing to
assist completion of irrigation schemes under construction. Consideration of
the project was made possible by changes in Government investment policy for
the irrigation subsector to concentrate resources on a few priority projects
to accelerate their completion and by measures taken to improve cost
recovery. The proposed project was prepared under the leadership of DSI which
coordinated its input with contributions from TOPRAKSU and the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry, with the assistance of the FAO/World Bank
Cooperative Program. The project was appraised in September 1982. A Staff
Appraisal Report entitled "Turkey - Igdir-Aksu-Eregli-Ercis (IAEE) Irrigation
Project" (No. 4299-TU dated May 13, 1983) is being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors. The key features of the proposed project are listed
in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III. Negotiations took place in
Washington in March 1983, with a delegation headed by Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief
Financial and Economic Counselor of the Turkish Embassy in Washington, and
including representatives of Treasury, DSI, TOPRAKSU, the Ministry of Village
Affairs and the State Planning Office. Final agreement was reached in May
1983.
The Project Objectives and Loan Features
50.      The proposed project conforms to the Government's strategy for
accelerating growth of production through giving priority to completion of
irrigation schemes which will bring about quick returns. Government agencies
are presently attempting to complete construction of some 79 irrigation
schemes involving in excess of 900,000 hectares. Due to budgetary constraints
and the attempt to handle too many projects simultaneously, construction
periods and project benefits have been delayed. Contractor construction
capacity and staff capacity of administering agencies are considered adequate
to permit an acceleration of construction if sufficient finance can be made
available. The project objective is to accelerate completion of several of



- 14 -
those schemes which are nearest to completion, have no technical difficulties
to delay completion, do not have a significant energy requirement and are
financially attractive and economically viable. Four such irrigation schemes
hiave been selected which meet the above criteria and which would bring about
113,000 ha (net) under improved irrigation (from dryland or inadequately
irrigated areas) and affect about 25,000 farm families. In addition an
irrigation strategy review (para 58) would assist Turkey to design its future
irrigation investment program so as to achieve a more rapid increase in
.irrigated area.
51.       In the selected subprojects all dam construction is either completed
or close to completion. The Government has committed itself to provide all
required funds and facilities to ensure completion of the remaining work in a
timely manner (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01 (b) and (c)(i)). However,
additional investments are required to use the available water efficiently.
The project would include the construction of additional irrigation canals,
intakes, drainage networks, rehabilitation and improvement of existing
irrigation and drainage systems, and provision of on-farm developments in the
form of land levelling, surface and subsurface drainage, correction of
salinity and alkalinity problems, and feeder roads. It would also include
strengthening of extension services, equipment for operation and maintenance
of the irrigation scbemes, staff training, and preparation of an irrigation
strategy review. Independent qualified experts, acceptable to the Bank, would
be employed to periodically inspect on an agreed schedule the construction,
operation and maintenance of the dams, in accordance with sound engineering
practice (Loan Agreement Section 4.03 (b)).
Project Components
52.       The Igdir Irrigation Scheme would benefit a net area of about 53,000
ha (net) in Eastern Turkey in a valley along the border with USSR. Presently
23,000 ha are irrigated using the Serdarabat Dam which was jointly constructed
in 1927 by Turkey and the USSR. The proposed subproject would rehabilitate
the existing irrigation system and expand the system by about 30,000 ha,
making use of additional water from the Arpacay Storage Dam upstream (also
jointly built by Turkey and the USSR). The subproject would also include
on-farm development work, feeder roads, and reclamation of about 12,500 ha of
saline and alkaline soils. About 14,300 farm families are expected to
benefit. Increased production of cereals, sugarbeets, cotton, alfalfa and
fruits and vegetables is expected to result from the project.
53.       The Aksu Irrigation Scheme would benefit an area of about 23,000 ha
in the Mediterranean region near the city of Antalya. About 9,000 ha are
currently irrigated using the Aksu Dam (constructed in 1961) but little
on-farm work (land leveling or surface drainage) has been carried out. An
additional 3,000 ha are currently irrigated using pumps or through the
remnants of an old irrigation scheme. The proposed project wTould extend the
area irrigated from the Aksu Dam by about 14,000 ha, rehabilitate the existing
irrigation system, and provide on-farm works and feeder roads. It would also
provide flood protection, since flooded areas of up to 7,000 ha are common.
About 5,800 farm families are expected to benefit. Increases in production of
wheat, cotton, and fruit and vegetables are expected.



- 15 -
54.      The Eregli Irrigation Scheme would benefit an area of about 32,000 ha
in Konya province in Central Anatolia. About 14,000 ha are currently
irrigated, although inadequately. The Irviz Dam (begun in 1979) is about
two-thirds completed and should be in operation in time for the 1985
irrigation season. This will permit expansion of the irrigated area by about
18,000 ha and improvement in the areas currently inadequately irrigated. The
subproject would not finance any head or canal works since these are already
contracted and construction is already underway. The subproject would include
about 17,000 ha of land leveling and drainage works, feeder roads and
reclamation of about 4,000 ha of saline and alkaline soils. About 4,360 farm
families are expected to benefit. Increased production of fruit, wheat,
sugarbeets, and vegetables is expected.
55.      The Ercis Irrigation Scheme would benefit an area of about 7,000 ha
along side Lake Van in Southeastern Turkey. The subproject area, currently
farmed under rainfed conditions, would be irrigated from the Kockopru Dam,
which was started in 1979 and is scheduled for completion in 1984. The
subproject would include irrigation canals, drainage networks, on farm
development, and feeder roads. About 850 farm families are expected to
benefit. Increased production of alfalfa, cereals, sugarbeets, and vegetables
is expected.
Agricultural Extension
56.      An agreed extension system would be introduced in the subproject
areas (Loan Agreement Section 3.06). Under this system one day of training by
district engineers and subject matter specialists would be given to the
agricultural technicians every two weeks, to be followed by nine days of field
extension work. The training would outline, in accordance with the season,
the cropping pattern, and specific agricultural practices to be promoted. The
extension services would be strengthened by three or four subject matter
specialists for each irrigation scheme and a county agricultural engineer for
three of the schemes. A ratio of at least one agricultural technician per 400
farm households would be maintained. The project would include the
construction of offices and staff accommodation where appropriate and the
provision of field demonstration equipment and vehicles.
57.      Training:  In order to tailor extension skills to project objectives,
the Ministry of Agriculture would, by February 29, 1984, carry out a survey of
training needs of extension staff to be assigned in the four irrigation scheme
areas. Tbereafter, the Ministry would prepare and submit to the Bank by June
30, 1984 a program for training of extension staff to be assigned to the
project areas, and carry out a program acceptable to the Bank for training
such staff (Loan Agreement Section 3.07 (b)). Short-term consulting
assistance would be provided for analysis of training needs and design of
project training programs. In addition about 170 man-months of Bank-approved
overseas training would be financed under the project for appropriate staff of
DSI, TOPRAKSU and the extension services.
58.      Irrigation Strategy Review.  Over the past two years the Government's
annual investment programs have concentrated resources on those priority
projects nearest completion. This policy is being continued under the 1983
investment program. Nevertheless, a further planning exercise is required to



- 16 -
establish future investment priorities among the various partially completed
projects and to develop implementation plans taking account of financing and
implementation constraints. The Government would therefore, by July 31, 1984,
prepare under agreed terms of reference, a ten-year irrigation master plan
designed to bring the average annual increase in irrigated area during the
next 10 years to about 100,000 ha per year, (Loan Agreement, Section 4.04),
and would employ specialist consultants to assist its staff in this work (Loan
Agreement, Section 3.02). The master plan would be based on a detailed
inventory and assessment on a project-by-project basis of existing and
projected DSI irrigation and TOPRAKSU on-farm development investments and of
financial and implementation constraints. It would include detailed
implementation plans for the first five years including additional works
required, cost and timing. The master plan is expected to serve as a basis
for selection and preparation of future irrigation projects suitable for Bank
assistance.
Cost Estimates and Financing
59.      The estimated total cost of the proposed project is $292 million
including $115 million in foreign exchange and about $6.6 million of taxes and
duties. The above estimates include an average of about 12 percent physical
contingencies and about 16 percent price escalation. (While local costs are
expected to increase at a faster rate, the floating TL automatically
accommodates the difference between local and foreign inflation.) The
proposed Bank Loan of $115.3 million would finance 100% of the foreign
exchange costs of the project (about 40% of total costs) plus the front-end
fee. The remaining 60% of costs would be provided by the Government. The
Bank has reviewed at negotiations the allocations for the various project
components included in the 1983 budget and found them to be adequate. For
later years the Government would, by September 30 each year, provide to the
Bank for comment, an annual updated financing plan giving the proposed budget
allocations for the project (and associated dams and facilities), and updated
project schedules and cost.estimates (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01 (c)).
Consultants services are to be provided for assistance in preparation of the
irrigation master plan (about eight man-months) and of project training
programs (about one man-month), at an estimated average cost of $12,000 per
man-month (including salary, costs, fees, international travel and
subsistence). Fellowship costs are estimated at $2,500 per man-month to
Europe and $4,000 per man-month to the USA. In order not to interrupt
progress on the project, up to $4 million of retroactive financing would be
provided for expenditures after January 1, 1983 under contracts which were
awarded in accordance with approved procedures.
60.      The above cost estimates exclude additional agricultural credit the
farmers would require to take full advantage of the irrigation facilities to
be provided. This incremental credit required is estimated at about $42.5
million equivalent including about $15 million in foreign exchange and is
expected to be provided by the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (TCZB), either
directly or through cooperatives. The proposed Second Agricultural Credit
Project, expected to be ready for Board presentation shortly, would include
funds for financing the estimated foreign excbange component of such credit
over a period of four years. The proposed credit project would also include



- 17 -
measures to strengthen TCZB's organization and procedures which would
facilitate provision of this credit.   The Government has agreed to guarantee
that agricultural credit would be provided in adequate amounts to meet the
incremental requirements of farmers for efficient cultivation of the land
receiving new or improved irrigation under the project (Loan Agreement
Section 4.07).
Implementation
61.      Implementation of project components would he the responsibility of
the Government agencies concerned, namely DSI, TOPRAKSU, and the Ministry of
Agriculture. Since each irrigation scheme represents an acceleration of an
on-going program, most of the required implementation organization is already
in place. The increased use of private contractors by TOPRAKSU and the
project financed training programs would help to improve the implementation
capacity of the involved agencies. A coordination committee would be formed
by December 31, 1983 in each province served by the project (Loan Agreement
Section 3.08 (a)), to be chaired by the provincial Governor and including
representatives of DSI, TOPRAKSU, the extension service, and TCZB. These
committees would meet at least monthly. Preliminary designs and cost
estimates have been prepared by DSI and TOPRAKSU with some assistance from the
FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program. DSI and TOPRAKSU would have the
responsibility of preparing final designs, cost estimates and bidding
documents and have done so for the first year's contracts. These agencies are
adequately staffed to prepare the remaining final designs and to supervise
construction, operation and maintenance, except for TOPRAKSU staff for the
Igdir subproject area, which requires strengthening. A suitably staffed
TOPRAKSU project section would be established for the Igdir subproject by
December 31, 1983 (Loan Agreement Section 3.08 (b)).
Contracting and Procurement
62.      All DSI new construction (estimated at $86.9 million equivalent,
including price and physical contingencies) and all building construction for
the extension service ($1.8 million) would be performed by private
contractors. DSI work in rehabilitation of existing irrigation networks
($33.2 million equivalent) would be carried out by force account, since such
work can only be accomplished during periods when irrigation services can he
interrupted. With respect to TOPRAKSU, at least 75 percent of civil works for
land leveling, surface drainage and farms roads would be performed by private
contractors, representing a significant change from prior TOPRAKSU practices
under which most of such work was done by force account. While private
contractors have up until now not been used for TOPRAKSU subsurface drainage
work due to the need for specialized equipment, at least 10% of such civil
works under the Project would be carried out by private contractors.
Contractors would he given special assistance to enter this field through
being allowed to use less specialized equipment. In total, about $43.2
million equivalent of TOPRAKSU works would be carried out by contractors and
about $30.3 million eauivalent bv force account.  About $33.0 million of DSI
civil works contracts, including all of such contracts except for the Igdir
subproject and one small ($4 million) contract under the Ercis subproject
would be awarded through international competitive bidding (ICB). Because of
the remoteness and inaccessibility of the area, DSI construction contracts for



- 18 -
the Igdir subproject (estimated at about $49.9 million) would be awarded
through local bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. TOPRAKSU and
Ministry of Agriculture construction contracts ($44.8 million), which are for
small works unlikely to be of interest to international firms, would be
awarded through appropriate local bidding procedures. Contracts for vehicles
and equipment ($42.0 million) would he awarded through ICB. Equipment tenders
would provide for adequate servicing capacity and spare parts within Turkey.
Purchases of small items of equipment of value less than $50,000 and not to
exceed $250,000 in total for the Project, may be procured off-the-shelf on the
basis of at least three offers.
63.      The project is expected to be implemented within five years.  This is
faster than previous irrigation projects in Turkey, but is considered to be a
reasonable schedule since the project consists of acceleration of on-going
works, the implementation units already exist and the arrangements for prior
review of proposed project budget provisions (para. 59) and the establishment
of a revolving fund for civil works contracts (para. 64) are expected to
facilitate timely provision of adequate financial support for the project.
Disbursement and Audit
64.      The Bank loan would be disbursed against (i) 50 percent of the costs
of civil works executed by contract; (ii) 25 percent of the costs of civil
works executed by force account; (iii) 100 percent of foreign expenditure and
local expenditure ex-factory and 60 percent of other local expenditure for
vehicles and equipment; (iv) 100 percent of foreign expenditure for overseas
training, and (v) 100 percent of foreign expenditure for foreign consultants
or 75 percent of total expenditure for local consultants. A revolving fund of
$4 million equivalent would be established for civil works contracts to avoid
the need for the Government to first provide the funds for the full cost of
contractor services and then await Bank reimbursement (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 5). Completion of necessary action to cause TOPRAKSU to assess and
collect water charges on farmers receiving on-farm development investments
under the project (para 46) would be a condition of disbursement for DSI or
TOPRAKSU force account work after September 1, 1984, for DSI or TOPRAKSU
contracts signed after September 1, 1984, or for disbursements exceeding $30
million equivalent on DSI contracts (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, para 4).
65.      DSI, TOPRAKSU and the Ministry of Agriculture would each maintain
separate accounts for the project. Staff of the three agencies involved would
prepare at the end of each quarter a detailed statement of project
expenditures during the period and submit such statement to the Bank within 45
days after the end of each quarter. Such statements would, inter alia, be
uised as the basis for Bank review of progress and supervision of costs of
force account works. An annual audit would be carried out by the Auditor
General's office and submitted to the Bank within nine months of the end of
each fiscal year (Loan Agreement, Section 4.02)).
O)ther Special Project Features
66.      Government Owned Land:  Of the 56,300 ha (gross) to be irrigated in
the Igdir subproject area, 10,200 ha are Government or village owned land.
The prior land reform legislation in Turkey has been repealed, and replacement
Legislation has not yet been proposed to the Assembly. Therefore, for the



- 19 -
time being, there is no legal provision for the sale of Government land to
farmers.  The Government intends to have the Government and village owmed land
in Igdir Subproject area become the property of the Treasury Department after
TOPRAKSU has completed the on-farm development works. The Treasury plans to
lease this land for three to five years to, in order of priority, farmers with
no land, small landholders, farmers renting or sharecropping, and other
farmers in the immediate vicinity of the project area. Most of this land will
not be available until 1985 by which time new land reform legislation may bave
been passed. The Government has agreed that it would (a) submit to the Bank,
by July 1, 1984, a detailed plan for disposition of such land, and (b) lease
or sell Government and village owned land irrigated under the Project to
farmers under arrangements acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Section
3.05 (b)). No significant amount of Government owned land is included in the
areas of the three other subprojects.
International Water Rights
67.      No issues of international water rights affect the Aksu, Ercis or
Eregli subprojects. However, the Aras River, which provides water for the
Igdir subproject, forms the border between Turkey and the USSR, and further
downstream the border between Iran and the USSR. There is an international
agreement between Turkey and the USSR on the use of the Aras River, which
provides that each country has a right to a 50% share of the river flows.
Pursuant to this, both countries jointly built in 1927 the Serderabat
Diversion Dam, with two intakes dividing the Aras River flows between Turkey
and USSR. The countries' representatives meet monthly to discuss operations
and maintenance. Recently the two countries jointly built the Arpacay Storage
Dam upstream, but it has not yet been put in operation.  A supplementary
agreement was signed in 1973 governing the use of this water. The Arpacay Dam
will store water during winter and spring months to permit increased river
flows during the summer, which will be diverted through the Serderabat
Diversion Dam. This treaty between Turkey and the USSR satisfactorily deals
with the water rights issues for the Igdir subproject. The arrangements in
effect since 1960 have led to full utilization of all available water by USSR
and Turkey during the growing season. No such treaty exists between Turkey
and Iran. But the storage of additional water during the winter (8 percent of
the total flow) for release during the growing season appears not to have any
significant adverse effects on Iran. These findings were conveyed to Iran and
no objections have been received.
Benefits and Risks
68.      The project, at full development, would lead to improved agricultural
practices on 119,000 ha gross of land (112,700 ha net) which will benefit from
new or better irrigation. The project is expected to benefit directly over
25,000 farm families. Of these about 23,000 presently own and cultivate land
in the project areas, and about 2,000 are expected to start cultivation on
Government-owned land to be reclaimed and redistributed or leased in the Igdir
scheme. The net disposable farm incomes of these farmers at full development
will average about 2.5 times higher than without the project, after taking
into account increased water charges (see para. 46). In addition, as a result



- 20 -
of the intensification of cropping patterns and practices under the project,
the annual demand for seasonal labor will increase; it is estimated that at
full development, about 20,000 more people will find temporary employment on
farms in the project area during the 3 months of peak farm labor.
69.      Full development would be achieved in year 12 of the project (1994).
At that time total incremental benefits would amount to about $107 million
equivalent in 1982 economic prices. Of this, about 49% would be derived from
increased production of fruit and vegetables, 13% from cotton, 12% from
sugarbeet, and the remainder from cereals, fodder, oil seeds, tubers and
poplar wood. No problem is anticipated in the domestic marketing of most of
the additional output. However, at full development the total production of
fruit and vegetables from the project area would be quadrupled. During the
last decade, the national production of vegetables has increased by about 4%
per year, and the production of citrus, apple and apricot by about 5-6% per
year. This increase has been partially absorbed by the growing national
demand, as well as by rapidly rising exports during the last 2-3 years, mostly
towards Middle-Eastern and European countries. Part of the incremental
project output would be exported, particularly most of the citrus and early
vegetables from the Aksu scheme in the Antalya province, where the World
Bank-supported Fruit and Vegetable Project (Loan 1967-TU) is currently
assisting in improving production and marketing of these commodities. In this
province during recent years the growth in fruit and vegetable production has
been matched by private investment in marketing and storage facilities, and
increased trucking capacity has permitted a surge in exports, particularly of
citrus to the Persian Gulf and Libya. In the medium term however, further
expansion of export markets would require improvements in marketing
efficiency, packaging and quality control. The marketing organizations to be
set up under Loan 1967-TU are intended to assist in bringing about such
improvements.
70.      Economic rates of return have been calculated for each of the
subprojects. Rates of return vary from about 15% for the Ercis subproject to
about 30 percent for the Eregli subproject, and average about 20% for the
project as a whole. These estimates assume rather conservative rates of
progress in introducing improved practices and changing cropping patterns
after the introduction of irrigation. If benefits were delayed by two years
due to delays in completion of construction, rates of return would still be
satisfactory, ranging from about 12 percent for Ercis to about 22 percent for
Eregli, and averaging about 16 percent for the project as a whole.
Project Risks
71.      There are no unusual technical risks associated with the project, and
those normally associated with project benefits, costs, development period and
implementation delays have been taken into account in sensitivity analyses
which demonstrate project viability in the face of any reasonable combination
of such risks. On the organizational side, collaboration and cooperation
between DSI and TOPRAKSU is already quite satisfactory. The fact that the
project would accelerate implementation of on-going subprojects means that the
initial delays in setting up implementation units have already been overcome.
The only organizational risk is that delays may take place in strengthening



- 21 -
the extension service, which would delay adoption of improved farming
practices. While this has been a problem in some of the earlier Bank financed
irrigation projects, experience under our ongoing projects has been reasonably
good and the Government's attitude to the new extension system has moved from
acceptance for Bank projects only to endorsement as the intended nationwide
extension model. One risk which could reduce project returns and which other
Bank-assisted projects in Turkey have faced periodically would be inadequate
local budgetary support resulting in delays in construction schedules. To
minimize this risk, assurances have been received (see para 59) that the
necessary budget will be provided on time and that the Government would, for
each year of the implementation period, give the Bank an opportunity to
comment on the proposed allocations for the project prior to finalization of
the budget.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
72.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank
and the report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The special features of the Loan Agreement are referred to in the
text and listed in Section III of Annex III. There are no special conditions
of loan effectiveness. Completion of necessary action to cause TOPRAKSU to
assess and collect water charges from farmers receiving on-farm development
works under the project would be a condition of disbursement on some
components (para. 46).
73.      I am satisfied the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
74.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360 - Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973. Effective Date:
March 20, 1974. Closing Date: December 31,1983.
The project is expected to be substantially completed by the current
Closing Date of December 31, 1983. As of March 31, 1983, about $35.5 million
has been disbursed of this $44 million loan.
Ln. No. 1023 - Elbistan Lignite Mine and Power Project: US$148 million loan
of June 28, 1974. Effective Date: June 1, 1976. Closing Date:
June 30, 1983.
Progress has been made on the power component in line with the
measures recommended in February 1982. The civil works contracts have been
renegotiated and additional contractors brought in. TEK has delegated site
management to STEAG, a German project management firm. The main contractor,
Foster Wheeler (FW), has revised the work plan taking into account the use of
erection personnel being made available by the main equipment suppliers. The
revised work plan concentrates maximum effort in completing Unit No. 1 by end
1984. Units No. 2, No.3 and No. 4 would follow at one year intervals. With
the arrangements made through the US EXIM Bank, and the proposed reallocation
of an additional US$6.8 million from the IBRD loan, financing for the FW
contract through end 1983 is assured. Social infrastructure and salary
problems persist. The contract for operation and training for the mining
component expires in July 1983. Decision on renewal has not been taken. The
contract for mine consulting is continuing. TKI has not negotiated frame
contracts for mine equipment maintenance. Maintenance of mine equipment is
inadequate. TKI's ability to mine lignite in sufficient quantities to
adequately supply the power station (17.6 million tons/a) will be assessed in
connection with the appraisal of a supplemental loan tentatively scheduled for
September 1983.
Ln. No. 1130 - Corum-Cankiri Rural Development: US$75 million loan of
June 23, 1975.  Effective Date:  January 22, 1976.  Closing Date:
June 30, 1984.
Satisfactory progress is being maintained except for delayed payment
to contractors by DSI. The Bank has agreed to the Government's request for
reallocation of proceeds so as to provide additional funds for short-term
credit, which is expected to be sufficient to cover needs until a proposed
second agricultural credit project, now scheduled for Board consideration in
June 1983, becomes effective.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Ln. No. 1248 - Agricultural Credit and Agro-industries: US$54.3 million loan
of May 5, 1976. Effective Date: May 11, 1977. Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
The supervised credit and ferryship components are fully disbursed
and the study of TCZB organization and operations has been completed. Due to
reluctance of sub-borrowers to assume foreign exchange risk and availability
Of other sources of credit without this risk, only 11 percent of the
agro-industries component has been disbursed. The Government is considering
proposals for dealing with this issue.
Ln. No. 1258 - Balikesir Newsprint: US$70 million loan of May 21, 1976.
Effective Date: October 15, 1976. Closing Date: December 31, 1982.
Although the Closing Date has not been extended, accounts are being
kept open pending settlement of final payments. As of March 31, 1983, $68.4
million, or 98 percent of the total loan amount, has been disbursed. A
project completion report is under preparation.
Ln. No. 1265 - Livestock III: US$21.5 million loan of May 26, 1976.
Effective Date: February 25, 1977. Closing Date: March 31, 1984.
The Closing Date has been extended to March 31, 1984 to allow for
utilization of the remaining $6.8 million of undisbursed loan funds. Project
implementation has been satisfactory. However, the increased availability of
locally bred offspring of imported cattle at considerably cheaper prices than
for comparable directly imported cattle, has caused a serious reduction in the
demand for sub-loans. The Bank is currently considering a request from the
Government for restructuring all three ongoing livestock projects to include
financing for the foreign exchange component of loans for sheep and beef
fattening in addition to dairying; locally bred improved cattle and sheep, as
well as imported ones; and farm machinery and equipment, livestock housing,
pasture and forage production, feeds and other inputs in addition to livestock.
Ln. No. 1310 - South Antalya Tourism Infrastructure: US$26 million loan of
July 9, 1976. Effective Date: March 1, 1978. Closing Date: December 31,
1983.
Project implementation is about two years behind schedule due to
initial difficulties relating to land acquisition and project organization.
At present most project works are either completed or under advanced
implementation. The Closing Date has been extended for the first time by one
year to December 31, 1983. As of March 31, 1983, $10.8 million, or 42 percent
of the total loan amount, has been disbursed.
Ln. No. 1379 DYB (State Investment Bank of Turkey): US$70 million loan of
March 23, 1977. Effective Date: July 21, 1977. Closing Date:
December, 31, 1982.
The Closing Date for this loan has not been extended, but the
accounts are being kept open for settlement of final payments. As of March
31, 1983, the undisbursed balance of this loan is $7.0 million.

Ln. No. 1585 - Northern Forestry:  US$86.0 million loan of June 5, 1978.
Effective Date:  October 30, 1978.  Closing Date:  March 31, 1986.
Overall physical achievements are about 60 percent of targets. Local
funding, which is almost totally dependent on timber sales, has been
inadequate due to a depression in the construction industry. Although
equipment procurement is still behind schedule, proposals for foreign
equipment procurement have been agreed, providing for initiation of remaining
procurement in 1983/84 witb completion of disbursement expected by early
1986. A management consultant to assist the project implementation is
expected in Ankara shortly.
Ln. No. 1586 - Livestock IV: US$24.0 million loan of June 5, 1978. Effective
Date: October 31, 1978. Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Implementation of the supervised credit program is extremely slow due
in part to the increased availability of locally bred offspring of imported
cattle at considerably cheaper prices than for directly imported cattle. A
Government request for restructuring of all three ongoing livestock projects
(see Loan No. 1265) is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1606 - Erdemir Stage II Steel: US$95.0 million loan of June 30,
1978. Effective Date: July 30, 1979. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Inflation and the devaluation of the Turkish Lira have caused serious
financial problems for the company. Proposals to tackle the situation are
being considered by the company and the Government in consultation with the
Bank. Implementation of the main components of the original project is one
year behind schedule with additional delays now expected on some non-critical
support facilities and several additional items recommended by consultants to
improve productivity, quality, and efficiency. A financial plan prepared by
the company is being reviewed.   Extension of the Closing Date to permit
utilization of the remaining loan funds is dependent upon development of a
satisfactory financial plan.
Ln. No. 1741 - Ports Rebabilitation: US$75 million of July 2, 1979.
Effective Date: January 22, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
Cumulative loan disbursements of $38.0 million up to March 31,1983
were only about 51 percent of the total loan amount due to initial delays in
tendering, awarding contracts, appointing consultants for port planning study,
and finalizing specifications of a 250-ton floating crane. Physical
implementation is now progressing satisfactorily. Extension of the Closing
Date is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1742 - Grain Storage: US$85 million of July 2, 1979. Effective
Date: January 21, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1985.
Prequalification procedures for silo construction contractors are in
progress. The Government is currently examining the merits of possible
adjustments in the project contents to take account of changes in relative
prices and cost increases due to previous delays.

Ln. No. 1748 - TSKB XIII (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$60
million of July 12, 1979. Effective Date: October 25, 1979. Closing Date:
September 30, 1983.
Delays in committing this loan have resulted due to sub-borrowers'
reluctance to bear foreign exchange risk and cancellation of loan contracts
because of financial distress caused by high interest rates and shortage of
Local currency. These financial problems which are endemic in the Turkish
private sector have prevented TSKB's serious arrears position from improving.
The current Closing Date of September 30, 1983 is not likely to be extended.
As of March 31, 1983, about $43.4 million has been disbursed.
Lns. Nos. 1754 and 1755 - TSKB (US$65 million) and SYKB (US$15 million)
Private Sector Textiles loans of September 17, 1979. Effective Date:
February 29, 1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
A lower than anticipated level of commitments (about $38 million or
55 percent of forecasts) still prevails due to depressed conditions in the
textile industry and the sub-borrowers' reluctance to assume foreign exchange
risk. Local consultancy service has been reorganized on schedule, as a
private sector joint venture without further need of the Bank's financial
support.
Ln. No. S-15 - Ankara Air Pollution Engineering: US$6 million loan of
December 12, 1979. Effective Date: April 4, 1980. Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
Out of the five components of this project, only two (Seyitomer Plant
and Air Pollution Monitoring Equipment) have so far been partly implemented,
representing US$0.9 million or 15 percent of the total loan amount. The test
results from the MTA pilot plant showed that investment in a larger scale
pilot plant would not be warranted. The Alternative Technology Study will not
be executed since no feasible processes exist for coke or hot briquetting
manufacture based on Turkish lignite. The Gas Production Study will be
implemented, but the cost for the study might be significantly higher than the
appraisal estimate. Revision of the cost estimates and extension of the
present Closing Date are under consideration.
Ln. No. 1844 - Karakaya Hydropower: US$120 million loan of May 21, 1980.
Effective Date: August 15, 1980. Closing Date: December 31, 1988.
Implementation after initial delays is now satisfactory. The cash
generation covenant was not met for 1982, and is not likely to be met for
1983. This matter is now being pursued with the Government.

Ln. No. 1847 - Sumerbank Textiles Modernization and Rationalization:
US$83 million loan of May 28, 1980. Effective Date: February 27, 1981.
Closing Date: June 30, 1984.
After initial delays of about one year due to delayed loan
effectiveness and staffing problems of the project implementation unit,
project implementation is now progressing satisfactorily and the costs are
within appraisal estimates. The reorganization plan for the Cotton Textile
Division was approved by the Sumerbank Board in March 1982. Recruitment of
competent personnel for the Cotton Textile Division and the project
implementation unit has been hampered by salary limitations on State Economic
Enterprises. The situation is expected to improve after the passage of the
SEE reform decree.
Ln. No. 1862 - Livestock V: US$51 million loan of June 6, 1980. Effective
Date: October 22, 1980. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Progress on the credit component for livestock development, with the
exception of boilers, is extremely slow. The Government has decided not to
implement the meat processing component due to changes in its investment
priorities, and a request has been received to reallocate the funds.
Implementation of the animal health and breeding components is reasonably
satisfactory. A Government proposal for increasing the types of livestock
credit eligible for financing (see Loan No. 1265) is under consideration.
Ln. No. 1916 - Petroleum Exploration Project: US$25 million loan of
November 24, 1980.  Effective Date:  June 30, 1981.  Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
Project implementation is slow due to delay in contracting consulting
services and initiating technical studies. Acceptable drilling locations have
not yet been identified in southeast Turkey. The Bank has recently approved
the Government's request to extend the scope of the loan to include the Thrace
basin, which has been found to have a highly attractive potential for
hydrocarbon exploration, and to reallocate a portion of the proceeds of the
loan to finance computer equipment for higher quality seismic data processing
needed for the Thrace program. Progress in separation of TPAO's
import-related operations is also behind schedule because of its relation to
the broader issues under consideration in the SEE reform legislation. Energy
audits for five major industries are currently in progress.
Ln. No. 1917 - Bati Raman Enhanced Oil Recovery Field Demonstration Project:
US$62 million loan of November 24, 1980. Effective Date: June 30, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project is about one year behind schedule due to initial delays
in equipment procurement and delivery. Bids for the enhanced recovery studies
for other fields are under review, and the studies are expected to start
shortly. The fracturing of the Hamitabat gas field has been completed
successfully and has demonstrated the feasibility of full commercial
development of the field. Progress in separation of TPAO's import-related
operations has also been delayed because of its relation to the broader issues
under consideration for the SEE reform legislation.

Ln. No. 1952 - Labor Intensive Industry Project: US$40 million loan of
March 13, 1981. Effective Date: June 12, 1981. Closing Date:
June 30, 1986.
A poor investment climate still continues to hamper loan
utilization. As of January 31, 1983, subloans totalling $16.8 million had
been approved by SKYB.
Ln. No. 1967 - Second Fruit and Vegetable Project: US$40 million loan of
April 6, 1981. Effective Date: August 1981. Closing Date: June 30, 1986.
Project implementation is proceeding more slowly than projected, but
should improve as a result of experience gained to date: all consultants have
been engaged and are in place. Three of the four Regional Marketing
Corporations will become operational as soon as TCZB's contribution is
received in early May 1983.
Ln. No. 1985 - Fertilizer Rationalization and Energy Saving Project:
US 110 million loan of May 15, 1981. Effective Date: August 28, 1981.
Closing Date: December 31, 1986.
The project components of AZOT and IGSAS are progressing
satisfactorily. GUBRE, one of the three beneficiaries, has not yet signed a
contract with an engineering company for project implementation because of
changes proposed in the scope of the project by GUBRE management to further
improve its economic viability.
Ln. No. 1998 - State Industrial Enterprise Finance Project: US$70 million loan
of June 3, 1981. Effective Date: August 27, 1981. Closing Date:
December 31, 1986.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. The Bank is
considering the Government's request for an extension of the deadline for
completion of a study of DYB's future role.
Ln. No. 2093 - Export-Oriented Industries Project: US$100 million loan of
March 5, 1982. Effective Date: May 28, 1982. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Although the special task force for dealing with problem projects is
now functioning relatively effectively, prolonged low capacity utilization
rates in industry and high interest rates make a substantial improvement in
arrears unlikely in the near future. Demand for direct foreign exchange fixed
asset financing has been declining due to reduced private sector investment
demand as a result of current economic conditions and the unwillingness of
sub-borrowers to bear foreign exchange risk. The technical assistance program
for potential exporters has been proceeding on schedule.

Ln. No. 2094 - Erzurum Rural Development Project: US$40 million loan of
March 5, 1982. Effective Date: November 24, 1982. Closing Date:
June 30, 1987.
Since the loan became effective in November 1982, implementation has
been on schedule for the irrigation, soil conservation, new roads, plant
protection, and veterinary services components. However, progress is slow
with extension services and recruitment of consultants, and it has proved
difficult to recruit and retain a project manager in Erzurum.
Ln. No. 2131 - Second Fertilizer Rationalization Project: US$44.1 million
loan of May 13, 1982.  Effective Date:  April 13, 1983.  Closing Date:
June 30, 1987.
This loan became effective in April 1983. The Government has
requested cancellation of Part A of the project which relates to GUBRE, one of
the four beneficiary ferti]izer manufacturing companies of the project, which
is no longer interested in proceeding with its portion of the project.  The
total loan amount will accordingly be reduced from $44.1 million to $38
million to reflect this cancellation.  The other project components are making
satisfactory progress.
Ln. No. 2137 - Highway Rehabilitation Project: US$71.1 mi]lion loan of
May 13, 1982. Effective Date: August 13, 1982. Closing Date: June 30, 1987.
Progress continues to be good. All civil works and procurement
contracts have been bid and feasibility studies have been completed for all
the remaining road sections included in the loan.
Ln. No. 2158 - Structural Adjustment Loan III: US$304.5 million loan of
May 28, 1982. Effective Date; July 16, 1982. Closing Date:
December 15, 1983.
This loan became effective in July 1982. The first tranche of the
loan has been fully disbursed. Release of the second tranche is expected to
be authorized shortly.
Ln. No. 2159 - Istanbul Sewerage Project: US$88.1 million loan of
May 28, 1982. Effectuve Date: January 24, 1983. Closing Date:
December 31, 1988.
This loan became effective in January 1983.
