                         Overall progress towards achieving Project Development and Global Environment Objectives remains satisfactory. To date the Project has completed animal waste management
                         investments in 76 livestock farms, 6 agricultural high schools, three slaughterhouses and meatprocessing facilities, and three rendering plants. Construction at one agricultural high
                         school and equipment delivery to 24 farms is ongoing. As such, the Project's Development and Global Environment Objectives have been exceeded.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         ·         Water quality monitoring to gauge Project impact on groundwater nutrient concentrations has to date yielded inconclusive results due to the short time span. Continuation of
                         the water monitoring program would yield valuable input to Serbia's action plan to approximate the EU Nitrate Directive.
                         ·         It was agreed that all beneficiary farms would receive updated annual nutrient management plans (NMPs) by the project closing date. The mission also recommends that
                         Project Local Advisers review the NMPs with the beneficiary farmers to ensure that they are able to update their NMPs themselves annually. Furthermore, the mission recommends
                         that training of agricultural advisers across the country be considered under the Serbia Transitional Agriculture Reform Project.
                         ·         The Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) report for the Project will be completed by June 30, 2011.
