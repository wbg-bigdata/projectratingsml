REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
FOR A SECOND COCOA PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Ivory Coast, for the equivalent of US$20 million to help
finance a project for the development of 26,500 ha of high yielding cocoa
plantations, rehabilitation and construction of access roads and land clearing.
The loan would have a term of twenty years including five years of grace, with
interest at 8.o percent per annum. US$2.3 million would be onlent to the Banque
Nationale pour le D6veloppement Agricole (BNDA) for further relending to farmers
through Soci6t6 dtAssistance Technique pour la Modernisation Agricole de la C8te
d'Ivoire (SATMACI) at a term of eight years including four years of grace, at
the same interest rate as the Bank loan.
PART I - THE EClN014Y
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report No. 296-IVC
"Curtent Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory Coast", April 11, 1974
which is based on an economic mission in April of 1973, confirmed the country's
creditworthiness. The report analyzed the country's economic growth record,
which has been favorable by international standards. It concluded that pro-
spects for further development remain good and that the Government's development
efforts require and deserve continued external support. While the recent de-
velopments in oil and other export and import commodity prices led to substan-
tial quantitative changes in the balance of payments' estimates from those
made when the report was prepared, our calculations show that the conclusions
of the report are still valid. Estimates of the impact of the price increases
on the economy of the Ivory Coast have been included in this report. Annex I
contains basic country data.
3.        Throughout the 1960's, the Ivory Coast's economic growth has been
rapid. GDP has grown at an annual rate of 7.5 percent in real terms and in
1972 per capita income reached US$34Q. Although this growth rate could not
be fully sustained in the early 1970's due to deteriorating terms of trade
and adverse weather conditions, growth in 1971-73 still averaged 6.5 percent
a year, in real terms. Factors contributing to rapid growth were the Govern-
ment's liberal and pragmatic economic policies which have made the country
attractive to foreign investors, the availability of ample land and timber
resources, the existence of a large pool of labor including migration from
neighboring countries and, during the late sixties, rising commodity export
prices. Recognizing the country's vulnerability in its dependence on three
export commodities (cocoa, coffee and wood constitute 80 percent of total
exports while exports are some 32 percent of GDP), the Government began after
1965 to diversify agriculture by introducing or expanding oil palm, coconut,
pineapple, rice, rubber and sugar cultivation -- and by placing more emphasis
on other economic sectors such as industry, mining and tourism. Although
the full results of these diversification efforts are still some years off,
the prospects are that the Ivory Coast will gradually become less dependent
on a few major exports.



-2-
4.        The Government's development objectives include, in addition to
broadening the production base, the extension of economic infrastructure in
such fields as transport and power, the improvement of urban facilities,
regional diversification in agricultural production, the development of
secondary industrial centers, the development of education and the Ivoriza-
tion of the economy. These objectives correspond well to the needs and the
possibilities of the country. Past and ongoing development has laid a solid
foundation for further growth. Moreover, Government and private investment
activities indicate that the country's growth possibilities are being recog-
nized and exploited.
5.        The Government's awareness of social problems is expressed in the
current Plan (1971-1975) and its emphasis on the income effects of develop-
ment, regional balance and education is stronger than in the past. The Gov-
ernment has adopted a policy of developing regional alternatives to the con-
centration of investments in Abidjan and of improving the quality of life in
rural areas as a tool to neutralize certain imbalances in the Ivorian economy.
To reduce inequalities, recent salary raises have been graded down from 26
percent for the lowest to 5 percent for the higher paid workers. A nuniber of
projects, for instance, cocoa, rice, oil palm, rubber, sugar and cotton are
designed to narrow the gap between urban and rural incomes and to reduce re--
gional income disparities. In the same vein, the Government has maintained
favorable producer prices. Over the past five years, producer prices increased
for cocoa by 120 percent, for coffee by 60 percent and for cotton by 35 percent.
6.        In spite of these policies, the Ivorian Plan will need to focus more
sharply on problems of urbanization, prospects of employment in both rural and
urban areas and income distribution. To assist the Government in the process
of preparing the next Five-Year Plan (1976-80), a special Bank employment
mission, which received assistance from ILO staff, visited the Ivory Coast.
The mission report: "Ivory Coast: Special Report on Employment" (Report lNo
279-IVC) issued recently has been discussed with the Government. The m4ssion
identified the employment problem as one of growing imbalances: while the
overall increase in labor demand was about equal to supply including immligra-
tion, there is likely to be a shortage in rural areas and a surplus in urban
labor markets. The mission also singled out a number of issues for fturther
study, including the costs and benefits of creating a better economic and
social infrastructure in secondary centers combined with a certain degree of
industrialization and suggested changes in educational. and training systelr,s.
7.        In the short run most export products of thp Ivory Coast are expected
to remain in strong demand and export receipts will therefore grow rapidly.
However, imports will rise rapidly as well because of high inflation rates in
supplier countries and higher prices for food, fertilizer and oil in particular.
The net oil import bill is expected to go up from US$15 million in 1972 to US$70
million in 1974 and US$80 million in 1975 or from 3 percent of 1972 commodity
imports to 7 percent of forecast 1975 imports. The Government has taken steps
to cushion the impact of higher imports on the country's balance of pavments.
For instance, the retail price of petroleum products has been increased sharply



while the producer price for rice has been doubled to encourage local produc-
tion. The Government is also considering increasing the country's relatively
low interest rate structure to stimulate local savings and to discourage the
transfer of private earnings abroad. However, on balance, there is expected
to remain a resource gap of about US$45 million in 1974 and US$85 million in
1975, which is equivalent to 4.2 percent of total exports of goods and non-
factor services in 1974-75. In contrast, in the 1965-70 period, the Ivory
Coast enjoyed a resource surplus of US$35 million per year on the average.
8.        Based on past experience, Ivory Coast's economy may be expected to
be responsive to the new price structure in the longer run. Good growth pro-
spects in several sectors will facilitate the necessary structural adjustments
to be induced by the Government. The Ivory Coast has a substantial potential
to increase its electricity generation from hvdro-sources. Sites additional to
the three in operation now were already under investigation before the oil
price went up and the program for hydroelectric development will be speeded
up. By the early eighties, an estimated 85 percent of Ivorian demand for elec-
tricity will be met from hydro-electric plants versus 40 percent at present.
The possibility of a relative advantage in the longer run in the energy sector
may accelerate the implementation of the Government's policy to process raw
materials locally rather than exporting them in unprocessed form as is still
the general practice. The Government's policy of encouraging the processing
of wood and locally grown agricultural crops is expected to benefit from
higher prices for these products.
9.        However, to bring about structural changes will take time. Moreover,
current Bank commodity price forecasts for the remainder of the 1970's indicate
a gradual deterioration of the terms of trade in the case of Ivory Coast. Pre-
liminary calculations therefore show that in the second half of the 1970's and
the early 1980's a resource gap might result of on average US$80-90 million
a year as against an earlier projection of an equilibrium in the goods and
non-factor services account.
10.       Based on the situation before the price increases, it was estimated
that financing a public investment program of around US$300 million per year
in 1974-75 would require substantial external aid. This program would enable
the economy to grow at 6.5 percent a year in real terms. It was calculated
for 1974-75 that, assuming a continuation of Government revenues well over
20 percent of GDP, about US$180 million per year would have to be financed by
disbursement of grant and loan funds and increased mobilization of private
domestic savings. Based on the pattern of disbursement in recent years, it
seemed likely that funds of this magnitude would be available. Financing
assistance would be contributed by the Ivory Coast's traditional aid donors -
France, Germany, Italy, the European Community - and by more recent lenders
in the Ivory Coast - the United States, Canada, Denmark, the African Develop-
ment Bank and the World Bank Group.
11.       Due to high rates of inflation in general and an oil related re-
source gap in particular, more foreign capital than originally anticipated
will be required to maintain an overall growth rate of the economy of 6 percent



- 4 -
per year. Since an increasing part of investments in the Ivory Coast takes
place in the public sector - 50 percent on average in 1965-1970 and 60 percent
in 1973 - a substantial part of the increased needs for financing from abroad
may be expected to occur in the public sector. The absorptive capacity in
terms of projects to be financed in the public sector is substantial. The
net inflow of foreign capital into the public sector in 1973 was US$165 mil-
lion; in 1980 it may need to be as high as US$250 million. Assuming that 5o-60
percent of future foreign capital requirements will be provided by international
organizations and foreign governments and the rest by more expensive sourees
like suppliers credit and private banks - a proportion similar to the one ex-
perienced in the past - the debt service rate would rise from its rather low
level of 6.6 percent in 1973 to around 15 percent in the early 1980's, which
is considered to be manageable. About 25 percent of the public investment
program would be financed by public savings after debt service as against
35 percent now.
12.       Although our projections must be refined and confirmed, these pre-
liminary calculations point to a substantial increase in the need for foreign
funds. A basic economic mission scheduled for 1975 will evaluate the countrv's
long-term prospects in the context of the draft 1976-1980 development plan.
This evaluation would include a thorough reexamination of our projections,
the underlying assumptions and especially the consequences for Ivory Coast's
external borrowing requirements. Total external public debt stood at US$895
million on December 31, 1973.
13.       The economic and fiscal performance of the Ivory Coast in the past
justifies the assumption that requirements for additional funds will be kept
at a reasonable level and that the country wAll be able to obtain those funds.
However, with the increase in capital requirements, the terms are becoming
increasingly important.   If for instance an increasing amou.t of future capi-
tal needs would be covered on terms offered in the Eurodollar market - to
which the Ivory Coast has access - the debt service could substantially sur-
pass the level of 15 percent projected for the 1980's. To keep the debt ser-.
-dIce manageable and to enable the Government to implement its development policy,
it is desirable that foreign capital be made available oni as concessionarV terms
as possible, including long repayment and grace periods. However, in view of
the still low debt service ratio, the good future growth potential of the eco-
nomy and the expected increase in export earnings, the Ivory Coast remains
creditworthy for substantial additional borrowing from the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE ITORY COAST
14.       Since 1968, the Bank's lending to the Ivory Coast has expanded
rapidly and now includes thirteen loans totalling US$122.4 million and an
IDA credit of US$7.5 million. Four of these fourteen operations have been
for roads; six were to the member companies of the SODEPALM Group for the
development of oil palm and coconut plantations and the construction of two



oil mills, of which the last one was presented to the Executive Directors
on June 27 of this year; the remaining four loans were for education, cocoa,
a rubber plantation and a telecommunications project presented to the Execu-
tive Directors on April 30 of this year. The IFC also has a small (US$204,000)
participation in the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank Group operations and notes on the execu-
tion of ongoing projects.
15.       The agricultural sector remains the principal foreign exchange
earner and domestic employer. It continues to provide close to 90 percent
of exports, to employ a majority of the population, to help stabilize an
increasingly mobile population, and to bring development to remote areas of
the country. Our principal efforts are, therefore, in this sector. A
cotton project has been appraised for submission early next year and an
agricultural resettlement project is under preparation for FY76. We are
also participating with the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE)
in preparing a rice project in the West of the Ivory Coast. The Government
has also requested our assistance in financing additional oil palm and
coconut development in the Ivory Coast's South-West, and in providing agri-
cultural credit.
16.       In support of agricultural development, we have placed considerable
emphasis on transportation and have become the principal lender for road con-
struction and maintenance. This is due largely to the fact that the Bank was
closely associated, as Executing Agency, with the 1968 UNDP Transport Survey
of the Ivory Coast. We expect that projects identified by this survey will
continue to be submitted to the Bank Group for financing in the next few years.
A Fifth Highway Project has been appraised this summer which includes the
Abidjan-Agboville and Katiola-Badikaha roads. The Government is also interest-
ed in obtaining our assistance in financing the realignment of a section of the
Abidjan-Ouagadougou rail line. Other sections of the rail line are being fi-
nanced by the FED and the EIB.
17.       Urban infrastructure and education are two important social sectors
in which we are involved, although our financial participation should remain
relatively modest. A Bank mission has just appraised a sewerage and drainage
project in the greater Abidjan area. This is the first phase of a ten-year
government program to improve the sanitation sector of Abidjan. A study of
the development of a new quarter of Abidjan is being financed with Bank funds.
With regard to education we are closely associated with the Government's
efforts to modernize its educational system principally at the secondary and
vocational levels. With the assistance of UNESCO, we have recently appraised
a small second project which will lay the ground for a larger third education
project. Two small projects in tourism and industrial development will be
appraised this fall. Substantial investments are also foreseen, in the later
years, for industry and power, areas in which we have not previously been
involved, but in which the Government foresees the need for the Bank Group's
participation.



-6-
18.       W4e have recently begun work on a small enterprise project which will
carry forward the special effort inaugurated in Western Africa through a
recent Bank study on the development of African private enterprise. We hope
to appraise it this fall. We were asked also to participate in a project
concerning agricultural marketing. However, after reviewing a consultant's
study and a preparation report of our Abidjan mission on this project, we
reached the conclusion that because of a general lack of experience in under-
takings of this kind and because of the unustual risks associated with the
project, the Bank could not participate in its financing.
19.       Of the total external lending to the public sector at the end of
1973 (total public debt outstanding), 30 percent was provided by Governments,
20 percent by international organizations (of which 60 percent by the Bank
Group), 20 percent came from private banks and through bond issues while 30
percent came in the form of suppliers' credits. The capital not supplied
by international organizations came mainly from four countries, France (35
percent), USA (27 percent), Italy (15 percent),and Germany (8 percent).
France and the European Economic Community remain the principal source of
development assistance in grant form. Altogether, grants accounted for 15
percent of the total flow of foreign assistance to the public sector.
20.       Bank  GrouD  lending which    has  averaeed  about
US$20 million per year in the mix years since we began operations in the
Ivory Coast, is expected to increase substant:ially over the next several
years. The Bank Group's share of the Ivory Coast's external debt is now
approximately 11 percent (including undisbursed) and may increase in the next
5 year period to about 18 percent. The Bank Group's share of debt service is
at present 3.4 percent and is expected to go up to about 7 percent by 1980.
PART ITI - AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
21.       Agriculture and forestrv account for about 90 percent of the Ivory
Coast's exports and 27 percent of its GT)P. They are the mainspring of the
country's growth and should remain so for many years to come. In 1970-72,
the Ivory Coast's exports on average were valued at CFAF 132.1 billion
(US$516 million) and three commodities -- coffee (32 percent), timber (25
percent) and cocoa (22 percent) accounted for about 80 percent of the value
of total exports. Three-quarters of the population depend directly or in-
directly on activity in this sector. Average per capita income earned in
agriculture including the value of subsistence production is roughly calcu-
lated at CFAF 28,000 (US$100) for 1970. Regional disparities are, however,
very large with the poorest areas being in the North of the country.
22.       Abundant land, good labor supply (including immigrant workers) mainly
from Upper Volta and Mali) and generally favorable world markets for its prin-
cipal products have assured rapid growth of this sector. Through diversifi-
cation, the Government has sought to reduce the country's dependence on coffee



- 7 -
and cocoa; efforts to increase the production of oil palm, bananas, pineapples,
coconuts, rice, cotton and rubber and to increase the exploitation of its
forest resources have been highly successful. For example, 13,000 ha of
rubber trees have been planted since the mid-1950's and in 1971 rubber pro-
duction amounted to about 13,000 tons. The new plan calls for continued
diversification, modernization of both coffee and cocoa cultivation, more
careful management of forest resources and domestic processing of wood.
23.       Until recently efforts to improve agricultural productivity have
been focused on various individual export crops. Promotion of these crops
by specialized autonomous, public companies has been quite successful. Food
crop production has not generally benefitted from this intensive promotional
effort and consequently has begun to lag. The Government has now turned its
attention to this situation and the inter-related problems of rural poverty
and regional income disparties. Projects currently under preparation support
the Government's planning. The Government has undertaken major programs for
cotton, rice and sugar as part of its plan for the development of the Northern
half of the country. As a result, cotton production has risen from 20,000
tons of seed cotton in 1965 to about 50,000 tons in 1972. Rice production
has reached 380,000 tons of paddy in 1971 and plans call for an increase of
170,000 tons by 1977. A sugar project is under implementation and is expected
to produce 60,000 tons of sugar and provide over two million dollars in income
to the population of the region.
24.       Wood is one of the principal exports of the Ivory Coast which
accounted on average for 25 percent of total commodity export earnings over
the 1970-73 period.  In 1972, about 3.3 million m3 of timber were exported,
95 percent in unprocessed form. The total roundwood production in that
year amounted to 4.1 million m3. The Goverrment, as part of its policy
of industrialization in which processing of local raw materials plays an impor-
tant role, is taking steps to guarantee the long-term supply of raw materials
to local wood processing industries. The current Plan (1971-75) foresaw a
gross production of logs of 3.5 million m3 per year for 1970-75 and 4.0
million m3 in 1980 with more than 40 percent of the latter being processed
locally. In the fall of 1974 a Bank-supported FAO mission is planned for the
Ivory Coast to discuss preparation of a forest inventory to enable better
forecasting of reserves and to improve forest management.
25.       The Cocoa Sub-Sector.   The total cocoa area in the Ivory Coast increased
from an estimated 172,000 ha in 1954 to some 422,000 ha in 1972/73. There are
about 235,000 cocoa farmers constituting generally part of the middle-income
farming community. Cocoa production has increased correspondingly from about
58,000 tons in 1954 to a high of 225,000 tons in 1971-72; it declined to 185,000
tons in 1972-73 due to unfavorable weather conditions. Average yields are
estimated to be between 450 kg/ha and 500 kg/ha.   In 1971-73, the Ivory Coast
was the third largest cocoa producer, just ahead of Brazil, with about 14 percent
of the world total. After timber and coffee, cocoa is the most important
Ivorian export crop accounting for roughly 22 percent of total exports. About
80 percent of production is exported as dry beans. Cocoa processing for export
as cocoa butter and paste is currently limited to 40,000 tons of beans and a
new plant, now under construction would add another 30,000 tons of capacity by 1976.



-8-
26.       The Bank estimates total world cocoa production at 1.8 and 2.1
million tons in 1980 and 1985 respectively, of which Ivory Coast's share
should amount to about 290,000 tons and 335,000 tons respectively. If these
expectations materialize, Ivory Coast production will keep pace with an esti-
mated world demand and supply growth rate of about 3 percent annually.
27.       The Ivory Coast has extensive areas of land suited for cocoa prodUc-
tion. In 1970 the Government introduced a program of promoting high yielding
planting material, as well as of improving establishment and maintenance tech-
niques. By mid-1974, about 35,000 ha had been planted under this program and
a total of some 120,000 ha are expected to be planted by 1980. The strategy
selected by the Government is to rehabilitate existing trees to achieve a
quick increase in production and at the same time to expand the acreage under
cocoa, using new high yielding varieties. The new planting program helps
balanced regional development by being concentrated in the western part of
the country where income-earning cash crop production is much less developed
than in the East.
28.       In an effort to assist the Government's cocoa development program.
the Bank made an initial loan of US57.5 million (iVC-686) in June 1970'
for planting and rehabilitation. Although there have been delays in the
completion of the planting program due to drought, the project is progressing
satisfactorily and preliminarv indications are that yields will meet appraisal
estimates.
29.      The Government has recently introduced a quality premium of CFAIF
60,000 per ha of cocoa planted under programs administered by Socitt4 d'AnssiF
tance Technique pour la Moderrisation Agricole de la Cote dlIvoire (SATACI)
which is responsible for all cocoa planting.   This premium would be distrilbuted
in two yearly installments of CFAF 30,000 bee4nning after the first year of
planting.  In order to be eligible for the premium under the scheme the farrransrl
plantation would have to meet s-trict quality criteria prepared by the Govern.
ment and SATMACI. SAThACI expects that less than 50 percent of all new planters
would qualify for the premium, which would result in a total cost of about CFAF
500 is.Ulion per year. Through the premium program the Government would return
to tVe farmers only a small fraction of its total cocoa revenues of more thar
CFAF 20 billion per year; the premium paid would be the equivalent of about
CFAF 2.5/kg, or about 1.4 percent, of the current producer price.
30.       The proposed project would help the Government to reach its produc-
tion objectives in the cocoa sector. As most of the project is located in the
western and central areas, it would meet the needs of balanced regional growth.
In addition, it would help develop new cooperatives, through which the rehabil-
itation program would be carried out.
PART IV - THE PROPOSED PROJECT
31.       A report entitled "Appraisal of A Second Cocoa Project" (No. 486a-IVC
dated November 18, 1974) is being distributed separately. A loan and project
summary are in Annex III.   Negotiations for the loan took place from October
7, 1974 to October 11, 1974. The Ivorian delegation was headed by Mr. Hovine,
Director General of the Caisse d'Amortissement and included Messrs. Porquet
from the Ministry of Agriculture, Semavoine coordinator of external f'nancing
of SATMACI, Pape from BNDA and Sako from the Embassy.



9 -
32.      The project would be concentrated in the central and western portions of
the country, where soils and rainfall conditions are suitable for cocoa growing
and land is available for expansion. The estimated population in the project area
is just over one million. Farm size averages between 2 ha and 7 ha with 1 ha to
3 ha of cocoa, depending on the region, and the rest in food crops and coffee.
Corresponding per capita incomes range from less than US$100 to about US$360, but
most participants in the project are expected to have per capita incomes of less
than US$170, or only about half of the national average.
33.       The project would be carried out over seven years (1974-1981) and
consist of:
(a) establishing 26,500 ha of high yielding cocoa plantations,
9,500 ha of which would be planted in 76 blocks and main-
tenance until entry into production of trees planted under
the first project;
(b) providing technical assistance and credit for cooperatives
in conjunction with the blocks;
(c) rehabilitating and constructing 330 km of access roads, land
clearing and constructing 146 wells;
(d) strengthening SATMACI's management, training its staff in
technical and administrative matters, providing and equipping
additional extension, credit and survey services; and
(e) hiring consultants to recommend improvements in the organization
or credit administration and to evaluate the results of the
first project.
The project was included in the production forecast of the recent paper entitled
"The World Cocoa Market" (Ref. R74-36) which was reviewed by the Executive
Directors on April 2, 1974. It was also included in the list of future Bank
activities in cocoa which has received support from FAO and the project has
specifically been accepted by the staff of the International Cocoa Organization.
34.       The project would cover the costs of all necessary extension and
credit services at the regional, zonal and field levels, including staff
salaries, vehicles and operating expenses. Training would be provided for
field level extension workers, credit officers and surveyors, and a program
for the recruitment and training of replacements for expatriate staff would
be instituted, beginning with the appointment of deputies to the two expatriate
SATMACI Regional Directors who supervise operations in the Project area.
Project Execution
35.       SATMACI (Societe d'Assistance Technique pour la Modernisation
Agricole de la Cote d'Ivoire) which has been responsible for carrying out the
first cocoa project, would also be executing agency for this project. SATMACI
was formed in 1958 as a statutory corporation under the Ministry of Agriculture.



- 10 -
Its main activities are cocoa and coffee rehabilitation and planting. The
expansion of its activities under the proposed project, and the need to co-
ordinate planning and budgeting with the Ministries of Agriculture and Finance,
would require some strengthening of senior management. Under the proposed
project, three new positions would be created (Section 4.05 of the loan agree-
ment). A Financial Director would take over responsibility for financial plan-
ning and control from the present Director of Administration, and a Planning
Advisor would develop, in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture, medium
and long-term plans for SATMACI activities. In addition, a Project Inspector
would be appointed to assist the Director of the Cocoa Department and carry
out regular field supervision of the project.
36.      The planting programs would be achieved by providing some 17,000 farmers
with planting material and with credit for equipment, fertilizers and insecticides
under the close supervision of SATMACI. Farmers themselves would pay a portion of
the cost of the planting material and would provide hand tools, materials for the
construction of nursery shelters and labor requirements. The main innovation
of the proposed project would be the creation of large blocks of cocoa plantings
from former forest land or lands held in reserve by the villages. Plots in
these blocks would be allocated on an individual basis but their close proximdty
would facilitate the supervision of field work and credit, the creation of
cooperatives, the improvement of access roads andthe provision of water points
to farmers. Each block, with an average size of 2GO ha, would take two to four
years to complete planting.
37.       Cooperatives.  One of the benefits of block plantlng is the facil-
itation of the development of cooperatives for the production and commercial-
ization of cocoa. The project would finance technical assistance and the
training of cooperative officials, to be provided by CENAPEC (Centre National
pour la Promotion des Entreprises Cooperatives). In addition, the project
would finance special credits to members of block cooperatives in the forn;
of transportation services during planting and the construction of storage
facilities.
38.       Roads.  Although main roads in the project area are generally satis-
factory, individual cocoa plantings are sometimes difficult to reach. Tne
project would provide for the construction of about 270 km of roads and the
rehabilitation of another 60 km to permit access to block plantings. The
roads would be constructed by SODEPALM, the oil palm development agency which
has spare capacity to do this work. Subsequent maintenance would be carried
out by SATMACI which would establish a special unit for this purpose.
39.       Well Construction.  The project would finance some 146 wells, or
about one per 100 ha of block planting. These wells would serve to supply
water to farmers and workers, to group cocoa nurseries and for the spraying
of the trees with insecticides. The well program would be implemented by the
BANDAMA VALLEY AUTHORITY (AVB) which has an adequately equipped and staffed
well unit to carry out the SATMACI program in addition to its own.
40.       Consultants and Studies.  The project would provide for a consultant
to study and help to implement the reorganizaton of the credit accounting sys-
tem. Further, an evaluation of the first project would be carried out in 1975.
It would include a survey of plantings and yields, information on farm budgets
and family income and expenditure and assessment of effectiveness of extension
services. These data would help in the planning of integrated rural develop-
ment in the forest region.



- 11 -
41.       Training.  The proposed project would include a training component
at SATMACI's Gagnoa Training Center and provide for instructors for extension,
credit and surveyors training; supporting staff and operating costs for the
training center; investments in vehicles, electrical, teaching and audiovisual
equipment to assist the extension staff in instructing farmers; and per diem
for trainees. In addition, the training costs of the program for replacing
expatriate personnel would also be financed under the project.
42.       Marketing.  The purchase from producers and export of cocoa is
mainly in the hands of the private sector under conditions set by the CSSPPA
(Caisse de Stabilisation et de Soutien des Prix des Produits Agricoles) which
itself exports about 10 percent of the annual crop. Farmers sell cocoa to
local buying agents who pay the farmer the guaranteed farmgate price and are
allowed a fixed commission on purchases. The proposed project would assist
the development of marketing cooperatives tc assume the role of the first in-
termediary in the marketing chain, thereby earning for participating farmers
the buying agent's commission which is currently about CFAF 6/kg.
Other Institutions
43.       The Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Agricole (BNDA) was
formed in January 1968, to be the main instrument for financing agricultural
development. BNDA has not been staffed to evaluate credit applications from
small scale farmers, hence most production credit has so far been administered
by the specialized agencies, such as SATMACL and SODEPALM. For instance,
Credit Funds under the First Cocoa Project are channeled through BNDA although
their distribution and administration have remained in the hands of SATMACI.
Under the proposed project BNDA would, in addition to being a channel for Bank
funds, contribute itself to the project by financing credits to farmers
(Section 3.03 (a) of the loan agreement).
4.1       CSSPPA, the Government's price stabilization fund, controls the
marketing of cocoa, coffee and cotton in the Ivory Coast, guaranteeing both
producer and exporter prices. Surpluses accumulated by CSSPPA that are not
required for building reserves, are used to promote export crop production
and processing, and other government investment programs.
45.       The Institut Francais du Cafe, du Cacao et Autres Plantes
Stimulantes (IFCC) is one of several French organizations designated to under-
take agricultural research under a technical assistance agreement with France.
IFCC has developed the high yielding hybrids and the cropping methods currently
used to improve cocoa planting in the Ivory Coast and will provide the seeds
for the proposed project.
Cost and Financing
46.       Project costs are estimated at US$34.7 million including duties and
taxes (US$4.4 million) and capitalized interest (US$3.2 million) on the Bank
loan. The foreign exchange component is US$17.9 million or 52 percent of total
costs. Cost estimates are based on February 1974 prices. Contingencies of
about US$10.2 million amount to 48 percent of base cost. A detailed breakdown
of cost estimates is shown in Annex III.



- 12-
47.       Financing.  The following table shows a sunmmary of the financing
plan for the project:
Contributions            Percent
(in US$ MiLlions)
IBRD                             20.4 /1                  59 12

TOTAL                  34.7                    100
/1   includes US$0.4 million from the first loan to finance
cost up to the signing date of the second Loan.
/2   about 67 percent of the net of tax cost.
46.       The Bank loan would be made to the Government.   Funds intended for
farmers and cooperatives credit (US$2.3 million, including contingencies) would
be onlent by the Government to BNDA (Section 3.02 (a) of the loan agreement) at
the same interest rate as the Bank loan, with repayments tied to those of farmers'
loans.  BNIA would pass the funds on to SATMACI (Section 3.03 (a) of the loan
agreement) for disbursement to participating farmers in kind (Sections 3.04
and 3.05 of the loan agreement). The farmerst credits would have a term of
eight years, with four years grace and carry an interest rate of 8 percen>t.
Funds to cover the costs of infrastructure (US$3.6 million, including contin-
gencies) and of extension and cooperative services, project staff, general.
administration, survey and mapping, training and studies (US$10.9 milolion,
including contingencies) would be passed on to SATNACI as a grant, ThLe reraininu
funds (US$3.2 million) would be iTsed to pay the capitalized inlmacest. on tbe F>;TnJ-c
loan.
1w.       In order to simplify the administration of th.le two projects, it is
proposed that the unused balance of the first loan (686-IVC) should he can-
celled on the signing of the second loan. At that time (assumed to be
December 1974) a balance of approximately US$2.5 million of the first loan
would be unused.  This consists of (a) savings from reduction irn the level oc
fertilizer use and in the size of the rehabilitation programs (US$1 .2 million)
and (b) savings associated with concluding disbursements under the first pros-
ect in 1975 rather than as originally planned in September 1977 (JS$1 .3 mil-
lion). The Bank's share of the costs of completing the first project is inclu-
ded in the proposed second lotn,
50.       Procurement and disbursemetnt.  All contracts over US$50,000 for
the procurement of fertilizers, insecticides, sprayers, vehicles and equipment
(totalling US$ 3.6million) would be through international competitive bidding
in accordance with IBRD guidelines. Domestically manufactured goods would be
allowed a preference of 15 percent (or level of iuport duty, whichever is
lower) when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign manufacturers.
Contracts for buildings valued at US$1.3 million, involving several operations
scattered across the project area, are not likely to afttract foreign interest
and wouil be awarded on thIe basis of cornpetitive biddinp. advertiseci loca,lv andl



in accordance with local proce Au!s which are satisfactory to the Bank.    It
is proposed that the roads (US$4.4 nmillion) and the wells (US$1.0 million)
be constructed by force account by SODEPALM and the Autorite de la Vallee du
Bandema (AVB) respectively. The major part of project costs, (US$ 21.2million)
would be for on-farm hired labor and material to be procured by the farmers
themselves, planting materials, staff salaries and operating costs; none of
these would be suitable for competitive bidding.
51.       Disbursements of the proposed loan would cover:
(i)  100 percent of CIF cost or 80 percent of total cost (representing
the estimatednet of tax ^-nd dutv coimonent) if procured locally
of vehicles and equipment, fertilizers, sprayers and insecticides;
(ii)  90 percent of total costs of staff salaries for training, survey,
cooperative, road maintenance, administration and extension
services; and of training grants for Ivorian personnel to re-
place expatriate staff;
(iii)  80 percent of total costs of studies and of survey and maDping
of project plantings;
(iv) 70 percent of total costs of civil works; and
(v)  40 percent of the operating cost of Hroject vehicles and personnel.
Any funds remaining undisbursed upon completion of the project would be can-
celled. A schedule of estimated disbursements is included in Annex III.
52.       Economic Justifications and Benefits.   Although the Government has
introduced several successful programs to expand its economy beyond the main
cash crops, coffee and cocoa, the poorest sections of the forest zone covered
by the project, offer only limited possibilities for diversification.    The
study referred to in paragraph 36 should help to define the growth potential
of other crops.
53.       The principal direc;. be-efits of the project would primarily take the
form of increases in farmer inucmes. These increases range from CFAF 106,000
(uS$440) for individuals planting the minimum of one hectare to CFAF 350,000
(US$1*,h60) for block participants planting an expected maximum of three hectares.
These increments represent increases of between 20 percent and more than 200
percent of present farm incomes with average increments expected to be higher in
the poorer western parts of the project area (paragraph 32). Net revenues
per man-day are expected to be about CFAF 1,300 as compared to the going
agriculture wage of CFAF 250.
53.       The principal direct benefits of the project would primarily be
increases in farmer incomes. These increases range from CFAF 106,000 (US$440)
for invidivuals planting the minimum of one hectare to CFAF 350,000 (US$1,460)
for block participants planting an expected maximum of three hectares. Net
revenues per man-day are expected to be about CFAF 1,300 as compared to the
going agriculture wage of CFAF 250.
54.       Through increased cocoa output, the project would also contribute
to higher foreign exchange earnings and Government revenues. Based on pro-
jected world market prices, net annual foreign exchange earnings by 1985
would be about US$23 million, while net Government revenues would amount to
about CFAF 2.8 billion (US$11.7 million). The economic rate of return is
estimated at 36 percent.



- 14 -
55.       Over and above the project direct benefits, there would be important
secondary benefits such as the institutional strengthening of SATMACI, parti-
cularly in the areas of finance, planning and training. The creation of co-
operatives for the commercialization of cocoa would help the farmers to gain
a higher proportion of the value of their produce. Through its infrastruc-
ture and well component, the project would also help to raise the standard
of living of the farming community.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
56.       The draft Loan Agreement (Second Cocoa Project) between the Bank and
the Republic of the Ivory Coast, the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
draft resolution approving the proposed Loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
57.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 30 through 46 of this report.
58.       1 am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
59.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Procurement arrangements
All contracts over US$50,000 for the procurement of fertilizers,
insecticides, sprayers, vehicles and equipment (totalling about US$3.6 mil-
lion) would be through international competitive bidding in accordance with
IBRD guidelines. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed a prefer-
ence of 15 percent (or level of import duty, whichever is lower) when comparing
domestic bids with those of foreign manufactures. Contracts for buildings
valued at US$1.3 million, involving several operations scattered across the
project area, are not likely to attract foreign interest and would be awarded
on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally and in accordance with
local procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. It is proposed that the
roads (USSL~ .1 million) and the wells (US$1.0 million) be constructed by force
account through other Government agencies, SODEPALM and the Autorite de la
Vallee de Bandema (AVB) respectively.   The major part of project costs, US$21.2
million, would be for on-farm hired labor and material to be procured by the farm-
ers them-selves, planting materials, staff salaries, and operating costs; none of
these would be suitable for competitive bidding.
Rate of return:
36 nercent.
