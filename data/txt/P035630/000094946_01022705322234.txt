REPUBLIC OF MALI
AGRICULTURAL SERVICES AND PRODUCER ORGANIZATIONS PROJECT
ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report analyses the Environmental and Social Impact of theAgricultural Services and
Producer Organizations Program (PASAOP). The work consisted in identifying activities
proposed under PASAOP that could induce positive or negative impacts on environment (physical,
biological, and social). PASAOP main objectives being to strengthen the institutional capacity of
MDR and of its personnel toward a sustainable rural sector development, its direct impacts on the
environment would be very limited. However, for the long term, there is little doubt that after its
execution PASAOP activities will induce positive social and environmental impacts.
PASAOP Components
PASAOP will be executed through four components:
- Component I: Support to MDR Reforms toward its rationalization and deconcentration;
- Component II: Support to the National Agricultural Research System;
- Component III: Support to the National Agricultural extension System;
- Component IV: Support to Producer Organizations.
Methodology
The work was based on: (i) field surveys and interviews of field technical staff and producers, and;
(ii) thorough analysis of the proposed PASAOP activities as described in the preparation reports.
A. The Environmental Aspects.
Safeguard Policy -- Environmental Assessment The PASAOP's potential impact shows little
trade-off between stimulating efficient agricultural growth, and sustainable natural resource
development. The agricultural strategy supported under PASAOP argues that Mali's agricultural
growth potential lies in the high and medium-potential areas, and the greater the degree to which
this potential can be tapped, the less pressure there will be to expand intensive agricultural
frontiers into the more fragile areas. Indiscriminate expansion into the arid lands should be
cautiously held in check and intensification of agriculture in the high potential areas must be
associated with appropriate land use practices. Soil erosion and degradation is already a serious
problem and sustainability of the natural resource base must be a priority in the strategy. While
the increased use of inorganic fertilizers and pesticides are important to increase productivity and
output this has to be associated with an integrated "agro-ecological" approach to agricultural
research and extension which stress conservation measures such as maintaining vegetative cover
and retention of soil organic matter as well as integrated pest management.



Safeguard Policy -- Pest Management. Although procurement of pesticides is not envisaged under
the project, it is expected that the necessary intensification of agriculture will possibly lead to
increased use of pesticides (and of inorganic fertilizers). However, the overall objective of the
project being to increase producer income, improved farm management methods and techniques (to
decrease the cost of production) will seek promote a better efficiency of extemal (chemicals) inputs
and might result in a decrease of such external inputs. The proposed training and extension activities
under the project will be aiming at promoting an integrated "agro-ecological" approach to
agricultural research and extension which stress conservation measures such as maintaining
vegetative cover and retention of soil organic matter as well as integrated pest management. In
particular specific IPM activities (see Annex on IPM Special Initiative, with the IPM
Implementation Plan) have been included for execution during the project under the research and
extension components as well as under the MDR reform component (as far as its regulatory and
control functions are concerned). Further, during negotiations assurances were obtained that the
Government would apply, or have applied, standards and procedures for the utilization of
agricultural chemicals in connection with agricultural extension activities which are satisfactory to
the Bank. The project is in compliance with the Safeguard Policy, and in addition under the "Rural
Disaster Prevention and Emergency Assistance Program", it includes specific provision (US$1.0
million) for the co-financing of removal of obsolete pesticides stocks throughout the country.
B. The Social Aspects
The major social issues for the project are the feasibility of implementing the demand-driven
R&D and extension programs through producer organizations and the impact of the technological
innovation on the poor and disadvantaged groups.  Producer organizations ranging from
commodity-based groups, to community and irrigation associations exist in all ecoregions in
Mali. Some groups are quite strong and have already access to technology, training, and
information services.  The project would provide support directly to the most capable
organizations while investing in training and promotional activities to strengthen the capacity of
others. A proactive infornation and education/training program would be developed to ensure
that the poor and the disadvantage groups can have a voice and participate actively in the design
and management of technology generation and transfer programs.
Social groups in Mali vary considerably in population size, internal social differentiation, and
social influence. Nonetheless, no ethnic groups in Mali are deemed to be indigenous under the
definitions of the Bank's policy on Indigenous Peoples. Some PASAOP project activities will
take place in areas frequented by small ethnic groups, such as transhumant herders and traditional
(semi-nomadic) fishermen. These groups will get benefits from the project not because they are
indigenous but because they constitute a set a stakeholders whose special needs have been
recognized and are dealt with the Project. However, some of these groups for various reasons
have received limited attention and support from public and/or NGO intervention and could be
considered as "vulnerable groups". During preparation specific possible interventions have been
identified toward these vulnerable groups (including women), and in particular the semi-nomadic
Bozos fishermen in the Mopti area. A Vulnerable Groups Special Initiative has been
formulated and would be led by a high-level specialist contracted through DNAMR to ensure in a
very proactive manner that initiatives and actions will effectively take place during project
implementation to address the particular issues and needs of these groups.
Operational Policy -- The Gender Dimension of Development. As indicated above, the social
issues related to the Safeguard Policies have been integrated in project design. A specific gender
assessment study was carried out during project preparation and identified women's lack of access



to extension as a critical issue. Insufficient efforts have been made to improve the quality and the
dissemination of technical recommendations for products like fruit, vegetables, small livestock,
which are mainly the responsibility of women producers. Fishing and fish marketing (specifically
women activity) have also been identified as having good potentialities to alleviate poverty in
terms of income and nutrition.
The program would therefore include a comprehensive program of actions (the above-mentioned
Vulnerable Groups Special Initiative to address the specific needs of both women and
vulnerable groups producers. Key indicators with regard to gender dimension and vulnerable
groups have been defined for monitoring and evaluation purpose for each project component.
Under research and extension, agricultural activities that are either solely or largely carried out by
women (crop production; livestock; food processing techniques; and utilization, storage and
marketing of farm products and other off-farm income-generating activities) will be given special
attention. Research and extension on the post-harvest, value-added processing activities that
women carry out will be increased. Specific criteria for the selection of demand-driven
technology generation and transfer projects will ensure that women issues will be taken into
account in a systematic manner. The scope of the extension program in particular would include
the training of all extension agents on gender and poverty issues, the number of female extension
agents would be increased. Finally, project financing would include provision for undertaking
beneficiary assessments, specific surveys and analysis to assess and monitor in particular the
participation of women and vulnerable groups producers in rural production and rural commercial
activities.

ANALYSE D'IMPACT ENVIRONNEMENTAL ET SOCIAL
SOMMAIRE
Le present rapport est relatf a l'evaluation d'impact environnemental et social du Programme
d'Appui aux Services Agricoles et aux Organisations Paysannes (PASAOP). 11 analyse les
consequences possibles qu'aurait la realisation du programme en ce qui concerne les aspects
environnementaux et sociaux.
L'analyse d'impact a consiste a identifier les activit6s du PASAOP susceptibles de provoquer des
changements soit positifs ou negatifs sur l'environnement (physique, biologique, social et leurs
interactions). Le PASAOP etant un programme de renforcement des capacites institutionnelles du MDR et
des competences environnementales de son personnel pour un developpement durable et soutenable, ses
impacts directs sur l'environnement physique sonttres limites ou presque inexistants. La mise en euvre du
programme telle que definie a travers ses principaux objectifs, aura plus d'impacts posiSfs que negatifs sur
l'environnement.
Rappel des grandes lignes d'intervention du PASAOP
Le PASAOP aidera a:
a. appuyer le Ministere du Developpement Rural dans la mise en ceuvre des reformes institutionnelles
prevues dans le cadre de la Lettre de Politique de Developpement Institutionnel du Secteur Rural, en
particulier en ce qui concerne le recentrage et la rationalisation de ses services en distinguant: (i) les
activites dites "r6galiennes" concernant les strategies et politiques de developpement du secteur rural
(et de leur financement ), la reglementation et le contr6le, le suivi et evaluation des programmes et
projets; (ii) des activites pouvant etre transferees au secteur priv6 (production eVou commercialisation)
ou a des entites autonomes contractualisees par l'Etat ou les producteurs eux-memes;
b. dans le cadre du processus de d6centralisation initib par le Gouvernement du Mali, accompagner la
deconcentration des services du MDR au niveau regional et local;
c. appuyer le Systeme National de Recherche Agricole de facon a: (i) separer la planification et
financement des programmes de recherche de leur execution; (ii) mieux repondre aux demandes des
producteurs, et; (iii) mettre en place des mecanismes de financement durable;
d. appuyer le Systeme National de Vulgarisation Agricole et l'orienter vers un r6gionalisation des
programmes et budgets, et une meilleure prise en compte de la demande des producteurs en matibre
de conseils agricoles, par une contractualisation progressive des services avec le secteur prive eVou
des structures autonomes de conseil agricole;
4



e. renforcer la capacite des producteurs a travers leurs representatons locales, regionales et nationales
pour acceder a un systeme de financement a la demande en matiere de formabon, et de conseils
techniques, organisationnels ou de gestion
Principaux ProbIlmes Environnementaux et Sociaux identifies ou possibles dans le cadre du
PASAOP.
Le travail entrepris a e  realise a partir de:
1. I'analyse des resultats d'enquete de terrain aupres des services techniques specialises et des
populations concernees;
2. I'analyse detaillee des activites prevues dans le cadre des differentes composantes du PASAOP telles
decrites dans les rapports de pr6paration
11 est important de noter que le PASAOP est essentiellement un programme de renforcement des capacites
en matiere de services d'appui a l'agriculture en general, et non un programme d'investissement pouvant
faire appel a des amenagements, constructions importantes, ou achats de produits chimiques. L'analyse a
utlise comme cadre de travail la Directive Operationnelle 4.01 (Fevrier 1999) de la Banque Mondiale et en
particulier ses politiques de sauvegarde en ce qui conceme l'evaluation environnementale, la gestion des
biocides, la foret, les peuples indigenes, et les habitats naturels.
A. Aspects Environnementaux.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative a l'Evaluation Environnementale. L'impact potentiel du PASAOP sur
la gestion durable des ressources naturelles n'est pas incompatible avec I'amelioration efficace de la
croissance agricole. En effet, la strategie pr6conis6e par le PASAOP est que le potentiel de croissance du
secteur agricole au Mali se trouve dans des zones relativement limitees a haut et moyen potentiel, et que
plus ce potentel est valorise, moins la pression est forte pour etendre les superficies cultivees de facon
intensive aux zones plus fragiles.  L'extension des exploitations aux zones arides devra etre
scrupuleusement contr6lee, et de plus, l'intensification de l'agriculture dans les zones a haut et moyen
potentiel devra etre associee a des pratiques d'utilisation des sols appropriees. L'erosion et la degradation
des sols posent d6ja des problemes serieux and la sauvegarde des ressources naturelles doit etre une
priorite de la strategie de developpement rural. Bien que l'utilisation d'engrais chimiques et de biocides va
permettre une amelioration de la productivite des exploitations et de la production agricole, il importe que
les services d'appui aux producteurs, a travers en particulier la recherche et les conseils agricoles, puissent
y associer et promouvoir rapidement une approche integree plus "agro-ecologique", comme par exemple
des techniques de conservation des eaux et des sols, 1'emploi de couvert vegetatif, la fertilisation organique,
et une gestion integree des predateurs.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative aux Habitats Naturels. Dans le cadre du PASAOP, aucune activitb
de d6frichage de terres eVou de changement de vegetation naturelle n'est envisagee. Au contraire, comme
indique plus haut, les activit6s du projet resulteront en une meilleure gestion des ressources existantes et
une diminution de la pression pour etendre les superficies cultiv6es de fa,on intensive dans des zones plus
fragiles. A cet egard, le PASAOP est tout a fait en conformite avec la politique de sauvegarde concernant
les habitats naturels sans autre mesure particuliere.
5



Politique de Sauvegarde relative a la Foret. Dans le cadre du PASAOP, aucune activit6 relative a la
for6t n'est envisag6e. A cet egard, le PASAOP est tout a fait en conformite avec la politique de sauvegarde
concernant la foret sans autre mesure particuliere.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative a la Gestion des Maladies et Predateurs. Bien que, dans le cadre du
PASAOP il ne soit pas envisage d'acheter des pesticides (biocides), I'intensification de l'agriculture pourrait
amener a faire appel a un usage plus important de pesticides (et d'engrais chimiques). Cependant,
I'objectif global du projet etant d'am6liorer les revenus des producteurs, les methodes de gestion amblior6e
des exploitations ainsi que les nouvelles techniques appropriees cherchant a diminuer les coots de
production permettront une meilleure gestion et efficacite des intrants chimiques et en definitive auront
globalement comme cons6quence une diminution des intrants inorganiques. Le PASAOP a cet egard a
inclus a travers ses differentes composantes des actions visant a une meilleure gestion des maladies et
predateurs (revision du cadre macro-economique, l6gislatif et fiscal de l'importation et la distribution des
biocides, appui a la reglementation et contr6le de la gestion des produits, programmes specifiques de
recherche, de formaton et de conseils, etc.). Compte tenu de la nbcessite d'avoir un pilotage et un suivi
"transversal" de ces activites, le PASAOP a prevu la mise en place d'une "Initiative Speciale pour la
Promotion de la Lutte lntegree", permettant a une equipe de techniciens sp6cialis6s au sein de la DNAMR
de veiller a ce que tous ces aspects soient effectivement et correctement pris en compte. Par ailleurs, le
PASAOP a inscrit un financement specifique pour aider le Gouvernement du Mali a eliminer des stocks de
pesticides obsoletes et a traiter les zones contaminees.
Gestion de la Fertilite des Sols. 11 est a noter egalement que le PASAOP a travers ses composantes a
egalement prevu une "Initiative Speciale pour ia Fertilite des Sols" qui, comme pour la lutte integree, doit
intervenir de fagon "horizontale" a travers les differentes composantes sous le pilotage et le suivi particulier
d'une equipe sp6cialisee au sein de la DNAMR.]
Gestion des Espaces Pastoraux. L'levage transhumant au Mali joue un role economique tres important
compte tenu aussi de sa place dans le produit brut agricole qu'en ce qui concerne les revenus des
producteurs. Les espaces pastoraux ont 6t6 fragilises par les grandes s6cheresses, et on a assist6 dans
beaucoup de zones a une d6gradation des ressources pastorales. A cet effet, dans le cadre du PASAOP,
en particulier de la composante d'appui au conseil agricole, il a 6t6 pr6vu de soutenir un programme
regional pilote pastoral qui vise a promouvoir une approche participative pour une gestion durable des
espaces pastoraux.
B. Aspects Sociaux.
Un des objectifs du PASAOP est de renforcer la capacite des producteurs a exprimer leurs besoins en
matiere de services d'appui et a participer de fagon efficace a la preparation des programmes et des
budgets correspondants a travers leurs modes de representation au niveau local, regional et national. Les
reformes des systemes nationaux de recherche et de conseil agricole ont ete congues pour leur adaptation
progressive a une approche participative et contractualisee avec des entites publiques plus autonomes
eVou privees.  La question est de savoir si les programmes de generation et de transfert de technologies
d6veloppees grace au PASAOP aura un impact equitable entre les differents groupes de producteurs etlou
couches sociales, en un mot est-ce que les besoins groupes defavorises eVou vulnerables pourront etre
prise en compte de facon efficace par le PASAOP. 11 existe au Mali bon nombre d'organisations de
producteurs organis6s autour d'une filibre ou d'un systbme d'irrigation, d'associations ou groupements
communautaires ou villageois.   Bien evidemment la capacite technique et organisationnelle de ces
6



organisations de producteurs et groupes sociaux est tres variable au Mali. Certains sont d6ja suffisamment
bien organis6s et formes pour avoir acces a l'information et aux services d'appui prevus dans le cadre du
projet. Pour les autres, un programme d'information, de sensibilisation et de formation permettra de
renforcer leur capacit6 et s'assurer que les groupes plus defavorises ne seront pas exclus dans
l'elaboration des programmes d'appui et dans leur execution.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative aux Populations lndigenes. Les groupes sociaux au Mali sont tres
variables en taille de population, organisation sociale interne, and influence sociale. Cependant, aucun
groupe ethnique ne peut etre consid6r6 comme "indigene" selon la definition de la politique de sauvegarde
4.09 de la Banque Mondiale. Les activites du PASAOP vont etre realisees sur 1'ensemble du territoire,
entre autre dans des regions peuplees de groupes ethniques minoritaires, comme par exemple certains
eleveurs transhumants et pecheurs traditionnels semi-nomades. Ces groupes vont beneficier du projet non
pas parce qu'ils sont "indigenes", mais parce qu'ils font partie des producteurs dont les besoins sp6cifiques
ont bte identifies et pour lesquels des actions sont prevues dans le projet. Ces groupes, pour differentes
raisons, n'ont souvent pas re,u auparavant une attention suffisante et des appuis sp6cifiques de la part des
services publics eVou des ONGs. A cet egard ils peuvent etre consid6res comme des "groupes
vulnerables". Durant la preparation du PASAOP, des possibilites d'interventions specifiques ont ete
identifiees pour ces groupes vulnerables qui comprennent entre autre certaines minorit6s ethniques ou
sociales (comme les pecheurs Bozos semi-nomades dans la zone de Mopti), et les femmes (la dimension
fgenre" est abordee plus bas). Une "Initiative Sp6ciale Groupes Vuln6rables" a et6 definie et il est prevu de
recruter un(e) specialiste en la matiere pour piloter et suivre de manibre tres active ces actions pour que les
specificites de ces groupes soient effectivement prises en compte.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative a la Dimension Genre dans le Developpement Rural. Comme
mentionne plus haut, grace a l'approche participative et au processus de decentralisation qui guident les
reformes envisag6es dans le cadre du PASAOP, les aspects sociaux ont ete largement pris en compte des
la conception meme du projet. Une 6tude specifique sur la dimension genre a ete entreprise pendant la
preparation du projet et a identifie la difficulte des femmes a avoir acces aux conseils agricoles. Des efforts
insuffisants ont et6 faits jusqu'a present pour ameliorer la pertinence, la qualitb et la diffusion des
recommandations techniques relatives a la production fruitiere, au maraichage, et au petit 6levage, qui sont
dans une large mesure des activites specifiquement reserv6es aux femmes. La peche et en particulier la
commercialisation des produits de la peche (qui est une activite generalement reservee aux femmes) ont
6galement ete identifiees comme etant des possibilit6s pour diminuer la pauvrete aussi bien en termes de
revenus que de nutrition. Tous ces aspects ont ete pris en compte dans le cadre du projet et il sera de la
responsabilite de l'equipe chargee de l'initiative Sp6ciale pour les Groupes Vuln6rables de s'assurer que
des actions pertinentes (voir le tableau d'actions prevues) sont effectivement realis6es pour chacune des
composantes du PASAOP.

I.     DESCRIPTION  DU  PROGRAMME  D'APPUI AUX  SERVICES  AGRICOLES  ET  AUX
ORGANISATIONS PAYSANNES (PASAOP)
1.1 Justification
La dernibre decennie a ete caracterisee au Mali par la poursuite de la mise en ceuvre des programmes
d'ajustement structurel aux fins de creer un environnement macro-economique stable. Parallblement a ce
cadre global, le secteur rural a b6n6fici6 d'un programme de r6forme sectorielle: le Programme
d'Ajustement Sectoriel Agricole (PASA), conform6ment aux orientations du Schema Directeur de
D6veloppement Rural adopte par le Gouvernement en 1992.
L'ensemble de ces reformes preconisait, entre autres,  le desengagement de l'Etat des fonctions
productives et commerciales et son recentrage autour des fonctions perennes, la responsabilisation des
acteurs et promoteurs du d6veloppement, la decentralisation, la promotion du secteur priv6 et la
reorganisation institutionnelle du secteur rural.
A cet 6gard, le Gouvernement a restructurb successivement les operations de d6veloppement rural, la
chambre d'agriculture, la recherche agricole, l'Office du Niger et le dispositif central du ministere du
developpement rural. Aux lieu et place d'une chambre unique, il a ete cree neuf chambres regionales
d'agriculture r6unies en une assemblee permanente des chambres d'agriculture du Mali, plus
representatives de l'ensemble des professions agricoles. La restructuration de la recherche agricole a ete
bAtie autour de la necessite d'asseoir un systeme national de recherche agricole bas6 sur la demande des
producteurs ruraux et transformateurs, eux-memes organises en commissions des utilisateurs des resultats
de la recherche et encourages progressivement a participer au financement de la recherche aux c6tes de
l'Etat. La reforme des op6rations de developpement rural et de l'Office du Niger a abouti a leur retrait de
toutes les fonctions commerciales et le recentrage de leurs activites autour de celles jugees essentielles,
dont notamment le conseil rural, la maitrise d'ouvrage delegu6e et l'entretien du reseau hydraulique. Enfin
la restructuration du dispositif central du ministbre du developpement rural a vu la disparition de six
anciennes directions sectorielles et leur remplacement par trois directions plus adaptees au contexte de
decentralisation et de d6sengagement de l'Etat.
Bien que les reformes soient a ce stade tres avance, elles demeurent inachevees en raison de: (i) la non
r6alisation de certaines revues, notamment celles relatives aux operations de developpement rural
transformees en etablissements publics a caractbre administratif et des structures de projet, (ii) la necessite
d'une poursuite ordonn6e des programmes de transfert de certaines fonctions du ministere du
d6veloppement rural vers les collectivites territoriales et la societe civile, (iii) le decalage important entre les
ressources minima disponibles et les besoins optima decoulant surtout de la nouvelle culture
organisationnelle bas6e sur la performance et 1'exigence croissante de la demande des usagers des
services publics . Ces faiblesses doivent etre corrig6es, a l'effet de permettre aux services agricoles que
sont la recherche, la vulgarisation et la formation agricoles et aux organisations professionnelles agricoles
de combler les attentes de la societe du troisibme millenaire.
A cet effet, le Gouvernement et la communaut6 des Partenaires au Developpement ont identifi6 et preparb
un programme permettant non seulement de poursuivre et parachever ces reformes, mais aussi et surtout
de rationaliser davantage I'action du ministere du d6veloppement rural et de renforcer les capacit6s des
acteurs. Ce programme est intitule a Programme d'Appui aux Services Agricole et aux Organisations
Paysannes (PASAOP) >
12



1.2. Programme
Les grands axes des reformes qui sous-tendent ce programme sont inspires d'une vision a long terme
basee sur une evolution qualitative de la decentralisation et du desengagement de I'Etat, une meilleure
performance des services agricoles et une participation financiere des beneficiaires aux coots des
prestabons. II s'agira surtout de:
-  de rendre plus fonctionnelles les chambres d'agriculture et les organisations professionnelles
agricoles, en vue de leur permettre d'assumer leurs fonctons de representation et de defense
des interets de la profession agricole et de les organiser en filibre au niveau local, regional et
national afin de rendre a leurs membres les services pour lesquels elles ont et6 cr66es;
-  d'ameliorer les performances des institutions de recherche agricole, de focaliser les activites de
recherche vers la demande des utilisateurs et d'explorer les voies et moyens leur permettant de
participer au financement durable de la recherche agricole au c6te de l'Etat;
-  d'ameliorer les performances des services de vulgarisation agricole tout en partant de la
demande des producteurs ruraux et de tester dans certaines regions le transfert de la
vulgarisabon a certaines communes rurales et organisations professionnelles agricoles dans
des conditions acceptables par elles. Ce qui permettra de conforter le processus de
d6centralisation et de faire participer les beneficiaires aux activit6s et aux coots de la
vulgarisabon;
-  de mettre en ceuvre un programme de rationalisation des services du ministere du
developpement rural par un transfert mulfifonctonnel et multidimensionnel;
-  de realiser des programmes specifiques de communicaton rurale, de lutte contre le sida en
milieu rural, de formation et de restaurabon et maintien de ia fertilite des sols en vue de faire
rayonner l'image des services et actions du ministere du developpement rural, de pr6server les
couches rurales contre la pand6mie du sida, d'ameliorer les conditions de travail du personnel
et des services afin d'accroitre leur efficacite et d'augmenter la productivit6 agricole et les
revenus des ruraux.
A cet egard, le futur programme comportera quatre composantes: I'appui aux chambres d'agriculture et aux
organisations professionnelles agricoles, I'appui au systeme nabonal de recherche agricole, I'appui au
systeme de vulgarisabon agricole et cinq programmes specifiques: I'appui a la prevention et aux
interventions d'urgence contre les calamites, la communicabon rurale, , la lutte contre le sida en milieu rural
et le maintien de la fertilite des sols et des initiatves en faveur de groupes sociaux defavorises.
Le PASAOP est un programme qui inscrit son acton dans la duree. Ainsi il couvrira une periode de onze
ans r6partis en trois phases de respectivement trois, quatre et quatre ans.
1.3. R6sultats attendus
Le PASAOP est un programme de renforcement des capacites insttutionnelles de tous les acteurs du
developpement rural. Parmi les rbsultats attendus on peut citer, entre autres:
-  la producton et la productivit6 agricoles sont ameliorees avec une marge additonnelle nette,
correspondant au benefice additionnel de 1 1 milliards de FCFA seulement pour les productions
vegetales;
13



- le Systeme National de Recherche et de Vulgarisation Agricoles est renforce et restructure
pour repondre a la demande sociale des productrices et des producteurs, avec leur
participation financiere;
- les organes de gouvernance des chambres d'Agriculture et des organisabions professionnelles
agricoles sont operationnelles et transparentes pour faire de celles-ci les v6ritables
interlocuteurs du developpement rural;
- le secteur prive, les organisations professionnelles agricoles et les collectivites territoriales
affichent une reelle capacite a exercer les fonctions qui leur ont ete transfer6es par le MDR
- les services du MDR sont dotes d'une nouvelle culture organisatonnelle et renforces avec la
maltrise de nouveaux outils de simulations et d'anticipafion;
- la fertilit6 des sols est restauree et maintenue.
1.4 Organisation
A. Structures de Pilotage du PASAOP
Le PASAOP est un programme qui fait intervenir plusieurs services centraux du Departement, des acteurs
du secteur prive et de la socibt6 civile et les Partenaires au developpement. Les activites qu'il engrange
sont a la fois verticales et transversales. Pour mener a bien les objectifs du PASAOP, il est imperieux que
son ancrage institutionnel soit le plus proche des decideurs. II ne sera pas cree une direction classique du
projet. Les services du departement, chacun en ce qui le concerne, seront responsabilises a cet effet.
Toutefois, Le pilotage sera assur6 par le secretariat general du MDR. A cet effet, il existera:
Au niveau central:
Un Comite d'Orientation et de Pilotage du PASAOP, qui a pour mission d'assurer I'animation, la
coordination et le suivi de 1'ensemble des activites et de formuler les grandes orientabons dans le cadre de
la preparation et de la mise en ceuvre du PASAOP.
Le Comite peut faire appel a toute personne ressource en raison de sa competence particuliee.
Le Secretariat du Comite d'Orientation et de Pilotage est assure par le Coordinateur du PASAOP
Sous la supervision du Comite d'Orientation et de Pilotage du PASAOP, la Cellule de Coordination du
PASAOP est chargee de:
- preparer les reunions du comite;
- veiller a l'application des decisions du Comite d'Orientation et de Pilotage du projet;
-  veiller a la preparation et a l'execution des etudes generales du PASAOP;
- coordonner l'elaboration des budgets programmes annuels et assurer leur examen par le Comite
d'Orientation et de Pilotage;
- assister les structures d'execubon en matiere de passation de marches et de d6caissement
- veiller au respect des procedures de gestion et man uels d'op6rations;
- assurer la gestion des contrats d'audit du projet;
- preparer les rapports periodiques des gestions (trimestriel et annuel) du projet;
- preparer les reunions des partenaires au d6veloppement;
- elaborer le rapport d'avancement et ou d'achevement du projet.
14



La cellule de Coordination du PASAOP comprend , outre un coordinateur du projet, un Assistant au
Coordinateur et un comptable et du personnel d'appui.
Au niveau regional:
Le Comit6 d'Orientaton et de Pilotage est represent6 au niveau regional et dans le District de Bamako par
un Comit6 regional de Coordination et de Concertation du PASAOP.
Le Comite Regional de Coordination et de Concertation a pour attribution d'assurer I'animation, la
coordination et le suivi de la mise en ceuvre de 1'ensemble des activites du PASAOP dans la region et le
District de Bamako.
Le Comite Rbgional de Coordination et de Concertation est presid6 par le Haut Commissaire et sa
composition est similaire a celle du Comite d'Orientation et de Pilotage.
Le Secretariat Technique du Comite Regional est charge de preparer et de soumettre au Comite Regional
de Coordination et de Concertation les budgets et programmes des activites du PASAOP et le point de leur
execution periodique.
Au niveau du cercle : le Comite Local de Coordination et de Concertation;
Au niveau de la Commune: le Comite Communal de Coordination et de Concertation
B. Structures d'execution
Chacune des structures suivantes sera responsable de la mise en oeuvre d'une des composantes du
PASAOP. Ainsi:
-  la Cellule d'Appui aux Reformes Institutionnelles du Secteur Rural, pour la composante appui a la
rationalisation du MDR;
- la Direction Nationale de l'appui au monde rurale, pour la composante vulgarisation.
3 le CNRA pour la composante appui systeme national de recherche agricole.
*  I'APCAM, pour la composante appui aux Chambres d'Agriculture et aux organisations paysannes.
D'autres structures executeront des volets et, a ce titre, placeront leurs activit6s dans le cadre d'une
composante.
1.5 Cofts et financement
Le coOt provisoire du programme pour les 3 ans a venir est d'environ 56 milliards de F CFA, soit environ 87
millions de $US. (voir details ci-dessus).Les coOts definitifs seront arretes a l'issue de l'evaluation finale
prevue en f6vrier 2001. L'Etat y contribuera pour environ six milliards de F.CFA
11 pourra etre negocie avec les partenaires au developpement classiques du MDR . II s'agit de L'IDA, les
Pays-Bas, la France, I'USAID, l'Union Europeenne, la Cooperation allemande, la Belgique, le Canada, la
Suisse, le Luxembourg, Novartis, etc.
15



1.6 Conclusion
Deux missions de prb-evaluation de la Banque mondiale, respectvement du 31 janvier au 18 fevrier 2000
et du 12 au 19 juin 2000, et, une mission d'evaluation de l'Agence Fran,aise de Developpement, ayant
sejourne au Mali, ont toutes conclu a la necessite d'une finalisation rapide de ce programme pour insuffler
au secteur rural un nouvel elan apte a en accelerer sa croissance. Ces missions ont egalement permis de
mettre a jour l'analyse du developpement institutionnel du secteur rural, d'examiner le projet de lettre de
politique de developpement institutionnel du secteur rural et l'organisation generale du programme.
Elles ont en outre determine les elements pour lesquels la preparation doit se poursuivre afin de satisfaire
les conditions d'une 6valuation rapide du Programme. Entre autres, la mise en place du Comite
d'Orientation et de Pilotage procede de cela.

II.    ETAT INITIAL DE L'ENVIRONNEMENT DU MALI
2.1 Environnement physique
Le Mali est un vaste pays enclave qui couvre une superficie de 1.241.000 Km2, situe entre le 10e et le 256
paralleles. II est l'un des pays du Sahel les plus touches par la desertification et I'avance du d6sert.
2.1.1 Aspects geologiques
Les formations geologiques au Mali couvrent les principaux ensembles stratigraphiques de l'Afrique. Ainsi,
neuf grandes subdivisions g6ologiques y sont repr6sentees (cf. fig. 25). Elles sont les suivantes: le sol
birrimien (prbcambrien); l'infracambrien (precambrien); le cambrien; le primaire de Taoudeni; les
intrusions doleritiques; le continental interclaire; le cretace superieur/Eocene inferieur; le continental
terminal; les formations de recouvrement
Les problemes decoulant de ces donnees geologiques sont entre autres:
*  la pauvrete des sols d6rivant de la couverture greseuse pure qui sont de surcroit sablo-limoneux et
sensibles a 1'6rosion;
*  les pertes enormes de terres cultivables provoquees par le cuirassement ferrugineux;
+  les accidents gaologiques qui handicapent la navigaton fluviale (rapides de Sotuba, chutes de
Felou et de Guina, etc.)
Ces donn6es geologiques recelent aussi quelques potentialit6s qui sont entre autres:
+  les failles masquees et les couloirs lineamentaires constituant des sites preferentiels de forage. Ils
permettent aussi le rechargement des nappes acquiferes, et constituent parfois des sites
interessants pour les projets d'exploitation miniere.
+  en creant des biefs a fortes pentes, les accidents geologiques traversiers des cours d'eau
representent des sites d'implantation de barrages hydroelectriques.
2.1.2 Paysages morpho-structuraux
Le relief du Mali est en general plat et monotone. Les principaux ensembles du relief sont d'Ouest en Est,
les plateaux, les collines, les plaines et les ensembles dunaines. Les plaines et les collines s'individualisent
le long des cours d'eau. Les dep6ts de sel se trouvent parfois sur le fonds de cuvettes. Is peuvent cotoyer
les ergs.
Les massifs les plus impressionnants sont les falaises de Bandiagara et de Hombori avec 1155 m qui
constituent les plus hauts sommets du Mali. Au Nort-Est, I'Adrar des Iforas culmine a plus de 500 m.
L'Ouest est marque par le plateau Mandingue (810 m au Gangaran Kourou).

La geomorphologie du Mali pose quelques problemes aux projets de conservation des eaux qui sont entre
autres:
* I'entretien d'un processus naturel de ruissellement a cause des plateaux jouant le role d'impluvium,
les moyens-glacis a ruissellement concentre et les bas-glacis constituant le siege de ruissellement
en ravines;
*  Ia large ouverture du pays aux influences sahariennes venant du Nord a cause de la platitude du
relief;
*  Ia faible ascendance des hauteurs de reliefs au Sud sur les vents pour creer des pluies
orographiques;
+  l'instabilite des dunes dans les milieux saheliens et sahariens.
Par contre, les denivel6s sous-tendus par les pentes du relief constituent des facteurs interessants pour les
constructions de barrages hydroelectriques.
2.1.3 Contexte climatique
Le Mali est largement tributaire des conditions climatiques et plus particulibrement de la pluviometrie. Le
climat, de type continental, est caracterise par l'alternance d'une longue saison seche et d'une saison des
pluies allant de 2 mois au Nord a 5-6 mois au Sud. La pluviometrie, tres irreguliere dans 1'espace et le
temps, varie de moins de 100 mm au Nord a plus de 1 200 mm au Sud. Les moyennes thermiques
annuelles varient entre 26 et 31°. L'amplitude thermique croit avec la latitude: de 5 a 6 ° a Sikasso au Sud,
elle atteint 160 a Tessalit au Nord. Le pays est soumis a l'influence de deux vents principaux:
* un vent sec, I'alize boreal ou l'harmatan qui souffle pendant la saison seche du Nord-Est au Sud-
Ouest.
+ un vent humide et chaud, la mousson, qui souffle du Sud-Ouest au Nord-Est et qui apporte la pluie.
Du Nord au Sud, on peut distinguer 4 zones agro-climatiques qui sont les suivantes:
+ la zone saharienne avec moins de 150 mm de pluie;
+ les zones saheliennes Nord et Sud avec 200 a 800 mm de pluie;
* les zones soudaniennes Nord et Sud avec 800 a 1 200 mm de pluie;
+ Ia zone Nord Guineenne avec 1 200 a 1 400 mm de pluie.
Les problemes climatiques qui entravent l'amenagement sont, entre autres, les suivants:
* alteration des ressources en eau par le biais de l'evaporation;
* assechement des lacs;
* effondrement des agr6gats et des structures du sol dO a la variation des temperatures, facteurs
limitant pour 1'elevage et les cultures legumineuses en saison seche.
La probabilit6 de s6cheresse severe de domaine bioclimatique est enregistree sur la carte climatique ci-
jointe.

2.1.4 Systeme hydrique
Le Mali est traverse par deux grands fleuves: le Niger (4 200 km) et le Senegal (1 700 km). Leurs cours
sont coupes de rapides, de chutes et de seuils. lls drainent de grandes vallees et cuvettes qu'ils fertilisent et
qui font l'objet d'amenagement (OMVS). Les donnees caracteristiques de leur ecoulement sont
enregistrees dans le tableau ci-aprbs.

Le potentiel hydrique mobilisable est tres important, ainsi que le potentiel en eaux souterraines estim.    a
2270  milliards de m3  d'eau, dont 66 milliards renouvelables chaque annee.

2.1.5 Diversite biologique
Le Mali recele d'importantes ressources naturelles tant au point de vue floristique que faunique. Les
formations forestieres comptent 32,4 millions d'hectares, dont 3,9 millions d'hectares de parcs nationaux et
r6serves de faune; une riche biodiversite floristique et faunique (640 especes d'oiseaux, 136 espbces de
mammiferes, 80 especes de poisson), un potentiel fourrager avec un bon pouvoir de regeneration,
I'existence d'un potentiel en energie hydro6lectrique et solaire largement sous-exploite.
a. La flore
La flore du Mali presente une grande variete d'especes. II a ete denombre 1 739 especes spontanees
ligneuses reparties entre 687 genres provenant de 155 familles. Au Mali, huit especes de plantes sont
considerees commes endemiques: Maerua de waillyi, Elatine fauquei, Pteleopsis habeensis, Hibiscus
pseudohirtus, Acridocarpus monodit, Gilletiodendron glandulosum, Brachystelma medusanthemum,
Pandanus raynalii.
La vegbtation s'ordonne en fonction du zonage climatique en paysage. Elle se degrade du Sud au Nord en
fonction du gradient pluviom6trique et des actions anthropiques. Cette degradation s'accompagne d'une
extension xerophile au detriment des hygrophytes et hydrophites.
Les formations vegetales les plus vigoureuses se trouvent dans les zones Nord Guineenne et Soudanienne
ou elles forment des forets claires, des savanes boisees et des forets galeries. Celles-ci se degradent
progressivement au Nord pour donner naissance aux steppes arbustives, brousses tigr6es, fourr6es
boisees et aux formations discontinues dans l'espace. Les especes arborescentes de taille moyenne a
grande deviennent petites avec un volume brut variant de 15 a 50 m3/ha a 8 ou 25 m3/ha. Les epines et les
ocorces constituent leur d6fense contre l'evapotranspiration.
Le tapis herbace, souvent maigre, crolt rapidement avec les 1 ere pluies, surtout dans la zone saharienne ou
la vegetation se refugie sur des substrats qui jouissent d'un micro-climat favorable. Ce sont de therophytes
qui assurent tout leur cycle vbg6tatif en 1'espace de 15 jours.
Le Delta Interieur du Niger presente une grande originalite floristique. Les especes se repartissent dans
l'espace en fonction du gradient eau.
Au total, les formations v6getales du Mali produisent 525 313 700 m3 de bois pour une productivite de 22
979 505 m3/an. En la confrontant a la consommation totale qui est de 6 647 143 m3/an, il appara^it que les
besoins sont largement satisfaits. Cependant, autour de toutes les grandes villes, la coupe de bois pour les
besoins socio-economiques a cree des aureoles de desertification.
La tendance actuelle est la regression des forets et la desertification liees a la p6joration du climat et aux
actions anthropiques.
La sauvegarde des ressources naturelles necessite la mise en oeuvre d'un Plan National d'Action
Environnemental.
21



b. La faune
La faune au Mali est caracterisee par la diversite des espbces et le nombre reduit des effectifs. Elle ne
compte pas moins de 136 especes de mammiferes (UICM, 1989), dont 70 especes de grands mammiferes.
Les 42 espbces vivent dans les savanes soudanniennes occidentales et dans la zone sahelienne.
Certaines de ces especes sont actuellement en regression voire en disparition totale. C'est le cas des
espbces comme la damalisque (Damaliscus korrigum), I'eland de Derby (Taurotragus derbianus), la girafe
(Giraffa camelopardalis reticulata), la gazelle dama (Gazella dammah), l'oryx (Orys algazella), I'addax
(Addax nasomaculatus), le mouflon a manchettes (Acinonyx lervia), I'hippopotame nain (Choeropsis
liberiensis), le gu6pard (Acinonyx jubatus), le lycaon (Lycaon pictus), le lamantin (Trichechus senegalensis),
le pangolin (Manis Spp), l'orycterope (Orycteropus afer), le lion, 1'elephant, le chimpanze, etc.
On d6nombre au moins 640 especes d'oiseaux dont 15 sont consid6r6es comme rares. Les oiseaux
migrateurs pale-arctiques passent les 75 % du temps au Delta Central du Niger ou ils viennent se proteger
des rigueurs de l'hiver et s'engraisser pour affronter le voyage vers l'Europe. Ils profitent de l'alimentation
abondante et se reproduisent entre deux migrations.
Malgr6 l'absence de donnees recentes, on peut retenir que les cours d'eau du pays sont riches de prbs de
143 espbces de poissons appartenant a 67 genres et 26 families (Daget 1954).
Le cheptel, dont le dernier recensement remonte a 1992, se compose de plusieurs races et de sous-races
de bovins, d'ovins, de caprins, de camelins, d'equins, d'asins, de porcins, etc.
Le Mali est un centre important de domestication de nombreuses espbces de plantes cultivees pour
lesquelles il existe plusieurs ecotypes locaux et especes apparentees. II s'agit, entre autres, du riz, du
sorgho, du nieb6, du voandzou.
Ces ressources biologiques sont vitales pour le pays et jouent un r6le preponderant, voir exclusif, dans la
satisfaction des besoins alimentaires de la population. Elles sont indispensables a la survies des
populations (medicaments, sources de revenus, etc.). Elles ont aussi un role social, culturel, esthetique et
ethique de premier ordre. Les biens et services vitaux qu'assurent ces ressources dependent de la variete
et de la variabilite de leurs elements constitutfs: gbnes, especes, peuplement et ecosystbmes.
Malheureusement, ce patrimoine riche et varie est menac6 de disparition a cause essentiellement de
l'homme (defrichement, surpaturage, braconnage, peche illicite, feux de brousse, lutte chimique anti-
parasitaire et anti-aviaire - utilisation des pestcides - et par les aleas climatiques - deficits pluviometriques
notamment -). Cette situation est exacerbee par la faiblesse de la sensibilisation a la protection de
l'environnement des populations et l'accroissement demographique. Parmi les obstacles qui freinent la
preservation des ressources biologiques, figurent les conflits fonciers, I'insecurite foncibre, l'insuffisance
des moyens de l'Etat pour assurer la surveillance et la geston appropriees des ressources, I'accroissement
des besoins en ressources naturelles des populations, etc.

* Problemes lies a la diversite biologique
Pour assurer une bonne conservation de la diversit6 biologique, il est indispensable d'avoir une bonne
comprehension des facteurs responsables de la degradation de cette diversite. C'est par la maitrise de ces
facteurs que l'on assurera la conservaton et la perennite des ressources biologiques.
L'extincton de certaines espbces ainsi que la perte de souches g6n6tiques et des types d'ecosystbmes
compromettent les opportunites d'un developpement durable. Cette situation est le resultat d'un ensemble
de facteurs complexes, dont les principaux sont d'ordre climatque, notamment les secheresses r6currentes
et d'ordre anthropique : le defrichement, 1'exploitation du bois comme source d'energie, les feux de brousse,
le surpaturage, le braconnage, la surpeche et la mauvaise utlisation des produits chimiques, ect.
2.1.6 Ressources en sols
Au Mali, en fonction des zones bioclimatiques, on distingue des sols ferralitiques, des sols ferrugineux
tropicaux lessives, des sols fersialitques, des sols subarides et des sols desertiques appeles sols zonaux.
23



A l'interieur de ceux-ci, se sont developpes, a la faveur des conditions stationnelles, des sols azonaux
comme: les sols hydromorphes, les vertisols ou d'argiles noires tropicaux, les sols peu sales et les sols
sales ou halomorphes.
Le Mali compte environ 30 millions d'hectares de terres arables (soi 23,8 % du territoire), dont 11,4 millions
d'hectares de terres sous cultures et jacheres sur lesquels 3 a 3,5 millions d'hectares sont cultives chaque
annee et un potentiel d'un million d'hectares irrigables. Cependant, les differents sols presentent plusieurs
contraintes importantes du point de vue agronomique qui, ajoutees aux fortes limitations climatiques,
limitent le potentiel agro-sylvo-pastoral: niveau de fertilit6 moyen a faible, avec carences en phosphore,
potassium et soufre, forte sensibilit6 a l'6rosion 6olienne (plus marqu6e vers le Nord) eVou hydrique.
Par rapport a l'am6nagement, les problemes des sols sont entre autres:
*  un transfert des mat6riaux pedologiques des plateaux vers les basses plaines et les talwegs par le jeu
du ruissellement du Sud du Mali;
+  un appauvrissement des sols a sexquioxydes (sols ferralitiques, ferrugineux tropicaux lessivbs,
fersiallitiques). On peut restaurer leur fertilite en pratiquant:
-  du compostage a base de residus de culture;
-  des amendements organiques deja humidifies du type compost;
-  du mulching.
Ces types de sols conviennent a l'arboriculture associee a l'elevage et aux cultures pures.
*  L'instabilite structurale de tous les types de sol qui leur confere une grande sensibilite  la battance des
pluies, au splash et a l'erosion.
Les cartes ci-jointes presentent le patrimoine pedologique riche et varie ainsi que les risques de
degradation des sols.
24



2.1.7 Zones homogenes
Ce sont des zones qui representent une certaine unite de potentialite. Au total, 32 zones homogenes ont
ete identifiees par la Direction Nationale de la Planification (DNP). Elles sont resumees sur la carte ci-jointe.
2.2 Systemes de production
Un systeme de production est ia maniere articulee selon laquelle l'exploitant combine les productions et les
facteurs de production dont il dispose pour atteindre des objectifs qui lui sont propres.
Les systemes de production se r6partissent entre les zones agro-6cologiques comme suit:
2.2.1 Zone Nord-Guineenne
Les systemes de production dominants sont essentiellement:
-  I'agriculture c6realibre;
- une tres importante agriculture de rente (coton);
-  le maraichage et la production de tubercule;
-  I'elevage sedentaire traditionnel des races de b6tail trypanotolerantes.
Les principales contraintes de ses systemes ont pour noms la rarete des paturages et la pollution des sols
par les intrants agricoles.
2.2.2 Zones soudaniennes (Nord et Sud)
Les systemes de production sont surtout caracterises par:
-  une agriculture vivriere (mil sur sol sablonneux, sorgho, fonio, niebe en association avec le mil ou le
sorgho, sesame sur petites superficies, maYs, woandzou);
- une agriculture de rente (coton, arachide);
-  une agriculture maraich6re;
- un 6levage a vocation sedentaire (bovins, petits ruminants);
-  une transhumance du sud au nord;
- une agroforesterie selective (karite, nere, tamarinier, balanzan, baobab, r6nier, etc.);
-  un sylvo-pastoralisme;
-  des systemes a base de sorgho et de mil;
-  des systemes a base de sorgho;
-  des systemes a base d'association mil-sorgho;
-  une culture de coton (pas comme culture de rente), de dah, de henne, de pasteque et de niebe;
Les principales contraintes sont:
- l'insuffisance de l'integration agro-sylvo-pastorale;
-  I'absence de r6gime foncier favorable;
-  des problemes de debouches;
- des lenteurs dans l'adoption des innovations techniques;
- la d6gradation progressive de la veg6tation;
-  le manque d'eau;
- la r6duction des jacheres et de leur duree;
25



- 1'epuisement des sols a vocation agricole;
- la destruction des ressources naturelles par l'extension des superficies agricoles et le surpaturage;
- le faible niveau de technicite des populations et la faible productivite des cultures;
- la reduction des surfaces inondees cutivables;
-  I'insuffisance de I'humidit6 du sol;
- le manque de main d'ceuvre pour les travaux culturaux;
- la pollution des sols par les intrants agrcoles (cf. annexe);
-  la pauvre qualite des sols et erosion des terres;
- des contraintes de fertilite et des intrants de fertilisation;
- la faiblesse des sources de credit.
2.2.3 Zones saheliennes (nord et sud)
Les systbmes de production pr6dominants sont:
- 1'elevage (petits ruminants, bovins);
- le nomadisme;
- la transhumance;
-  une agriculture pluviale jusqu'a 350 a 400 mm, au dela de cette limite, I'agriculture n'est possible
qu'avec un supplement d'eau: irrigaton, inondation, decrue, etc.;
- des cultures intensives de mil, niebe, arachide, fonio, woandzou;
- des cultures maraich6res;
- un systeme agro-pastoral (mil, sorgho, arachide, coton et riz/elevage) dans la zone des luvisols;
- I'exploitation de bois (bois de chauffe).
Les principales contraintes sont:
-  la secheresse;
- 1'erosion eolienne;
- I'appauvrissement des sols a paturage;
- I'epuisement des sols a vocation agricole;
- Ia destruction des ressources naturelles par l'extension des superficies agricoles et le paturage;
- le faible niveau de technicit6 des producteurs et de productivite des cultures;
- la reduction des surfaces inondees cultivables.
2.2.4 Zone saharienne
On distingue les systemes de production suivants
- le pastoralisme pur (transhumance avec le delta pour centre);
- l'inexistence d'agriculture pluviale, mais possibilite d'am6nagement hydroagricole a proximite des
eaux de surface;
- une agriculture de cereales de decrue (sorgho et autres);
- la culture du b16 et du riz au niveau des petits perimetres irrigu6s;
- le maraichage.
Les contraintes liees aux systemes de production sont:
- les dunes qui etaient fixes sont devenues mobiles par un double processus lie a la secheresse et
a la degradation du milieu par les animaux. La d6sertification et la desertisation sont les deux
phenomenes observes. Ils entrainent 1'extension du desert vers le sud
26



-  la cohabitation des agriculteurs avec les eleveurs entrainant d'une part des conflits entre hommes,
et d'autre part une competition entre hommes et animaux au niveau des mares.
En conclusion, I'analyse des systbmes de production et leur interaction avec les ressources naturelles
montre dans la plupart des cas que les systbmes de production actuels sont en inadequation avec une
conservation du potentel de production. Les differentes etudes, dont le MDRE (1998), ont montre que la
baisse de fertilite est generalis6e et se manifeste par la stagnaffon/baisse des rendements, I'augmentation
des superficies cultivees avec defrichement des terres marginales eVou des zones a vocation forestibre. Le
niveau des engrais et intrants est g6neralement faible sauf dans la zone de l'Office du Niger et de la
CMDT; la culture attel6e, lorsque pratiqu6e, a encourage la dispariffon des arbres des systbmes agraires et
conduit dans de nombreuses zones a une aggravation de 1'erosion 6olienne eVou hydrique.
11 faut rappeler que les rares terres arables ne representent que 23,8 % de la superficie total du pays et
qu'elles sont soumises a de serieuses limitations agro-pbdologiques (pauvrete naturelle en matiere
organique et elements mineraux de la majoritb des sols) et climatfques.
D'une manibre generale, les productivites agricoles et animales sont faibles. La conjonction de la pression
demographique et animale sur un espace restreint a conduit en de nombreux endroits a une rupture de
l'equilibre entre utilisation et conservation des ressources naturelles.
2.3 Les problemes environnementaux
Le Mali recele un potentiel naturel riche et varie, mais in6galement reparti et a I'heure actuelle, fortement
menace par divers facteurs.
L'augmentation sensible de la population, conjuguee a la persistance des conditions climatiques
defavorables et a des systbmes d'exploitation pour la plupart extensifs, inadaptes et aux productivitbs tres
faibles, est un facteur important de la degradation des ressources naturelles et de 1'environnement, qui
participe activement au processus de desertification. En effet, la forte pression demographique et animale
souvent sur un espace restreint, va de pair avec un accroissement des besoins notamment en produits
agricoles, d'elevage, produits ligneux et en equipements/infrastructures indispensables. Cette situation a
conduit en de nombreux endroits a une rupture de l'6quilibre entre les utilisations pour la satisfaction des
besoins des hommes et la conservation des ressources de l'environnement et du potentiel du milieu
naturel.
Le processus de degradation des ressources naturelles se marque entre autres par une perte de fertilite
des terres de culture (diminution des jachbres, erosion 6olienne eVou hydrique), une diminution des
paturages naturels (reduction de la duree de la transhumance et concentrafion importante autour des points
d'eau, concurrence croissance entre agriculture et elevage particulibrement dans les zones inondees et
vers le Sud), forte pression sur les ressources forestibres, avec d6frichements agricoles, surpaturage,
prelbvements importants pour le bois-energie, principale source d'energie domestique, feux de brousse,
etc. Cette pression, conjuguee aux facteurs climatiques, contribue a la rarefaction des ressources sylvo-
pastorales, avec la disparition de 100 000 hectares de forets chaque annee, la destruction des
ecosystbmes et habitats naturels, une perte importante de la biodiversite et a la progression du ph6nombne
de desertification.
27



Toutefois, la degradation n'est pas uniforme sur l'ensemble du territoire. Au Nord (zone sahelienne et sub-
saharienne), on observe une progression alarmante du processus de desertification sur une vaste etendue
peu peuplee, avec un risque majeur d'ensablement des vallees et des mares.
Au Sud et plus particulierement autour des centres urbains, la pression sur les ressources encore
disponibles s'accentue de maniere inquietante en de nombreux endroits, alors que ce sont celles-ci qui
permeftent de satisfaire a l'heure actuelle globalement les besoins alimentaires et energetiques.
Parallelement a ce processus de degradation, les ressources de l'environnement sont egalement soumises
a un risque accru de pollution et nuisance diverses. Celles-ci, qui, en l'absence d'une reglementation
appropriee et de structures chargees du contr6le, devraient s'accentuer rapidement, sont dues a des
causes multiples, comme 1'exploitation des mines d'or, I'industre ou I'artisanat ou encore l'insuffisance en
matiere d'infrastructures et equipements d'assainissement. Ces sources de polluton de l'air, des eaux et
des sols touchent plus particulierement les zones de fortes concentration humaine, alors qu'en milieu rural,
les risques apparaissent moindres, sauf dans les zones de production plus intensives comme l'Office du
Niger ou la zone CMDT en raison d'une utilisation croissante d'engrais et de pesticides.
D'une maniere g6n6rale, 1'ensemble de ces facteurs a conduit a une deterioration progressive de la qualite
et du cadre de vie des populations, que l'on soit en milieu urbain ou rural. Dans les conditions de forte
croissance demographique, de pauvret6, de faible pouvoir d'achat des population et en l'absence de
mesures adequates, cette tendance devrait continuer a s'accentuer dans les annees a venir, avec des
consequences negatives sur la sant6 et le bien-etre des populations.
L'enjeu a terme consiste a restaurer/conserver les ressources naturelles (sols, eaux, vegetation, faune
terrestre et aquatique) et a les g6rer de fagon a satisfaire les besoins multiples et croissants de la
population, notamment les besoins alimentaires, de sant6 et d'education, tout en ameliorant le cadre de vie
de l'ensemble des citoyens.
2.4 Defis environnementaux
Pour assurer les conditions d'un developpement 6conomique et social durable, le Mali doit relever les d6fits
suivants:
* Assurer une meilleures adequation entre populations et ressources naturelles a travers un
amenagement rationnel du territoire national et une gestion durable des ressources naturelles;
+  Ameliorer le cadre de vie de populations rurales et urbaines en les dotant d'un minimum
d'infrastructures d'assainissement et en luttant contre les diverses pollutions, en particulier celles qui
affectent les ressources en eaux;
* Impulser un changement de mentalite et de comportement et assurer une participation efficiente des
populations et des divers acteurs concernes dans l'elaboration et la mise en oeuvre des programmes
d'action en matiere de protection/gestion de l'environnement;
+  Valoriser et mobiliser l'important potentiel de ressources en eaux et en 6nergies nouvelles et
renouvelables pour les mettre a la disposition des populations;
28



+  Soutenir la recherche sur la desertification et la protection de 1'environnement afin qu'elle developpe
des techniques et technologie appropriees dans les differents domaines;
+  Mettre en place un systeme performant de gestion des information et de donnees sur l'etat des
ressources de l'environnement et leur evolution;
+ Mettre en place un cadre institutionnel et legislatif approprie pour la coordination et le controle des
atteintes a la qualite de 1'environnement, y compris edicter un code de l'environnement;
+  Mobiliser les ressources financieres n6cessaires au financement des programmes d'action aux niveaux
national et regional,
2.5 Aspects socio-demographiques, economiques et culturels
Avec une population d'environ 10 millions d'habitants, le Mali a une densite moyenne de 7 habitants au
km2. Cette population comporte 51 % de femmes et 49 % d'hommes. Elle est tres jeune, avec 54 % de
moins de 20 ans. Son taux de natalite est de 50 pour mille et celui de mortalite, 13 pour mille. Ce qui
correspond a un taux d'accroissement naturel de 3,7 %. Le Mali connait, comme les autres pays en voie de
d6veloppement, une croissance d6mographique rapide.
II est class6 par les Nations-Unies comme appartenant aux pays les moins avanc6s (PMA) et par la Banque
Mondiale dans la categorie des pays a faible revenu et semi-aride.
Les problemes de 1'emploi et de la subsistance d'une population rapidement en pleine croissance se posent
de facon aigue dans un environnement defavorable dO a une secheresse persistance. La population
urbaine atteint actuellement 20%. L'agriculture et 1'6levage occupent environ 80% de la population active.
La position enclavee du Mali entre les pays du Maghreb et ceux de la foret explique l'importance des
courants commerciaux, I'attraction exercee par les activit6s de commerce ainsi que les coOts elev6s du
transport des marchandises.
Le Mali est egalement confront6 a l'analphabetisme qui touche environ 80% de la population.
L'ampleur et la nature des problemes de sante de la population se caracterise entre autres par:
-  une mortalite infantile encore elevee (102 pour mille en 1987) malgre les tendance a la baisse
depuis 1960;
-  une mortalite maternelle tres elevee, environ 20 a 25 % des deces des femmes sont lies a
I'accouchement et a la grossesse;
-  des soins de sante accessibles seulement pour 15 a 20% de la population. Le reste devant
compter sur des visites sporadiques des equipes mobiles de sante et sur la m6decine
traditionnelle;
-  un taux d'accroissement naturel eleve (3,7 %) rendant de plus en plus difficile l'extension des
services de sante a une plus grande proportion de la population.
Le personnel et les infrastructures sanitaires actuellement disponibles ne seront pas en mesure de faire
face aux nombreux besoins de sante de la population. La population vulnerable compos6e des enfants
29



ages de moins de 5 ans et des femmes en age de procreer connaitra une augmentation sensible de ses
effectifs.
Sur le plan macro-economique, la structure du Produit Interieur Brut (PIB) consacre la part prbponderante
au secteur primaire (plus de 42 % en 1992). Le PIB par tete d'habitant est tres faible. II est en moyenne de
55.000 FCFA, soit 221 $ US (au taux du dollar de 1990). La part consacree a la consommation est tres
forte (plus de 95%). Ce qui signifie que la possibilite d'une epargne interne est tres reduite. II est donc tres
difficile de degager une epargne a partir d'un niveau de revenu aussi bas. A cela, il faut ajouter que
l'bconomie malienne est peu monetaris6e et l'auto-consommation qui represente une part preponderante
du PIB, 6chappe totalement ou presque aux mecanismes monetaires.
En resumb, on peut retenir que l'evolution recente de l'economie du pays (1981-1991) se caracterise par un
taux de croissance du PIB inf6rieur a celui de la population (maximum 3,6% contre 3,7%).
Le taux moyen de croissance de la consommation annuelle a 6te de 2,6% de 1981 a 1991 entrainant une
epargne negative.
Le service de la dette represente plus de 4,8% du PIB. Le service courant de la dette atteint en 1992 un
taux de 57,5% depassant ainsi le seuil des 35% qui caracterise les pays en difficult6s de financement.
2.6 Aspects politico-institutionnels
Politiques de developpement
La politique de developpement economique, social et de gestion de l'environnement vise le but gen6ral
d'elever le niveau de vie de la population malienne en pr6servant son cadre de vie.
La forte dependance de l'economie nationale du secteur rural impose une osmose entre le milieu rural et le
milieu urbain, ce dernier devant connaitre un developpement qui genere une extension des debouches pour
les produits du secteur rural. En meme temps, les produits et les services non agricoles de la ville doivent
ameliorer les conditions de vie et la productivit6 de la campagne.
Pour asseoir une 6conomie dont la vulnerabilite aux facteurs exterieurs et climatiques est r6duite au
minimum et dont la croissance repose principalement sur I'augmentation de I'accumulation interne de
surplus et plus particulierement sur les facteurs endogenes de production en particulier, et l'elargissement
de la demande interieure, il est necessaire de mettre en place un systeme ayant les objectifs suivants:
+ accroitre la production et la productivite, etendre et diversifier la production du secteur rural et
d6velopper en particulier les branches d'activites en amont et en aval de l'agriculture, de l'elevage,
de la peche et de la sylviculture telle que la fourniture des intrants, les transports, le stockage, la
commercialisation, 1'encadrement technique, en 6largissant le marche de l'emploi et en
garantissant aux producteurs des prix rbmunerateurs.
+ ameliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles par la mise en ceuvre du Programme Rationnelle de
Gestion des Ressources Naturelles, c'est-a-dire par une responsabilsation directe des collectivites
locales et des producteurs dans les actions de gestion des ressources, d'amenagement du
30



territoire, de lutte contre la s6cheresse et la desertification, de maitrise de 1'eau et de maintien de la
fertilit6 des sols;
promouvoir les ressources humaines a travers une politique de populaton, la prise en compte des
migrations internes et externes, I'amelioration de 1'etat de sante de Ia population, le developpement
de 1'education de base, de la formation professionnelle, de la formation des adultes
(alphabetisation), la resolution des problemes d'emploi, notamment de celui des jeunes dipl6mes,
de l'int6gration de la femme dans le processus de d6veloppement, la prise en compte de la
dimension socioculturelle du developpement.
31



III. LEGISLATION ENVIRONNEMENTALE AU MALI
Au Mali, une legislation relativement importante a ete adopt6e dans le domaine de l'environnement et de la
protection du cadre de vie.
Le Mali a connu trois generations de textes traitant l'environnement. Les premieres legislations remontent a
la 16re decennie de l'indbpendance (de 1960 a 1970). Les textes de la premiere legislation etaient orientes
essentiellement vers la protection par l'interdiction des ressources naturelles. Ils avaient un caractere
prohibitif et repressif.
Trois principales lois ont 6t6 adoptbes:
-  Loi No 63-7/AN-RM du 11 janvier 1963 sur la peche;
- Loi N° 98-8/AN-RM du 27 fevrier 1968 portant code forestier;
- Loi portant protection de la faune et de son habitat (code de chasse).
La deuxieme generation (1970-1980) de textes edictes dans le contexte d'une grande secheresse a eu
pour orientation le renforcement de la protection par le durcissement des peines. Une operation de
relecture des legislations a 6t6 effectuee aboutissant a l'adoption d'une serie de lois sur les codes de
peche, de la foret, de la chasse et du feu. En plus d'une loi obligatoire d'utilisation des foyers ameliores,
une autre a ete adopt6e pour fixer le taux d'une taxe de defrichement.
La troisieme generation de textes, celle en vigueur et adoptee en 1995, met l'accent sur les notions de
gestion, d'am6nagement et de participation des populations avec un accent moindre sur l'aspect repressif.
Cette generation a ete marquee par l'adoption de quatre lois:
- Loi 95-003 du 18 janvier 1995 portant organisation de l'exploitation du bois et du commerce de
bois;
- Loi 95-04/AN-RM du 18 janvier 1995 fixant les conditions de gestion des ressources forestieres;
- Loi 95-031/AN-RM du 25 mars 1995 fixant les conditions de gestion de la faune sauvage et son
habitant;
- Loi 95-032/AN-RM du 20 mars 1995 fixant les conditions de gestion de la peche et de la
pisciculture.
Les principaux textes l6gislatifs qui nous ont inspires dans le cadre de cette etude sont:
-  la Constitution du Mali (Preambule, articles 15 et 99);
- le Decret No 99-189/PRM du 5 juillet 1999 portant institution de la procedure d'etude d'impact sur
l'environnement (Annexe 1);
- Le Decret No 96-133/P-RM du 22 avril 1996 portant protection de l'environnement a l'occasion des
grands travaux (Annexe 2);
- La Loi N0 92 - 013/AN-RM du 17 septembre 1992 portant institution d'un systeme de normalisation
et de controle de qualite (Annexe 3);
32



- Le Decret No 98 - 293/P-RM du 8 septembre 1998 fixant l'organisaton et les modalites de
fonctionnement de la DNACPN (Annexe 4);
La Loi N° 85 - 61/AN-RM du 2 septembre 1989 portant repression et l'importation du transit des
dechets toxiques (Annexe 5);
- les conventions internationales signees et ratfiees par le Mali:
* convention des Nations-Unies sur la desertification
* biodiversite
* changement climatique;
* reglementation sur l'homologation des pestcides commune aux Etats membres du CILSS
(Annexe 6).
Malgre que le Mali ait adopte plusieurs textes legislatifs des differents secteurs lies directement ou
indirectement a la protection de 1'environnement on note une insuffisance dans leur application.
L'adopfion d'une loi generale sur l'environnement (ex code de l'environnement) pourrait servir de cadre de
reference   pour  1'ensemble  des  secteurs.  En   plus,  une  campagne   d'information   et
d'education/communicaton environnementale doit servir de support a la loi sur la qualite de
1'environnement car les textes legislatifs dans l'ensemble sont m6connus du grand public et des utilisateurs.
33



IV. ANALYSE D'IMPACT ENVIRONNEMENTAL
L'analyse d'impact consiste a identifier les activites du PASAOP susceptibles de provoquer des
changements soit positifs ou negatifs sur 1'environnement (physique, biologique, social et leurs
interactons). Le PASAOP etant un programme de renforcement des capacit6s institutionnelles du MDR et
des competences environnementales de son personnel pour un developpement durable et soutenable, ses
impacts directs sur 1'environnement physique sont tres limites ou presque inexistants. La mise en ceuvre du
programme telle que d6finie a travers ses principaux objectifs, aura plus d'impacts positifs que negatifs sur
1'environnement. Afin de nous faciliter cette analyse, nous avons juge de faire un rappel des grandes lignes
d'interventions du PASAOP, avant d'analyser comment le programme pourra attenuer les problemes
environnementaux qui ont 6t6 regroup6s en cinq grandes categories.
4.1 Rappel des grandes lignes d'intervention du PASAOP
Le PASAOP aidera a:
f.  appuyer le Ministere du D6veloppement Rural dans la mise en oeuvre des r6formes
institutionnelles prevues dans le cadre de la Lettre de Politique de Developpement Institutionnel du
Secteur Rural, en particulier en ce qui concerne le recentrage et la rationalisation de ses services
en distinguant: (i) les activites dites "r6galiennes" concernant les strategies et politiques de
developpement du secteur rural (et de leur financement ), la reglementation et le controle, le suivi
et evaluation des programmes et projets; (ii) des activites pouvant 6tre transf6r6es au secteur prive
(production etlou commercialisation) ou a des entites autonomes contractualisees par l'Etat ou les
producteurs eux-memes;
g. dans le cadre du processus de decentralisation initie par le Gouvernement du Mali, accompagner la
deconcentration des services du MDR au niveau regional et local;
h. appuyer le Systeme National de Recherche Agricole de fagon 6: (i) s6parer la planification et
financement des programmes de recherche de leur execution; (ii) mieux repondre aux demandes
des producteurs, et; (iii) mettre en place des mecanismes de financement durable;
i. appuyer le Systeme National de Vulgarisation Agricole et l'orienter vers un regionalisation des
programmes et budgets, et une meilleure prise en compte de la demande des producteurs en
matiere de conseils agricoles, par une contractualisation progressive des services avec le secteur
prive eVou des structures autonomes de conseil agricole;
j.  renforcer la capacite des producteurs a travers leurs repr6sentations locales, regionales et
nationales pour acceder a un systeme de financement a la demande en matiere de formation, et de
conseils techniques, organisationnels ou de gestion
34



4.2 Principaux Problemes Environnementaux et Sociaux identifies ou possibles dans le cadre du
PASAOP.
Le travail entrepris a ete realise a partir de:
3. I'analyse des resultats d'enquete de terrain aupres des services techniques sp6cialis6s et des
populations concernees;
4. I'analyse detaillee des activites prevues dans le cadre des differentes composantes du PASAOP
telles decrites dans les rapports de preparation
11 est important de noter que le PASAOP est essentiellement un programme de renforcement des capacites
en matiere de services d'appui a I'agriculture en gen6ral, et non un programme d'investissement pouvant
faire appel a des amenagements, constructions importantes, ou achats de produits chimiques. L'analyse a
utilise comme cadre de travail la Directive Operationnelle 4.01 (Fevrier 1999) et en particulier les politiques
de sauvegarde en ce qui concerne l'evaluation environnementale, la gestion des biocides, la foret, les
peuples indigenes, et les habitats naturels.
Aspects Environnementaux.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative a l'Evaluation Environnementale. L'impact potentiel du PASAOP sur
la gestion durable des ressources naturelles n'est pas incompatible avec l'amelioration efficace de la
croissance agricole. En effet, la strategie preconisee par le PASAOP est que le potentiel de croissance du
secteur agricole au Mali se trouve dans des zones relativement limitees a haut et moyen potentiel, et que
plus ce potentiel est valorise, moins la pression est forte pour etendre les superficies cultivbes de fa,on
intensive aux zones plus fragiles.  L'extension des exploitations aux zones arides devra etre
scrupuleusement contr6l6e, et de plus, l'intensification de l'agriculture dans les zones a haut et moyen
potentiel devra etre associee a des pratiques d'utilisation des sols appropriees. L'erosion et la degradation
des sols posent deja des problemes s6rieux and la sauvegarde des ressources naturelles doit etre une
priorite de la strategie de d6veloppement rural. Bien que l'utilisation d'engrais chimiques et de biocides va
permettre une amelioration de la productivit6 des exploitations et de la production agricole, il importe que
les services d'appui aux producteurs, a travers en particulier la recherche et les conseils agricoles, puissent
y associer et promouvoir rapidement une approche integree plus "agro-kcologique", comme par exemple
des techniques de conservation des eaux et des sols, 1'emploi de couvert vegetatif, la fertilisation organique,
et une gestion integree des predateurs.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative aux Habitats Naturels.   Dans le cadre du PASAOP, aucune activite
de defrichage de terres eVou de changement de veg6tation naturelle n'est envisagee. Au contraire, comme
indique plus haut, les activites du projet resulteront en une meilleure gestion des ressources existantes et
une diminution de la pression pour 6tendre les superficies cultivees de facon intensive dans des zones plus
fragiles. A cet egard, le PASAOP est tout a fait en conformit6 avec la politique de sauvegarde concernant
les habitats naturels sans autre mesure particuliere.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative a la Foret. Dans le cadre du PASAOP, aucune activit6 relative a la
foret n'est envisagee. A cet egard, le PASAOP est tout a fait en conformite avec la politique de sauvegarde
concernant la foret sans autre mesure particuliere.
35



Politique de Sauvegarde relative a la Gestion des Maladies et Predateurs. Bien que, dans le cadre du
PASAOP il ne soit pas envisag6 d'acheter des pesticides (biocides), l'intensification de I'agriculture pourrait
amener a faire appel a un usage plus important de pesticides (et d'engrais chimiques). Cependant,
l'objectf global du projet etant d'ameliorer les revenus des producteurs, les methodes de gestion ameliorne
des exploitations ainsi que les nouvelles techniques appropri6es cherchant a diminuer les coOts de
production permettront une meilleure gestion et efficacite des intrants chimiques et en definitive auront
globalement comme cons6quence une diminution des intrants inorganiques. Le PASAOP a cet egard a
inclus a travers ses differentes composantes des actions visant a une meilleure gestion des maladies et
predateurs (revision du cadre macro-economique, legislatif et fiscal de l'importation et la distribution des
biocides, appui a la r6glementation et contr6le de la gestion des produits, programmes specifiques de
recherche, de formation et de conseils, etc.). Compte tenu de la n6cessite d'avoir un pilotage et un suivi
"transversal" de ces activites, le PASAOP a prevu la mise en place d'une "Initiative Speciale pour la
Promotion de la Lutte Integree", permettant a une equipe de techniciens specialises au sein de ia DNAMR
de veiller a ce que tous ces aspects soient effectivement et correctement pris en compte. Par ailleurs, le
PASAOP a inscrit un financement specifique pour aider le Gouvernement du Mali a eliminer des stocks de
pesticides obsoletes et a traiter les zones contaminees.
Gestion de la Fertilite des Sols. 11 est a noter 6galement que le PASAOP a travers ses composantes a
egalement prevu une "Initiative Speciale pour la Fertilite des Sols" qui, comme pour la lutte intbgree, doit
intervenir de fagon "horizontale" a travers les differentes composantes sous le pilotage et le suivi particulier
d'une equipe specialisee au sein de la DNAMR.]
Gestion des Espaces Pastoraux. L'elevage transhumant au Mali joue un role economique tres important
compte tenu aussi de sa place dans le produit brut agricole qu'en ce qui concerne les revenus des
producteurs. Les espaces pastoraux ont e  fragilises par les grandes secheresses, et on a assiste dans
beaucoup de zones a une degradation des ressources pastorales. A cet effet, dans le cadre du PASAOP,
en particulier de la composante d'appui au conseil agricole, il a 6t6 prevu de soutenir un programme
regional pilote pastoral qui vise a promouvoir une approche participative pour une gestion durable des
espaces pastoraux.
Aspects Sociaux.
Un des objectifs du PASAOP est de renforcer la capacite des producteurs a exprimer leurs besoin en
matiere de services d'appui et a participer de fa,on efficace a la pr6paration des programmes et des
budgets correspondants a travers leurs modes de representation au niveau local, regional et national. Les
reformes des systemes nationaux de recherche et de conseil agricole ont 6t6 congues pour leur adaptation
progressive a une approche participative et contractualisee avec des entites publiques plus autonomes
eVou priv6es.  La question est de savoir si les programmes de generation et de transfert de technologies
developpees grace au PASAOP aura un impact equitable entre les differents groupes de producteurs eVou
couches sociales, en un mot est-ce que les besoins groupes d6favorises eVou vulnerables pourront etre
prise en compte de fagon efficace par le PASAOP. 11 existe au Mali bon nombre d'organisations de
producteurs organises autour d'une filiere ou d'un systeme d'irrigation, d'associations ou groupements
communautaires ou villageois.   Bien 6videmment la capacite technique et organisationnelle de ces
organisations de producteurs et groupes sociaux est trbs variable au Mali. Certains sont deja suffisamment
bien organises et formes pour avoir accbs a l'information et aux services d'appui prevus dans le cadre du
projet. Pour les autres, un programme d'information, de sensibilisation et de formation permettra de
36



renforcer leur capacite et s'assurer que les groupes plus defavorises ne seront pas exclus dans
l'elaboration des programmes d'appui et dans leur execution.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative aux Populations Indigenes. Les groupes sociaux au Mali sont tres
variables en taille de populaton, organisation sociale inteme, and influence sociale. Cependant, aucun
groupe ethnique ne peut etre considere comme "indigene" selon la definition de la politique de sauvegarde
4.09 de la Banque Mondiale. Les activites du PASAOP vont etre realisees sur l'ensemble du territoire,
entre autre dans des regions peuplees de groupes ethniques minoritaires, comme par exemple certains
eleveurs transhumants et pecheurs traditionnels semi-nomades. Ces groupes vont beneficier du projet non
pas parce qu'ils sont "indigenes", mais parce qu'ils font partie des producteurs dont les besoins specifiques
ont ete identifies et pour lesquels des actions sont prevues dans le projet. Ces groupes, pour differentes
raisons, n'ont souvent pas re,u auparavant une attention suffisante et des appuis specifiques de la part des
services publics eVou des ONGs.   A cet egard ils peuvent etre consid6res comme des "groupes
vulnerables". Durant la preparation du PASAOP, des possibilites d'interventions specifiques ont ete
identifiees pour ces groupes vulnerables qui comprennent entre autre certaines minorites ethniques ou
sociales (comme les pecheurs Bozos semi-nomades dans la zone de Mopti), et les femmes (la dimension
'genre" est abordee plus bas). Une "Initiative Speciale Groupes Vulnerables" a ete definie et il est prevu de
recruter un(e) specialiste en la matiere pour piloter et suivre de maniere tres active ces actions pour que les
specificites de ces groupes soient effectivement prises en compte.
Politique de Sauvegarde relative a la Dimension Genre dans le D6veloppement Rural.  Comme
mentionne plus haut, grace a l'approche participative et au processus de decentralisation qui guident les
reformes envisagees dans le cadre du PASAOP, les aspects sociaux ont ete largement pris en compte des
la conception meme du projet. Une 6tude specifique sur la dimension genre a ete entreprise pendant la
preparation du projet et a identifie la difficulte des femmes a avoir acces aux conseils agricoles. Des efforts
insuffisants ont ete faits jusqu'a present pour ameliorer la pertinence, la qualite et la diffusion des
recommandations techniques relatives a la production fruitiere, au maraichage, et au petit elevage, qui sont
dans une large mesure des activit6s specifiquement reservees aux femmes. La peche et en particulier la
commercialisation des produits de la peche (qui est une activite generalement reservee aux femmes) ont
egalement et identifiees comme 6tant des possibilites pour diminuer la pauvrete aussi bien en termes de
revenus que de nutrition. Tous ces aspects ont ete pris en compte dans le cadre du projet et il sera de la
responsabilite de l'6quipe chargee de l'lnitiative Speciale pour les Groupes Vulnerables de s'assurer que
des actions pertinentes (voir le tableau d'actions prevues) sont effectivement realisees pour chacune des
composantes du PASAOP.

Le tableau ci-dessus porte sur le plan d'attenuation des problemes environnementaux. 11 precise les
principaux problemes environnementaux, les mesures prevues pour leur resolution ainsi que les institutions
charg6es de la mise en ceuvre. Compte tenu du fait que toutes les mesures indiquees ont deja et6
chiffrees et prises en compte a travers les composantes du PASAOP dans le cadre de son financement, il
n'a pas semble utile de pr6voir une evaluation specifique des actons indiquees.



VI. PLAN DE SUIVI-EVALUATION DES IMPACTS DU PASAOP SUR L'ENVIRONNEMENT
Le plan de suivi-evaluation permet de suivre et d'evaluer les impacts du projet sur l'environnement pendant
son ex6cution.
6.1 Aspects institutionnels
Nous recommandons que le suivi-evaluation des impacts du projet soit assure par la Cellule de Planificabon
et de Statistique (CPS) du Ministere du Developpement Rural en collaboration etroite avec la Direction
Nabionale de I'Assainissement, du Controle, de la Pollution et des Nuisances (DNACPN) et la Direction
Generale de la reglementation et du contr6le (DGRC) pour les raisons suivantes:
1. La CPS, la DNACPN et la DGRC sont trois structures perennes de l'Etat qui pourront poursuivre cette
activite meme apres le projet;
2. La CPS est non seulement une structure du Ministere qui a en charge le programme, mais aussi, elle a
deja une experience en matiere.de suivi-environnemental. C'est elle qui coordonne la composante
suivi-environnemental du PGRN depuis 1997. Cette composante qui a deja mis en place un reseau
avec 7 directions nabonales a a son actif, entre autres:
+ des manuels methodologiques pour la constitution de bases de donnees;
* des bases de donnees structurees dans les domaines de la m6t6orologie, la socio-d6mographie,
l'occupation des sols, la topographie, I'hydraulique et la pedologie;
* des cartes au 1/200 000 et au 1/500 000 en cours de digitalisabon;
* un site Web sur les structures mandatees des ministeres en matiere environnementale;
* un systeme d'information geographie (SIG) sur MAPINFO en place.
La CPS sera responsable de la coordination et de la supervision de la mise en ceuvre des diff6rentes
actions prevues au titre du suivi environnemental.
La DGRC est chargee de l'elaboration des normes et textes dans les domaines ci-apres:
- la gestion des ressources pastorales et halieutiques,
- la sante animale
- la protection phytosanitaire et le conditionnement
- l'organisation et la gestion des organisation associatives et coop6ratives
- la diffusion, la multiplication des textes elabores
- le controle et I'application des textes par les differents usagers etc.
Par ailleurs, dans le cadre de son mandat, la DNACPN est chargee de:
*  mener des etudes relatives a la definition des politques et strategies nationales en matiere de
controle des pollutions et nuisances, ainsi que de toute action tendant a l'amelioration du cadre de
vie des populations;
* fournir un appui aux collectivit6s territoriales en matiere de politique, de strategie et de planification
dans les domaines de l'assainissement et du controle des pollubons et des nuisances;
42



+  donner un avis motive sur les rapports d'impact sur 1'environnement;
+ proceder a des etudes relatives aux decharges contr6lbes, aux sites d'enfouissement et autres
techniques de traitement des dechets;
+ elaborer et veillez a l'application des textes legislatifs, reglementaires et normatifs propres a
assurer l'amelioration du cadre de vie des populations;
+ veiller au respect des engagements et prescriptions definis dans le cadre des etudes d'impact sur
l'environnement et dans la mise en ceuvre des projets;
+  identifier les facteurs de pollution et de nuisance et prescrire toutes mesures propres a les prevenir,
a les reduire ou a les eliminer;
+ elaborer et mettre en ceuvre, en rapport avec les structures concernees, des programmes de
formation dans le domaine de la prevention et du contr6le des pollutions et des nuisances;
- elaborer et mettre en ceuvre les programmes d'information, d'education et de communication sur
les problemes li6s aux pollutions et aux nuisances;
- centraliser et conserver la documentation relative aux pollutions et aux nuisances.
6.2 Indicateurs de suivi de l'evolution des impacts du PASAOP
Le suivi-6valuation des impacts environnementaux du PASAOP porteront essentiellement sur quatre
elements principaux qui sont:
+ evolution des ressources naturelles et leurs causes (sol, eau, flore, faune, air, conditions de vie);
+  evolution de l'occupation des terres (agriculture, foresterie, peche, chasse, activit6s minieres,
habitation, pastoralisme);
+ evolution des systeme de production;
+  evolution des impacts socio-economiques.
Les experiences acquises par la CPS/MDR dans le cadre du volet suivi environnemental du PGRN lui
permettront de definir des indicateurs pour les suivis d'impact du PASAOP sur 1'environnement.
Le tableau ci-dessous donne des directives sur les indicateurs d'impacts environnementaux ainsi que les
donnees a collecter en phase de suivi periode.

COMITE INTER-ETATS DE LUTTE CONTRE LA
SECHERESSE DANS LE SAHEL
(CILSS)
REGLEMENTATION SUR L'HOMOLOGATION DES PESTICIDES COMMUNES
AUX ETATS MEMBRES DU CILSS
BURKINA - CAP VERT - GAMBIE - GUINEE BISSAU - MALI - MAURITANIE - NIGER
SENEGAL - TCHAD

PREFACE
Le Sahel, confronte r6gulierement a de multiples attaques d'organismes nuisibles,
effectue chaque annee des traitements chimiques et souvent dans des zones a 6cosystemes
fragiles.
Aussi n6cessaire que soient ces interventions chimiques, il ne faudrait plus que les Etats
saheliens utilisent tout pesticide qui leur est propose. En tenant compte des crit&res reels
tels que la faible nocivite et la selectivite, la sous-region devrait autoriser ou interdire
l'emploi des pesticides qui lui sont soumis.
Considerant que les fieaux et autres ennemis des vegetaux ainsi que le bouleversement
des ecosystemes sont commun a 1'ensemble des Etats membres du CTLSS, il est
indispensable que les produits autoris6s ou interdits le soient pour 1'ensemble de la sous-
region. Le comite Sah6lien des Pesticides dont la cr6ation est proposee dans le present
document prendra des decisions communes A l'ensemble du Sahel, 6vitant ainsi qu'un
pesticide interdit dans un pays sahelien n'y soit introduit parce qu'il circule librement
dans le pays sah6lien voisin.
Puisse la presente reglementation, elaboree avec I'appui financier de l'UNSO, permettre
au Sahel d'effectuer une lutte chimique judicieuse dans le cadre d'un systeme de lutte
int6gree afin de ne pas aggraver les bouleversements des ecosystemes saheliens.
SIGNE:
Le Ministre Coordonnateur: Mr Antonio Gualberto ROSARIO

PREAMBULE
Les Etats membres du Comit6 Inter-Etats de Lutte contre la Secheresse dans le Sahel
(CILSS):
-  considerant la volonte des Gouvemements d'assurer la securite alimentaire
des populations dans les plus brefs delais,
-  considerant leurs politiques  agricoles  qui visent la  diversification  et
l'intensification des cultures en vue de l'accroissement des disponibilites
alimentaires et des revenus du monde rural,
-  considerant l'existence de fleaux et autres ennemis des cultures communs,
-  consid6rant  les  degats  incessants  des  ennemis  des  cultures  et  le
bouleversement des ecosystemes dans la r6gion sah6lienne,
-  considerant que les pertes dues aux ennemis des cultures atteignent pour
l'ensemble des pays du CILSS pres du quart des disponibilit6s alimentaires,
-  consid6rant que ces pertes importantes sont source de baisse considerable de
revenus monetaires,
-  considerant l'utilisation de quantites de plus en plus importantes des
pesticides,
-  considerant l'imperieuse necessite de l'usage de pesticides de plus en plus
s6lectifs,
- considerant l'existence de types d'ecosystemes similaires permettant une
utilisation appropriee des r6sultats des etudes ecotoxicologiques,
-  consid6rant les recommandations des organisations donateurs et de l'industrie
ainsi que les preoccupations de diverses organisations regionales telles que le
CPI, I'OUA et la CEE,
- considerant l'adoption du Code International de Conduite de la FAO sur la
distribution et utilisation des pesticides d'une part et les directives pour
l'homologation et le contr6le des pesticides d'autre part,
-  consid6rant la n6cessite d'une harmonisation de procedure d'homologation et
de contr6le des pesticides.
-  considerant le programme d'activit6s adopte par la premiere reunion technique
du Reseau de Gestion des Pesticides en Afrique Occidentale (Cotonou, mars
1991),
Ont convenu de ce qui suit:
TITRE 1: DU CHAMP D'APLICATION ET DU DOMAINE DE COMPETENCE
Article 1: La reglementation des pesticides communes a l'ensemble des pays membres du CILSS
concerne la mise en vente et l'utlisation des matieres actves et des formulations destinees a:

vecteurs des maladies humaines ou animales et les especes indesirables de
plantes ou d'animaux causant des dommages ou se montrant autrement
nuisibles durant la production, la transformation, le stockage, le transport ou la
73



commercialisation des denrees alimentaires, des produits agricoles, du bois et
des produits ligneux, ou des aliments pour animaux;
- &re administrees aux animaux pour combattre les insectes, les arachnides et
autres endo ou ectoparasites;
- etre utilisees comme regulateurs de croissance des plantes, defoliants, agents
de dessiccation, agent d'eclaircissage des fruits ou pour empecher la chute
pr6maturee des fruits.
La reglementation concerne egalement les biopesticides.
Article 2: Une liste positive de matieres actives et des formulations autorisees dans
l'ensemble des pays membres du CILSS sera 6tablie. L'etablissement de cette liste est de
competence commune. Les crit6res, la procedure feront l'objet de discussions au sein du
Comite Sahelien des Pesticides.
Les dispositions concernant le conditionnement, I'emballage et l'etiquetage des matieres actives et
des formulations doivent etre conformes aux normes internationales, notamment celles du Code
International de Conduite sur la distribution et l'utilisation des pesticides FAO et de la classification
OMS.
Article 3: Le Comite evaluera toutes les notifications au titre de la Procedure de
l'Information et du Consentement Pr6alable et amendera en consequence la liste
provisoire.
TITRE II: DES CONDITIONS D'HOMOLOGATION
Article 4 : Les pesticides peuvent etre homologues pour autant que les matieres actives
sont inscrites sur la liste positive commune et que la formulation presente les
caract6ristiques suivantes:
-  efficace vis-a-vis de l'organisme nuisible vise;
- non phytotoxique dans les conditions normales d'utilisation;
-  peu nocif pour l'homme et la faune non cible;
- pas d'influence nefaste sur l'environnement (en insistant sur la non
contamination des eaux de surface ou des eaux souterraines).
Les composants, les impuretes et les residus doivent etre determines et les reponses a
toutes ces exigences doivent etre apportees par des m6thodes d'essais et d'analyses
officiellement reconnues.
L'homologation des formulations sera basee sur des resultats experimentaux obtenus
dans les pays du CILSS. La validit6 de l'homologation est de cinq (5) ans et renouvelable
plusieurs fois pour la meme duree.
Les autorisations provisoires de vente ont une validite de trois (3) ans et renouvelable une
seule fois pour la meme duree.
74



L'homologation et les autorisations provisoires de vente peuvent ere reexaminees a tout
moment, annul6es si les conditions d'agr6ment ne sont plus remplies ou modifiees si
n6cessaire.
Article 5 : Les matieres actives inscrites sur la liste positive commune peuvent etre
reexaminees a tout moment si elles ne satisfont plus aux memes conditions de salubrite
que celles enumerees pour les formulations.
TITRE III: DE LA PROCEDURE D'INSCRIPTION D'UNE MATIERE ACTIVE
Article 6: Toute demande d'inscription d'une matiere active devra etre envoy6e a
I'UCTR/PV. Celle-ci sera chargee de centraliser puis classer l'ensemble de ces demandes
et de convoquer un groupe d'Experts (Entomologistes, Toxicologues, etc.) issus des
differents pays pour etudier et examiner ces differentes demandes en vue de donner des
avis positifs ou n6gatifs sur l'inscription d'une mati&re active sur la liste positive
commune.
Ce groupe d'Experts du CILSS appele << Comite Sahelien de Pesticides >> est mis en place
par l'UCTR/PV. Les avis emis par ce Comite seront diffuses au niveau des differents
Etats membres par l'UCTR/PV.
La decision de porter le nom d'une mati6re active sur la liste positive commune doit etre
conditionnee a une evaluation scientifique suivant des criteres prealablement etablis par
les membres du Comite Sahelien de Pesticides presents aux s6ances d'examen des
dossiers.
Dans un delai de six mois, le Comite Sahelien de Pesticides se prononce sur la
recevabilite du dossier et l'UCTR/PV notifie par ecrit la decision au demandeur puis en
informe les pays membres.
Cette disposition conceme egalement tout reexamen justifi6 par des connaissances
nouvelles sur la matiere active pour le maintien de son inscription.
Le detenteur d'une autorisation de vente a l'obligation de communiquer immediatement a
l'UCTR/PV, toute nouvelle information concemant les effets nocifs du produit ou des
residus de la matiere active, sur la sante humaine et animale ou sur l'environnement.

l'homologation et le contr6le des pesticides de la FAO et aux recommandations du
s6minaire CPI de Yaounde (nov.1987). 11 est a noter que 1'6tablissement des donn6es
d'homologation est maintenant de plus en plus informatise sur logiciel unique, identique
pour tous les pays, africains en l'occurrence. Par consequent, chaque parametre doit etre
75



rigoureusement maintenu tel quel dans tous les pays pour assurer fiabilit6, transparence et
exploitation optimale avec:
- ordre de presentation;
- numerotation et titre de rubriques;
-  resumes requis en annexe au dossier d'homologation.
Le demandeur d'homologation d'un pesticide est tenu d'avoir un si&ge permanent ou une
repr6sentation dans un des Etats membres de la CEDAO.
L'homologation des formulations doit etre faite par la prise des decisions au niveau du
Comite Sahelien des Pesticides comme dans le cas des matieres actives.
La comptabilite sera acceptee A condition de pouvoir effectuer la contre expertise, A la
charge de la firme agropharmaceutique concernees, de toutes donn6es contestables du
dossier.
Article 8 Les autorisations provisoires de vente ou de distributions sont emises par le
Comit6 Sahelien de Pesticides pour des formulations dont les matieres actives sont
inscrites sur la liste positive selon la proc6dure du titre III ou pour lesquelles des
investigations sont en cours. Ces autorisations provisoires sont delivrees pour trois ans
elles peuvent &re prolongees sur avis du Comite Sahelien de Pesticides.
Article 9: Les formulations deja commercialisees au niveau de la sous-region peuvent
pendant une periode de deux ans a partir de la date de mise en oeuvre de la proc6dure,
continuer A ere appliqu6es jusqu'a ce qu'elles fassent l'objet d'un examen par le Comite
Sah6lien de Pesticides en vue de leur homologation. A cet effet, le Comite doit faire un
inventaire de ces formulations, notifier aux detenteurs et les inviter A d6poser un dossier
d'homologation dans un delai de trois (3) mois.
Cet examen se fera suivant un programme prevu sur une periode de deux ans qui suit
i'adoption de la dite procedure. Un rapport sur l'etat des realisations de ce programme
sera etabli apres un an. Si apres examen les formulations sont refus6es, les Etats membres
du CILSS doivent retirer les autorisations accordees.
TITRE V: DE LA PROTECTION DES DONNEES CONFIDENTIELLES
Article 10: Les donnees fournies conformement au dossier type d'homologation prevue
par les directives pour homologation et le contr6le des pesticides de la FAQ et les
recommandations du CPI ne sont pas utilisables par des tiers.
Article 11: La confidentialite ne s'applique pas:
- A l'identite et aux proprietes chimiques des matieres actives et des produits
formules;

TITRE VI: DE L'INFORMATION, DE L'ETIQUETAGE ET DE
L'EMBALLAGE
Article 12: Entre 6tats membres et avec l'UCTR/PV, un systeme d'echange automatque
d'information integre a celui de la CEDEAO est instaure le mois suivant les nouvelles autorisations
ou retrait, ainsi que sous forme de listes annuelles des produits autorises.
L'information des utilisateurs est assur6e par les etiquettes et les notices jointes, de
preference en langue officielle, conformes aux prescriptions en vigueur et selon les
exigences precises de la procedure elle-meme. Si le produit n'est destine qu'a certaines
categories d'utilisateurs; le comite Sahelien des pesticides doit exiger que cette
information soit inscrite sur l'etiquette et la notice jointe.
Il est egalement possible d'autoriser des indications positives sur les possibilites
d'utilisation pendant la floraison et periode d'activit6 des insectes pollinisateurs.
Des pictogrammes doivent completer le texte, particulierement pour les precautions lors
de la manipulation qui doivent figurer aussi sous forme 6crite, en faisant la distinction
entre les vetements A porter lors de la manipulation du produit concentre et ceux a porter
pendant l'application.
Les pictogrammes symbolisant le type de produit, la methode d'application, le stade
vegetatif au moment de I'application, doivent etre standardises et &re toujours
accompagnes de 1'expression ecrite correspondante.
Les pictogrammes doivent par ailleurs etre confectionnes sous forme de posters en
quantite suffisante pour servir de materiel didactique jusqu'a la plus petite structure
utilisatrice.
Article 13: Les couleurs exigees sur les 6tiquettes sont celles relatives aux risques de
toxicit6 conformement a la classification OMS.
Article 14: Les caracteristiques des emballages seront conformes aux normes prevues par
les directives pour l'homologation et le contr6le des pesticides de la FAO.
TITRE VII: DE L'EXPERIMENTATION ET DU CONTROLE
Article 15: Les essais officiels en vue de l'homologation ainsi que les essais de contr6le
a effectuer apr&s d6p6t de la demande d'homologation seront r6alises par des
etablissements publics retenus par le Comite Sahelien des Pesticides.
Ces essais seront effectu6s selon des protocoles harmonises par un groupe technique de travail.
Les methodes elaborees par la CEB (Commission des Essais Biologiques) de I'ANPP (Association
Nationale de la Protection des Plantes - France) et les directives pour l'homologation et le contr6le
des agents biologiques de la FAO serviront de base de travail a ce groupe technique.
Les essais necessaires sur des vert6bres font l'objet d'une proc6dure particuliere lorsqu'il
s'agit d'une matiere active deja inscrite ou pour les informations supplementaires
concernant une substance deja sur le marche.
77



Cette proe6dure tend a eviter une repetition des essais portant sur des vert6bres et a
inciter les demandeurs a parvenir a des accords de cooperation ou d'utilisation des
donnees deja fournies.

ANNEXE 7
SPECIALE INITIATIVE: LUTTE INTEGREE
ASPECTS PHYTO-SANITAIRES ET GESTION DES PESTICIDES
DANS LE PASAOP
Grandes lignes d'orientation
Le PASAOP a pour but d'am6liorer la productivite du secteur agricole et d'augmenter la
production. Ceci passera par l'am6lioration de la foumiture des services agricoles, afin de
les rendre plus efficace et plus orient6s vers les besoins des producteurs, et de promouvoir
la responsabilisation des paysans. Cependant on peut supposer que ces activites auront un
effet considerable sur l'utilisation des produits phytosanitaires. Ceci necessite des mesures
qui permettent la pr6vention et mitigation des risques impliques par l'utilisation de ces
produits.
Dans le processus de la modemisation de l'agriculture Malienne, les producteurs devraient
avoir acces facilement aux intrants qui permet I'accroissement de la production et de la
productivite dans le secteur. Dans le cas des produits phytosanitaires, iJ est necessaire de
contr6ler les effets n6gatifs potentiels lies a l'utilisation de ces produits. Fr6quemment il y a
un manque d'information et de sensibilisation aupres des producteurs sur /es diff6rentes
alternatives de lutte contre les ravageurs qui cause une forte dependance aux produits
chimiques dans certaines cultures. Les structures gouvemementales ont insuffisamment
pris en compte les risques pour la sante humaine et l'environnement dans leurs
dispositions et strat6gies de d6veloppement du secteur (ex. distribution gratuite ou
subventionn6e des intrants). La mauvaise utilisation des pesticides cause des
"externalitffs" et consecutivement des coOts pour l'economie nationale. A pr6sent, ces
couts ne sontpas suffisammentpris en compte a cause du manque de leur "intemalisation"
dans les decisions des acteurs.
L'intervention dans le cadre du PASAOP doitporter sur trois axes:
mesures d'information et sensibilisation sur les alternatives a la dependance envers la
lutte chimique (des paysans-producteurs et du public en g6n6ral) pour stimuler
l'adoption des pratiques de protection phytosanitaire plus adaptees;
mesures de prevention, de reglementation et du contr6le des risques;
mesures d'internalisation des effets externes dans le fonctionnement des forces du
march6;
- renforcement des capacites en analyse d'impact environnemental.
Dans le domaine de protection vegetale il faut bien definir et delimiter
les t3ches de la responsabilit6 du secteur public et les taches des
operateurs economiques pour qu'on soit mieux prepare pour la
p6riode du lib6ralisation du secteur agricole et du libre marche pour
les intrants agricoles. Les interventions pr6vues contribuent a un
90



r66quilibrage de la balance entre les responsabilit6s du secteur
public et du secteur priv6. Cela demande d'un cot6 le renforcement
des structures et capacit6s du Gouvemement, en recentrant ses
interventions sur les fonctions de r6glementation et formulation des
politiques pour le secteur. De l'autre cote, les structures du
gouvemement devraient transferer les services ou activit6s qui
peuvent 6tre realisees par d'autres acteurs, soit par le secteur priv6,
soit par les organisations de la societe civile. Les fonctions de
reglementation et des prestations des services doivent 6tre bien
separees. Ceci implique la privatisation des certaines op6rations qui
ont et jusqu'a pr6sent r6alisees par le Gouvernement (ex.
distribution et vente des produits phytosanitaires). Le Gouvernement
se doit cependant de faciliter et promouvoir la prose en charge
progressive de ces t3ches nouvellement transfer6es aux acteurs
prives. Les op6rateurs 6conomiques, par exemple les entreprises
agro-industrielles, doivent responsables du contr6le de la qualit6 des
produits agricoles destines a l'exportation. Les paysans et leurs
associations par ailleurs, doivent etre inform6s et responsabilis6s
dans le domaine de protection des v6getaux.
Les nouvelles directions dans la gestion des pesticides necessitent
une adaptation du cadre 6conomique. La lib6ralisation croissante du
marche des intrants agricoles et la responsabilisation accrue des
producteurs dans les instances de decision demandent que les
forces du marche signalent aux acteurs economiques les vrais prix
des intrants agricoles au niveau de l'6conomie nationale. Quant aux
produits phytosanitaires, ii est indispensable d'appliquer le principe
du "pollueur-payeur". Le prix a l'achat devrait integrer les vrais coQts
de l'utilisation des intrants agricoles, y compris les couts extemes.
Toutes subventions indirectes qui pourraient avoir comme
consequence une surutilisation des intrants dans quelques cultures
(ex. coton) doivent etre eliminees afin de promouvoir l'adoption
d'une gestion rationnelle de protection des v6getaux. Le financement
des activites de la reglementation et du controle aussi bien que
l'assainissement des degats devraient etre assur6 suivant le meme
principe.
La gestion rationnelle des pesticides impliquent une collaboration et concertation des
responsabilites et activites dans les secteurs du dbveloppement rural, et de la protection de
l'environnement et de la sante humaine. L'intervention du Gouvernement necessite egalement une
meilleure coordination des actions entreprises par les differents ministeres et d'autres acteurs sur
ces aspects, aussi bien aupres du secteur prive que de la societe civile.
3.2 Strat6gie a entreprendre dans le cadre du PASAOP
L'intervention du PASAOP dans le domaine de protection vegetale et gestion des pesticides
devrait porter sur quatre (4) volets:
91



A.   Ancrer la strategie de lutte integree dans les systemes de vulgarisation et
d'information des producteurs
Demarrer un programme national de formation en lutte int6gree dans les cultures qui
sont prioritaires du point de vue problemes phytosanitaires et forte utilisation des
pesticides (c.a.d. coton, cultures maraich&res, riz);
Transferer les experiences de formation participative (formation dans les << champs-
ecoles des paysans >>) acquises en riziculture dans les cultures maraich&res et dans le
cotonnier comme essais pilotes;
Assurer la qualite de la formation des producteurs par l1'valuation de l'impact socio-
economique des activit6s realis6es;
Etablir un outil efficace pour la concertation des activites de formation, de
sensibilisation, de vulgarisation et de recherche en matiere de lutte integree (groupe
de travail dans le Comite National de Gestion des Pesticides)
Renforcer la liaison entre la vulgarisation et la recherche perrnettant le transfert
efficace des besoins des paysans (systeme de programmes a la demande);
Assurer l'appui technique aux organisations de vulgarisation (Offices, CMDT, ONG
et d'autres) et aux associations professionnelles des producteurs.
B.   Renforcer les structures de reglementation, prevention, suivi et controle
des risques lies a l'utilisation des pesticides
Le cadre l6gislatif et les structures de reglementation et controle doit etre adapte aux besoins
d'une meilleure gestion des circuits commerciaux des produits phytosanitaires et leurs effets
negatifs. Pour cela, il est prevu:
D'assurer la coordination efficace entre les agences de differents ministeres (developpement
rural, environnement, sante) par la revitalisation du Comite National de Gestion des Pesticides;
La mise en place des dispositions legislatifs pour le suivi et contr6le des circuits commerciaux
des produits phytosanitaires (interdiction des produits non-homologu6s, agrement pour les
importateurs et revendeurs);
Le renforcement des structures du suivi et contr6le de la qualite des produits phytosanitaires,
de la distribution, stockage et utlisation (surveillance reguliere des circuits commerciaux,
formation des revendeurs);
Le renforcement des capacit6s en matiere d'analyse des residus des pesticides dans
les denrees alimentaires et l'eau potable (programme de recherche sur la situation
actuelle);
Le renforcement des structures de suivi des effets negatifs pour la sante humaine et
1' environnement;
Un appui pour faciliter la creation d'une structure autonome du contr6le de la qualit6
des produits agricoles destines a l'exportation (association professionnelle des
exportateurs);
Le renforcement des capacites en etude d'impact environnemental au niveau du
secteur public et prive (bureaux d'etudes).
92



C.   Rationaliser les structures de surveillance et prevention des risques
poses par les ravageurs migratoires et d'autres grands fleaux
>  adapter les structures de surveillance et protection contre les grands filaux aux besoins
(evaluation des besoins et des capacit6s disponibles, formation des agents et des brigades
paysans, assurer leur fonctionnement);
> privatiser la vente et la distribution des produits phytosanitaires (ex. produits dans le
programme KR2);
> cesser la vente et la distribution des produits phytosanitaires par la DNAMR et les structures
regionales et appuyer la capacite technique, organisationnelle et de gestion du reseau existant
de revendeurs prives;
> renforcer les structures de l'inspection phytosanitaires (formation des postes a la
douane).
D.   Adapter le cadre economique et etablir des procedures de financement
durable pour les activites de reglementation et contr6le
Ces mesures ont pour but d'adapter la gestion des prix des produits phytosanitaires et de creer
une proc6dure pour le financement permanent et durable des services de reglementation et du
controle entames par les structures publics:
> envisager la mise en place d'une taxe specifique de 1 % sur les importations des produits
phytosanitaires suivant l'exemple d'autres pays dans la sous-region (Burkina Faso, Gambie).
La majorite des revenues de taxe serait destinee au financement de la reglementation et du
controle;
> promouvoir la reclassification des produits phytosanitaires dans le systeme de taxes (transfert
de la <( categorie 1 = biens de premiere nbcessite, matieres premieres de base et biens
d'equipement )) en  categorie 2 = intrants et produits intermediaires ))). Ceci contribuera au
financement du contr6le et de la pr6vention des effets negatifs des pestcides par l'adoption du
principe (( pollueur-payeur );
> mettre en place un systeme de fixation des prix des produits phytosanitaires qui intbgre les
coOts reels et les repercute entierement aux utilisateurs (ex. CMDT).
Ces activites s'incriront dans trois composantes du PASAOP, la composante restructuration du
MDR, la composante recherche agricole, et la composante vulgarisation agricole (voir Tableau ci-
joint Plan d'Action).

APERCU SUR LA REGLEMENTATION DES PRODUITS
AGROPHARMACEUTIQUES AU MALI ET PROCEDURE DE CONTROLE
Le Mali a ete une colonie fran,aise et comme toutes les autres colonies de l'6poque, il
etait soumis au droit frangais dans plusieurs domaines y compris celui de la 1lgislation
phytosanitaire. Trois principales periodes caracterisent la legislation phytosanitaire du
pays:
* la periode coloniale
* de l'independance a 1989
* de 1989 a 1995.
La r6glementation pendant la periode coloniale
Quelques textes peuvent etre mentionn6s a titre indicatif:
0  decret du 26 janvier 1926 portant reglementation du commerce, de la
d6tention et de l'emploi de substances venereuses en A.O.F (J.O.A.O. n° 1120
du 26 mars 1926 P. 227);
0  loi n°52-1256 du 26 novembre 1952 relative a l'organisation de la protection
des vegetaux dans les territoires relevant du Ministere de la France d'Outre-
mer;
0  decret n°84 MAEF du 13 avril 1959 interdisant la vente sur le territoire de la
Republique Soudanaise (actuel Mali) de certains produits.
* De l'independance du Mali a 1989
Peu de textes legislatifs et reglementaires en matiere de gestion et de contr6le des
produits agropharmaceutiques ont ete elabores et adoptes.
A la meme periode, le Mali a adh6r6 differentes conventions, reglementation et code de
r6f6rences parmi lesquels
O  la Convention Phytosanitaire Inter-Africaine (CPI/OUA) de l'Organisation de
l'Unite Africaine;
0  le Code International de conduite FAO pour la distribution et l'utilisation des
pesticides en novembre 1985;
0  la R6glementation sur l'homologation des pesticides commune aux Etats
membres du CILSS.
Jusqu'en aout 1995, ces differents textes ont constitue les seuls corpus juridiques internes
au Mali reglementant la gestion et le contr6le des pesticides au Mali.
* De la periode 1989 a 1995
Le Mali a elabore des projets de textes legislatifs et reglementaires en 1989.
Ce n'est qu'en 1995 que ces textes ont 6te adoptes par l'Assembl6e Nationale et le
Gouvernement. Actuellement le Mali dispose d'une l6gislation Nationale:
w la loi n°95-061 du 02 aofit 1995 portant repression des infractions a la
reglementation  de  l'homologation   et  du  contr6le  des  produits
agropharmaceutiques;
99



w cette  loi  prevoit  les  sanctions  applicables  lorsque  les  produits
agropharmaceutiques non homologues ou n'ayant pas recu une autorisation
provisoire de vente (APV) sont importes, fabriques, formules, conditionnes,
stockes, utilises ou mis sur le marche;
w le d6cret n°95-404/P-RM  du 10 novembre 1995 portant r6glementation de
l'homologation et du contr6le des produits agropharmaceutiques.
Ce decret:
* traite tout d'abord des definitions
*  interdit l'importation, la fabrication, la formulation, la vente, la publicite etc
de tout produit non homologue ou n'ayant recu d'APV;
+  a pris en compte la reglementation sur l'homologation des pesticides
communes aux Etats membres du CILSS dans ces articles 5, 6 et 17 qui
stipulent:
Article 5: I'homologation des produits agropharmaceutiques se fait conformement a la
reglementation sur l'homologation des pesticides commune aux Etats membres du
Comit6 Inter Etat de Lutte contre la Secheresse au Sahel (CILSS).
La procedure d'homologation prevoit:
l'autorisation d'experimentation;
. le refus ou l'ajoumement de la decision pour compl6ments d'information
l'autorisation provisoire de vente (APV)
. l'homologation.
L'autorisation et l'homologation peuvent etre modifiees ou retirees par le Ministre
Coordinatrice sur avis du Comite Sahelien des Pesticides (CSP).
Article 6: toute modification de la composition chimique, biologique ou physique d'un
produit ainsi que tout changement dans la destination pour laquelle un produit a ete
autoris6 ou homolo1u,, sont soumis a l'examen du CSP qui decide si une nouvelle
demande d'autorisation ou d'homologation doit etre presentee.
Article 17 : Un comite national de Gestion des Pesticides est institue aupres du Ministre
charg6 de l'Agriculture pour veiller a I'application au niveau national des decisions du
CPS.
Les attributions, la composition et le fonctionnement dudit comite sont fix6s par decret
pris en conseil des Ministres.
+  exige l'elaboration d'Arr&6 Minist6riel et Interministeriel sur les conditions
de d6livrance d'agr6ment et de licence.
* Exige la creation d'un comit6 National de Gestion des Pesticides.
Les diff6rents arretes et decrets sont en cours d'elaboration.

Degre d'application de la reglementation
Malgre, l'existence de differents textes legislatifs et reglementaires, la reglementation sur
l'homologation des pesticides communes aux Etats membres du CILSS, le degre
d'application reste tres faible.
Neanmoins, l'application de certaines decisions du Comit6 Sahelien des pesticides a
timidement commence a savoir la multiplication et la diffusion de la liste des produits
homologues ou ayant re,u une autorisation provisoire de vente (APV) a toutes les
structures concernees et les representants des firmes.
D'autre part il a 6te demand6 aux repr6sentants des firmes et grandes societes
consommatrices de pesticides, et dans le cadre de l'application des textes legislatifs et
reglementaires en vigueur au Mali ainsi que dans le souci d'assainir le march6 malien des
pesticides et de prot6ger 1'environnement et l'homme, un delai de six (6) mois, a compter
de la date de la r6union (vendredi 23 octobre 1998) qui a regroup6 les representants des
firmes pr6sents A Bamako, certaines structures techniques et societ6s et la DGRC, est
accord6 a tous les des firmes afin qu'ils prennent les dispositions n6cessaires pour
deposer au niveau du secr6tariat permanent du Comite Sahelien des Pesticides (CSP) a
l'Institut du Sahel a Bamako, les dossiers d'homologation des diff6rentes specialites dont
ils disposent.
Passe ce delai, des mesures seront prises par la DGRC pour retirer du marche tous les
produits agropharmaceutiques dont la proc6dure d'homologation n'est pas entamee.

CONTRAINTES
Comme pour la legislation phytosanitaire, des contraintes existent aussi dans
l'application des textes sur le contr6le des produits agropharmaceutiques.
Certaines se r6sument comme suit:
O Insuffisance de textes reglementaires : arretes d'application et autres;
! Insuffisance de personnel qualifie;
nJ Inexistence d'un Comite National de Produits Agropharmaceutiques;
O  Manque de materiels et d'infrastructures;

CONTROLE           ET    HOMOLOGATION                   DES    PRODUITS
AGROPHARMACEUTIQUES
Le contr6le des produits agropharmaceutiques est regit actuellement au Mali par deux (2)
textes.
La loi n°95-061 du 02 aout 1995 portant infractions a la reglementation de
l'homologation des produits agropharnaceutiques est un prealable a tout effort serieux
visant a r6soudre les problemes lies a l'utilisation des Pesticides dans un pays.
Pour mieux gerer et contr6ler les produits agropharmaceutiques, il est indispensable:
. de faire un inventaire de l'ensemble des formulations et m. a. existantes sur le
territoire et de leur utilisation;
. d'avoir une reglementation nationale;
. d'avoir une structure d'homologation.
Cet aspect de la gestion des pesticides est assure par le Comite Sahelien des pesticides.
102



PROCEDURE DE CONTROLE DES PRODUITS AGROPHARMACEUTIQUES
Des mesures generales
Les agents assermentes de la Direction Generale de la R6glementation et du Contr6le
(DGRC) charges du contr6le sont munis d'une carte professionnelle qu'ils doivent
presenter dans le cadre de 1'exercice de leur fonction. Ils doivent constater par proces
verbal etabli en trois (3) exemplaires toute infraction a la reglementation et au controle
des Pesticides.
En cas de prelevement d'echantillons un recepisse est delivre au proprietaire par l'agent
charg6 du contr6le. L'analyse des formulations de Pesticides sont confi6s au laboratoire
de la DGRC ou a d'autres laboratoires agrees.
Le(s) laboratoire(s) doivent dans un delai d'une semaine a deux (2) mois elaborer un
rapport ou sont consignes les resultats de l'analyse.
Controle lesproduits agropharmaceutiques ti I'intportation
Toute personne qui importe les Pesticides doit etre titulaire d'une licence delivree par le
Ministre charge du commerce. Un agr6ment doit 6tre requis par toute personne qui
procede a la mise sur le marche des pesticides.
L'importateur avant de faire la commande des Pesticides, doit se munir d'un permis. Ce
permis est delivr6 par la DGRC. Les produits importes doivent avoir re,u au prealable
une A.P.V ou une homologation.
L'homologation des Pesticides se fait conformement a la reglementation sur
l'homologation des Pesticides communes aux Etats membres du CILSS.
Le titulaire d'autorisation ou d'homologation doit tenir un registre paraphe de gestion des
Pesticides. Ce registre doit etre mis a la disposition des autorites chargees du contr6le.
Il doit etre conserve pendant cinq (5) ans a compter de la date d'expiration de
I'autorisation ou de l'homologation.
Un arrete du Ministre charge de l'Agriculture fixe les conditions de delivrance de la
licence et de l'agrement.
Pour mener a bien le contr6le a l'importation les agents doivent
*  avoir acces aux navires, avions, v6hicules;
* avoir libre acces aux bureaux des douanes, entrep6ts , bureaux de poste,

103



Le contr6le doit se faire avant le dedouanement de la marchandise. Toute publicite pour
un produit agropharmaceutique est interdite sauf s'il b6neficie d'une A.P.V ou d'une
homologation.
La publicite ne peut mentionner que les indications contenues dans l'autorisation ou
l'homologation et doit etre conforme aux lois et reglements en vigueur.
L e contr6le des produits agropharmaceutiques a l'exportation
La fabrication ou la formulation des produits agropharmaceutiques destines
exclusivement a l'exportation pr6par6s et conditionnes conformement aux specifications
et aux instructions de l'acheteur, est soumise a l'autorisation conjointe des Ministres

Toute infraction constatee entraine immediatement des sanctions administratives et des
poursuites civiles et penales prevues par la reglementation en vigueur.
104



SYSTE-ME   HARMONISE   D'HOMOLOGATION   DES  PRODUITS
AGROPHARMACEUTIQUES DANS LES ETATS MEMBRES DU CILSS
Un des objectifs principaux que se sont fixes les Etats membres du CILSS est la
production en quantite et en qualite suffisantes de denr6es alimentaires pour assurer la
s6curite alimentaire des populations.
Mais, il se trouve que le Sahel est regulierement confronte a de multiples attaques
d'organismes nuisibles, de maladies des plantes de mauvaises herbes et autres predateurs
qui aneantissent une proportion importante de la recolte. Pour faire face a cette situation,
les pays du Sahel effectuent chaque annee des traitements chimiques. Ces traitements ont
souvent lieu dans des zones a ecosystemes fragiles.
CREATION DU COMITE SAHELIEN DES PESTICIDES (CSP)
Pour eviter l'exportation vers les pays en developpement de certains produits interdits
dans un pays ou plusieurs autres pays, ou dont l'utilisation a ete severement limitee dans
quelques pays industrialises pour des raisons toxicologiques, ecologiques ou sociales, le
conseil des ministres du CILSS, reuni en session ordinaire les 6 et 7 avril 1992 a
Ouagadougou a adopte la r6solution n°7/27/CM/92 relative au controle phytosanitaire et
a l'homologation des Pesticides.
C'est ainsi que, d'une part, il a ete demande aux Etats d'elaborer et d'adopter une
legislation phytosanitaire et d'autre part, il a ete decid6 la creation du Comite Sahelien
des Pesticides (CSP) dont le secretariat est assure par l'UCTR/P.V.
Par la r6solution n°10/29/CM94 le conseil des Ministres demande
* aux Etats Saheliens d'appliquer les decisions du CSP
- au CSP de faire porter la mention << Sahel >> sur tous les produits homologu6s.
LE COMITE SAHELIEN DES PESTICIDES (CSP)
L'homologation des Pesticides se fait conformement a la reglementation sur
l'homologation des Pesticides commune aux Etats membres du CILSS. Il faut rappeler
que le Mali est membre du CILSS et a ce titre membre signataire du document relatif a la
reglementation pour l'homologation commune aux Etats membres du CILSS.. Au sein de
cet organisme est cree le CSP dont l'un des principaux r6les est l'homologation des
Pesticides.
Pour l'homologation d'un pesticide:
. le demandeur adresse un dossier complet de demande d'homologation au CSP a
l'INSHA A Bamako;
* le SP enregistre le dossier et le soumet au CSP.
Le CSP examine le dossier et peut soit:
* homologuer le Pesticide dans le Sahel pour cinq (5) ans. Le Pesticide homologue
porte un numero unique pour tout le Sahel;
105



* donner une APV. dont la duree ne peut exc6der trois (3) ans en attendant que le
dossier doit complet;
* maintenir une etude pour complement d'information ou 6tudes complementaires;
* interdire le produit dans le Sahel et dans le cas des Pesticides d6jh commercialis6s,
decider de son retrait immediat sur le marche;
*   le SP transmet au demandeur et a tous les pays Sah6liens, les resultats de la
deliberation du CSP.
Les missions du CSP: Le CPS est charge:
e 6tablir la liste des m.a. autorisees dans 1'ensemble des pays membres du CILSS et la
liste des formulations homologuees:
 examine les demandes d'homologation pour suite a donner;
* etablir la liste des etablissements publics autorises a effectuer les essais
*  tenir le registre des homologations et des autorisations;
* 6tablir une liste des produits d'emploi interdit ou limite en agriculture.
La composition du CPS: le CPS est compose:
* de deux experts de chaque pays sahelien. Ces experts peuvent etre des
entomologistes, des phytophalogistes, des malherbologistes, mammalogistes, des
virologues, des phytopharmaciens etc...
* de trois toxicologues saheliens ou travaillant au Sahel
* du directeur technique de l'OCLALAV;
* du coordonnateur de l'UCTRIPV;
* d'un representant de la CEDEAO
* d'un respresentant du CPI;
* d'un representant de la FAO;
d'un representant de l'OMS.
Meithodologie dle travail dlu CSP
Deux documents servent de base de travail au CSP ce sont
* reglementation sur l'homologation des pesticides commune aux Etats membres du
CILSS issue de la r6solution n°7/2/CM/92 du 07 avril 1992 prise par les chefs d'Etats
et de gouvernement a Ouagadougou;
* composition du dossier d'homologation des pesticides au Sahel.
La methodologie comporte quatre etapes:
1. VYrification de la regularit de / 'enregistrement des dossiers soumis par les firmes all
secretariatpermanent dc/ CILSS
Cette etape permet d'eliminer les dossiers enregistres apres la date limite de d6p6t.
106



2. Evaltation quantitative des dossiers
Cette evaluation consiste en la verification des elements constitutifs de la demande
d'homologation conformrment aux prescriptions du document relatif a la composition du
dossier d'homologation.
Ceux deux premieres etapes constituent l'etude pr6liminaire des dossiers, etude confiee a
un groupe d'experts en attendant le recrutement d'un phytopharmacien comme secr6taire
souverain. Ce sont:
le sous-comit6 charg6 de Y'examen des donnees physico-chimiques, biologiques et
mod&les d'6tiquettes;
* le sous-comite charge des donnees analytiques et toxicologiques.
Le travail de ces sous-comites consiste a passer aux etapes suivantes dans l1'tude des
dossiers a savoir:
3. Evaluation scientifiquie
4. D6liberations
Ces deliberations peuvent conduire a quatre types de resultats
* produits homologues pour cinq ans avec le label << Sahel >>
- produits ayant obtenus une autorisation provisoire de vente (APV) de trois ans;
* produits maintenus en etude sans APV (pour complements d'informations);
 produits rejetes.
Ce sont les produits dont l'utilisation peut poser des problemes (ex.: d6sherbants non
s,lectifs). Le comite se retrouve en pleniere pour faire la synthese des deliberations.
Les secretaires permanents se chargent d'informer les Etats membres et les firmes des
decisions du CSP.
Le CSP est une institution jeune. Des sa premiere reunion en mars 1994, it s'est dote d'un
r6glement interieur. Il pense aussi mettre en place des structures lui permettant
d'appliquer toutes les prescriptions contenues dans le document << Composition du
dossier d'homologation des pesticides au Sahel >.
Il s'agit essentiellement:
* de selectionner des Instituts de Recherches Agronomiques capables de prendre en
charge les essais biologiques. Lors de sa derniere reunion enjuin 1995 le CSP a invite
les responsables de ces institutions en vue d'elaborer des protocoles harmonisees.
Les firmes auraient ainsi a leur disposition, des centres ou elles pourront commander des
essais en pre-homologation et leurs produits dans les conditions du Sahel:
* d'elaborer des procedures d'6valuation des 6tudes d'ecotoxicologie,
107



*  de retenir, de renforcer les capacites analytiques d'un laboratoire de contr6le
des formulations, de recherche et d'analyse des residus.

Tableau des risques de pollution par les intrants agricoles
On considerera le risque a partir du moment oui la dose moyenne en intrants (fertilisants
ou pesticides) calculee pour la superficie totale du secteur consider6 depasse la dose
moyenne calculee sur la superficie totale des regions CMiDT. Notons que le fait de
ramener le calcul aux superficies totales plut6t qu'aux superficie cultivees permet de
determiner un indice de risque au niveau du secteur. Au-dessus de la dose moyenne
calculee sur l'ensemble des regions, le risque sera d'intensit6 variable, sur une echelle de
I a 3 d6finis dans le tableau suivant (tableau n°l).

Programme d'Appui aux Services Agricoles et aux Organisations de
Producteurs (PASAOP Mali)
I.    Introduction
Le Programme d'Appui aux Services Agricoles et aux Organisations de Producteurs
(PASAOP Mali) vise a promouvoir une augmentation soutenable de la production
agricole, un accroissement de la production et des revenus agricoles en mettant en place
un systeme de generation et de transfert de technologies repondant a la demande des
producteurs. Ce systeme permettra non seulement la promotion d'une amelioration
technologique et un appui au developpement du capital social, mais aussi une meilleure
gestion des ressources naturelles. Pour cela quitre composantes sont envisagees: i) un
appui aux reformes institutionnelles du Ministere du Developpement Rural; ii) un appui
au systeme national de recherche agricole; iii) un appui au systeme national de
vulgarisation et iv) un appui aux organisation paysannes.
II.   Information de base
Toute  information  pertinente  permettant aux  divers  acteurs  de  l'6valuation
environnementale, consultants ou representants du Gouvemement concerne. Cette section
doit comprendre une rapide description des principales composantes du programme
soumise a etude environnementale, une justification du besoin de cette evaluation et des
objectifs que cette evaluation compte poursuivre, ainsi que I'agence d'execution, le statut
actuel du programme et son calendrier. Dans l'hypothese ou d'autres projets en cours ou
en preparation affecteraient les memes ressources que le projet etudier, ces projets
devraient 6galement 6tre mentionn6s dans cette section..
III.   Objectifs
La presente Analyse environnementale a pour principaux objectifs
- d'apprecier l'impact des activites proposees par les institutions de g6n6ration et de
transfert de technologies sur l'environnement et l'amelioration de la gestion des
ressources naturelles;
- d'identifier, s'il y a lieu, des activites complementaires a envisager pour assurer la
prevention      ou la correction d'impact n6gatif;
- d'identifier les activites de prevention ou de correction prevues.

IV.   Requis juridiques pour 1'evaluation environnementale
Cette Analyse environnementale est requise dans le cadre du cofinancement du projet par
l'Association pour le Developpement International au titre de la Politique Operationnelle
4.01 (F6vrier 1999) et en particulier les politiques de sauvegarde en ce qui concerne
l'analyse environnementale, la gestion des biocides, la gestion des eaux internationales, la
foret, la propriet6 culturelle, les peuples indigenes, les deplacements des populations, les
territoires litigieux, la securite des barrages, les habitats naturels. L'analyse fera un point
rapide sur la situation des lois et decrets concernant l'environnement, ainsi que les
conventions internationales signees par le Gouvernement du Mali sur la conservation de
la biodiversite, les changements climatiques et la lutte contre la desertification.
V.    Zone d'etude
La zone d'etude est la zone d'influence du projet, actuellement 6tendue A 1'ensemble des
zones rurales du Mali, avec un accent particulier sur plusieurs zones ou des operations
pilotes sont pr6vues. Les zones presentent des dangers environnementaux importants
(erosion, d6forestation, qualit6 des eaux de surface ou nappes) seront plus
particulierement 6tudies.
VI.   Champ d'etude
Le champ d'6tude comprendra:
-  l'aide a la formation et a l'elaboration des mesures de gestion durable des eaux et du
sol des exploitations agricoles;
-  l'aide a l'introduction, dans les exploitations agricoles, de technologies appropriees,
notamment fertilisant organique, gestion des biocides, mecanisation appropriees,
gestion de la sante animale, utilisation'des energies renouvelables,
t6lecommunications rurales;
- l'integration des considerations liees a la conservation de la biodiversite dans le
developpement agricole et pastoral;
-  l'information et la formation des principaux acteurs du developpement agricoles,
notamment les groupes sociaux les plus vuln6rables.
VII.  Tache 1: Description du Projet soumis a Analyse Environnementale
Le consultant effectuera une rapide description des principales composantes du projet, a
I'aide de cartes A une echelle appropriee partout oiu cela est necessaire et en incluant les
informations sur les activites prevues dans les domaines des amenagements
hydroagricoles, la protection des zones basses contre la salinisation et l'acidification des
terres, la lutte contre la degradation des sols par erosion 6olienne ou hydrique et enfin la
preservation et l'amelioration de l'exploitation des forets naturelles. L'etude prendra en
compte tous les aspects aussi bien du point de vue de la vulgarisation que de la generation
de technologies appropriees par la recherche.
111



National d'Action Environnementale (PNAE) et les programmes pr6vus pour maximiser
les impacts positifs du Programme.
Le consultant recommandera des activites pour attenuer les impacts negatifs du
Programme en matiere environnementale.
Il fera expressement reference aux cadres logiques des differentes composantes et
activites du Programme pour prendre en compte ces impacts.
Le consultant proposera des programmes de travail, les estimatifs budgetaires, et les
besoins en termes de personnel et de formation, et tout autre soutien requis pour la mise
en ceuvre de ces mesures additionnelles.
12. Tfiche 6: Identification des besoins institutionnels pour la mise en  euvre des
recommandations de l'evaluation environnementale.
II conviendra d'examiner les mandats et les capacites des institutions aux niveaux local,
regional et national. Le consultant recommandera les mesures institutionnelles a
envisager pour renforcer ou etendre la capacite de ces institutions a mettre en ceuvre ou a
suivre de maniere effective les activites pr6vues. Il conviendra notamment que ces
mesures puissent favoriser les synergies entre les differentes institutions intervenant dans
le domaine de la gestion des ressources naturelles.
13. Tfiche 7 : Preparation d'un plan de suivi et d'evaluation
II conviendra de proposer des indicateurs et des mecanismes de suivi et evaluation de
l'impact des technologies g6n6rees et transfer6es sur l'environnement. II faudra inclure
dans ce plan une estimation des couts initiaux et recurrents et une description des autres
intrants requis (tels que la formation et le renforcement institutionnel) permettant la mise
en ceuvre du plan. Ce plan de suivi devra utiliser au mieux les mecanismes institutionnels
existants (telle que la cellule de Concertation Recherche developpement) et integrer les
institutions chargees de la gestion de l'environnement au Mali notamment celles
preconis6es par le PNAE Mali.
14. Rapport
Le rapport final d'evaluation environnementale devra etre concis (25 pages Maximum) et
se limiter sur l'evaluation des activites deja pr6vues, les activites a envisager notamment
