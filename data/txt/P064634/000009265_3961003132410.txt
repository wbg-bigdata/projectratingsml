MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CRED1T TO THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS FOR A
TRANSPORT SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on - proposed
development credit to the Republic of Honduras for SDR 46.90 million, the equiva1ent of US$65 million, on
standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance a Transport Sector Rehabilitation Project.
The project would be cofinanced by several multilateral and bilateral donors.
2.    1kod: The Governmeat of Honduras (GOH) has embarked on an ambitious restructuring
effort to lay the basis for sustained economic growth. This involves opening up the economy to competition
and expanding the role of market forces in resource allocation. Honduras is expected to continue its heavy
reliance on the export of agricultural commodities, which require low cost and reliable domestic
transportation facilities to be competitive. At present, transport costs are high due to years of low
investment, neglected maitenance, operational inefficiencies and an institutional framework unsuited to
rapid market changes. To reverse this situation the GOH straitegy seeks to: (a) expand the participation of
the private sector in the provision of transport services; (b) improve fiscal performance through the
establishment of user charges based on economic criteria; (c) strengthen investment selection, emphasizing
the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing assets; and (d) establish a new regulatory framework for the
transport industry to encourage competition. In addition, there is now growing awareness of the need to
minimize the effects of infrastructure investments on the environment, and the GOH intends to integrate
environmental concerns in transport policy and investment decisions. To ensure the sustainability of
impro-vements in sector efficiency, GOH has initiated far-reaching reforms in the key roads, ports and
airports subsectors, and is reducing the financial burden imposed by an inefficient railway system. In
addition, to raise the hierarchical level of the sectoral planning, programming and budgeting functions in the
Secretariat of Commnications, Public Works and Transport (SECOPI), the GOH recently created the
Under Secretariat of Planning and Finance.
3.    In the road subs  , the dominant transport mode, SECOPT has already reduced substantially road
maitenance staffing from about 5,000 in 1990 to about 2,760 in 1992, and is implementing a rapid shift to
road maintenan  by contract (300 microenterprises were retained in 1990 and 1991 to carry out routine
maintenance activities on about 4,000 km of roads). To ensure adequate cost recovery and to mobilize
additional resources in the subsector, the GOH, with support from the hiteramerican Development Bank
(IDB), will assess options through a study to be completed by the end of 1993. The present regulatory and
pricing framework for road transport is being revised to ensure free entry and the targeting of urban
transport subsidies to the lowest income groups.
4.    In the port subs r, a recent study financed by the United Nations Development Programne
(UNDP) concluded that: (a) the National Port Authority (ENP) is experiencing excessive growth in
administrative costs; (b) Puerto Cortes, which handles about 80% of the international traffic, is subsidizing
the other ports by charging considerably more than its operating costs; and (c) the present sector
organization is slow to adapt to changes in the demand for transport services and therefore the comparative
advantages of Puerto Cortes in the region, such as the provision of transhipment services, are not fully
exploited. The GOH is determined to enhance the competitiveness of its port systel 'hrough the gradual
transfer of most ports' operational responsibilities to the private sector, with ENP in1Teasingly taking the
role of a landlord agency. As a first step, GOH is planning to concession to private operators some of the
port activities in Puerto Cortes and to establish in the deficitary ports (mainly Puerto Castilla and Puerto San
Lorenzo) management schemes with the necessary incentives for commercial results. The GOH would



-2-
propose through its representatives in the recently created Public Utility Regulatory Commission (PURC), to
allow private operators to set tariffs on the basis of costs and demand.
5.    In the airr subsector, dispersion of responsibilities among several public agencies prevents
efficiency. A plan to strengthen the institutional framework, develop a suitable regulatory capacity, and
ensure sector performance according to international safety standards needs to be developed and
implemented. To that end the GOH, with UNDP financing and technical assistance from the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), prepared a 1992-1994 Civil Aviation Development Program, that
includes the design and implementation of an appropriate institutional framework for the subsector and
foresees a possible role for the private sector in its operation. The program also includes the preparation of
Master Plans fcr the development of future airport infrastructure, which is already inadequate to attend the
country's needs, both in terms of capacity and safety standards.
6.    In the railway sector, the Honduran National Railways (FNII) generates a US$1 million annual
operational deficit. As a first step for deficit reduction, FNH implemented a voluntary retirement program
with fiancing provided by the U.S. Agency for Intenational Development, and on November 30, 1992 all
the operational staff (143 people) from the non-operating La Ceiba line were separated from FNH. The
GOH, based on the conclusions of a UNDP financed study, has decided to phase out FNH's railway
operations completely by 1996.
7.    The GOH is also improving its capacity to address environmental concerns in the transport sector.
A core Environmental Unit was recently established in SECOPT to evaluate the environmental impact of
road works. Environmental assessments are carried out by local consultants who have developed
considerable expertise in this area. The responsibilities and output of the unit, would be fully integrated
into SECOPT's planning process and expanded to encompass other transport modes (para. 9). In addition,
the unit needs to develop standards against which palliative and/or mitigative actions can be measured.
8.    Pject Ojectives: The project has two sets of major objectives: (a) to help improve the
institutional and regulatory framework of the sector so as to: (i) encourage greater private provision of
transport services; (fi) establish investment and pricing policies based on efficiency and equity
considerations; (iii) integrate into SECOPT's work the systematic consideration of environmental concerns;
(iv) strengthen SECOPT's planning and regulatory capability; (v) restructure the port subsector and redefine
the role of the ENP; (vi) design and implement a strategy for the development of the airport subsector; and
(vii) rationalize railway operations; and (b) to help improve and rehabilitate transport infrastructure in the
main trade corridors in support of the Government's efforts for export-led growth and reduce the bacldog of
deferred mantenance. Achievement of these objectives would remove bottlenecks to trade, reduce
transportation costs, attract private investments to the transport sector (reducing the need for public funding)
and help redirect the focus of the state away from the provision of services.
9.    Pjt  Dertn: The project would have three components: (1) the polic   mponen is
reflected in the Government's Transport Sector Policy Declaration, which spells out a medium-term strategy
for the setor, and in the related Action Plans specifying the measures to be taken to address the most
important sector issues; (ii) the investment component (total cost US$79.6 million would finance a time slice
of the Government's 1993-1996 Transport Sector Investment Program (TSIP) amounting to US$545.7
million, and consists of: (a) rehabilitation of about 150 km of roads in the main export corridors; (b)
periodic maintenance of about 1800 km of the road network; (c) construction and rehabilitation of about
1000 m of bridges; (d) rehabilitation of about 1000 km of feeder roads in agriculturally rich areas; and (e)
rehabilitation of the runway, taxiway and apron of the San Pedro Sula airport. The institutional



-3 -
development and technical assistance component (total cost US$3.3 million), would provide technical
assistance to: (a) strengthen the capabilities of SECOPT's Under Secretariat of Planning and Finance and the
Directorate of Transport to carry out project evaluation and implement a regulatory framework consistent
with the new public-private sector mix; O) expand the role of the Environmental Unit to encompass all
transport modes and effectively integrate environmenzal aspects into SECOPT's investment decisions; (c)
support implementation of the Action Plans in the areas related to privatization/divestiture measures for the
port and airport subsectors; and (d) strengthen SECOPT's capacity for bridge management.
10.   The total project cost is estimated at US$545.7 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$338.5 million equivalent (62%). The proposed Credit would finance 12% of total project
cost with the remaining funding coming from several multilateral and bilateral donors. Schedule A shows a
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the Status of Bank Group operations in Honduras are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10680-HO dated January 11, 1993 is also attached. To avoid
any delays in starting road rehabilitation and maintenance works which could cause increased costs,
retroactive financing of up to US$1.7 million, equivalent to 3% of the Credit proceeds, is recommended for
expenditures incurred in eligible road rehabilitation works after July 31, 1992.
11.   Project Implementation: The proposed project is expected to be completed in about four years.
SECOPT would be responsible for coordinating overall project implementation, including monitoring of the
regulatory reforms and implementation of the GOH Sector Policy Declaration, and for the execution of the
civil works and technical assistance financed under the proposed credit. An Implementation Committee
icluding the Ministers of SECOPT and of Economy, would b3 responsible for the implementation of the
reforms in the port subsector. 'The Implementation Committee would be supported by a Technical
Implementation Unit in ENP. A full-me project coordinator (PC), with qualifications satisfactory to IDA,
would head a Project Coordinating Unit and would be responsible for monitoring sector developments and
for coordinating the necessary actions to achieve the objectives of the GOH Sector Policy Declaration and
Action Plans. The PC would report directly to the Vice-Minister of Transport.
12. Project Sustainablity: Project sustainability would be enhanced by the proposed focus on the policy
framework, on institutional development and on the redefinition of the role of the state, all of which would
promote the participation of the private sector in the provision of transport services and the establishment of
an effective system for transport regulation, pricing and cost recovery.
13.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement: The Bank and IDA have played an instrumen
role in the development of the transport sector of Honduras since 1955, and the Bank Group made a total of
eleven loans/credits, of which eight were for the highway subsector and three for the port subsector. The
result of these efforts, in terms of institutional strengthening, sector planning, investment optimization and
prioritization, and improvements in infrastructure maintenance have been mixed and weaknesses in past
projects can be traced to insufficient Government commitment to implement far reaching reforms. The
project draws heavily upon the lessons learned by the Bank and IDA through its project work both in
Honduras and world-wide, which show that, institution building is a slow process and requires continued
support to strengthen transport sector management. Past experience show the need to reconsider the role of
the state where the private sector can play an expanded role. The emphasis is on developing a better private
public mix, assisting Governments to strengthen the technical capacity and increasing the accountability of
government agencies responsible for the regulation, planning and allocation of funds in the transport sector,
and encouraging competition to make transport services more responsive to market needs.



- 4 -
14.   Rationale for IDA Involveme: IDA's strategy for Honduras has been to support a comprehensive
and successful adjustment program. IDA is now focussing on programs designed to address poverty issues
and on laying the basis for sustainable growth. The strategy pursues private sector led growth and is
designed to assist the Government to develop an institutional and policy framework within key sectors that
supports this change in development strategy. Building on the ongoing economic adjustment program, IDA
is in a unique position to support the Government's efforts to restructure the transport sector, especially in
the port, airport and railway subsectors. The proposed credit broadens the past Bank/IDA sector strategy of
project specific lending to embrace sector wide reforms. The proposed project has been developed in close
coordination with IDB, which is expected to continue providing substantial financial support for
rehabilitating the road network, improving road management, enforcing axle load controls and ensuring
adequate cost recovery in the roads subsector.
15.   Actions Agreed: During neeotiations, agreement was reached: (a) that GOH would: (i) allocate
each year adequate funds for read maintenance, (ii) maintain its road network, and (iii) continue the staff
reduction of DGCCA, all according to the schedule set forth in the key project indicators; (b) that the GOH
would cause ENP to reduce its staff according to the schedule set forth in the key project indicators; (c) that
the GOH would prepare and furnish to IDA, not later than October 31, 1993 an operational and
maintenance plan for the airports and, subsequenty, provide in its annual budget, starting in 1994, funds for
DGCA to implement said plan until an entity with juridical personality and financial autonomy is established
to operate the airports; (d) that the GOH would cause FNH to reduce its operational deficit in accordance
to the schedule set forth in the key project indicators; (e) on the Transport Sector Policy Declaration and
Action Plans and, that it would be an eveat of default if the GOH takes any action or adopts any policy
which is not consistent with the policies outlined in the Transport Sector Policy Declaration; (f) on the
1993-1996 Transport Sector Investment Program (ISIP), and that any change to the 1993-1996 TSIP, which
would be reviewed during annu-l and mid-term reviews, would have to be satisfactory to IDA; (g) that no
investments with economic rates of return below 12% and/or that are not environmentally sound would be
included in the 1993-1996 TSIP, except for investments in access roads not exceeding 10% of the total
investment in access roads, provided they: (i) comply with the environmental criteria, (ii) do not exceed 14
km in length, and (iii) the total cost of the road does not exceed US$650 per capita of the population
served; (h) on the terms of reference for the technical assistance to support SECOPT's institutional
development and for the implementation of the Action Plans for the port and airport subsectors and the
establishment of the Bridge Management System; (i) that the consultants for the identification and
implementation phasea of the technical assistance to strengthen SECOPT and the Environmental Unit would
initiate work, respectively, not later than July 31, 1993 and December 15, 1993 and that the consultants for
the implementation of the port reforms and the Budget Management System would be hired prior to October
31, 1993; a) on the Project Coordinator functions and responsibilities; and (k) that GOH and IDA would
carry out jointly, by no later than June 30 of each year, an annual review, as well as a mid-term review, by
no later than June 30, 1995, of the progress made in achieving the project objectives and, if necessary,
prepare and execute, to the satisfaction of IDA, remedial plans of action agreed during the annual and mid-
term reviews. Conditions of effectiveness would be that: (a) SSPF has initiated its operations; (b) the
Environmental Unit has (i) started its operations within SSPF, and (ii) employed competent staff in adequate
numbers to carry out its operations; (c) the consultants for the technical assistance for the evaluation of the
economic and financial impact of different leasing/concessioning alternatives in the port subsector have been
appointed; and (d) the project Coordinating Unit has been staffed satisfactorily. Conditions of disbursement
of funds for civil works in the San Pedro Sula airport would be hiring the consultants for the technical
assistance to the airport subsector.



-5-
16.   Environmental Aspects: The project is rated B. The proposed credit would fince mostly
rehabilitation wc!ks that would help improve environmental conditions, by improving road drainage and
eliminating safety hazards. The works do not pose environmental risks and will be carried out on the basis
of contractual arrangements that appropriately address all environmental concerns. Furthermore, the
technical assistance component of the priject would help integrate environmental concerns into SECOPT's
investment decisions.
17.   Proiect Benefits: The project is expected to support the introduction of major policy and structural
reforms and help strengthening the sector 's institutions through the implementation of the various Action
Plans covering a wide range of policy and institutional improvements. By addressing sector specific issues
and overriding institutional weaknesses, the project would contribute to enhance Honduras comparative
advantages in international trade and substantially reduce transport related distortions in the economy.
Direct benefits of the project would be derived from: (a) increasing the quality and cost-effectiveness of
tuansport services through: (i) improving the efficiency and accountability in the road subsector; (ii) making
ports and airport services more responsive to user needs; and (iii) eliminating intermodal distortions by
phasing out railway services; (b) strengthening sector planning and policy formulation; and (c) improving
the sustainability of resource use through the development of a technical foundation for an environmentally
sound transport arrangement. The project's benefits would therefore go well beyond the returns on specific
individual investments.
18.   Risks: There are no i.portant technical risks or major environmental issues, as no projects with
potentially significant environmentl impact are being planned. Because of the project's policy emphasis,
there are risks related to the Government's commitment and ability to implement the needed institutional and
policy reforms. These are deemed acceptable, in view of Honduras' good performance under the ongoing
structural and sectoral adjustment operations. Up-front actions in support of these reforms, such as further
reduction of SECOPT's personnel, closure of the La Tela-Ceiba Railway line and appointment of
consultants to implement the sector's privatization/divestiture program should reduce these risks. In
addition, specific targets have been identified in the process of sector reform and their achievement will be
closely monitored. Nevertheless, there is a risk of funding shortages that cannot be discounted which could
slow the planned implementation of the investment program. The proposed annual reviews would ensure
that those projects with higher rates of return are given priority. The risk that SECOPT might have
insufficient capacity to implement a complex project involving substantial sector reforms was taken into
account in the design of an intensive supervision plan and the inclusion under the project of short-term
technical assistance in those areas, such as concession arrangements, which require special expertise.
19.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
