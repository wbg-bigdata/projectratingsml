Benefits            The PDPL will help the Government implement a medium-term reform
                    program aimed at promoting growth andjob creation through
                    improvements in the investment climate. The program also aims at
                    improving the governance and efficiency o f the public sector. The
                    reform programwould be consistent with the Government's aspiration
                    for eventual EUmembership

Risks               Capacity weakness could impede full implementation o f some proposed
                    reforms. The implementation o f an ambitious reform agenda sustained
                    over several years will be a challenge given the relatively weak
                    capacity o f some public sector institutions. However, the riski s
                    mitigated through the use o f two donor financed grants designed to
                    provide technical assistance inkey areas o f the reformprogram and
                    from Bank investment projects inhealth, social protection, judiciary,
                                           ...

                          and business environment. The risk i s further mitigated through close
                          cooperation with other donors workmg inthese reform areas.

                          There are also some political risks. While the threat ofrenewed ethnic
                          violence i s modest, some political polarization continues to constrain
                          constructive dialogue. Also, uncertainty continues over the status o f
                         neighboring Kosovo. The Government which took office at end-
                          August 2006 is a coalitionmade up of several parties. The domestic
                         political risks are mitigatedby the broad consensus across the political
                          and ethnic spectrum for integration with European structures. The
                          continuedimplementation o f economic reforms i s widely recognized as
                          an essential step on the path to EUmembership.

                         FYRMacedoniaalso faces macroeconomic risks. While FYR
                          Macedoniahas an impressive track record o f macroeconomic stability
                          and prudent macroeconomic policies which have now been bolstered by
                          a 3 year IMF Stand-By Arrangement, the recent reduction inexternal
                          current account imbalances to levels o f about 1percent o f GDP i s
                         underpinned by large private transfers. It i s not clear what i s behindthe
                         recent increase in such transfers and thus there i s some risk that they
                         could return to levels seen earlier inthis decade. Sustained exports
                          growth i s needed to reduce FYRMacedonia's vulnerability to such a
                         reduction inprivate transfers. The riskwould be mitigatedto the extent
                         that PDPL supportedreforms would stimulate growth inproductivity
                         over time and/or generate an increase in savings. Inaddition, to the
                         extent that the improved investment climate attracts higher flows o f
                          foreign direct investment, a higher current account deficit could be
                         financed without incurring additionalexternal debt.

           PROPOSED SECONDPROGRAMMATICDEVELOPMENTPOLICY LOAN
                  TO THE FORMERYUGOSLAV REPUBLICOF MACEDONIA



                                        I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This Program Document presents the second in a series o f three proposed Programmatic
Development Policy Loans (PDPLs) to the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) o f Macedonia to support
FYRMacedonia's structural reformprogram. The current loan is inthe amount o f 23.3 million (US$30
million equivalent) and i s expected to be followed by a third PDPL. Both the second and third PDPLs
would represent two thirds o f the policy lending envisaged in the CPS covering FY07-10, which i s
presented to the Board together with this program document. The PDPLs have been complemented by a
number o f investment loans inkey reform areas and analytical and advisory services.

2.      The objective o f the proposed PDPLs i s to promote economic growth and job creation in FYR
Macedonia through improving: (i) investment climate; and (ii)governance and efficiency o f the
                                      the
public sector. The PDPLs are designed to ensure consistency with the Government's aspiration o f
eventual EUaccession.

3.      This PDPL series follows up on the reforms initiated under the recent Public Sector Management
Adjustment Loan (PSMAL) andthe SecondFinancial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan (FESAL 2)
as well as the reforms identified inthe recent Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).

4.      The proposed reform program has been developed jointly with the Government, and it has been
coordinated closely with other development partners, in particular with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to ensure consistency with the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) approved onAugust 31,2005.


                                     11.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

                     A.        RECENT   MACROECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

5.      The civil conflict in 2001 disrupted a brief period o f positive economic momentum. Although
direct damage from the conflict was limited, investment activity markedly dropped, and output contracted
by 4.5 percent in2001. Defense-related expenditures pushedthe budget and current account deficits to 7
percent o f GDP. The effects o f the conflict were still clearly felt in2002 as investment and export growth
remained sluggishwhile budget and current account deficits remained high.

6.      Economic recovery gradually took hold in subsequent years as the budget deficit was quickly
eliminated in 2003 and structural reforms gradually resumed. The budget has remained roughly balanced
since 2003 while expenditures were reduced from 40 percent o f GDP in 2002 to about 35 percent o f GDP
in 2005. The tight fiscal policy contributed to a reduction in the current account balance. In2005 the
current account deficit fell to 1.4 percent o f GDP following a 4 percentage point o f GDP increase in
recorded private transfers to 17.7 percent o f GDP, the highest in Southeast Europe. Recorded transfers
increased by an additional one percentage point of GDP in 2006 and the current account moved to a
surplus of 0.4 percent o f GDP. The overall balance of payments has strengthened considerably as gross
reserves increased to about 4.5 months o f imports. In this environment, external and public debt ratios
have gradually declined to less than 40 percent o f GDP. Given the low external and internal imbalances,

the modest debt ratios, the highlevel o f reserves and the low level o f inflation, the macroeconomic policy
framework i s appropriate.

7.       While prudent macroeconomic policies have firmly established macroeconomic stability,
economic growth and formal sector job creation have been disappointing. Growth has averaged only 3.5
percent over the 2003-2006 period. Such growth rates place FYR Macedonia among the slowest growing
economies in ECA in this period. Also, the recovery remains narrowly based on a few key sectors and
the unemployment rate remains extremely high. While official data probably overstate unemployment, at
over 30 percent, FYR Macedonia's official unemployment rate i s the highest in the region. High and
persistent unemployment reflects low newjob creation inthe formal sector. Inpart this i s due to an overly
restrictive labor market and high payroll taxes. Inpart it i s due to the poor corporate governance which
emerged following privatization. An overly burdensome business regulatory environment also hampers
new business startups and job creation.          Collectively, these forces contribute not only to FYR
Macedonia's high unemployment rate but also encourage informality. Some estimates suggest that the
informal economy inFYRMacedonia i s well over 40 percent o frecordedGDP.

8.       Conversely, at about 20 percent o f GDP the investment rate in FYR Macedonia has lagged
significantly behind faster growing economies in the region. The flow o f FDI into FYR Macedonia has
also been disappointing over the past decade. Apart from the spike in FDI in 2000 and 2001 when the
largest bank and the telecom company were privatized and in 2006 when the electricity distribution
company was sold, FDI has averaged 1.5 percent o f GDP, one o f the lowest rates among transition
countries. Business climate surveys indicate that the most serious obstacles to private sector development
include: an inefficient and opaque judicial system, poor access to credit, heavy regulation (especially in
labor markets), political risks, corruption, and policy unpredictability.


                                         B.      POVERTYUPDATE

9.       Though FYR Macedonia's economy has grown moderately, poverty has not decreased since
2002. An estimated 21percent o f the population lives below the absolute poverty line indicatingthat they
are unable to meet their basic food and nonfood needs. Of these, about one third - or 7 percent o f the
population - has expenditures so low that they are unable to even acquire a minimumlevel o f calories.
However, the stagnation in the level o f poverty masks internal changes occurring in FYR Macedonia:
urban poverty in secondary towns has risen while rural poverty has fallen. This i s not surprising, since
these areas were largely dependent on employment by former SOEs which failed to restructure
successfully.

10.      Growth has generated few jobs - especially well paying formal sector jobs - which may explain
the poor performance o f the economy in reducing poverty and raising the income levels of the lowest
quintile. The welfare o f the poor in particular has been adversely impacted by the low level of job
creation leaving the poor's rate o f unemployment to stand at 50 percent compared to about 30 percent for
the non-poor. Moreover, thejobs poor people findtendto bepoorly paid, insecure and seasonaljobs. As a
result, poor people derive more o f their income from informal sector activity and social assistance
compared to the non-poor.

11.      The poverty profile indicates that the major determinants of income per capita are employment
status, household size, and the educational level o f the head o f household. Thus, people with limited
education obtain low paying jobs on which they usually have to support large families - including
economically inactive adults. In contrast to the difficulties o f the prime age population and their
dependents, poverty systematically declines with the age o f an individual and poverty among the elderly
i s lower than among other age groups, especially the young. This suggests that pensions play an important



                                                      2

role in mitigating old age poverty. Finally, a cross-cutting correlate o f poverty i s ethnicity with poverty
being higher among the Roma as well as ethnic Albanians.

 12.      Non-monetary dimensions o f poverty (in particular, poor housing conditions and low education)
affect another 30 percent o f the population. However, poverty in all dimensions for individuals i s rare
meaning that few persons suffer across all dimensions o f income and non-income poverty. Health
indicators, school enrollment rates and access to and reliability o f infrastructure services appear to be in
line with national income per capita. In particular, there have been large improvements in access to
secondary and tertiary education over the last 15 years. This beingsaid, access and quality o f the services
received by the poor or less affluent people lag considerably behindthe non-poor.

                   c.     MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                                               OUTLOOK

 13.      The Government has launched a comprehensive structural reformprogram which i s supportedby
 this proposed series o fPDPLs(see below). A comprehensivejudicial reformhas been launchedto firmly
 establish the rule o f law including creditor, contract and property rights. The labor law has been
 overhauled to introduce more flexibility into FYR Macedonian labor markets. Reforms aimed at
 increasing competition in the economy have been launched including those that facilitate efficient entry
 and exit o f firms as well as reduce the regulatory burden on ongoing business. Corporate and personal
 income tax rates have been reduced to among the lowest in the region.             Banking supervision and
 governance are being strengthened. Finally, sustained reforms to improve public sector governance
 continue to be carried out.




                                                      3

14.     Assuming continuing improvements in regional and domestic political stability, prudent
macroeconomic policies and strong and sustained reform implementation,                   the medium-term
macroeconomic outlook i s positive. Acceleration o f economic growth to levels recently achieved in
neighboring countries will depend on a positive private sector response to the emerging improvements in
the investment climate. A sustained increase inthe investment to GDP ratio and continued improvements
intotal factor productivitywouldunderpinagradual accelerationof economic growth.

15.     The Government's medium-term fiscal strategy aims at continuing the gradual decline inpublic
debt ratios and reducing the burden o f distortionary taxation. A reallocation o f composition o f public
expenditures favoring an expansion inpublic investment and efficiency gains could better support growth.

16.     The current account deficit i s projected to grow gradually to about 5 percent o f GDP as aggregate
demand increases. Prospects for export growth should slowly improve as structural reforms gradually
increase the competitiveness o f Macedonian firms. Planned privatizations would finance the increased
current account deficit in the next two years and a gradual increase in greenfield investment in the
medium-termwould help ensure that external debt remainmodest at around 40 percent of GDP.

17.     Gross external financing requirements are expected to remain modest at about $1 billion per year
over the medium-term. These would be requiredto finance current account deficit $350 to $400 million;
amortization payments o f a similar magnitude and a gradual increase in net foreign reserves. Net FDI
flows could cover roughly 40 percent of total financing needs. Debt ratios would remain modest and
stable. Debt sustainability is not likely to be a concern duringthis CPS period.



                                      III. THEGOVERNMENTPROGRAM

18.     The current FYR Macedonian Government was elected inJuly 2006 on a pro-reform agenda and
took office in August 2006. After four years in opposition, the current ruling party o f VMRO-DPMNE
(VMRO-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity) leads a coalition joined by the Democratic
Party of Albanians (DPA) as well as several other, smaller parties.

19.     The new Government's program is based on an election manifesto entitled "Rebirth in 100
Steps." The main goal o f the 100 steps i s to boost economic growth from its current level o f 4 percent to
6-8 percent in the next few years, thereby reducing the country's stubborn unemployment rate. The
program focuses on increasing investment, attracting higher levels o f foreign direct investment, fighting
corruption, and accelerating the country's EUand NATO accession.

20.     Key elements o f the programinclude:

         0     Fiscal policy reform: Reduction o f public expenditure by 2 percent o f GDP by 2010 while
               increasing the share o f investment, education, and health expenditures; radical reform for
               tax policy and administration; and overhaul o f customs.

               Infrastructure development: Expansion o f the road, electricity generation, and irrigation
               networks, including through concessions and public-private partnerships (PPPs); reduction
               o f telecommunication costs by increasing competition and stimulating internet penetration;
               and railway modernization.

         0     Overhaul o f market institutions: Simplifying company, property registration, and licensing
               requirements; increasing labor market flexibility; completing the land cadastre and real
               estate registry; granting greater rights to minority shareholders and creditors; facilitating


                                                      4

               execution and enforcement o f commercial contracts; simplifying bankruptcy procedures,
               and stimulating growth o fprivate credit bureaus.

               Improving governance: Raising FYR Macedonia's ranking in Transparency International's
               corruption perception index from the bottom third to the top half by 2010, by reducing
               discretionary rights o f public employees, adopting a legal framework for regulating conflict
               o f interest; strengthening transparency of public procurement, and establishing an agency
               for fightingorganized crime.

21.     Other areas include promotion o f foreign direct investment, agricultural development, and social
policy reforms.



                  IV.        BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENTSTRATEGY

                                           A.      LINKTOCPS

22.     The new CPS covering FY07-10 i s being presented to the Board together with this PDPL 2.
Overall, the CPS aims to accelerate FYR Macedonia's prospects for joining the European Union.
Proposed activities envisaged under this CPS are focused on two pillars: (i)fostering job creating
economic growth, and increasing living standards for all, and (ii) improving governance and transparency
inpublic sector delivery to support a market economy.      The second and thirdproposed PDPLs would be
a centerpiece o f the CPS.        To maximize the impact o f the PDPL series, the Bank has already
complemented it by investment loans and analytical and advisory services in the last CAS (see below).
The Healthproject, the Business Environmentproject, and the Legal and Judicial reform project have all
been designed and implemented inmany respects to support the PDPL-supported reform program. All of
these investment loans will have an implementation period which will carry them throughthe next CPS.


                B.       COLLABORATIONWITHTHEIMFAND OTHERDONORS

23.     The IMF program has a heavy structural component reinforcing a number o f reforms to be
supported under the proposed PDPL. The Bank and Fund teams have coordinated intensively to ensure
that: the two institutions give consistent policy advice and that areas o f overlap are limited to supporting
politically challenging and important reforms where the weight o f both institutions would be needed.
Coordination has included participation in each other's preparation missions and extensive intra-mission
meetings between the two teams. This cooperation builds on the close coordination under the current
PSMAL and former Stand-by Arrangement as well as the joint Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) report prepared in2003. Also, Bank staff contributed to the recent Ex Post Assessment.

24.     The PDPL team has worked closely with other donors active in FYR Macedonia. At the end o f
each mission the team summarized their findings at a donor coordination meeting. Team members also
visited the European Commission to exchange views on, and coordinate support to the reform agenda
ahead. The potential components o f the program have been proposed following close consultation with
donors involved in each o f these areas. The other active donors include the Dutch Government, the
European Agency for Reconstruction, the European Commission, and USAID. The last three have active
programs in FYR Macedonia including programs which support some o f the components o f the PDPL
program. The Dutch Government has supported two trust funds which provide important technical
assistance to a number o f institutions implementingthe PDPL program.

                             C.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

25.      The proposedPDPL is draws significantly form a series ofrecent economic and sector work. The
Country Economic Memorandum o f September 2003 focused on reforms needed to tackle unemployment
and stressed the need for the simultaneous implementation o f labor market reforms and reforms to
improve the investment climate. The FSAP focused on issues o f corporate and financial sector
governance, bank regulation and supervision, the legal and judicial framework. In 2003, the CFAA and
CPAR built on the analysis o f the 2000 PER which together formed the basis for PSMAL supported
reforms inpublic expenditure management including internal and external auditing, public procurement,
and budget formulation and execution.

26.      The Bank completed a Judicial Reform Assessment in June 2005. The work on this assessment
has come intime to inform the preparation o f the PDPL series. A ROSC on corporate governance carried
out in conjunction with a study on bank governance and a diagnostic on bank supervision carried out over
the summer o f 2005 yielded recommendations which were too late to be incorporated into the PDPL 1
matrix in detail. However, the team has subsequently incorporated such findings into the second and third
proposed PDPLs including the design o f a comprehensive bank supervisory development plan and a
number of improvements to the legal framework for corporate andbank governance.


                       V.      THE PROPOSEDPDPLREFORMPROGRAM

                               A.     OVERVIEW OF THE PDPL PROGRAM

27.      A number of factors have discouraged growth and job creation in FYR Macedonia. Critical
rigidities have included an inefficient and opaque judicial system that obstructs creditor, contract and
property rights and hampers the effectiveness o f key government agencies and regulatory bodies from
enforcing administrative sanctions such as fines, penalties and actions to revoke licenses. Inflexible
product and labor markets, highpayroll taxes, a burdensome regulatory environment, and poor corporate
and bank governance have impeded job and new business creation. A poorly functioning bankruptcy
regime has hindered firm exit and the secondary transformation o f ownership. These flaws in the
investment climate have been compounded by weak public sector governance which further undermines
investor sentiment.

28.      PDPL 1 (approved by the Board in October 2005) supported a number o f reforms to tackle this
interconnected agenda. Reforms supported by proposed PDPL 2 are well underway. A comprehensive
judicial reform has been launched to firmly establish and enforce the rule o f law including creditor,
contract and property rights. After engaging in a critical dialogue with social partners regarding an
overhaul o f the labor law and institutions to introduce more flexibility into FYR Macedonian labor
markets, a new Labor Law was enacted in July 2005. Reforms aimed at increasing competition in the
economy have been launched including those that reduce barriers to efficient entry and exit o f firms as
well as reduce the regulatory burden on ongoing business. Banlung supervision and governance are being
strengthened. Finally, reforms initiated under the PSMAC and PSMAL to build a meritocratic, rules-
based, transparent public sector through the continuation o f public administration reforms, health care
reforms, and decentralization as envisaged under the Ohrid agreement are continuing to be carried out.

29.      Sustained improvements in the investment climate would also require a reduction in perceived
political and geopoliticalrisk.The continued implementationo f the Ohrid Agreement, continuedprogress
toward eventual EU membership, and the successful implementation o f a final status arrangement in
neighboring Kosovo ultimately could prove as important to the investment climate in FYR Macedonia as
the proposed PDPL reformprogram.

30.     The objective o f the proposed PDPLs is to promote economic growth and formal sector job
creation in FYR Macedonia through improving: (i)             the investment climate, and (ii)governance and
efficiency o f the public sector. The structural and institutionalreforms under the proposed PDPL support
the Government's efforts to meet EUaccession requirements.

31.     Table 2 summarizes the reform areas and issues/actions covered under each pillar o f the PDPL
program. The attached Policy Matrix spells this out in more detail across the proposed 3 year program.
The investment climate pillar includes judicial reform, labor market reform, financial sector reform, and
business regulatory reform. The public sector governance pillar includes public administration reform,
health care reform, and decentralization

                           Box 1: GoodPracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle1: Reinforce Ownership
The PDPL program i s in line with both the previous Government's M a y 2005 reform agenda (and
December 2004 Judicial Reform Strategy) and the new Government's 100 steps program which lay out
FYR Macedonia's comprehensive economic policy. The Bank's analytic work (especially the Judicial
Reform Assessment, PEIR, CFAA, CPAR, and Corporate Governance ROSC) has contributed
substantially to the design o f the Government's program.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
accountabilityframework
The Government's PDPL series i s summarized in an agreed policy matrix which outlines actions over the
medium-termwith clear outcome goals. The agreed matrix has been modified slightly as the programhas
evolved. The Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs coordinates the program for the Government
and assigns specific responsibility for implementing and monitoring the program to various Government
agencies. The Government and the Bank have also closely coordinated the reform program with other
development partners (EAR, the European Commission, IMF, USAID, DFID, and the Dutch
Government), and a number o f them (EAR, IMF, USAID, and the Dutch Government) have financed
technical assistance to support the design and implementationo f the reforms.
Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
circumstances
The reform program i s based on and part o f Government's strategies and programs. It reflects the
intensive structural and institutional reforms needed across sectors for successful EU integration, and to
complete the country's transition to a well-functioning market economy. At the start o f each operation in
the series, the Cabinet has reviewed and endorsed the reform program at a formal Government session.
The PDPL program i s part o f a larger Government reform program aimed at EU integration which has
had broad support across the political spectrum. A number o f measures o f this broader program have
required two thirds majority support in Parliament such as the amendments to the Constitution and a
number o f organic laws essential for judicial reform.
Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
The PDPL program focuses on actions that are critical in terms o f achieving the set outcome goals. The
PDPL 1program consisted o f six prior actions and 18 benchmarks. The PDPL 2 program consists o f nine
prior actions and twenty benchmarks.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
financial support
Progress made with the implementation o f reforms and achievement o f outcome goals i s monitored on a
regular basis: a progress matrix, which outlines the status o f reforms and outcome indicators, i s updated
periodically and circulated among ministries and agencies. The proposed PDPL 2 lending volume has
been taken into account inthe 2007 budget and the Government's macroeconomic fi-amework.


32.      All nine PDPL 2 prior actions have been fully met (see Table 3). The prior action on easing the
burden o f regulation on business suffered delays under the last Government in the run up to the July
elections. The new Government i s firmly committed to these regulatory reforms which was a centerpiece
o f their "100 Steps" platform. The Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs i s directly responsible
for carrying out regulatory reforms. A "regulatory guillotine" system was launched with a Government
decree in November 2006 to reduce the burden o f existing regulations on businesses. Also, legislation
will be prepared and enacted by mid-2007 to introduce a Regulatory Impact Assessment to minimize the

                                            a
June 2005 baseline o f 6101 civil cases as measured by USAID Court Modernization Program's (CMP)
court performance measures for seven pilot courts.'

                  Progress towards EU assessment: November 2006 EU assessment o f the judicial sector
                  noted progress in amending the Constitution and adopting legislation to create the
                  framework for an independent and efficient judiciary. Successful implementation o f these
                  reforms remains a challenge and requires continuous and sustained efforts.

                  Progress towards civil case workload reduction: USAID's CMP performance measures
                  have shown a steady decrease in the civil case backlog in seven pilot courts. From June
                  2005 to June 2006, the backlog has decreased by 33 1 cases or 5.4%.

34.       The efficient, effective and fair enforcement o f creditor, contract and property rights are key
ingredients in building a business climate in FYR Macedonia that promotes investment and growth. The
EU has also made the proper, efficient functioning of independent judicial institutions a key criterion in
its assessment o f progress in FYR Macedonia's application for accession. The Government has taken a
number o f steps towards these goals.

35.       In December 2004, the Government adopted a comprehensive Strategy on the Reform of the
Judicial Sector (Reform Strategy) as a first step in modernizing FYR Macedonia's judicial institutions.
By mid-2005, the Government adopted a new Law on Civil Procedure, Law on Enforcement and Law on
General Administrative Procedures which aimed at removing procedural obstacles to reaching and
enforcingjudicial decisions and improving the fairness o f administrative decision making. Amendments
to the Constitution adopted in December 2005 were an essential element o f the Reform Strategy and laid
the groundwork for a dramatic restructuring o fthejudiciary and court system. Revisionofkey legislation
(and PDPL 2 prior actions) took place in May 2006 with the adoption of new Laws on Courts,
Administrative Disputes and Misdemeanors. each o f which addressed issues to improve the organization,
efficiency and effectiveness o f the court system.

36.       While each o f these laws will require a sustained effort and additional resources in order to be
fully implemented, their impact has been felt within the judicial system. Macedonian court procedures
have been shortened and judges have taken more control over the course o f trials under the new Law on
Civil Procedure. A system o f regulated and licensed enforcement agents outside o f the courts began
operating mid-2006 and has had the effect o f removing enforcement cases from the workload o f the
courts. However, the removal o f misdemeanor cases from the courts and administrative disputes from the
Supreme Court will require additional work to adjust sector-specific laws allowing for administrative
sanctions and to create o f the new Administrative Court (proposed triggers for PDPL 3).

civil cases or the rate at which courts hear and dispose o f civil cases (clearance rate) were considered. Based on the
variability o f the clearance rate indicator and the need to implement a number o f changes incourt processes and
procedures simultaneously, the World Bank has recommended that the judicial reform indicator be revised to focus
more clearly on the ability o f Macedonia's courts to reduce the backlog o f civil cases as measured inseven (7) pilot
courts monitored by CMP.

37.     FYRMacedonia's bankruptcyproceedings have been open to delay and abuse. Improvements are
included in a new Bankruptcy Law adopted in May 2006 but the major shortcoming has been the
inefficient implementation o f the law. Implementation has been hindered by a lack o f a professional
cadre o f bankruptcy trustees and a lack o f understanding o f the role and purpose o f bankruptcy in a
market economy, both within and outside thejudiciary.

38.      FYR Macedonia will need to provide sufficient financial and human resources if it is to ensure
effective institutional mechanisms for the supervision, coordination and implementation o f the reform
process. Both the Ministry o f Justice and Ministry o f Economy have key supervisory functions that are
necessary to oversee the effective implementation o f the recently passed laws. In addition, the Court
Administration Office (located in the Supreme Court) requires staff and other resources to conduct the
functional analysis o f court operations and provide analytical reports necessary for improved court
management and administration.

39.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: The PDPLs have supported the following actions
to support the judicial reform:

               Reduce backlog and delays in courtproceedings:

                o    Progress under PDPL I:A new Law on Civil Procedure was adopted to streamline
                     court procedures and provide judges with greater control over case processing.
                     Salaries for judges were also increased.

                o    Progress under PDPL 2: A new Law on Courts was adopted to create courts with
                     enhanced and specializedjurisdiction and specialized divisions within courts. Under
                     PDPL 3 implementation will be carried out with the creation and staffing o f
                     specialized divisions in first instance and enhanced jurisdiction courts. A new Law
                     on Misdemeanors has been adopted to provide administrative agencies with the
                     authority to issue misdemeanor sanctions without court action. Implementation will
                     require amendments to sector-specific laws and is expected to start under PDPL 3.

               Improve enforcement of courtjudgments:

                o    Progress under PDPL I: A Law on Enforcement was adopted to remove
                     enforcement cases from court jurisdiction and create professional, private
                     enforcement agents (bailiffs).

                o    Progress under PDPL 2: With support from USAID consultants, regulations, by-
                     laws and rules have been adopted to implement the Law on Enforcement.
                     Enforcement agents have been trained and licensed following passage o f competitive
                     examinations and began operations.       A self-regulating Chamber o f Enforcement
                     Agents has been created and a public awareness campaign has been undertaken.
                     Creation o f a supervisory body inthe Ministryo f Justice is expected under PDPL3.

               Improve regulatory and implementationframework for bankruptcy cases:

                o    Progress under PDPL I: A new Bankruptcy Law creating a trustee profession and
                     framework for close supervision by the Ministry o f Economy was drafted and
                     introducedto Parliament.




                                                      12

               o    Progress under PDPL 2: A new Bankruptcy Law was adopted but it differed Erom
                    the version reviewed and agreed with the Bank team by including a limit on the
                    number o f cases that can be assigned to a trustee. Parliament subsequently adopted
                     an amendment to the law that removes the case limit until June 30, 2007.
                     Implementing regulations and rulebooks have been reviewed by Bank team and
                     adopted by Ministry of Economy. During PDPL 3, new bankruptcy institutions
                     (supported by the LJIIS and Dutch Trust Fund) will be established, trustees will
                     undergo certification exams and the law will be amended to permanently remove the
                     case limit before July 2007.

              Increase speed, transparencyandfairness of administrative decisions:

               o     Progress under PDPL 1: A Law on General Administrative Procedure providing for
                     international standards o f transparency, fairness, and due process was adopted.

               o     Progress under PDPL 2: A new Law on Administrative Disputes adopted to move
                    jurisdiction over these cases from the Supreme Court to a new Administrative Court.
                     Staffing and operation o f the Administrative Court are expected under PDPL3.2

              Increase institutional capacity to implementand monitor reforms Strategy:

               o     Progress under PDPL I: While there was a delay the in permanently staffing the
                     Court Administrative Office (AO), USAID funds were used to provide consultant
                     staffing in the interim.       An Advisory Council was created to monitor the
                     implementation o f the new Civil Procedure Law.

               o     Progress under PDPL 2: The A0 i s now hiring full-time staff. The A0 has tested
                     and begun to use automated management and budgeting systems provided by
                     USAID. The Judicial Reform Council has issued bi-annual reports on status of
                     implementing the Reform Strategy. Monitoring, analytical and reporting capacities
                     are expected to strengthen in both the A0 and Judicial Reform Council under
                     PDPL3.

Labor Market Reform

40.     Outcome Goals:       A more conducive environment for creation of productive employment
opportunities and enhancement o f social dialogue. Short-term monitoring indicators include: the share o f
workforce with formal labor contracts, the share o f employed youth ages 15 to 24, the share o f workers
with part-time and fixed term contracts, and an increase inthe number o fcontributors to payroll taxes.

              Progress towards Goal: The employment rate (population aged 15-64) has risen from
              35.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 to 39.9 percent in the third quarter o f 2006.
              Employment o f youths ages 15 to 24 has already picked up considerably. Youth
              employment increased 4.0 percent (from 13.4 to 17.4 percent) and unemployment
              decreased 5.2 percent (from 59.8 to 54.6 percent) for the period between the second quarter
              of 2005 and the same period in2006. There was a 4.3 percent increase inthe number o fjob
              contracts concluded and an increase o f 28.6 percent for fixed-term contracts (January-
              November 2005 to the same period in 2006). The share o f fixed-term contracts rose from

                                                      13

               44 to 54 percent o f new employment contracts (again January-November 2005 to the same
               period in 2006). There has been an increase in the number o f legal entities that have been
               assigned a social insurance code, from 48,300 inJanuary 2006 to 52,600 inNovember 2006
               but the number o finsurees inthose entities has slightly declined for the same period.

41.      In July 2005, a new Labor Relations Law was enacted. Given FYR Macedonia's high
unemployment rate and large informal sector, this was one o f the most critical reforms in recent years.
This law balances the need to protect workers' rights with the need to increase flexibility in the labor
market, and establishes a more conducive environment for the creation o f productive employment
opportunities and enhancement o f social dialogue. The Government has also made other efforts to reform
the labor market. Other legislation was amended, to reinforce incentives for job seekers to re-enter the
labor market. In particular, in 2005, the maximum duration o f unemployment benefit payment was
reduced from 14 months to 12 months, and the maximum amount o f the benefit was reduced from 100
percent o f the average wage in the economy to 80 percent. The Law on Agencies for Temporary
Employment was adopted in 2006, with an objective to reduce informal employment in FYR Macedonia.
Thus far, eight such agencies for temporary employment have been set up. Also the Law on Employment
Incentives was adopted in2006 as a temporary active labor market scheme under which the Government,
through the employment agency, aims to improve the employability o f older workers by offering to pay
the pension and disability insurance contribution if the employer employs workers from a group of
eligible individuals.

42.      The recent modest improvement inthe employment rate (population aged 15-64) was mirrored in
a reduction o f the unemployment rate from 38.2 percent at end-2004 to 36.3 percent by the third quarter
of 2006. Despite these improvements, FYRMacedonia's employment rates remain among the lowest, and
its unemployment rates among the highest in Europe. The full impact o f the reforms will be felt over
time, especially as other improvements inthe investment climate emerge.

43.      Enforcement o f labor legislation and protection o f workers' rights are serious issues in FYR
Macedonia. In 2005, 6,500 cases were submitted to courts. Also, the Confederation o f Trade Unions
received about 13,000 complaints from the members on violations o f workers' rights.Most complaints are
related to wage arrears, unpaid annual leave, and unpaid social contributions. The work load o f various
institutions inresolution o f complaints on labor issues i s enormous, and legal costs for claimants are high.

44.      Alternate dispute resolution (particularly mediation), i s widely accepted internationally as an
important mechanism to resolve labor disputes. Mediation can prevent strikes and other industrial action,
and can also increasingly be used to resolve individual labor disputes, as the new labor dispensation in
FYRMacedonia matures.

45.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: The PDPLs have supported the following actions
to support the labor market reform:

          e    Enhance labor marketflexibility:

                 o   Progress under PDPL 1: A new Labor Relations Law was enacted which: (i)
                     promotes more diversified employment contracts, by ending restrictions on the use o f
                     fixed-term, temporary and part-time employment contracts while allowing for a
                     provision whereby the cumulative duration o f fixed-term contracts cannot exceed 4
                     years; (ii) pre-conditions for valid dismissal and limit severance pay to a
                                 relaxes
                     maximum o f 6 individual monthly salaries; (iii)increases the scope for overtime
                     work by increasing the yearly limit on overtime to 190 hours annually, with lower
                     levels for minors; (iv) redefines the collective bargaining framework. The new law



                                                      14

                      explicitly provides that membership in trade unions and employers' associations i s
                      strictly voluntary. Second, the law lays down rules for determining which parties may
                     represent employers and employees in negotiating collective agreements. Third, the
                      law makes collective agreements binding only for signatories and members o f
                      signatory associations and trade unions. This should exempt many smaller firms from
                     being bound by collective wage agreements made at an industry level. Finally,
                      collective agreements are limited to a fixedtwo-year term.

                o    Progress under PDPL 2: A legislative framework establishing alternative labor
                      dispute resolutions mechanisms is beingdrafted under PDPL 2 and will be adopted
                      under PDPL 3.

StrengtheningFinancialSector Regulation and Supervision

46.      Outcome Goals: Strengthened supervisory capacity o f the banking sector with migration toward
increased transparency, disclosure, and a risk based supervisory approach leading to improved
compliance with regulationand concrete corrective actions with specific banks.

               Progress towards Goal:The SDP i s being implemented with the help o f an IMF-sponsored
               resident advisor. Implementation i s on track. An update o f the 2003 Financial Sector
               Assessment Program (FSAP) i s tentatively scheduled for 2008. It would assess results o f
               the reforms supported by the PDPL, including compliance with Base1 Core Principles,
               Code on Transparency and Financial Policies, AML/CFT Principles and Core Principles for
               Systematically Important Payments Systems.

47.      Despite the sustained growth in financial intermediation experienced over the past years, the
Macedonian banking sector's ability to finance the development o f the enterprise sector remains well
below levels in EU countries. Credit to private sector was only 15.9 percent o f GDP in 2002. By 2006,
credit to the private sector reached 29.7 percent o f GDP. As a result o f the method privatization o f most
banks (many sold to the borrowers o f the banks), non-financial corporate entities represent about 40
percent o f the ownership structure o f banks. Weak bank governance hinders the evolution o f banking
competition. Thus, banks in FYR Macedonia have been slower in introducing new products than most
neighboring countries. Also, interest rate spreads have narrowedmore gradually than inmost countries in
the region, yet Macedonia's banks remain less profitable than most neighboring countries. The opaque
ownership structure o f some banks also poses a challenge to the supervisor. Inaddition, untilrecently, the
legislative framework did not provide the NBRM with the tools to require transparent ownership
structures and to apply rigorous fit and proper rules for board members and shareholders.

48.      The Authorities have recognized the needto improve the overall bank governance framework and
have decided to strengthen legislation and supervisory procedures accordingly. ith support from the
Bank, a Supervisory Development Plan (SDP) was designed and adopted by the NBRM to guide the
supervisor in the migration towards a more risk-based supervisory approach that would also hold bank
boards, controlling shareholders, and senior management increasingly responsible and accountable for the
safe and sound operation o f their banks.

49.      Inparallel, the NBRMlaw andthe bankinglaw have beenreviewedwiththe objective to expand,
inter alia, the supervisor's enforcement toolkit and to provide the NBRM with adequate and clear
authorities to address board members, take remedial actions based on breach o f duty or lack o f effective
internal control and monitoring mechanisms (including risk management systems), or enforce accurate
financial statement and corporate transparency.

to support the financial sector reform:

          0    Strengthenbankingsupervisionand regulation:

                 o    Progress under PDPL I: The Supervision Department o f the NBRM undertook a
                      diagnostic o f its supervisory process inparallel with an assessment of the governance
                      framework for banks. The recommendations from the diagnostic were embedded in
                      the Supervisory DevelopmentPlan (SDP) that was adopted by the NBRM. The SDP
                      maps a set o f reforms to help the supervisor migrate towards a more risk-based
                      supervisory approach to supervision and further strengthen bank governance. Other
                      recommendations o f the diagnostic have been integrated into draft revisions o f the
                      NBRMLaw andthe BankingLaw.

                      support the implementation o f this multi-year plan. Amendments to the NBRM law
                      were adopted in December 2006. The new Banking Law has been drafted and is
                      expected to be approved by the Parliament inMarch or April 2007. .

               TerrorismFinancing(CTF) requirements.

                 o    Progress under PDPL 2: To strengthen the AML/CFT regulatory framework for
                      banks, the NBRM completed a review o f the NBRM manual on assessing banks'
                      compliance with AML and CFT requirements. Following the review, in January
                      2006 the NBRM approved stronger AML/CFT policies and procedures.               Further
                      strengthening o f fit and proper standards will take place in mid-2007 following the
                      adoption o f the new Banking Law.

Improvingthe BusinessEnvironment

51.      Outcome Goals: Improved perception o f foreign and domestic investors o f the investment
climate and reduced administrative and regulatory barriers to investment (FIAS 2007 Administrative and
Regulatory Costs Survey, ARCS).

               Progress towards Goal: According to the 2007 Doing Business survey, business
               registration has been significantly simplified in FYR Macedonia. Time has been reduced
               from 48 days to 5 days; the cost decreased from 11.4 to 7.4 percent o f GDP per capita, and
               steps required was reduced from 13 to 7. Reduced administrative barriers have resulted in
               an increase o f newly registered businesses. In 2006, the total number o f newly created
               businesses was 50 percent higher than the total number o fbusiness registered at the court in
               2005.

52.      A transparent and predictable regulatory framework for business activity is necessary to promote
investment and growth. A good corporate governance environment, including increased transparency and
information disclosure, would also help to increase investor confidence and make it easier for companies
to raise capital and finance investment.

53.      The PDPL has supported implementation o f a "one-stop-shop" system that enables transparent
and fast registration for new businesses. To further facilitate business registration, the Government has


                                                       16

decided to reduce further in 2007 the time required to register a business from five to up to three days,
and to eliminate the requirement to deposit the minimum capital before registering a limited liability
company or a limited liabilities companies with one f ~ u n d e r . ~

54.       Inorder to systematically reduce administrative and regulatory barriers to investment, the PDPL
has supported the establishment o f an institutional framework at the centre o f the Government for
implementation o f regulatory reforms. To this end, the Sector for Economic Policies and Regulatory
Reforms (SER) has been establishedwithin the General Secretariat with a mandate to improve the quality
o f the stock and flow o f regulations affectingbusiness a c t i ~ i t y . ~

55.       Inthis framework, the Government has decided to launch a "regulatory guillotine" to streamline
all the "formalities and administrative hurdles'' and eliminate unnecessary requirements affecting legal
entities and individuals. The "guillotine" i s expected to be finalized in mid-2007. By then, a "Unique
National Electronic Registry o f Regulations" would be established to improve public access to such
information. It would also contain formalities and forms (including certificates, permits, statements and
other forms) for doing business inFYRMacedonia.

56.       In parallel, the Government has confirmed its commitment to introduce a regulatory impact
assessment system that would seek to ensure future new business regulations will be clear, transparent
and business-friendly. The RIA should be inplace by mid-2007.

57.       Inaneffortto further strengthen the corporategovernanceframework ofthe enterprise sector, the
Government i s committed to amend the Company Law in line with recommendations o f the 2005 Report
on Observance o f Standards and Code (ROSC) on Corporate Governance. These amendments will
strengthenthe overall framework for corporate governance. Legal entities will no longer be able to sit on
boards and stronger protection for shareholders line with ROSC recommendations. The ROSC
recommended strengtheningenforcement o f the new Securities Law. To that end, the Securities Exchange
Commission (SEC) has prepared a strategy aimed at strengthening its enforcement capacity.                     The
adoption o f the action plan for its implementationwill be supported by the PDPL 3.

58.       Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: The PDPLs have supported the following actions
to support the business environment reform:

           0     Strengthen the corporate governance of the enterprise sector.

                  o      Progress under PDPL I:The Government undertook an assessment (ROSC) o f the
                         corporate governance policy framework and enforcement and compliance practices
                         against OECD principles.      In parallel, an assessment of the bank governance
                         framework was carried out to identify policy actions to promote stronger bank
                         governance.   The ROSC (finalized in June 2005) provided recommendations to
                         further improve the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for corporate
                         governance. Recommendations arising from the banking governance assessment
                         were incorporated in the Supervisory Development Plan adopted by the NBRM
                         and/or are planned to be addressed through the new draft Banking Law.



 Businesses established inthese legal forms - which represent 92 percent o f the universe o f the businesses
operating inMacedonia - would be required to deposit the paid incapital (equivalent to Euro 5,000) by the end of
the first year of activity.

   o    Progress under PDPL 2: Most key ROSC recommendations have been implemented.
        The new Securities Law (approved in November 2005) strengthened the framework
        for information and ownership disclosure. The SEC has adopted all major by-laws
        for implementing the new legislative framework for securities. In consultation with
        relevant stakeholders, a new Corporate Governance Code has been prepared and
        adopted by the Macedonia Stock Exchange (MSE). The new SEO-NET system o f
        the MSE is fully operational and will contribute to improve disclosure dissemination.
        The SEC has prepared a comprehensive enforcement strategy and will adopt this
        strategy under PDPL 3. Also under PDPL 3, the Parliament will adopt amendments
        to the Company Law that would strengthen the overall legal framework for corporate
        governance, including the removal o f the possibility for legal entities to sit on boards
        and stronger protection for shareholders.

  Adopt a quality-oriented approach to regulatory reforms to improve the quality of
  existingand new regulations affectingbusinessactivity.

   o    Progress under PDPL 2: The SER was established in July 2005 within the General
        Secretariat. Its mandate i s to implement regulatory reforms on a systematic manner
        by improving the quality o f the stock and flow o f regulations affecting business
        activity. The SER has been provided with adequate budget, staff and office space.
        The Government has launched the "regulatory guillotine" process and will introduce
        a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) system by mid-2007 (PDPL 3). The
        "guillotine" process i s expected to be finalized inJune 2007 (PDPL 3).

  Implement a business-friendlysystemfor businessregistration.

   o    Progress under PDPL 2: The Business Registration Law became effective in
        October 2005.     About 15 laws and regulations were amended to allow for the

        -whichismanagedbytheCentralRegistry-becameoperationalonJanuary 1,2006.
        implementation o f the new business registration system. The "one-stop-shop" system

        Businesses can register in 30 offices o f the Central Registry throughout the country.
        The decision upon the business registration application must be done within 5 days
        from the day o f submission o f the registration form.

   o    Progress under PDPL 1:A new Audit Law was adopted.

   o    Progress under PDPL 2: The implementation o f the law is underway. The Institute
        o f Certified Auditors was established in May 2006 with a membership o f 120
        certified auditors. The Oversight Council was established in December 2005. The
        Council i s fully operational and is financed by the Budget. The Council endorsed the
        Charter, its Annual Program and Rules o f Procedures o f the Council, as well as
        comprehensive overviews o f responsibilities. The Council independently oversees the
        regulation of the auditing and accounting professions monitors the quality o f auditing

Public Administration Reform

          StrategicManagement

59.       Outcome Goals: These reforms will lead to more strategic budget allocations as well as better
disciplined budget planning and execution. More strategic budget allocations will be reflected in a
programmatic summary o f budget allocations showing increases (or, at least, no net reductions) in shares
o f total General Government budget allocated to policy priorities enunciated inthe Government Program,
as reflected in annual budget allocations and actual expenditures. Better disciplined budget planning and
execution will be reflected in: (i)modest differences between budget ceilings established in annual
Budget Circular (BC) and Budget User's (BU's) initial proposed budgets (BU-specific and average in
absolute value terms across BU's); and (ii) average deviations o f budget units' actual expenditures
                                               modest
from budgeted.

           e    Progress towards Goal:

                 o   Strategic prioritization: Sound progress i s being made towards achieving the goal o f
                      more strategic budget allocations. On the budget formulation side, the 2006 Budget
                      allocated 14.0% o f budgeted resources to priorities identified within the Government
                      Program, compared to 12.9% in the 2005 budget, although this share dropped to
                      10.0% in the 2007 Budget. The decline in the 2007 budget allocation to these
                      Government Program priorities reflects a period o f increased uncertainty regarding
                      Government priorities at the time o f the mid-2006 Parliamentary elections. On the
                      budget execution side, actual expenditures on Government Program priorities rose
                      from 5.6% o f total expenditures to 7.1% between 2005 and 2006.

                 o   Budget discipline: Budget discipline has been more variable. The average difference
                      between budget ceilings established inthe annual Budget Circular and Budget Users'
                      initial proposed budgets was 9.3% inthe 2007 Budget, down from 13.1% in2006 but
                      still much higher than the 3.4% in 2005. Preliminary-2006 data indicate actual
                      expenditures deviated from budgetedby around 7%, up from 2.5% in2005.

60.       The Government is continuing an ambitious public administration reform agenda addressing two
inter-linked public administration functions: strategic management and human resource management.
The strategic management reforms aim to (i) the capacity o f the Government to adjust policies
                                                   enhance
and broad programmatic expenditure patterns to better reflect its policy priorities, as reflected in the
Government Program, and (ii)       improve budget discipline so as to keep budgeted and actual expenditures
inline with Government's strategic priorities and ensure cost-effective use o fbudget resources byBudget
Users.

61.       The Government has improved its capacity to make difficult policy choices. Starting in 2003, it
implemented a series o f budget formulation process improvements. Three-year medium term fiscal
strategies were approved by the Government in 2004, 2005 and 2006. Hard budget ceilings for each o f
the first line budget entities were approved by the Government ineach o f the last three year and provided
to the entities as part o f their budget instructions. These were ultimately reflected in the budget approved
by Parliament. During the same period, the General Secretariat and Ministry of Finance prepared
strategic plans designed to ensure that their organizations would be equipped to deliver on the stronger

policy and fiscal management role envisioned by new legislation. A milestone was achieved with the
issuance, in September 2003, o f a Government Decision on the "Adoption o f the Methodology for
Strategic Planning and Preparation o f an Annual Work Program o f the Government o f the Republic o f
Macedonia."

62.     Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: The PDPLs have supported the following actions
to support the strategic management reform;

               Develop institutional arrangements and capacitiesthat permitmore effective strategic
               prioritization.

                 o    Progress under PDPL 1: All ministries except the Ministryo f Interior completedthis
                      full strategic planning process as part of the 2005 budget process (for the 2006
                      budget).

                 o    Progress under PDPL 2: All Ministries and Other State Administration Bodies
                      complied with this strategic planning process as part o f the 2006 budget process
                      (preparation o f the 2007 budget).      The legal framework governing the strategic
                      prioritization and budget processes i s appropriately designed to reinforce efforts to
                      ensure congruence between Government priorities and budget allocations; i.e. to
                      institutionalize the strategic prioritization process. Over the next two years, the
                      Government will continue implementation o f the strategic planning methodology.
                      This effort will continue to be closely linked with budget formulation process
                      improvements, as well as the Acts o f Systematization process, in order to ensure that
                      staff redeployment challenges are effectively addressed. The Government will also
                      improve monitoring o f the costs and impacts o f key programs and policies and ensure
                      that such information i s widely and publicly available, so as to foster debate about
                      their effectiveness,

         Human ResourceManagement

63.      Outcome Goals: Expected results include: (i)more decompressed civil service salary structure;
                                                         a
(ii)more effective civil service establishment control; (iii)increased attractiveness of civil service
employment; (iv) salary structures within the public administration that ensure a more consistent, yet
affordable, relationship between public and relevant private sector remuneration for given sets o f human
capital; (v) a fiscally sustainable wage bill; and (vi) improved tracking o f and reporting on the results of
human resource management reform efforts within FYR Macedonia's public administration (see Civil
Service Management monitoring matrix).

64.      Progress towards Goal: A more decompressed civil service salary structure was achieved in
March 2006. The compression ratio increased from 3.6 at end-2004 to 4.2 at end-2005. More effective
civil service establishment control was achieved by requiring clearance of the Civil Servants Agency
(CSA) for all new civil servant hires. Attractiveness o f civil service employment has improved, as
evidenced by an increase in the average number o f qualified applicants per advertised position, from 4.5
in2004 to 5.3 in2005. Initial steps of a broader public sector salary settingreformhave been undertaken.
An initial publidprivate sector salary survey was completed and will be undertaken regularly by the State
Statistics Office from 2008. A draft Law on Public Sector Salaries has been prepared and will be further
revised, with the help o f technical assistance and advice from the World Bank. A fiscally sustainable
wage bill has been achieved with expenditures on wages and salaries falling from 8.3% in 2004 to 8.0%
in2005 and 7.7% of GDP in2006. Fiscal sustainability will be one o fthe key principles o fthe newLaw




                                                      20

on public sector salaries. The establishment o f a database within the Ministry o f Finance has improvedthe
tracking o f results o f the HR reforms.

65.      The human resource management reforms aim to: (i)develop a professional, politically neutral
civil service, managed on the basis o f merit, rather than political loyalty, and capable o f attracting,
retaining and motivating required human capital skills; (ii)expand salary reforms beyond the civil
service, to encompass the rest o f FYR Macedonia's central public administration; and (iii)      ensure fiscal
sustainability o f the wage bill.

66.      The 2000 Law on Civil Servants (CSL) provided the legislative framework for a meritocratically
managed civil service system.      The Law provided for a uniform, rule-based and less compressed salary
structure; uniform definitions o f the types o f positions encompassed by the civil service; and the
establishment o f an independent agency, the Agency for Civil Servants (CSA), responsible for
establishing and enforcing civil service managementpolicies and procedures. Implementation o f the CSL
has proven challenging, but those challenges continue to be met. A new salary structure was phased in
over the April 2004 through March 2006 period. Despite the provisions o f the law and its subsidiary
legislation, sectoral ministries, inthe initial stages o f implementation o f the CSL, were able to bypass the
CSA, recruiting staff for civil service positions without competitive exams or review by the CSA. These
shortcomings have now been addressed, through a payroll based enforcement mechanism, which ensures
that civil service recruitmentprovisions are followed.

67.      The remaining challenges are to: (a) ensure continued implementation o f the CSL in a way that
meets its underlying objectives o f (i)  creating a depoliticized, meritocratically managed civil service, (ii)
attracting and retaining the human capital skills required by FYR Macedonia's civil service; (b)
continuously improving that legal framework, in light o f lessons learned from its implementation; while
(c) addressing pay reform issues within the 90% o f public employees who are not civil servants, in a way
that ensures, among other things, fiscal sustainability o f the public sector wage bill.

68.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: The PDPLs have supported the following actions
to support the humanresource management reform;

          0     Develop a professional,politically neutral civil service, managed on the basis of merit,
                rather than political loyalty.

                 o     Progress under PDPL 1: The civil service recruitment enforcement mechanism was
                       solidified by embedding it inthe new Organic Budget Law.

                 o     Progress under PDPL 2: The legal framework governing the civil service has been
                       reviewed to document lessons learned from its implementation and appropriate
                       revisions have been made in that legal framework. The Civil Service Agency has
                       reviewed CSL implementation, and prepared both a Strategic Plan and an
                       Operational Program consistent with that plan. Under PDPL 3, the plan will be
                       implementedand the CSL will be revised.


          0     Revise salary structures within FYR Macedonia's public administration to ensure
                consistently competitive yet fiscally sustainableremunerationacross required types of
                human capital.

                 o     Progress under PDPL I: The civil service salary decompression continued to be
                       implemented as planned.




                                                       21

                o     Progress under PDPL 2: The civil service salary decompression was implemented
                      as agreed and completed as o f 31 March 2006. The Government has taken a phased
                      approach to reforming the legal framework governing salaries within the broader
                      public administration (beyond the civil service). It i s buildingon experience in other
                      countries and i s collecting systematic data on remuneration relativities by type o f
                      skill set between positions within the public administration versus the relevant
                      domestic private sector in FYR Macedonia, which will be provided by the annual
                      salary survey. As a basis for this broader salary reform in the public sector an initial
                      survey o f public and private sector salaries was completed in June 2006. The State
                      Statistical Office has committed to repeating such a survey on a regular basis,
                      beginning in 2008 to generate regular, systematic data that can be employed to
                      inform deliberations about salary structures throughout FYR Macedonia's public
                      administration. A task force completed a review o f pay practices throughout FYR
                      Macedonia's public administration in January 2005, and a working group prepared
                      drafts of a Law on Public Wages in September 2004, followed by a revised version in
                      June 2006. The Government has also begun monitoring and publishing systematic
                      data on the extent to which core objectives o f the Government's human resource
                      management efforts are being achieved.         Monitoring was launched under earlier
                      Bank-financed operations (the Public Sector Management Adjustment CrediVLoan),
                      and continues under the PDPL.

HealthReform

69.      Outcome Goals: (i) new Health Insurance Fund (HIF) arrears to the five largest Health Care
                                No
Institutions (HCIs) in 2006, (ii) no new HIF arrears to suppliers in 2006, (iii) new health sector arrears
                                                                                 no
in 2007, (iv) access and quality of care improved in HCIs implementing budget ceilings (10 percent
decrease in hospital admission rate, 15 percent decline in average length o f hospital stay, 30 percent
reduction inthe number o f re-admissions for the same condition during a 3 month period, reduction inthe
number o f referrals to outpatient specialists and hospitals by lo%, improved patient satisfaction measured
by surveys).

70.      Progress towards Goals: Goals (i) (ii) already achieved in2006. Data for indicators (iii)
                                              and    were
and (iv) will be available in 2007. As o f July 31, 2006, total HIF and HCI arrears amounted to 4.0 billion
denars. This i s a 23 percent reduction over the arrears o f 5.1 billion denars in July 2005. However, while
there is no further build-upo f HIF arrears, H C Iarrears are continuing to increase.

71.      Improving the governance, transparency and management o f the health sector i s critical for
improving "value for money" in the health sector and strengthening the delivery o f health services. A
series o f analytical work in FYR Macedonia has identified the significant public financial management
risks associated with the Health Insurance Fund (HIF). For example, the 2004 World Bank CFAA
identified many weaknesses in the HIF's management o f health expenditures as contributing to the
chronic build-upo f arrears among health care institutions (HCIs) and suppliers. Almost 95 percent of all
funds in the health sector flow through the HIF amounting to 5.7 percent o f GDP. Opaque financial
management within HIF also leaves significant scope for corruption. In addition to the fiscal and
corruptionrisks posed by poor financial management within HIF, there are also concerns with the quality,
efficiency and accessibility o f health services in FYR Macedonia. Public opinion polls have consistently
rated health services as "poor or very poor." Household budget surveys show that out-of-pocket payments
for health care are large and pose financial access barriers for poor households. Informal payments are
rampant. Combined public and private health spending i s FYR Macedonia i s almost 9 percent o f GDP,
higherthan the new EUmember states (EU10) and slightly above the OECD average.




                                                      22

72.      The fiscal sustainability challenge in the health sector in FYR Macedonia has stemmed from a
number o f institutional weaknesses such as: (i)  the absence o f essential budgetary functions and spending
controls, resulting in the inability o f HIF to plan and subsequently control H C I budgets and the delivery
of health services; (ii)contracting practices that do not generate hard budget constraints for HCIs, and
provide no indication o f performance; (iii)a weak HIF governance framework marked by low
involvement and oversight by M O H and MOF; (iv) a benefits package that i s not evaluated on the basis
of effectiveness and the available resource envelope for the health sector; (v) mismatch between the
demand and supply o f health services; and (vi) weak capacity and accountability framework for health
care institutions (HCIs) that generates fiscal risk through the build-upo f HCI arrears and reduces quality
and efficiency o f health services.

73.      The objective o f the proposed PDPL i s to continue strengthening financial management o f the
HIF, focusing on preventing the chronic build-up o f arrears by HCIs and improving governance and
accountability o f HIF. The policy actions proposed in the PDPL largely reflect the HIF Action Plan, the
completion o f which and adoption by the Government was a core policy action under the PSMAL.

74.      One o f the key instruments for strengthening HIF governance and accountability is ensuring good
performance o f the HIF Board. Inthe past, the HIF Board played a passive role inmanaging the affairs of
HIF. The large number of doctors and health providers on the Board posed a significant conflict of
interest problem. Board members did not have financial management training.

75.      Reform Strategy to Reach the Outcome Goals: The PDPLs have supported the following actions
to support the health reform;

               StrengthenHIFGovernance andthe healthpolicy makingenvironment.

                o    Progress under PDPL I: Under PDPL 1, the Health Insurance Law was drafted and
                     submitted to Parliament. The draft focused on changes in the HIF Board. The
                     number of members was reduced from 13 to 7, the criteria and process for selecting
                     Board members were changed and made free o f political influence. To promote
                      strong oversight by the M O H and MOF, and until such time as the Board proved its
                      effectiveness, veto power was granted to M O H and MOF representatives on the
                     Board, and results o f HIF Board meetings were required to be publishedon the HIF
                     website, thereby increasing public scrutiny and accountability.

                 o   Progress under PDPL 2: Under PDPL 2, the changes to the HIL were adopted by
                     Parliament. The new HIF Board was appointed based on the new criteria within five
                     months o f adoption o f the HIL. The results o f HIF Board meetings are published on
                      the HIF website. Another governance and accountability risk related to HIFhas been
                      the weak health policy environment. Without a health sector policy to underpin the
                      activities o f HIF, expenditure management has been made more difficult. Critical
                      areas o f concern include: the scope o f the benefits package; policies on contracting
                     with HCIs and whether and under what conditions selective contracting is allowed;
                     policies on payment mechanisms for health providers; and enhancing accountability
                      and performance o f HCIs. The health sector strategy, based on wide stakeholder
                      consultation, i s now drafted and awaiting submission to Parliament. Data for the
                     medical map has been collected and a first draft i s expected by March 2007. Under
                     PDPL 3, the findings o f the medical map will be used to formulate a regional
                     rationalization plan. Special programs will be fully integrated into the HIF benefits
                     package and the public health program o f the MOH. Finally, a new Health Provider
                      Law will provide a legal framework governing HCIs.

         0    Building Capacity in Budget Planning and Control, Financial Management and
              ProcurementinHIF,MOH, andHCIs.

               o     Progress under PDPL I: Under PDPL 1, HCIs began monthly financial reporting to
                     HIF and HIF produced quarterly consolidated HCI financial reports that are posted
                     on the HIF website. This has contributed to improved HIF and H C I capacity in
                     financial reporting and monitoring and improved transparency o f HIF and H C I
                     operations.

               o     Progress under PDPL 2: Under PDPL 2, a plan for addressing HIF/HCI arrears was
                     developed and implementation begun. In 2006 hard budget ceilings were introduced
                     for all HCIs, internal audits were conducted o f the three largest HCIs and baseline
                     data for performance monitoring among pilot HCIs was collected. Financial reports
                     o f HIF and HCIs are regularly published on the HIF website and the S A 0 has
                     conducted external audits o f selected HCIs. Under PDPL 3, 10 percent o f pilot H C I
                     budgets will be linked to performance indicators in 2007 budget formulation.
                     Contracts will be completed with all HCIs on the basis o f hard budget ceilings and
                     key performance indicators. The Government will continue implementation o f the
                     plan to address validated HIF/HCI arrears and achieves agreed targets.              An
                     international tender will be completed for all drugs on the positive list and reference
                     prices will be introduced for drugs on the outpatient list.
Decentralization

76.     Outcome Goals: The revenue structure of local governments i s stable and transparent and
municipal liabilities are reduced to sustainable levels.

77.    Progress towards Goals: A stable and transparent revenue structure has been established and
implemented since July 2005. Municipal arrears have been reduced by about 50 percent between July
2005 and September 2006.

78.     The decentralization component o f the PDPL program supports the Government's efforts to
produce a stable, financially viable system o f local government consistent with its obligations under the
Ohrid agreement which ended the 2001 civil disturbances. The Ohrid Agreement called for a significant
decentralization o f central government powers to local governments. It specifically required Parliament to
adopt a new law on local self government `reinforcing the powers o f elected local officials and
substantially enlarging their competencies'; a new law on local finance to ensure a stable and transparent
source o f local revenues; and a new system o f territorial organization based on a new census. The
Government has now satisfied these requirements. In January 2002, Parliament approved a new Law on
Local Self-government. In July, 2004, it approved a new Law on Local Government Finance. The
enactment o f the Law on Territorial Reorganization (August 2004) was subsequently endorsed in a
national referendum inNovember 2004. Municipal elections were successfully completed inthe Spring of
2005 on the basis o f the new boundaries. The basic legal framework for decentralization i s now inplace.
Nevertheless, muchremains to be done interms o f implementation.

79.     Reform Strategy toReach the OutcomeGoals: The PDPLs have supported the following actions
to support the decentralization;

              Adopt a stable andtransparent mechanismfor financing municipalgovernment.




                                                      24

              o   Progress under PDPL 1: The new Law on Local Government Finance maintained
                  the three existing local taxes and allowed municipalities to retain three percent o f the
                  personal income taxes collected within their jurisdictions. It also called for a revenue
                  sharing system in which three percent o f Government VAT collections would be
                  distributed among municipalities on a formula basis. It did not, however, specify a
                  formula for distributing these funds. The first PDPL supported the adoption o f a
                  stable and transparent formula for distributingthe municipal share o f the VAT. The
                  Government adopted a formula based largely on population. In connection with
                  PDPL1, the Government adopted the formula for the period covering the first six
                  months o f the reform period (July-December 2005.).

              o   Progress under PDPL 2: The VAT formula was extended into budget year 2006.
                  PDPL 3 will support its extension into 2007.
            Reduce municipal arrears.

              o   Progress under PDPL 1: At the time the first PDPLwas appraised, the total stock o f
                  municipal arrears was estimated at 2.7 billion denars, or around one percent o f GDP.
                  Of this amount, roughly 60 percent consisted o f overdue payments to construction
                  companies for work performed in past years.         Another 37 percent consisted o f
                  interest on this debt. At the time, the Government was under considerable pressure to
                  assume some o f this debt. However, the Government recognized that such a move
                  would have created a dangerous precedent. The Ministry o f Finance concurred and
                  adopted a no-bailout policy. Municipalities were encouraged to reach individual debt
                  workout agreements with their respective creditors.

              o   Progress under PDPL 2: The policy is working as planned. Construction companies
                  have filed claims for overdue payments with the courts and debt negotiations are
                  proceeding. According to the latest M O F figures, the stock o f municipal arrears to
                  construction companies has declined by about fifty percent. PDPL2 and 3 both
                  support the continuation o f this policy.



       0    Adopt a plan for financing teachers' salaries.

              o   Actions to be taken under PDPL 3: Under Phase 2 o f the planned decentralization
                  strategy, municipalities would obtain direct responsibility for paying teachers'
                  salaries. The Law on Local Government Finance provides minimal guidance as to
                  how this will be accomplished. It specifies that costs will be financed through block
                  grants, distributed according to a formula devised by the Ministry o f Education
                  (MES) and guarantees only that the amount will be `not less than the same amount
                  used for the same purpose inthat area inthe previous year.' The Government has not
                  yet decided when and how--or          even if-it  will proceed with this aspect of
                  decentralization. Several more detailed proposals are being considered by the
                  Government. A financing plan for teachers' salaries will be adopted before
                  proceedingwith wage bill decentralization.

Decentralization Strategy

              o   Actions to be taken under PDPL 3: The Law on Local Government Finance also
                  specifies that education decentralization-along    with the decentralization o f other
                  functions--will be implemented on a case by case basis.         Any municipality that


                                                   25

                     `possesses an adequate staff capacity for financial management, shows good financial
                     results for at least 24 months, and has no arrears to suppliers or any other creditors
                     exceeding those ordinary terms o f payments' will be eligible. This raises two
                     concerns. First, it i s not clear that overall financial results are a good indicator o f a
                     municipality's ability to manage specific sectoral responsibilities.         Second, the
                     resulting two tier system--with some municipalities inPhase 1 and others inPhase 2-
                     may complicate efforts at sectoral reform. Inthe education sector, for example, Phase
                      1 municipalities would continue to have teachers' salaries paid on the basis o f
                     authorized positions by the MES, while Phase 2 municipalities would be allocated
                     salary funding on a capitation basis (under one version o f the proposed financing
                     formula). Under these conditions, municipalities facing declining enrollments might
                     prefer to remain in Phase 1 indefinitely. To address these concerns, PDPL3 the
                     Government will review the overall strategy for functional decentralization in Phase
                     2.
                             VI.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACTS

80.      Some o f the policy measures that would be supported by the PDPL could potentially have
distributional impacts. Labor market reform, in conjunction with other improvements in the investment
climate, should help alleviate poverty in the medium-term as employment in the formal sector improves.
As contract based labor participation increases and informal jobs are formalized, social protection
coverage should also increase. On the other hand, insiders would have lessjob security and would receive
lower redundancy payments. The second phase o f decentralization, expected to occur after the PDPL
program, poses risks for the equitable delivery o f social services if not well designed. Thus the PDPL
program includes measures to ensure that the design o f the second phase o f decentralization will
safeguard equal access to quality education, an adequate supply o f qualified teachers and non-teaching
staff for ethnic minorities, and appropriate language o f instruction. The Bank i s carrying out a
programmatic Poverty Assessment which will allow for a close monitoring o f the impact of PDPL
supportedreforms on poverty and may be supplementedby specific poverty and social impact analyses.


FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

81.        The Bank has extensive knowledge o f the country's Public Financial Management (PFM). The
latest Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was finalized in March 2004 while the
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was finalized in June 2002. The Government has
addressed a number o f major weaknesses identified inthose fiduciary assessments o f the public financial
management and procurement framework and i s continuing to progress on others. The Fiscal
Transparency Module5was completed inJune 2006.

82.      The CFAA reported that the Government had a well-functioning treasury operation, exercising
good control over the spending o f budget entities. The NBRM efficiently administered the Treasury
Single Account (TSA) on behalf o f the Government and had implementedcontrols over foreign currency
accounts o f donors and others. The budget formulation process had been steadily improving including the
introduction o f a multi year framework. The treasury accounting system i s capable o f producing accurate
and frequent in-year reports on central government budget outturns. The CFAA found that ex-ante
controls were generally well exercised in budget entities, applied by MOF officials in each budget unit.
The S A 0 performed audits but the Government did not respond thoroughly to the SAO's significant

                                                         26

recommendations. At the time o f the CFAA report, there was no internal audit function in the
government. Extrabudgetary Funds (EBFs) were outside o f the TSA and generally not well monitored and
the CFAA reported major deficiencies in financial controls in the Health Insurance Fund. Since then, the
government has made good progress on a number o f these issues identified inthe last CFAA.

83.     The EBFs and local governments have been integrated into the treasury single and their budgets
are now being tabled in Parliament together with the government's budget proposal. The introduction o f
program budgeting with the 2005 budget (together with a description o f programs in the budget
document) has provided much better transparency o f expenditure plans. Good improvements have been
implemented in budget execution by the government over the past four years. The capacity of ministries
to plan and to cost their budget proposals is still evolving, particularly in forecasting o f future
expenditures within the three-year expenditure framework and in entitlement programs. The M O F now
records and controls commitments.

84.     A Law on Internal Audit adopted in September 2004 required the establishment o f internal audit
units in all budget entities with expenditures exceeding 500 million denars. The smaller budget entities
are covered by the internal audit unit in MOF. In 2006 15 internal audit units were established, and an
aggressive implementation timetable was approved for the remaining 17 budget entities and the local
governments. An intensive learning and certification program has been undertaken, supported by the
PSMAL. A project financed by EARhas also assisted with the ambitious roll-out o f the internal audit and
enhancing the use o f international standards in the audit work. EAR i s also assisting with the
improvement o f the internal financial control through the establishment o f a Public Internal Financial
Control (PIFC) framework. Further work i s ongoing to strengthen the internal financial controls and the
internal audit based on a government approved actionplan.

85.     Good progress was made by the State Audit Office (SAO) and the government. The S A 0 is
independent from the executive branch and its mandate covers all public sector activities. The
government increased resources to the SAO, amended its legislation to: require an annual audit opinion
on the government's annual financial statements; require the auditor to summarize the audit findings for
the year into common themes on high-riskareas for the government to address; adopt a risk-based audit
approach to the annual audit planning process; report on the government's progress in implementing
current and all outstanding audit recommendations; perform performance-based audits; and implement
international auditing standards covering all aspects o f its work. The S A 0 has implemented the changes
requiredby law; in2005, 10performance audits were undertaken. Twinningarrangements with the Dutch
Court o f Accounts was established and additional audit process reforms and auditor training being
pursued.Donor assistance in capacity development was provided at various times by the DTF, the EU's
EARand the Bank.

86.     The last CPAR noted several deficiencies in the Law on Public Procurement (LPP). Short term
recommendations included: issuingcomprehensive set o f implementing regulations; ensuring widespread
dissemination o f Law on Public Procurement and its implementing regulations; and upgrading the public
procurement division. Long term recommendations included enacting a new LPP with supporting
implementing regulations and standard bidding documents. Several improvements have subsequently
taken place in procurement. A new LPP in line with international standards and best practices was
enacted in March 2004 as part o f the PSMAL program. Government adopted comprehensive
implementing regulations, promulgated standard procurement documents and forms o f contract, and
established a state administrative body for public procurement within the Ministry o f Finance made fully
operational with staff, resources and terms o f reference. The Public Procurement Bureau i s workmg with
an EC financed consultant on MOF website for the Register o f Performed Public Procurement. All these
PSMAL-supportedreforms were undertaken by May 2005. The law was subsequently amended in 2005
to introduce electronic procurement, a one-stop-shop system for central registration o f tenderers'


                                                     27

qualifications, and the requirement for publishingall contract notices on the Public Procurement Bureau's
website.

87.      However further improvements in several areas o f the PFM in FYR Macedonia could be
necessary including: (i) strengthenedreporting on state-owned enterprises; (ii) improvement inthe
                                                                                   further
recently-established internal audit units and improvement o f the internal financial control through the
establishment o f a Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC) framework; and (iii)    increased funding for the
activities as well as improved follow-up on the recommendations o f the state audit office. An update o f
the country fiduciary assessment i s planned for FY2007.

88.      The fight against corruption i s an important feature o f the new government's program for the
period 2006 to 2010. Institution building and improvements o f standards in the areas o f the judiciary,
police, health, and customs i s targeted as well as strengthening o f controls and punishments for those who
do not respect laws and regulations. The areas mentioned are also supported by the Bank, for example
through its support to the judiciary, as well through support from EAR and other donors. Even if more
transparency i s introduced and civil society engaged in this fight as planned by the Government the level
of corruption will remain a huge challenge. The ongoing improvements in the areas o f public
procurement, internal audit, and strengthening o f the role o f the S A 0 contribute to the fight against
corruption.

89.      The IMF completed an update o f the safeguards assessment in February 2006. The previous
assessment was completed in April 2003. The update found that the NBRMhad taken steps to strengthen
its safeguards framework, and recommendations from the earlier assessment had been implemented.
Notwithstanding this progress, the report made recommendations in the reporting and audit areas,
including: (i)review by the NBRM internal audit function o f processes for compiling monetary data
reported to the IMF under the program; and (ii)    completion o f annual external audits on a timely basis as
prescribed by the central bank law. The NBRM has started to conduct internal audit reviews on the
processes for compiling monetary data reportedto the IMF.


DISBURSEMENTANDAUDITING

90.      The proposed Loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
loans. The untied budget support will be disbursed in compliance with the agreed prior actions and will
not be tied to specific purchases. N o procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval o f the
Loan and notification by the Bank o f Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a withdrawal
application. At the request o f the Government, the Bank will disburse the Loan, less the amount of the
front-end fee, and the net proceeds of the Loan will be deposited in the Treasury's Euro account in the
NBRM,this account being available for budget financing. The Borrower shall ensure that upondeposit of
the net proceeds o f the Loan into said account, an equivalent amount will be credited in the Borrower's
budget management system, ina manner acceptable to the Bank. The Borrower will report to the Bank on
the amounts deposited inthe foreign currency account and credited to the budget management system. If,
after the proceeds are deposited in the NBRM account, the proceeds o f the Loan are used for ineligible
purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to promptly, upon notice
from the Bank, refund an amount equal to the amount of said payment to the Bank. Amounts refunded to
the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration o f the Loan will be the responsibility
o f the MOF.

91.      The administration and accounting o f the loan will be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
Finance. The standard country rules will be followed by treasury for administration and accounting. The
MOF will maintain accounts and records, showingthat disbursements were inaccordance with provisions



                                                      28

o f the Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be maintained in a form acceptable to the Bank.
The Ministry o f Finance will provide the Bank within 30 days with a confirmation letter stating that the
DPL funds have been received and deposited into the deposit account designatedby the borrower.

92.       Considering the Bank's knowledge o f the public finance management systems, the ongoing
improvements o f these systems and considering the assessment o f the NBRMmade by IMF, no audit will
be necessary o f the deposit account.


ENVIRONMENTALASPECTS

93.       The PDPL team has reviewed possible effects o f the PDPL-supported policies on the
environment, natural resources, and forests. The PDPL supports ongoing efforts to reduce the regulatory
and administrative costs o f business regulation and promote private sector development.                   The
Government's reforms would remove regulatory and administrative barriers through the adoption o f
methodologies such as the `regulatory guillotine' and the `regulatory impact assessment.' These reforms
require a comprehensive review o f business regulations to help identify those regulations that are
unnecessary or without sufficient legal basis.         This exercise would also identify those regulations
affecting business entry and operations that do not offer sufficient safeguards with respect to safety,
health, environment, consumers and the public interest. A rigorous implementation o f these reforms
would help ensure that environmental matters are taken into account in the preparation o f business
regulations. The Business Environment Reform and Institutional Reformproject (approved inJune 2005)
will provide the assistance necessary to design and implement these regulatory reforms.


LESSONSLEARNEDFROMPRIOROPERATIONS

94.       The preparation o f the proposed PDPL has benefited from important lessons learned from
previous policy based lending. This i s especially true o f the PSMAL (see paragraph 19 above) which was
under implementation during the initial preparation o f PDPL 1. One key lesson from the PSMAL (as
well as the PSMAC) i s that complex institutional changes involve an iterative process o f "learning while
doing" and take time to gain momentum. Continued follow through i s essential to ensure results. Inthis
regard, a series o f single-tranche operations designed within a multi-year program i s likely to be more
appropriate than a traditional multi-tranche operation due to the flexibility inherent in this new
instrument. With follow through inmind, the proposed PDPLprograminpart reflects a continuation o f a
number o f institutional reforms initiated under PSMAL. The civil service reforms as outlined in the
PDPL policy matrix most directly incorporate this phased nature o f institutional reform. The PDPL team
has also worked closely with several government bodies in establishing institutional arrangements and
capacities to monitor a rich array o f indicators designed to measure the impact o f the public expenditure
and human resource management reforms begun under the PSMAL supported program. The evaluation
o f these regular indicators will help determine to what extent and where alterations o f the reform program
would be advisable. Reforms in the health sector proposed to be supported by the PDPLs grew directly
out of a comprehensive external audit and action plan which were key features o f the PSMAL program.
Finally, as important as it i s to continue the public sector reforms launched under PSMAL and PSMAC, it
i s also clear that reforms to improve the investment climate are necessary to foster higher levels o f growth
and productivity inFYRMacedonia.

95.       Another lesson learned i s that reforms supported by policy based lending tend to be more
effectively implemented when supported by critical technical assistance and investment projects
supported by the Bank and other donors. The PDPL program i s thus being supported not only by the
PDPL itself but also by the Bank's health, education, judicial reform, and business environment projects.

reform component o f the PDPL program. Technical assistance provided by the EUDelegation, EAR, the
Dutch, UK-DFID,and USAID also supports a number o freforms inthe PDPLprogram.


MONITORINGAND EVALUATION

96.     The Government recognizes the importance o f monitoring and evaluation in ensuring the
successful implementation o f the PDPL supported program. The reform program sets out qualitative and
quantitative benchmarks and targets embedded in the PDPL Policy Matrix. Some o f these indicators are
produced in regular surveys conducted by the Bank and other international organizations, while other
indicators are regularly produced by the Government. The Government recognizes that the proposed
PDPL 2 and PDPL 3 are subject to the approval o f the Bank's Board o f Executive Directors and that
adequate progress in reform implementation would be required. The Bank and the Government, in
consultation with other stakeholders, civil society, and international donors, have utilized the flexibility
inherent in the PDPL instrument during the preparation o f the proposed PDPL 2 and made a few
adjustments to the indicative policy actions stipulated in the Policy Matrix o f PDPL 1. Such changes
have focused on effective implementationwithout compromisingprogram outcomes.


RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION

97.     Implementation risks are moderate. The institutional changes that the PDPL program seeks to
overcome are a medium-term endeavor. The current capacity o f some public sector institutions to
implement an ambitious reform agenda, while much improved over the past few years, remains relatively
weak. However, the risk i s mitigated through the use o f two donor financed grants designed to provide
technical assistance in key areas o f the reform program and from Bank investment projects in health,
social protection, judiciary, and business environment.      The risk i s further mitigated through close
cooperation with other donors working inthese reform areas.

98.     There are also some political risks. While the threat o f renewed ethnic violence is modest, some
political polarization continues to constrain constructive dialogue. Also, uncertainty continues over the
status o f neighboring Kosovo. The Government which took office at end-August 2006 i s a coalition
made up o f several parties. The domestic political risks are mitigated by the broad consensus across the
political and ethnic spectrum for integration with European structures. The continued implementation of
economic reforms i s widely recognized as an essential step on the path to EUmembership.

99.     FYRMacedonia also faces macroeconomic risks. While FYRMacedoniahas an impressive track
record o f macroeconomic stability and prudent macroeconomic policies which have now been bolstered
by a 3 year IMF Stand-By Arrangement, the recent reduction in external current account imbalances to
levels o f about 1percent o f GDP i s underpinned by large private transfers which are not well understood.
Sustained exports growth i s needed to reduce FYR Macedonia's vulnerability to a reduction in private
transfers. The risk would be mitigated to the extent that PDPL supported reforms would stimulate growth
in productivity over time and/or generate an increase in savings. In addition, to the extent that the
improved investment climate attracts higher flows o f foreign direct investment, a higher current account
deficit could be financed without incurring additional external debt.

                               RE: LETTEROFDEVELOPMENTPOLICY


 Dear Mr. Wolfowitz:

 1.We arc writing to request on behalf o f the Government o f the Republic of Macedonia, a Second
 Programmatic Development Policy Loan(PDPL) of (33.3 million (USS30 million equivalent) to support
 our economic reform program. This Letter of Development Policy sets out the key actions that the
 Government is committed to undertake over the medium-term to enhance economic growth in
 Macedonia a d make progress tow-ads our goal of EU accession. Attached to this Letter is also a Policy
 Matris that summarizes the contents of this Letter.

 ?.The overakhing ol$ective of our reform progain is to Promote economic growth and job creation in
 Macedonia through improving: (i) the invesbnent climate, and (ii)governance and efficiency o f the
 public sector. We will briefly describe OUT reform plans in both of these areas.

 ImprovingInvestmentClimate:
 3.Despite a number o f reforms carried out over the past decade, including trade liberalization, fmancjal
 sector reform and privati-ration, and enterprise resQucturing and privatization, Macedonia's invesbnent
 climate has not yet created fully satisfactory enabling environment for rapid growth. The raform strategy
we hope the PDPL would support includes key r e f o m in the judiciary, labor markets, financial sector
and business cnvironment.

4.Jirdiciul Reform: We are committedto continuing to implementthe comprehensive reform in              area
as jet out in The Snaregy on the Reform of ihe Judicial Seclor (Keform Strategy] in December 2004. We
consider the development, adoption, initial implementation of this Reform Strategy as critical f i s t steps
in [he process of modernizing Macedonia's judicial institutions. &Iimportant subset of our Reform
Strategy seeks to ensure the efficient: effective and fair enforcement of creditor, contract and property
rights. W e recognize that such rights are key ingredients in a business climate b a t promotes investment
and gowlh. Onc important component of the Reform Sbategy aims to reduce the backlog and delays
court proceedings. We have followed transparent and consultative le@slative and regulatou drafting
procedures as we developcd critical pieces of the legal fmework.            following amendments to the
Constitution in December 2005, the Parliament adopted in May 2006 a group of new organic laws
including [he Law on Courts and the Law             OD   Misdemeanors.     We will ensure the effective
implementation o f each o f these important laws to increase the independence of the judiciary and the
pace and efficiency o f the court system. We will adopt Court Rules ofProcedure based on the opinion of
the Suprenie Court and Judicial Council o f the Republic of Macedonia. The Judicial Council of the
Republic of Macedonia, Ministryof Justice snd Supreme Court will implement plans for the creation and
staffing of specialized divisions hi fist instance and enhancedjurisdiction courts, We will adopt new

     ellforcement agents. We will alsn improve the supervisory itnd ovusight. capiicity in the Ministry of
     Justice. conduct a public awareness campaign and user survcys which will allow us to follow up with an
     action planfor continued improvements in thc dorcemmt o f court judgments.

6.   We idopted     ii new BCmkruptcyLaw and implementing regulations which aim to ensure the ilisritudcrila~
     development o f the hankmptcy tmstee profession. We intend to amend the law before JLUC 2007 to
     permanently reinove a provision that limits trustees to three cases at any one time. We will establisl: a
     supervision unit for bankruptcy iinplementation in the Ministry of E,conomy. A Truster Chamber will be
     established and its operating dociunents, including ethical standards and discipline procedures, will be
     set out according to the framework establishcd in the Lmv and regulations. Existing trustees will be re-
     certified under the new procedures or de-licensed and removed from the register

7.   Tn 1005. w e adopted a modem General Administrativc Procedure Law. The constihltional mnendments
     adoptedinDeceinbcr 9005 provide the opportunity not to file an appeal from an adminislra~i\~e       decision
     with a Second lnstaiice Cornmission, and instead provide for direct coun protection. Following this
     consTitutional chnge we enacted a new Law on Adminisrratjve Disputes.                   The constitutiunaf
     mc`ndmmls aIso pcmlit administrative agencies to enforcc admkistrativc sanctions without seeking a
    judicial order. We will emure the effective iinplementation o f these laws by establishing and fully
     staffing the Achinistrative COWwhich will operateunder its new rules o fprocedurc.

8.  Finally, w e hwvc staffed key bodies such as the Court Administrative Oftice (AO), in agreement with the
    Judiciary. 10 mohiror implementation of rfic Reform Stra.T.cgy. Thc AO provides automated illputs for
    annual court budgcts and genzriites analytical reports for improved courl n~7mgment.The A 0 will

12. WCiue commiltzd to the adoption o f a quality-oriented approach to re,oulatory reforms to improving thc
     quality of existing mindnew repulations which affect thc business seclor. lnJuly 2005, we establishcd the
     Sector f o r Economic Policics and Regulatory Refonns (SER) within the tieneral Sccret'xiat. Its mandate
     IS to  implement regulatory rcfciiins on a systematic manner by improving thc quality o f the stocli aid
     flow o f regulalioiis a f k r i n g business activity. We liave provided the SGR with adequate budget arid
     slaff.    We have launched the "regulatoiy guillotine" process and arc committed to introduce the
     regulatory impact assessment (RIA) system through the appropriate mechmisrn. Our regulatory
     guillotire was begun with a Government Decision which spells out: (i) envisaged for the pmgani
                                                                                 steps
     implementation: [ii)responsibilities of each government entity involved in the process; and (iii)             the
     deadlines within which each step is to be completed. All working groups established will-Lin each
     ministry and orher state adnlinistration Lntities have submitteda list of the laws and bylaws dealing with
     ~ormalities,including business related mes, to thc Committee for Regulatory Reforms. The "guillotine"
     process will be finalized innid-2007. A "Unique National Electronic Registry o f Regulations" would he
     established subsequ+nrly to facilitate public ac5ess to i d o m t i o n on formalities and F o m (including
     ctrrificateY, pem't.s. statements iuid other forms). Wc will adopt thL:appropriate r n c c h i s n i estsblishinp
     [hi: k3.A by mid-2007.

13. We also recognize that. Lhe process OFregistering new hushcss needs to be faster and less burdmsomr.
    In this regard. wc adopted an adininistrativa and stre'dined business registration systbm with no court
    involvement. The Law establishing thc "One-Stop-Shop Systcm" becune effective in October 2005.
    About 15 laws and regulations werc mended 10 allow for the implementation of the new busiiiess
    registration system.      The "one-stop-shop system" implemented by the Central Rcgistiy becami:
    operational inJanuary 2006. Businesses can register in 30 offices oFthe Central Registry throughour the
    country. The decision upon the business registration application is made within 5 days fi.oin the day of
    submission of the registralionform, and we plan to reduce it further to three &ys.

14. Finally, wc adopted     3 new Audit Law       in September 2005. The law is beingfully implemented. 'lhe
    lnstitute o f Certified Auditors was cstablished inMay 7006 with a membership of 120 cmtlfied auditors.
    T i e Ovmsight Council was established in December 1005. The Council i s fully operalioiial aid is
    financed by the Budget. T l i e Council endorscd the Charter. its Annual Programand Rules of Procedures

StrengtheningPubIic Sector Governance:
15. We rccognizc that good public sector povanuice is a pre-requisite for private sector        gobflvth.   Wt: h v r
    irr.plemented many reforms in recent yurs in public adnunistration and health cuc                   which w H C
   supported by thc Public Sector Managanent Adjustment Credit (PS.NAC) and thc Public Secliir
   Manayanent Adjuslment Loan (PSMAL). We improved ow capacity to make tough policy choms.
   We have implmicnted a series o f budget formula:ion process improvements. Three-ycar medium term
   fiscal strategies were approvcd by the Govermnent in 2004. 2005 and 2006. Hard budget ceilirigs for
   each of the first line budget entities were approved by the Government in 2004, 2005 and 1006. mnd
   provided to the entities 3s part o f their budget instructions. These were ultimately reflected in [he 2005.

     Health Sector and havc hunched a decrntralization process. Our refoim efforts inthcse ueas continuc ;bS
      outlined below.

 16. Public Adnrinistrotion Rifor/n: Wc havc developed institutional arrangements and administrative
     capacities desigiied to eiisure more effective strategic pnoritization, cunsistrnt with the mcthociology for
     strategic planning and prepantion o f M m i u a l work progrm, o f the Goveinment of :hc Republic nt
     IMacedonia issued by the Government in September 2003. under [he instructions for the lnanncr. conimt
     and form for preparing slratcgic plans in ministries and other state adnlinislration bodies issued hy the
     Government in May 2005. A411 ministries and other state administration bodics comp!ied with this
     srriitcgic planningprocess as part ofthe 2006 budget procciss (prqxaition ofthe 2007 budget). Thc Icy1
     hmework governing [he strategic pnoritization and budget processes is scmiblv designed to reinforce
     efforts to ensue coiikTucnoc bctwcen Government priorities and budget ailocarions                   I.e., to
     institutionalize the strategic prioritization process. This legal framework defines thc proccss of strategic
     prioritrzation aid strzttegic planning as a continuow process, and we will fiirtlier devclop [he activiries
     while implementing the strategic planning methodology. This clfort will contiiiue to lx close1y 1inked
     with the hudgct. fornulation process improvements, as well as h c ACTS Systeinatization proccss. in

     order to eiisurc that s t d l rcdeployrnennt challenges u e effectively addrcssrd We will also improvc
     monitoring o f the costs and impacts of key programs and policies and ensure that such information        IS
     widely and publicly available, so as l o foster debate about their effectiveness.

17. In human rcsource management we are also continuing B numbu o f reforms initially supp~flcdby
    PSMAUL. We havc strLmgthened the legal framework establishing a mechanism for ccinlmll!ng
    compliance with both the recruilmcnt and selection requirements and thc positinn classification
    requirements, by including this provision in the new Organic Budget Law. which wzs enacted in July
    2005. We have also introduced a liinitcd numbcr of specific .amendments to the Civil Service Law
    (CSL), designed to improve our cupacitics to attract, retaiii and motivate qualified civil servants. Wc
.   have continued to review      OUT  experience in implcmcnting this law cmd continue to document lessons
    learned. The Civil Service Agency. has reviewrd CSL ,implementation, and prqnred both a Strategic
    Plan and an Operational Program consistect with that plan. Under PDPL 3 the plan will be irriplementrd          *

    a d the CSL will bc rcviscd. as necessary.

IS. We have completed the decomprusion o f civil service salaries as agreed under the P S M a progam.
    Wc w i l l also adjust the legal iramework governing the sctting of public sector salaries. with the aim of
    establishing a consistent set of principles, rules and procedures for setting public sector salarie~.
    including assi,mnmt      of authority and responsibilities for the various rolcs required for such salap
    setting. InSO domg, tlmt lcgal Gmncwork will enable the setting of salary structures for well defined
    subsets nf the, public administration via laws or sub-legal imtruments, such as collective bargainin:
    agreements or decrees issued by Govenmient; albeit subject to clevly specified procedural constraints
    dcsigncd to ensure compliance with the underlying principles for s a l q setting. Those principles
    include; (i)tiscal sustainabjlity of the overall public sector wage bill, (ii) consistency in the
    competitiveness o f total rcmunsration across types o f human capital required by Macedonia's puhlic
    administration, and (iii) transparency and fairness in rhe setting o f public sector remuneration, both thc
    ovcrall slructure and composition of remuneration within the public admiilistrdtion, as well as the
   remuncralion of individual public senm~ts. As a basis for this broader salary reformin the pllblic Sector
    a n initial survey ofpublic and privatc sector salaries was completed iiiJunc 2006. The State Statistical
    Ofkice has conlmitted to repealing such a survey on a regulu basis, beginning in 2008 to generatc
   rekwlu. systematic data that c'm be employed to inform deliberations ahout salary structures througliout
    our public administration. A task forcc complctcd 3 review o f pay practices throughout          OUT  public

                                T,ocal %If-government.    InSeptember, 2004, it approved a new Law on T.ocal
    Government Finance. Tn A u p s t of the xzme year, it enacted a new Law on Tem'torial Reorginiza1:on.
    Municipal elections havc been successfully completed on the basis o f the new boundaries. Th.c bask
    legal framework for tlcccntralization is therdore now inplace. Nevertheless. muchrcmains to be dona in
    terns of implcnuxlatioii.

23. The ilew Law on Lncal Government called for           3 revcnuc slwing system in which three pcrceat.      of
    Govcmment VAT collections would be distributed among municipalities on a formula basis. It did not.
    however, specify a fornula for distributing t.hcse funds. A stable and transpumt lormula, largely based
    on population. was adopted in 2005 and was renewed for 2006. We h v c rLncwed i t for the 1007 budget
    year. We inlend to maintain a stable formula for distributing the niunicipal portion o f the VAT in rhc
    200s budgct.

24. WQhave a150 t,aken stcps to reduce the stock of municipal rurears. A s recently as May 2005. the total
    stock o f municipal arrears was estimated at MKD 2.7 billion, or one. pcrccnt of GDP. Thc Ciovemnienr

     declined to MKL) 1.45 billion. Approxinitely sixty pcrceiit of the total i s now subject to courr-oraercc
     withholding. Muck o f the rsmainder has been either liquidated or IS subject to individual rescheduling
    agrzcmrnts. Wr intend to continueto carry out our obligations u d c r the agreed debt resolulion policy.

25. The Law an Locd Governmen1 Finance envisions a second phase of dccentrdization, whereby
    municipalitirs would rake on increasing rolcs in primary and secondary education, social welfare.
    cdturc, and, to a s m l l e r degree. health care. The present law spcci,fies that these functions will be
    transfencd to `my municipality UI~CE a special comniftee established by the Government has certif-ed
    that the inunicipality complies with certain financial rnmapcment criteria. W e thercfore intrndto rcvirw
    the overall straiegy far functioiial decentralizatioii inPhase 2.

26. The Law on Local Government Finance also provides general guidance as to how the timctions to bc
    dcccntralizcd under Phase 2 will he timnced, spccifyiny only that costs will be financed      through hlack
    gams from the Government budget. Wc recognize that my changes in the system for financing thaz
    functions will require considerable study, and m y involve complementary changes in other aspects         0:
    ther rnanagemmt. Changes in the system for financing teachers' salanes, for examplc, may r c q u h       NI
    examination of the systzm used i o allocatc teaching positions among individual jurisdictions. Prior lo
    gmting municipalities authority to pay teachers salarics directly. we intend to adopt an acceptable plan
    for financing tlicsa costs.

Conclusion:

27. Wc are awarc that our ambitiousgoals will require a concerted effort. A t the same t h e we are confident
   that tllls lrttzr outlines a coherent program of rcforrns and is focused on cntjcal policy pnoiities. We a12
   convinced that rhasc reforms dre esseiitral to achieving sustained growth. In closing,      WG  would like lo
   rcitzrate tlul the continued support o f thc World Bank and the international commullify will bc essential
- -for achievmg these ambitious goals. *trust            that this request for World R       d support for the

                                Statement of the IMFStaff Mission


An IMFmission headedbyMark Griffithshas visited Skopje January 25 -February 5,2007 to
discuss the Second Review under the Stand-By Arrangement.

The mission found that good progress has beenmade towards completing the review. The
program's macroeconomic targets for 2006 were met. The fiscal position remains strong,
internationalreserves have increased, and interest rates are low. Preliminary official data
estimate 2006 real GDP growth was broadly unchanged from 2005, but other indicators suggest
that growth may well have been considerably higher.

The economic outlook for 2007 and the mediumterm is favorable. To secure macroeconomic
stability, the 2007 budget that was approved by parliament inlate December 2006 limits the
fiscal deficit to 1percent o f GDP-slightly higher than the target for 2006. The additional
resources will be usedto finance important reforms, including harmonizationo f social security
contributions, higher investment, the second pillar pension system, and lower tariffs and income
taxes.

The mission welcomes the recent agreement with Paris Club creditors regarding debt
prepayment. These prepayments are expected to be completedby end-April 2007. As a result,
interest payments will decline, and medium-term debt sustainability will further improve.

Intheview o fthe mission, it is crucial that the government adheresto its fiscal targets, andthat
fiscal risks stemmingfrom problems ina few sectors o f the economy-in        particular, the health
and energy sectors-are     mitigated. Steps have been taken. However, the mission encouraged the
authorities to develop a comprehensive action plan to restore the financial viability o f the energy
sector, inclose collaborationwith the World Bank.

The mission reached understandings on almost all elements o f a draft letter o f intent.A few
issues still need to be discussed ingreater detail, including: (i)
                                                                 clarification o f the strategy for
liberalization and reform o f the telecommunications sector; (ii) next steps inharmonizing the
bases o f social security contributions and the personal income tax; (iii)improving tax collections,
through integrating the social funds to collect social security contributions and, eventually,
consolidating these reponsibilities within the public revenue office; and (iv) the new draft

 IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the former Yugoslav
                                 Republic of Macedonia


On July 28, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.8

Background

Economic performance has started to improve. After a decade of sluggish growth, in part
the result of external shocks, growth has reached 4 percent for two years in a row. In 2005,
growth was driven by strong exports. A broadly balanced fiscal position and the fixed
exchange rate have kept inflation under control. The external position has strengthened,
with gross reserves rising from 700 million at end-2004to around 1,200 (more than 4
months of imports or 25 percent of GDP) by May 2006. The recorded current account deficitfell
sharply to 1.3percent of GDP in 2005 driven by increased private transfers, though these
may also capture capital account transactions.



The increase in reserves has allowed the central bank to cut interest rates. Bank credit has
expanded, especially to households and in foreign currency, though from a low base and
less rapidly than in the region's other countries.

The overall fiscal position showed a small surplus in 2005. Last year's 0.3 percent of GDP
central government budget surplus was better than projected by 1 percent of GDP,
reflecting continuing underperformance of ministries' Special Revenue Accounts, restraint in
public employment, and procurement delays. One-off revenue developments, including the


* Under Article IV of the IMF'sArticles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateraldiscussionswith
members,usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information,and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.On
return to headquarters,the staff preparesa report,which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion,the Managing Director,as Chairman of
the Board,summarizesthe views of ExecutiveDirectors,and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizesthe views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the July 28, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

In 2006, growth is projected to remain at 4 percent, with higher domestic demand offsetting
some decline in net exports. Inflation is expected to increase to 3 percent, driven by supply
factors, including higher tobacco taxes and oil prices. The official current account deficit is
projected to widen to 3 percent of GDP due to higher oil prices, lower interest rates
stimulating imports, and some slowing in last year's increase in private transfers.

Despite recent progress, structural weaknesses constrain the economy's ability to increase
employment and achieve more rapid output growth. Recorded unemployment in 2005
reached 35 percent, one of the highest in the region, as employment has barely increased
since 1995. Levels of financial intermediation and the stock of foreign direct investment
remain low. Macedonia ranked poorly in international comparisons of the business
environment due to high costs of opening and closing a business, hiring and laying off
workers, and enforcing contracts. Property rights are poorly defined with the land cadastre
incomplete, the tax wedge on labor remains high, and telecommunications services are
expensive. The government has amended the constitution and passed new laws to
introduce comprehensive judicial reform, yet implementation has just started.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the Macedonian authorities for their sound macroeconomic
policies which, after a decade of sluggish growth, have now started to deliver economic
recovery. Inflation has remained under control, the current account deficit has narrowed,
international reserves have increased, and the fiscal position is sound.

Directors noted that, despite these successes, considerable challenges lie ahead. These
include raising living standards closer to European levels, reducing unemployment, and
keeping the current account deficit under control. Directors stressed that the best way to
meet these challenges would be by maintaining the country's hard-won macroeconomic
stability, and accelerating structural reforms.

Directors viewed the 0.6 percent of GDP fiscal deficit target as one of the anchors of
macroeconomic stability. They cautioned that loosening the fiscal stance would be
premature in view of uncertainties about the current account's true size, medium-term fiscal
challenges, and the limited institutional capacity in line ministries to spend additional funds
efficiently. Rationalization of the public sector should be undertaken before spending
increases are envisaged. Going forward, Directors also encouraged efforts to strengthen
the fiscal revenue base and reduce nondiscretionary spending.
Directors considered that the exchange rate peg is appropriate given the Macedonian
economy's size and openness, and its limited international financial market integration. The
peg has kept inflation low, and, although there are structural weaknesses in the economy,
price competitiveness and the level of the exchange rate seem broadly satisfactory.
Directors considered it important to continue to strengthen the central bank's policy
instruments. They welcomed the central bank's recent interest rate cuts, but with euro-area

rates higher and the need to see the effects of the cuts on credit and the real economy, a
pause now seems appropriate.

Directors stressed the importance of structural reforms for accelerating growth. Institutional
reforms, ranging from judicial reform and improving public governance to market
liberalization and privatization, will be essential to developing a functioning market
economy. Reducing the very high unemployment rate should be a priority, and can be
achieved through active labor market policies, reducing the tax wedge, and eliminating
barriers to part-time employment. Financial market development is also needed, notablyto
lower intermediation costs, improve the credit culture, and enhance banking supervision.
Such reforms would boost investment and employment, strengthen total factor productivity,
and increase Macedonia's attractiveness for foreign direct investment. Directors noted that
although these tasks are immense, so too are the potential rewards, and they encouraged
the authorities to implement these reforms expeditiously.

Macedonia's provision of data to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes.
Directors nevertheless underscored the need for continued efforts to improve the quality
and coverage of statistics, including in the area of fiscal transparency.
