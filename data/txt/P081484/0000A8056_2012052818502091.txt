                         This ISR reflects the findings of the March 12-16, 2012 Implementation Support Mission. This is the final ISR for the project, known as PNDCC as per the French acronym.

                         The project has achieved all six of its Project Development Objective (PDO) indicators, as revised in the Additional Financing approved by the Board on July 6, 2010: (i) the project
                         has successfully met its objective of promoting use of CDD, with 38.3 % of public capital spending on service delivery utilizing the CDD approach over the last three years (target = 20

                         %); (ii) since 2005, 747,000 people (target = 450,000) participated in PNDCC grassroots management training in 1,518 communities (target = 1400); (iii) about 158,500 students are
                         enrolled in primary schools constructed or rehabilitated under the project (target = 100,000); (iv) 25,250 people have benefited from project-financed water points (target = 10,000); (v)
                         14,807 people in 512 previously unserved communities have gained access to microfinance services (target = 10,000); and (vi) 97 % of beneficiaries were satisfied with the project
                         (target = 80 %). These indicators are not yet final as data on the last sub-projects completed is not yet included. Looking back to the PDO indicators prior to their revision, the project
                         met two of the three original outcome indicator targets: (i) by the end of each fiscal year, at least 90% of IDA funds expected to be managed by targeted communities have been
                         effectively managed by them; and (ii) by the end of each fiscal year, 100% of the Borrower's Financing shall have been disbursed to finance subprojects. It came close to meeting the
                         third pre-revision outcome indicator target: (iii) by the end of the project, the execution time of community sub-projects (from submission to completion) financed with Government
                         Financing is not superior to the execution time of community sub-projects financed with IDA funds (the result was that Government financing took 9% longer than IDA funding, an
                         improvement from 21% when first measured by the project).

                         According to the ICR criteria for measuring project outcome -- Relevance, Efficacy, and Efficiency -- the project appears to have performed well. The relevance of the project's
                         objectives -- increase poor communities' access to basic social and financial services -- is clear. Efficacy is demonstrated through meeting all six revised outcome indicators, and two
                         of the three original (pre-revision) indicators. In terms of efficacy, the recently completed technical audit provides some evidence of the cost-effectiveness of the project's approach.
                         Taking advantage of a 'natural experiment' whereby the exact same model of primary school that was built under the project was also built by two contract management agencies
                         (AGETIP and AGETUR), the independent consultant who prepared the technical audit found that the schools built by these agencies cost between 40% and 57% more than identical
                         PNDCC-built schools, with a similar level of quality.

                         Based on these results, the project's ratings for progress toward PDO and overall implementation progress are rated satisfactory. The success of the project has permitted the
                         preparation of a follow-on project to build further on the PNDCC's achievements--another sign of the PNDCC's relevance in constituting a platform for advancing the Government's
                         strategies as expressed in its PRSP which highlights CDD, decentralization, and service delivery. The successor project, the Decentralized Community-Driven Services Project
                         (PSDCC), was approved by the Board on May 3, 2012.
