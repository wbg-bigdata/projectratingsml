INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THZ EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ADJUSTMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Cameroon for US$ 21.5 million equivalent is submitted
for approval.  The proposed IBRD loan, with a five-year grace period and
20 years maturity, would help finance a Social Dimensions of Adjustment
Project as part of Cameroon's ongoing structural adjustment. Additional
funds would be provided by the African Development Bank (US$ 16.0 million),
the European Community (US$ 10.0 million), the Federal Republic of Germany
(USS 7.7 million), the Canadian International Development Agency (US$ 7.3),
France (US$ 3.9 million), the US Agency for International Development
(US$ 3.5 million), the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(US$ 3.2 million), Japan (US$ 1.0 million), the United Nations Development
Program (US$ 0.8 million), and the Government of Cameroon (US$ 10.8
million).
2.        The Project and Structural Adiustment.  The Cameroonian
Government is determined to reestablish economic growth with equity over
the medium and long term and ensure the protection of vulnerable groups in
the short term. It has, therefore, decided to address the social
dimensions of adjustment as an integral part of its Structural Adjustment
Program. This determination, expressed in the Government's Statement of
Development Strategy and Economic Recovery (and accompanying matrix of
actions), dated May 1989, has been translated into the policy and
operational program reforms included in the proposed Project. As a
critical part of the Structural Adjustment Program adopted by the
Government, it is closely coordinated in both conception and design with
the $150 million equivalent IBRD SAL and the Economic Management Project
approved on June 8, 1989 and July 11, 1989, respectively. The three
operations, therefore, constitute an integrated whole, with this Project
focusing on issues of poverty. Because the SDA objectives are to be
achieved as part of the Structural Adjustment Program, failure of the
Government to make satisfactory progress under that Program would be
considered an event justifying the Bank to suspend disbursements under the
SDA Project.
3.        To prepare this Project, the Government established, under the
Technical Committee for the Preparation and Follow-up of the Structural
Adjustment Program (CTPAS), five working groups covering the areas of
population and health, education and vocational training, employment, women
in development, and institutional development. These working groups
prepared the Project through a broad participatory process supported by the
Bank through the Africa Region SDS, Unit.



2
4.        ProJect ObJectives.  The Government's Declaration of Development
Strategy identifies as its objectives in the social dimensions: (a) to
promote the participation of the poorest population groups in the recovery
process by establishing sustainable social programs and complementary
policy measures; (b) to mitigate adverse social effects of Cameroon's
economic crisis and the consequent adjustment measures through a set of
priority actions and policy adjustments; and (c) to promote the
institutionalization of these concerns among the routine duties of existing
agencies (presently being strengthened by the Economic Management Project,
financed by Loan 3110-CM of 1989). From these objectives energe the three
lines of action of the Project: (a) support to a fundamental policy reform
process in the social sectors; (b) immediate actions to address priority
needs while the overall reform process takes hold; and (c) institutional
support for the above actions.
5.        Policy Reform Process.  The Project would strengthen the socio-
economic policy reform process and related programming. This component
would contain the following elements: (a) support for on-going efforts to
design and implement new national policies in population. health, and women
in development, which would be oriented towards the provision of basic
social services targeting the most disadvantaged segments of the population
and the establishment of cost-effective and sustainable delivery systems
including the introduction of adequate cost-recovery mechanisms; and
(b) improvement of financial resource allocation and efficiency
through program budgeting in health thereby protecting operating expenses
that will benefit the poor. Policy development, institutional
strengthening, and program budgeting for the education sector will be
supported by the complementary Education and Vocational Training Project
(Loan 2683-CM of 1986) which is currently being restructured. These
elements are intended to be precursors of planned human resources
development operations from FY92 onwards.
6.        Immediate Actions.  Action Programs cover the following areas:
(a) Health and Population: strengthening maternal and child health and
family planning programs, emergency replenishment of medical and
pharmaceutical supplies for primary health care, and introduction of cost
recovery measures and systems to ensure sustainability. (b) Education:
emergency replenishment of educational materials for primary and secondary
education. (c) Employment: creation of a National Employment Fund (FNE) to
finance the following activities: a unit to assist workers displaced from
public service by austerity measures and recent school or university
graduates, directing them as appropriate to job opportunities, retraining,
or self-employment; strengthening of vocational training in Government -nd
NGO-managed training schools by providing financing for the expansion
and/or consolidation of effective programs; on-the-job training programs to
promote job creation by helping employers train new workers; and conducting
two pilot programs (i) to support self-employment, and (ii) to make
available technical and financial assistance to existing or new micro-
enterprises. (d) Women in Development: strengthening of existing women's
support agencies and a sensitization program to involve line Government
agencies more actively in the promotion of women's participation in socio-
economic activity. (e) Community Development: establishment of a Community



3
Development Program (PRODEC) to provide grants, to NG0s and others, for
sustainable small-scale social infrastructure and services, and for the
creation or expansion of urban micro income-generating activities, at the
community level.
7.        Institutional Suppor,.  To complement the Economic Management
Project, which focuses on strengthening the ability to execute a reform
program and to manage the economy on a daily basis, this Project component
would focus on the integration of social and economic aspects in macro-
economic policy making, and would reinforce this capacity in the key
Government institutions responsible for socio-economic policy formulation,
programming, and monitoring. This component would contain technical
assistance for (a) integration of distributional and employment impacts in
macro-policy formulation; (b) reinforcement of the existing planning and
programming units in the ministries of health, education, labor, and social
and women's affairs; and (c) reinforcement of the socio-economic
information base through the development of a system for household surveys
and support to the system for preparing price indices.
8.        Implementation Arrangements.  The Project would be organized
into identifiable and manageable modules in line ministries in order to
facilitate the implementation of the diverse components of the Project.
Project coordination would be the task of a high-level coordinating
committee, chaired by a senior, full-time, Administrator under the
supervision of the Presidency. Individual task managers in the line
ministries would be assigned to each module. A separate agency has been
established to administer the employment module, the National Employment
Fund (FNE), which would report to the Ministry of Labor.
9.        Financial Arrangements.  At a donors' meeting convened by the
Government in February 1990 and a follow-up meeting in April 1990, US$ 53.4
million of cofinancing for the Project was confirmed (see para. 1).
Furthermore, tne Federal Republic of Germany, France, USAID, UNFPA, and the
World Food Program are putting in place projects which would complement the
SDA Project.
10.       Justification and Risks.  By fostering the participation of the
poor in economic activity and the sustained development of human resources,
the Project would contribute to the restoration of suE ainable growth over
the medium and long term. It would also contribute to protecting the poor
and other vulnerable groups during the transition phase of the adjustment
process. The main risks are related to: (a) the complex nature of the
Project which would involve many different Cameroonian agencies, not all of
which may move speedily to execute Project components in accordance with
Project objectives, and several different donorss this risk would be
minimized through the creation of a strong coordinating unit under the
Presidency, the division of the Project into modules under the
responsibility of separate managers, and reliance on existing structures
for most Project modules would alleviate this risk by streamlining Project
execution and facilitating the channelling of external finance from the
different donors; (b) there could also be, despite the Government's strong
commitment, resistance to the population and women's components of the



'4
Project, which may conflict with established cultural valuest this risk
would be mitigated by the intensive information programs being and to be
carried out by the Government; and (c) the innovative nature of the self-
employment and micro enterprise support programs: substantial safeguards.
including limited pilot testing periods, followed by built-in review and
evaluation, have been incorporated into project design so as to minimize
the risks associated with these programs.
11.       Government Action Required.  Prior to negotiations the Tecnnical
Committee for the Coordination of the SDA Project (CTCJDSA) was
established, the Project's Administrator was appointed, and cofinancing was
arranged. At negotiations, the principal matters agreed were: (a) if the
Bank were to find Government performance uns..tisfactory (i) under the
Structural Adjustment Program or (ii) in the preparation of a statement of
policy, a medium-term action plan and long-term implementation strategy for
education (under the Education and Vocational Training Project), such
unsatisfactory performance would justify suspending disbursements under the
SDA Project; (b) the need for mid-term evaluation of the Project; (c) the
need for Bank consultation prior to implementation of sectoral policies in
the areas of population, health, and women in development; (d) the need to
develop a system of program budgnting to protect core expenditures in the
area of health; (e) detailed plh s for the management of the various
modules and for the implementation of action programs (except in the case
of education where this would be a condition of disbursements); (f) the
contents of and a timetable for the cost-recovery pr,3gram for
pharmaceuticals and medical supplies; and (g) the establishment of a users'
committee in connection with the development and use of the Cameroonian
Household Survey. Prior to Board presentation, legislation establishing
the FNE and PRODEC was enacted, and their Director-G^neral and unit chief,
respectively, were appoii-ted. Appointment of the L nbers of the CTCIDSA,
most of whom would be the managers for the Projec* odules, and its deputy
administrator and accountant; appointment of the    isor to the Director
General of the FNE; and the establishment of the i 3ject Account for the
FNE and deposit therein of CFAF 100 million would be conditions of
effectiveness.
Conditions of disbursements for specific modules inc:udes for education,
detailed implementation plans for the action progrwA; for the formal
vocational training and self-employment programs of the employment module,
effectiveness of ADB cofinancing, constitution of the FNE's Board of
Directors, adoption of an organigram and operating procedures for the PNE,
execution of a subsidiary agreement allowing the Government to pass funds
to the FNE, appointment of the manager of the FNE's Employment and Training
Assistance Division, and appointment of the manager of the FNE unit
administering the self-employmemt program and his internationally recruited
advisor; for the second phase of the self-employmer.t program, Bank
agreement following evaluation of the first phase; and for community
development, effectiveness of cofinancing and adoption of guidelines for
sub-project selection, appraisal, and supervision. A matrix of detailed
actions has been developed by the Government in the process of Project
preparation and was finalized and agreed upon during negotiations.
