MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO GUYANA
FOR A THIRD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed credit to Guyana for SDR 2.3
million (US$3.0 million equivalent) is submitted for your approval. It
would assist in the financing of studies and technical assistance related
to policy areas included in the second Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC)
which is being submitted fot your approval under separate cover.
2.       Background.  Guyana's econxomic situation has deteriorated since
1975, in part due to the Government's failure to adopt appropriate policies
to deal with changing conditions. The Government is now undertaking a
major stabilization and adjustment effort with the support of the IMF, IDA
and bilateral donors. The Association's strategy over the next three years
is to support the Government's efforts to restructure the economy and place
it on a sustainable growth path. This strategy is reflected in the SAC
which supports the Government's adjustment program of: (i) improvements in
the incentive framework through adoption of market-based pricing of
products and trade liberalization; (ii) public sector reform, including
divestment and revenue strategies for public enterprises; (iii)
rehabilitation of basic infrastructure through rationalization of the
public sector investment program (PSIP) and (iv) alleviation of the social
effects of policies adopted under the adjustment program.
3.       Past Government policy failed to provide adequate incentives for
efficient resource allocation and economic growth. Foreign exchange has
been underpriced and rationed; prices of some basic commodities have been
set too low to encourage domestic production; and private investment has
not received sufficient encouragement. Within the framework of the SAC,
import license procedures will be simplified and import prohibitions
reduced; economic criteria, including border prices and average operating
costs, will be used appropriately to price services and products either
provided or regulated by Government; and new procedures will expedite
processing of private investment applications for fiscal incentives. These
measures are designed to stimulate larger private domestic and foreign
investment.
4.       Guyaia has the largest public sector, relative to its economy, in
South America. Its central Government deficit is also very large,
amounting to 332 of GDP in 1988. The overall deficit of the public
enterprises has decreased over time to only 12 of GDP in 1988, and can,
with appropriate policies, be reversed to generate positive transfers to
the Central Government.   The Government's adjustment program will control
costs by eliminating overlapping functions and non-critical vacancies in
the civil service and increasing central Government net revenues from
public enterprises by enforcing positive revenue targets and transfers, and
requiring the development and implementation of diversification and
divestment strategies.
5.       The economic problems of the last decade have contributed to the
deterioration of Guyana's basic public infrastructure, investment in which



is largely financed by external sources. The importance of this
infrastructure for Guyana's economic growth requires that the State
Planning Secretariat (SPS) allocate available investment resources as
efficiently as possible. Raising efficiency requires improvements in PSIP
formulation and evaluation, coordination and agreement on the size and
composition of the PSIP, and improvements in external aid coordination to
expedite fund requests and disbursements.
6.       Implementation of the structural adjustment program could impose
additional hardship on segments of the population, which has already
experienced widespread and substantial declines in living standards over
the past 15 years. In order to protect groups which are particularly
vulnerable, and to engender public support for the economic measures, the
Government has for this purpose established a Social Impact Amelioration
Program (SIMAP) containing a number of program proposals to be financed by
the 1DB and other external sources. Improved capacity to evaluate these
proposals is required to ensure that program benefits are effectively
targeted.
7.       The ability to manage macroeconomic policy in Guyana has
deteriorated over the past decade as qualified technical personnel seeking
higher income have emigrated from the country. The Government's Monitoring
and Coordinating Agency (MCA), located in the Ministry of Finance, is
responsible for monitoring the structural adjustment program and,
currently, needs strengthening to fulfill these responsibilities. Key
offices in the Ministry of Finance are seriously understaffed. The
Statistical Bureau fails to provide essential current economic statistics,
and the Public Corporation Secretariat (PCS) and SPS need to improve the
collection and reporting of financial and economic performance data for the
large public enterprise sector.
8.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The quality of public sector
management will play a critical role in determining the success of the
program. At the Association's request, the UNDP together with the
Government developed a comprehensive set of technical assistance packages
to improve public sector management. These packages will be financed
through a combination of IDB, IDA, CDB, UNDP, EC, and bilateral sources.
IDA is financing those improvements in the capacity to manage macroeconomic
policy regarded as essential for success of the structural adjustment
program. IDA technical assistance is primarily directed to the Ministry of
Finance and the State Planning Secretariat, which have joint responsibility
for managing macroeconomic policy.
9.       Project Objectives.  The proposed Technical Assistance Credit
(TAC) would help Government policy makers to improve macroeconomic
management so that the objectives of the adjustment program can be
achieved. The TAC will also assist in strengthening the public sector
agencies responsible for implementing the adjustment program by financing
staff training and equipment to improve management and analytic capacity;
these institutional strengthening activities will lay the basis of
transition to complete local management at the project's end.



- 3 -
10.      Project Description.  The project will provide assistance in the
form of short-term and long-term consultants to work with local staff,
equipment, supplies, vehicles, and training of local staff. Short-term
consultants will help the Government to carry out special studies required
under the adjustment program. A consultant will work with the MCA to
identify deficiencies in the application and administration of consumption
taxes. Other short-term consultants, equipment and training will also be
provided to SPS and the Ministry of Culture and Social Development (MCSD)
to improve targeting of SIMAP programs.
11.      Long-term consultants, computing equipment, and local staff
training will be provided to the State Planning Secretariat and the Public
Corporations Secretariat to help the Government improve its monitoring and
control over the public enterprises; by the end of the project,
computerized information systems will permit close monitoring and timely
reports on their financial and economic performance. Consultants,
equipment including a vehicle, and training will also be provided to the
State Planning Secretariat to improve its capacity to evaluate projects and
to plan the PSIP; this assistance will permit coordination of the magnitude
and composition of investments within funding constraints. Similar
technical assistance will be provided to the Ministry of Finance, Bank of
Guyana, and the Ministry of Trade and Tourism to increase their ability to
coordinate external aid with investment priorities and to expedite external
aid disbursement.
12.      A long-term macroeconomic adviser, computing and other equipment
including a vehicle will be provided to the Monitoring and Coordinating
Agency to improve its capacity to manage the Government's structural
adjustment program. Training will also be provided for improving the
analytic capacity of the Agency's staff and ensuring that a small cadre of
professionals experienced in macroeconomic analysis is in place by the end
of the project.
13.      The Monitoring and Coordinating Agency is the executing agency for
the project. It is responsible for hiring consultants, procuring
equipment, arranging local staff training, and overseeing the provision of
project-funded assistance to other Government offices critical for the
attainment of the Government's structural adjustment program. The Agency
will contract with UNDP/Georgetown to assist in the provision of these
services. In addition, a qualified procurement agent will be provided
under the TAC to the Bank of Guyana to ensure that purchases financed by
both the TAC and SAC are in line with the Bank Group's guidelines for
procurement.  Disbursements will be made against statements of expenditure.
14.      The urgency of the Government's structural adjustment program has
*         required that improvements in the ability to manage macroeconomic policy
precede the date of TAC effectiveness. UNDP/Georgetown has agreed to
finance the Government's request for a bridging operation to fill most of
the long-term consultant positions anticipated under the TAC, using terms
of reference agreed to by the IDA and the Government. The qualificationr
and experience of consultants hired is satisfactory to the IDA; Bank Group
guidelines for the use of consultant services have also been followed in
filling the TAC specified positions.



15.      The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$ 3.1
million, of which USS 3.0 million will be provided under the proposed IDA
credit. The Bank will retroactively finance a portion, up to US$150,000,
of UNDP expenditures under the bridging operation. A summary of the cost
estimates and methods of procurement and disbursements are provided in
Schedules A and B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Guyana are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map of Guyana is also attached. Since there is no Staff
Appraisal Report, the detailed project description, and the project
administration and implementation arrangements are given in Annex I. The
linkage between structural adjustment objectives and TAC components is
illustrated in the Technical Assistance Matrix (Annex TI). which also
provides target dates for the completion of the various component
activities.
16.      ARreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached on: (i) the
establishment, mandate, location, and staffing of the MCA and (ii) TORs for
TAC-financed activities, target dates for their completion and the means to
ensure the building of institutional capacity including training.
Compliance with these target dates will be periodically reviewed by IDA and
the Government. Agreement has also been reached on the identification of
key counterparts and on the mechanisms for identifying and contracting
consultants provided under the TAC.
17.      Benefits.  The Government's capacity to design and implement
policy reforms and its macroeconomic management capacity will be improved
under the TAC. These improvements are critical to the successful
implementation of the Government's structural adjustment program.
18.      Risks.  Complementary technical assistance provided by other
agencies may not materialize as scheduled. This risk is reduced through
UNDP efforts to coordinate all technical assistance in Guyana, including
regularly scheduled meetings of a Steering Committee comprised of
representatives of the Government and the agencies providing assistance. A
second risk is that the benefits of assistance are not sustained after the
project's completion due to staffing deficiencies.  This risk is reduced
through training under the TAC to increase the analytic and management
skills of staff.
19.      Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

GUYANA
THIRD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Section A. Project Description.
1.       Background.  The World Bank strategy is to assist the Government
of Guyana in its efforts at structural adjustment, including support of an
emergency program to ameliorate the social costs of adjustment. Towards
this end, Guyana's Program for Structural Adjustment (PSA), which is a
major component of the Government's Economic Recovery Program and which is
being supported by the IDA SAC, proposes policy and management actions in
four areas: (i) the incentive framework, (ii) public sector finances,
(iii) the public sector investment program, and (iv) social sector
programs. The TAC will support the Monitoring and Coordinating Agency,
which is responsible for coordinating macroeconomic management under the
PSA, and will strengthen public sector agencies responsible for
implementing proposed PSA actions.
2.       Public sector management has deteriorated over the past decade,
resulting in deficiencies in terms of qualified personnel and equipment.
Low public sector wages and a high rate of professional emigration from the
country have contributed to the problem. Most government agencies have
funded but unfilled vacancies at the professional level. Staff currently
in place frequently lack both experience and relevant training. Computer
equipment and software, which can increase the productivity of scarce
professional labor, is largely nonexistent.
3.       Since PSA policy and management actions concern a variety of
government agencies, technical assistance will be, also, be provided to a
number of agencies, primarily the Ministry of Finance, the State Planning
Secretariat (SPS), and the Public Corporations Secretariat. The TAC will
serve to strengthen these agencies while facilitating implementation of PSA
policy and management actions. The TAC will not aim to strengthen all
components of these primary agencies. Rather, it will strengthen those
units essential to implementing structural adjustment.
4.       Other international agencies are at present and will in the future
provide technical assistance to complement that provided by the TAC. The
IDB has provided technical assistance to the Guyana Water Authority and the
Guyana Electricity Corporatlon and plans further assistance to the State
Planning Secretariat, the Guyana Rice Group, the Ministry of Education and
the Ministry of Culture and Social Development. The UNDP has provided
assistance to the Public Corporations Secretariat and has financed UNIDO
technical assistance to GUYMIDA.   The UNDP is, in addition, at the request
of the Bank providing a bridge technical assistance project until the TAC
is effective.   UK/ODA currently offers training to SPS personnel and will
continue to provide assistance to strengthen the Public Service Ministry,
especially the Management Services Division. The Commonwealth Fund for
Technical Cooperation (CFTC) is funding an on-going program of technical
assistance in debt management to the Ministry of Finance.   The CDB is
committed to financing urgently-needed institutional strengthening of the
Statistical Bureau.

5.       Incentive Framework.  The PSA calls for a number of changes in
domestic pricing, trade policy, and investment procedures as a means of
correcting incentives important to structural adjustment and economic
growth. Agreements have been reached between the Government and the Bank
on the principles for pricing of sugar, petroleum, public transportation,
and rice prior to Board Presentation of the SAC, and these agreements will
be implemented during the life of the credit.
6.       Petroleum and public transportation are at present priced
according to the principles specified in the PSA and, thus, do not require
further study. Rice and sugar are not currently priced correctly. Rice
pricing is being studied under the IDB-financed technical assistance to the
Guyana Rice Group (GRG). Calculation of domestic pricing of sugar based on
CIF and other acquisition costs would be fairly straight forward and not
require a study.
7.       With respect to trade policy, the PSA envisages a reduction in the
list of prohibited imports, changes in procedures for issuing import
licenses, and a study of trade taxes and ensuing agreement on a program to
rationalize trade taxes. The TAC will provide a short-term consultant to
the Monitoring and Coordinating Agency (MCA), the coordinating unit for the
project, to work with the government on a study to identify the
deficiencies in the application and administration of consumption taxes and
to address these deficiencies.
8.       Finally, the PSA requires changes in procedures to expedite
approval of fiscal incentives for new investment. GUYMIDA, the
organization responsible for expediting and stimulating new investment has
already reduced the amount of time required to process applications, but it
does not yet operate as an effective one-stop investment agency. UNIDO is
currently providing the technical assistance required to improve the
effectiveness of GUYMIDA and convert it to a true one-stop agency.
9.       Public Sector Reforms.  The PSA envisages institutional
strengthening of the Public Service Ministry and suppression of non-
critical vacancies in the civil service.   With respect to public
enterprises, it requires an increase in current surpluses, operating
procedures to enforce transfers of surpluses to the central government,
adoption of a disaggregated accounting system for GUYSUCO, implementation
of a divestment program for the Public Corporations Secretariat, and
implementation by the Guyana Rice Group of recommendations following from a
study of irrigation water charges to improve water distribution and promote
the efficient use of water.
10.      The Public Service Ministry is understaffed and not equipped to
carry out the kinds of analyses required to reorganize a government
characterized by an excessively large number of ministries, a shortage of
qualified professionals at prevailing pay levels, and a large number of
funded but unfilled positions. The key unit in the Ministry responsible
for determining non-critical positions and rationalizing government
organization is the Management Services Division. The UK/ODA has already
carried out an institutional analysis of the Public Service Ministry and
will provide substantial technical assistance over the next two years to
strengthen the Management Services Division. This assistance will be
adequate for the Ministry to play its role in the PSA.

11.      The public enterprises in Guyana include a few independent
enterprises (primarily GUYSUCO and GUYMINE) which report directly to the
Office of the President and a much larger number which report to the PCS.
The Enterprise Monitoring Department (EMD) in the SPS is responsible for
monitoring the financial performance and corporate development strategies
of all public corporations, while the Physical and Financial Monitoring of
Corporations Unit within the PCS has responsibility for monitoring
financial performance for the enterprises only under its purview. The EMD
liaises closely with the PCS in carrying out its financial monitoring
function. The TAC proposes to provide technical assistance to both the EMD
and PCS to improve monitoring of financial and operational performance.
12.      The Physical and Financial Monitoring of Corporations Unit in the
PCS is staffed by eight professionals and has benefited from a UNDP
institutional strengthening project begun in 1987. That project provided
equipment, training of staff, and specialized short-term technical
assistance in designing the management information system. At this point,
the data base is designed and staff has been trained, but complementary
technical assistance is required in implementing the data base design,
analyzing corporate financial performance, and designing corporate
development strategies. The TAC will provide this assistance in the form
of a long-term consultant expert in these areas; additional computer
equipment to facilitate the consultant's work will also be provided.
13.      The Enterprise Monitoring Department of the Macro-Monitoring
Division of the SPS has the responsibility for monitoring and analyzing the
financial performance and operating plans of public corporations and
assessing their macro-economic impact, including monitoring investment
plans as an important component of the PSIP. In carrying out these
responsibilities, the Department liaises with the PCS and the Office of the
President, as well as the larger corporations themselves.
14.      The EMD is at present inadequately staffed with a director and
three professionals; EMD has no computer facilities for maintaining and
analyzing data bases on the public corporations. No operating manual
exists for the EMD, no public enterprise performance indicators have been
developed, and only ad hoc, descriptive reports are issued. The size of
the professional staff of EMD should be increased but, more importantly,
procedures need to be established for monitoring, analyzing, and reporting
the financial conditions of public enterprises. The large role public
enterprises play in the Guyana economy, including their share of total
public investment, combined with the need for those enterprises to meet
established revenue or profit targets lend importance to strengthening EMD.
EMD receives no external technical assistance at present, and none is
anticipated. The TAC will help strengthen EMD by providing a long- term
adviser, computer equipment and software including a generator, and short-
term specialized training for staff. The results should include more
timely and better monitoring and analysis of the financial performance and
development and investment plans of the public corporations. A performance
monitoring system system along the lines of those functioning in Pakistan,
Korea, and Thailand will be introduced as part of this program.

15.      The PCS has already formed a working group to develop a divestment
strategy for the corporations for which it has responsibility. It has,
however, very limited experience in actually carrying out divestment. The
critical need of the PCS is in implementing its divestment program and
revising the divestment plan when required by changing circumstances. PCS
requires assistance in a variety of divestment issues, including valuation
of assets, legal procedures, publicity, and communication with potential
investors. The UNDP is planning to support implementation of the
divestment plan by providing expert consultants in divestment procedures;
further assistance is not proposed under the TAC.
16.      Other parts of the Government's PSA require GUYSUCO to develop and
implement a disaggregated accounting system and require the Guyana Rice
Group to carry out studies of irrigation water charges and the private
sector rice export market. Neither of these activities require assistance
under the TAC. GUYSUCO has the capacity to revise its accounting system
and the IDB will assist the GRG in carrying out the two studies specified
above.
17.      Public Sector Investment Program.    The PSA envisages
strengthening the capacity of the SPS to evaluate new investment projects,
to prepare the PSIP consistent with available funding, and to monitor
ongoing projects. In addition, the PSA envisages improved coordination of
external aid, especially expediting the use of credit lines by facilitating
disbursement.   Since all PSIP projects are currently externally financed,
this stipulation will also help in implementation of the PSIP and
consequently in the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure.
18.      The Project Cycle Unit in the SPS is responsible for planning and
monitoring the PSIP and assuring its consistency with overall government
expenditure constraints.   The Planning Secretariat is hampered in carrying
out these functions by a shortage of computer equipment, vehicles and
professional staff, the latter a result of high turnover due to low
salaries, which persist in spite of the fact SPS is a semi-independent
entity not subject to the Public Service Ministry's pay scale. Two key
division heads and several professional staff positions need to remain
filled for effective and efficient control over the PSIP.
19.      The IDB will in the future provide technical assistance in
developing an information system in the SPS, and UK/ODA is currently
providing training (mostly three month courses) for fifteen SPS
professional staff at Bradford University's Development and Project
Planning Centre.  What is urgently required for successfully meeting PSA
objectives with respect to the PSIP is immediate technical assistance in
the form of an experienced economic advisor on the PSIP, an experienced
project cost analyst, 3upporting staff, computing equipment and a vehicle.
The TAC, will provide funding for the advisor and analyst, for some short-
term training to staff in project evaluation and resource management and
for computing equipment and supplies.
20.      External aid is. in principle, coordinated by two government
agencies. The Department of International Economic Cooperation (DIEC) in
the Office of the President is responsible for coordinating external aid
requests and UNDP and bilateral donor proposals, while the Division of



- 144 -
Multilateral Financial Institutions (MFI) in the Ministry of Finance is
responsible for coordinating and facilitating procurement and disbursement
of external funds, especially those provided by multilateral institutions.
The functions of the MFI are those which the PSA envisi;3es be strengthened.
21.      To assure the MFI functions as intended, additional professional
and support staff are required, in addition to computer equipment and staff
training. The TAC will finance one long-term consultant to either head or
advise the MFI division; the MFI head reports to the Director of the Budget
Office in the Ministry of Finance, but will closely liaise with the Bank of
Guyana and the Ministry of Trade and Tourism. In addition, the TAC
proposes training of staff in international procurement and disbursement
procedures and provision of additional computing equipment and software to
facilitate the work of the consultant and assure continued staffing
strength.
21.      Social Sector Program.  The PSA envisages action on an emergency
program to ameliorate the social costs of adjustment and agreement on
agencies responsible for coordinating and implementing that program prior
to Board Presentation. Agreement has already been reached on an emergency
Social Impact Amelioration Program (SIMAP) to be coordinated by the
Ministry of Culture and Social Development (MCSD); implementation of the
programs themselves will be the responsibility of other ministries.   Time
has not permitted a careful study of the distributional consequences of
structural adjustment and design of social programs carefully targeted on
those groups most adversely affected by adjustment.
22.      Being new, MCSD lacks both organizational structure and
professional staff and is heavily dependent on, both, the Department of
Social Infrastructure (DSI) in the State Planning Secretariat for
assistance in identifying target populations, and on line ministries for
project execution. Given the lack of local professionals with analytical
skills in and the urgency of implementing SIMAP, it is not advisable for
MCSD to develop its own in-house capacity for project evaluation and
implementation; coordination would be a more suitable role. In addition.
since SIMAP is likely to lead to other low income targeted social programs,
it is important to improve DSI's capacity to correctly identify target
populations.
23.      The UNDP is providing short-term technical assistance to MCSD in
organizational design.   The IDB has proposed technical assistance to MCSD
in the form of a professional experienced in the coordination and
implementation of social programs and provision of equipment and short-term
training of staff to assure development of management capacity. The TAC
complements these efforts by providing short-term consultants (12 months
total) to work with DSI in analyzing the distributional effects of
structural adjustment, developing procedures for assessing target
efficiency of projects, assessing the efficiency of SIMAP, and providing
training to DSI in target efficiency. The TAC, also, proposes providing
computer equipment to DSI to improve staff productivity and facilitate data
analysis.
24.      Macroeconomic Management.   The PSA envisages that a variety of
conditions dealing with pricing and trade policies, investment procedures,
civil service management, public enterprise transfers and development
strategies, public sector investment, and social programs to ameliorate
adjustment effects be fulfilled. The Monitoring and Coordinating Agency



- 15 -
(MCA), located in the Ministry of Finance, has the responsibility of
providing economic policy advice and overseeing implementation of the
Government's Economic Recovery Program, which is largely consistent with
the measures envisioned in the PSA.
25.      The MCA has not yet been fully staffed, although a director has
been appointed and is aosembling a professional and support staff. Since
the professional staff will largely play a coordinating and monitoring
function, it would be adequate to have a small unit numbering about three
staff members in addition to the director. It might, however, be difficult
to fill these positions due to (i) low public sector pay levels and (ii)
scarcity of personnel in Guyana with the requisite skills. To help
overcome these obstacles, the TAC will provide an experienced macroeconomic
adviser to the director for a period of two years. The advisor will
monitor, assemble, and analyze information from a number of agencies in
preparing reports and providing policy advice to the director and the
Minister of Finance. The TAC will, in addition, provide equipment
including a vehicle, required for the MCA to function effectively and will
provide training to new staff members. Finally, to assist the MCA in
expeditious implementation of the Government's Economic Recovery Program,
the TAC will provide a qualified procurement agent to the Bank of Guyana
for up to six months to ensure that purchases financed under the SAC and
the TAC are consistent with the Bank Group's Guideline for Procurement.
26.      The PSA specifically envisages that the Debt Management Division
(DMD) in the Ministry of Finance be fully staffed. The DMD has several
responsibilities including compiling and maintaining Guyana's debt
inventory, recording debt data on a loan by loan basis, production of
reports on single loans and groups of loans, assistance in evolving
borrowing policy and strategy, assistance in loan negotiations, processing
applications by parastatals for external borrowing, and preparations for
rescheduling and refinancing existing debt. The DMD reports directly to
the Minister of Finance. It currently issues reports only on an ad hoc
basis.
27.      The DMD was established five years ago and has never been
adequately staffed or equipped to perform its functions. Currently, there
is no director. There are only two professional staff, one of whom is
seconded from the Accountant General's Department. The UNDP has provided
technical assistance in the form of two small computers, and the
Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation has provided the software for
data recording and reporting--the Commonwealth Secretariat Data Recording
and Management System (CS- DRMS) and some training in use of the software.
To function adequately, the DMD requires at least four staff members--two
professional and two support--and a director.   The Public Service Ministry
has approved these positions, but they have not yet been filled.  It will
be especially difficult to find a knowledgeable, experienced director for
the Division; the CFTC has for this reason agreed to finance a long-term
consultant to head the DMD.
28.      Current macroeconomic data is essential to macroeconomic
management and, thus, important to the success of the Government's
structural adjustment program. The Statistical Bureau has responsibility
for assembling and reporting a wide variety of macroeconomic and household



- 16 -
and national income accounts data. For a number of reasons, these tasks
are not done adequately. The Government has assessed the situation and
developed a comprehensive plan to strengthen the Statistical Bureau. It is
important to ensure the provision of essential data as quickly as possible.
Towards that end, the CDB will provide financing for long-term consultants
in survey design and implementation and data processing. The TAC will
complement this effort by financing needed computer equipment, which the
CDB is unable to provide.
Section B: Proiect Administration and Implementation
29.      Project Organization and Administration.  The implementation unit
for the TAC will be the Monitoring and Coordinating Agency (MCA) for the
Government's Economic Recovery Program.   The MCA is located in the
Ministry of Finance, and the director reports directly to the Minister of
Finance. The MCA will be responsible for monitoring progress in the PSA,
coordinating consultants and studies provided under the TAC and required to
successfully implement the structural adjustment, making quarterly reports
analyzing economic conditions and government finance, and providing
macroeconomic policy advice to the Minister of Finance. The MCA will be
responsible for hiring consultants, in coordination with line agencies,
administering their contracts, purchasing equipment and arranging for
training. The required secretarial, accounting, and bookkeeping support
will also be hired by the MCA.
30.      Due to the urgency of effectively implementing the PSA, the most
critical technical assistance to be provided under the proposed TAC is, at
the request of the Bank, already being provided by the UNDP to the
Government of Guyana. Three of the five consulting positions to be in part
financed retroactively by the TAC are currently provided by the UNDP using
the terms of reference already agreed to by the Bank and the Government.
31.      Project Coordination and Reporting.  The MCA will be staffed with
high level professionals, who will serve as counterparts to TAC financed
long and short term consultants. Together they will be responsible for
coordinating PSA/TAC activities under a management services contract with
UNDP. This includes contracting consultants in consultation with line
agencies. Consultants will work closely with designated counterparts in
those agencies. The MCA will prepare quarterly reports on progress of
project implementation and compliance with PSA objectives as specified in
the SAC agreement.  In addition, it will prepare an annual report
summarizing progress in all key areas of the reform and, upon completion of
the project, will collaborate in the preparation of a project completion
report. The MCA will play a key role in ensuring that measures are taken
sufficient to warrant release of the second and third tranches of the SAC.
32.      Procurement and Disbursements.  The goods and services to be
financed under the project would be procured in accordance with procedures
acceptable to IDA as summarized in Schedule B of the President's Memorandum
on the project. Training and consultant services would be procured in
accordance with IDA guidelines. However, due to the difficulty in
recruiting qualified consultants to work in Guyana, it is intended to
employ the UNDP's Office of Project Services (OPS) to identify consultants,



- 17 -
assist the MCA in their hiring and provide the necessary logistical
support; UNDP's OPS will also assist on the procurement of computer and
office equipment. Computer equipment, including maintenance and repair
services, for which contracts are expected to be above US$20,000 and less
than USS150,000 would be procured through limited international bidding
(LIB). Any contract above US$150,000 would be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB). Equipment and supplies to cost
less than US$20,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of US$100,000 would be
procured through local or international shopping. Disbursements for
contracts to cost less than US$20,000 would be made against statement of
expenditures, for which detailed documentation evidencing such expenditures
will be retained by MCA and made available for the required audit and for
supervision by IDA.  The minimum value of each SOE would be the equivalent
of US$5,000. Any ICB procurement and the first two LIB procurements would
have prior Bank review.
33.      Accounts and Audits.  Separate accounts will be kept for all
expenditures made under the project. The MCA will maintain records and
accounts for all project activities. The accounts and statements of
expenditures will be audited each year by independent auditors acceptable
to IDA and submitted to IDA. no later than six months after the close of the
financial year.
