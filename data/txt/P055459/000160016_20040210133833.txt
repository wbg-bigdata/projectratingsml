Introcduction
Improving sdiool envilronmnents is a very impor-tant area under DPEP Civil Works. All DPEI' states are now using improvecd designs for construction of new
schools - these new designs rcater to most of the functional requirements.
however, there is scope for further improvement. Certain issues are yet to be addressed. for example, in many cases, our schools dlo not have enough
leamning spaces. Display and storagec facilities are often iniadiequate. Also, we are yet to providle a 'bamer-free enoironment' for our,disabled childrren.
'Child-friendly' EIement5
Certain building elements have been idientified to address such issues, and make- the school environment more 'child-friendly'. for example, the provision
of a simple chabutara (platform) undier a tree, with a chalkboard, creates an outdoor space that is usable for teachingl. The provision of ramps, handirails
etc. encouragjes children who are physically disabled.
The adidition of such small features also makes the school more attractive to the child.
About thi5 document
DPEP engineers in most states are now beginning to incorporate these elements. This document attempts to provide informiatiorl, which would help them
get a clear picture of what to construct.
The handibook consists5 of the following:
I.    Dexnptions of clemenlt5: Elements that have been successfully tned out are descnibed here. The following details are provided:
*  General description andi purpose
*  Photographs of elements ini use
hints5 about where to locate them
*  Typical construction method in brief
Technical drawings shoring typical heights, wAidths and other dimensions
*Item cquantities9 of a 'typical' element. (13y applying local rates to these quantities, the engineers shouldl be able to estimate how much this kind
of element would cost in their situation.)

(Many other DPEP states have very similar designs.)
It can be seen that these proposals have not resulted in any change to the onginal designs. In fact, the elements now seem to be a part of them.The
BPEP                         proposals are shown here as case studies.
N  o                         Upon going through this booklet, one c-an see that these elements are low in cost andi are easy to construct. They dlo not need any special technical
A& W                ~~~~~~know-how, or new materials. Also, they can mostly bec incorporated into anty existing deCsign or buildiing. With the help of this document, all OPEF
engineers, will be able to easily design, estimate andi implement child-friendly elements into their schools.

AcCe55 Ramp5s
Ramps should be provded to help physically disabled
children to climb the pinth of the school.
P[acemenTt4
The ramp should be straight as far as possible. It _
should never turn sharply. If it does, a flat landeing
should be given at the turming point.                                   /
Normally, the ramp leads up to the verandah, which
leads to the classroom. The ramp should be placed in                                    ;
such a way that the child can go easily frorn the ramp
to the classroom door. The child should not need to
turn sharply to do this.
-~~~~~~~~~~~
The walking surface should be non slip. Here waiste stone
chips have been used.
S~~                                                                                                                               I

Con5truction
A rarnp can be madec by simply creating a sloped surface with toe walls on the

Walking 5urface
The walkirig surface should be just rough enuh to preverTt slipping, but smooth
enough so as to not have ary holes. Bnck pav.'ng is a c-ommon finish. IP5 cemient
