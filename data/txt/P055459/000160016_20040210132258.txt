Our Team
The aim of this programme is to
involve you and your village directly in
the civil works activities. You will be
entrusted with the responsibility of
getting the works constructed. You will
| be provided with the funds and technical
suport of engineers (in the manner
expkairied iuier). Your responsihiNity is to
procure materiais, provide / employ

that would be responsible for civil
works.
For this purpose you must form a
Village Construction Committee (VCC).
This must happen in a full meeting of
the VEC. During this meeting, five
members must be chosen in the
following pattern:
I  President  Woman member of the
5 * Secretary- School teacher (member
of VEC)                                        co

What will the members of our
team  do ?
The VCC 
The first task of the VCC is to mobilise
the village. You must involve them and

keep them informed of the construction           5f OfNe4.TION
works. The   VCC   must ensure   co-       c   - AMK1MI6tN( WMAITEAL
operation  and   support   for   the             UCTION At> TM AUNA&-
programme from the entire village.
Next, you must make a suitable site
available for the construction work.
Once the works starts the VCC has
three main responsibilities:
You   must   procure  the   materials
prudently after determining the best
quality and price available.
You must ensure    that wastage   of
material or labour is kept to a minimum.
You must ensure that the quality of
construction is not compromised and
that the work is completed in time

Step Four - Construction of the bui/dinq
Getting the money for the job It is advisable that you divide respQnsibilities
clearly amongst itself. To do this smaller groups should be formed within the VCC
Iincluding:-
A purchase group responsible for all the material purchasing required
An accountsgroup, responsible for keeping all bills and accounts
A supervision group, responsible for the day-to-day check on the works along
with  keeping any records that may be required
Procurement of materials
,T,L Purchase Group wili be inchar'ge of the purchase of maTeriais. Tkey must sv
the amount of materials as specified in Section =:rof this manual. Before buyino the
malerials you must compare the prices between a few shops. You must also check the
* qua!.t of the materials. Section 1 Z explains how t he quality of materials car b:
checked, Be sure to take bills for all the materials you buy. Give all the. bills "c the
Accounts Group
Accounts Croup
*      The Accounts Group will be responsible to keep a record of all the mone.;
received and spent for materials and labour. It is very important to keep the accounts
neatly and properly. The format in which the accounts are to be kept is given below.
The Accounts Group must also inform the Engineer when half the installment;
money is spent. The engineer will then see the accounts and send a request for the f
* next installment to be given.
If the record of acounts are not not kept properly, or the engineer is pot
j informed in advance, the release of money may be delayed and the work may have to
stop.
Supervision 6roup
The Supervision Group has a very important role to play. They must be present
on site every day to check that the works are being done properly. Please read I
through Section II and III carefully. These sections explain clearly how the work
will be done and how you can check if the work is being done properly. Take this manual
to the site everyday and refer to it while you check the work. Use the checklists given,
to see if the work is being done properly. Mark on the manual itself as the work gets
done.
If you have a'ny difficulty in understanding the manual, ask the engineer to
explain it to you.

FOUNDATION
What is the foundation7
The foundation is the part on which
entire building rests. It is constructed           '" o",vou
below the ground. You will not be able to
see it once the building is complete.
However, the strength and life of your
building depends on it.
Prior to the construction of the
bwilding, earth is dug up and a thick "wall"
is built inside this excavated portion. This
thick wall is the foundation. It may be
twice or even thrice the thickness of the
wall above the ground depending on the
number of floors in your building.
Why is it required ?                                /.
The  foundation  is required  to                         T E
provide stability to the walls and ensure
that your school does not settle with
time. The foundation gives your building
strength in two, ways: First, it prevents
the wall from falling side ways. Secondly,
it ensures that the building does not                                        Al
settle down into the soil due to its own
weight.
As we dig into the earth, the soil
generally becomes harder and harder. In
some places we may even find stones and
rocks when we dig into the earth. By
building into the ground, we make the wall
more stable. It will not fall easily even if
it is pushed from the side. Also, if it is
built on hard ground, the building will not
settle easily.



What are    the  different  types  of
foundations ?
Different types of soil are found in
different places. The type of soil, the
water table and the type of building        A
determine  the  type   of  foundation
required.
* In places where the soil is hard and
rocky the foundation need not be very
deep. Normally, the depth   of the
foundation would be about 3 feet.                   Se          WITH
* In places where the soil is sandy we
must dig deeper.  The depth of the
foundation would be about 5 feet or
until hard or rocky soil is found.
* We must be very careful about black-
cotton soil. In black cotton soil the  !
foundation must be constructed very           ''=      X
carefully. This is explained in detail on
the next page.
Does your villaqe have black cotton
soil?
Black-cotton soil should be avoided
wherever possible. If there is no better
site available, great care should be taken  * 
while constructing the building.                   ON L-AN FILLW OVeX
It is very dangerous to construct f             ..I 
your school buildings on filled-up sites.                  ,r.
F/l/ed-up sites should never be used for
constructing7 build/nqs.

o-ther soil conditions? .             0     vCH\   CK LIST         0
Hard soil : In hard or rocky soils the
foundation may be shallow. Generally, the
depth of the foundation is not %more than
3 feet.
* The trench is dug as per the lines
marked-out by the mason.
• After excavation  a layer of lean    >,
concrete 3-4" thick is laid. The width

DAMP PROOF COURSE (0PC)                I
9tOU~~NO ToC% r R
What is damp-proofinqgX
.amp proofing is normally laid as a
thick   layer  of   cement   concrete.
Alternatively a layer of sand-stone may be
laid. It is used to prevent damp f rom
getting into the walls of your school.                 _____
However, if a plinth beam is constructed, 
I the damp proofing layer is not required.
Damp proofing is laid above the
foundation masonry. Above this the walls {   .
are constructed.                       :eco
e D*,; eO
j  Why is it required?
It is required to prevent water                      7     AYi OF 4P5TOSJ
(dampness) from the ground rising into
the walls. Dampness reduces the strength I
I nf the wall. It also makes the paint and
plaster fall off from the wall. The damp
proof layer prevents this from happening
as water cannot pass through it.
,*  ow is it /aid? 
Any one of the following may be
used as a damp proof layer:
Sandstone: A layer of concrete is
laid over the foundation masonry to
create a level surface. Slabs of                bA AE    FI-4T 
sandstone 1.5" thick are laid above             L.A     'T - IS, T
this. The slabs must be laid at the
leve.l of the finished floor.
. tamD   Proof  Course: A    cement
concrete. layer, 1.5" thick (bPC) may
be laid in place of the sandstone. The
mortar must be a rich cement mix. A
water-proofing chemical should also

be added to the concrete as per the
instructions provided with the water-
proofing compound.                                      KLS

this with a water level as shown in the

If the DPC is lower than this than
the damp will rise from the floor into the
wGlls of your school. If it is higher then
the damp will be able to rise into a part of
the wall in any case. This is why the
proper position of the 3PC is at the same
level as the finished floor.



WALLS                                           s      4R >
Why are walls required?
We all know that the walls
and roof provide us with shelter. Walls
are required not only for shelter but also
to make the building strong and stable. It
Is on the walls that the roof rests.
What is the wall built of?
Bricks, stone and concrete
blocks are some of the typical wall                _4
materials.
Bricks: Unburned bricks and over-
burnt bricks must not be used for
construction. If they are used they
will reduce  the  strength  of the
I    building. Good bricks should be of
uniform size, will not have cracks and
will not break easily.
Stone:  Uncoursed   stone  masonry
should not be used as far as possible ..
Concrete blocks:
fIlow do we know if the walls are
beinq constructeddproperly?
You can easily check if the walls of
your  school  are   being  constructed
carefully and properly.                         Tht nKSic URSF 
i Tf bricks are being used in the I
construction  then they must be
soaked (immersed) in water for at
least one hour prior to construction.
* Cement and  sand should be mixed
thoroughly  while they  are  dry.
Cement mortar must not be used
more than half an hour after water
is added. So, only so much mortar
*  -<                       * I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'~



(wet mix) must be prepared as con               C X  V CECK LU,a
be used immediately.
While laying the bricks, the mason
should use a centre-line to ensure
i I    that the wall is being constructed
properly.
. The cement mortar joints must be      .<.                      .
8mm thick. The mortar should not |                -                      l
be more than lcm thick as this       _     -.- 
reduces the strength of the wall.    1.   -heck   uovme
. After every   three  courses the
mason should check plumb. Plumb is                                 -0
checked with a plumb-bob to see
that the wall is being constructed
vertically and not tilting to one side.
I   The mason must also check level and
line. The water level 4s used to
check and maintain the level of the                            .,,i l -
corner bricks. Then string is tied to
these corner bricks and used to
maintain  the  line  of  all the   I      E
intermediate bricks in the course.              c      2.    .          4
I   The  bricks  /  stone  must  be
staggered when they are laid. This              Y -1;c US  .rsne  orCe4r  F
means that each brick must rest .et                X&              ons.
half on one brick and half on the                    _-
next one. Ensure that bricks are not
laid exactly one on top of the other.
Similarly, at the corners where two
walls meet, the bricks must overlap.
This way the two walls are joined          (VATICALJONTS)
together and become stronger. If
the bricks are not staggered the
walls will not be joined together.
This way the walls of your school l41   iorid
building will not be strong and it may
collapse after some time.

DOORS AND WINDOWS
Why are windows required?                     ii   '
All schools are designed to
have windows with shutters. Windows are                          9
required to ensure that the classrooms        i    ,             .    -_r
receive adequate light and ventilation.
Providing  shutters  ensures  that the
windows can be closed when the weather        LET IN LI1( M  VENTILATION

It is important to ensure that                          1
doors and windows are fixed properly. If                         i

Plumb The door and window frames                6
must be plumb (i.e. they must be

LINTELS                                               7
What are lintels ?                                 I Z   --
Lintels are the part of the wall           J   l
exactly  above  the  door and  window
openings. The lintel is constructed to be
one complete piece. It is normally a stone
slab or a concrete beam which spans the
opening.
i  Why ore linte/s required?
An opening in the wall has to be
rmade for doors and windows. To hold up
the wall above the opening, lintels are
required. The lintel may be made of stone,
RCC or brick.
H How do we know if they ore beinq
constructed properly?
There are many things that you can .
check to see   if the  lintel is being
cinstructed properly.
Level: Check to see that the lintels are
being place exactly horizontal. The mason  I.Q   ,     LeM 9h          _ 
will check this with a water-level as          t           U4- J
explained eariier. All lintels must be at
the same height.                       (K.    r…X
gearinq : All lintels must have a bearing of  I
at ieast 4.5". This means that at least 4 5"  )l 11  e         s-
cf the l:ntel must be resting on the wall on4 5
either side. So, if you are buying stone                     I            F
slabe for the lintels, make sure that they  2.J  n       ;      KS 45     F
are at least 9" longer than the span of the i      6
opening.
Cha io .All the windows of your school
must be protected by a projection. If the
window is flush with the wall then a chajja.



must be provided. For this purpose a
Stone slab of adequate width could be
used. If RCC is being used then the chajja
should be cast along with the lintel.      0
As explained   later (Roofs  and
Beams), all RCC works must be cured for
at least one week to ensure that I is
strong enough.

BEAMS AND ROOF
What are beams and roofs ?
Beams . Buildings like your school have
rooms of a large size. It is not possible to
ioy a roof over such a large area in one
piece. So beams are used to span the
classroom. On top of the beams, the roof
is laid. You can see the beam from inside
the room. It may be of RCC, steel or even                  -
stone.,                                                      ,
Roof . The    roof is what gives us
protection. It is constructed on the walls.
If both sides of a room are larger than 10
to 15 feet, the roof will require the
support of beams as well.
Poofs can be flat or sloping. In
a-reas where there is heavy rain or snow  0
fall, the roof should be sloping. The roof
is typically made of PCC or stone slabs.
f/ow are roofs constructed ?
RCC Roofs . The construction of RCC                    11,       *
roofs is a complicated process and must  ."
be checked carefully.
Shutterinq . Beforethe construction of
RCC works, a shuttering or framework is
made which would support the concrete                                      i .
sliab, beam or coiumn for the first few I  l.. Cheky Nri     n  ,
weeks. Roof shutterina is in the formti of [    h            at&  ct1      A
poles (usually wood) over which woodden I
flats and panels are fixed.
Re-Mnforcement .- Steel bars are laid over                              0
the shuttering and tied together with   .
steel wire.
Pourinq concrete . Over this framework
the concrete is to be poured. This is

known as the casting of the slab. The
entire roof slab must be cost in one day.
Compaction: After the concrete it must              V
be compacted. This must be done with
rods (durmut) and planks.
Curing: .Like plants and trees concrete
work also requires watering if it is to
grow strong) Luckily, you have to water it
for fourteen days only!! The concrete
must never become dry throughout these
fourteen days. If possible the slab must         It                i
be kept submerged in water.                      L)              1         1

CHECKING MATERIAL QUALITY
Bricks must be strong andl not
Dreck easily. To know if the bricks are of
proper quality you can try the following
tests:                                          r
. Raise the brick to a height above
your head and drop it. If the bricks  6.J  Ensurc pr.rco*      n*
brecks, if is not it good quality.
Take two bricks in your hand and s                            w_    i4
bang them against each other. If           ( 
either one breaks then the bricks
are not of good quality.                 ..
* Put a few bricks in a bucket of
water and leave it over-night. If
the bricks dissolve by the morning,  y r                        .
they are not of good quality.      *5
Try these test on a number of bricks.
Only if the bricks are strong should n_                          }    
you buy them.                      I
Sometimes the shop keeper may show
you good quality of bricks for testing
and actually supply poor quality bricks.
Ensure that he supplies the same
quality bricks that you have tested,
Steel d Joists                     /Y
