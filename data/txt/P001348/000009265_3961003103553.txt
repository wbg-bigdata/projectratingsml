ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA
FOR A PAIP1SATM RME  AMA3O
TACLA AS&E  PROJET
I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommeaions on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Kenya for SDR 16.10 million (US$23.32 million
equivalent) to help finance a Parastatal Reform and Privtization Project. Ihe credit would be on
standard IDA terms, with a murity of 40 years. The U.K. Oversea Develaopent Association
has ageed to provide the project with co-financing of about US$4.18 million equivaien  Other
donors prving co-fiancing include the EEC, UNDP and the Netherlands.
EART I: COUNTRY POLICIES AND BANK GROUP'S
ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
1.1   The Board last disused the Country Policies and Bank Group's Assistance Str   for
Kenya on September S, 1991, when the Education Sector Adjustmen Credit (EDSAC) was
presented. Bank Group assistance continues to be governed by ihat strategy.
A. BACKGROUND
1.2 Kenya is a low-income country which had a per capita imcome of $340 in 1991. Its
popultb growth rate has fallen to 3.6 percent but this remains one of the highest in the world.
Some thre quas of the country is cssified as aid or semi-arid (ASAL). The ecomy is
heavily dependent on agriculture, which employs about 80 percent of the labor force and
ctut more than one quarter of GDP. Coffee and tea accoun for close to one half of
merchandise exports. Mhe service sector accounts for about 45 perenit of GDP and is an
impont source of enmloyment. It includes tourism which in recent years has become Kenyas
leadig foreign exchange eaner. The manufactrIg sector is relatively developed and
dvesHied, contrte about 12 percent of GDP and employs close to 8 percent of the labor
force. The sector, however, has been producing mainly for a protected domesdc market.
Pa%uatals account for about one quarter of the value added in manufacturing, and 11 pecent of
GDP.
1.3   Four phases cm be distinguished in Keya's economic peomance since Indepece in
1963: (a) rapid growth and low inflation in the first decade until 1973; (b) slower growth and
ring iflation durig 1973-80, due to adverse terms of trade and the emergence of structural and
policy-induced  ntrain  in agriculture and ma  ing; (c) serious macroeconomic
imbalances and low growth during 1980-8S, caused mainly by the second oil shock in 1979, the
erosion of fiscal discipline and a severe drought in 1984; and (d) renewed economic growth
duing 1986-90, largely the result of structural reforms and progress toward stabilization.



-2-
However, 1991 saw renewed destabilizing fiscal pressures, a weaker reform effort and slower
growth. Fiscal discipline improved by mid-1992 but monetary expansion has continued (paras.
1.6-1.10) and performance on structural reforms has betn mixed (paras. 1.19-1.22).
B. RECENT STABilZATION EFFORITS
1.4   During 198687, the G;overnment begM implementig a major stabilizaton and
adjustment program supported by the IMP ttiough a stand-by arrangement and a SAF (ater
converted into an ESAF). Support from the Bank was provided through sectr adjustment
operations in agriculture, industry, the financial sector, expott development and educatio (pam.
1.19-1.22). Several donors co-financed these operations.
1.5   Since 1987 Kenya's stabilization efforts have been uneven and therefore, have produced
mixed results. The budget deficit was reduced from 6.6 percent of GDP (including grants) in
FY87 to 4.5 percent in FY90 primarily through efforts to limit the growth in development
expenditu   and contain the growth in the employment of civi servants. Meanwhile, high
aggegate demand, International price increases and an accommodaiing monetary policy 4teled
domestic inflation, which remained above 10 perwant throughout 1988-90. During this period, the
Govaerments exchange rate policy wis appropriate but the etWnal account was adversely
affeted by deteriorating terms of trade, especia1ly low coffee prices and high oil prices.
Nonethless, Kenya was able to meet on time its external debt service obligations which averaged
over 35 percent of export earings. (Table 1.1).
1.6   The Gulf crisis and the deteriorat  terms of trade weakened the balance of payments in
late 1990 and early 1991. To restain the growth in aregate demand and, therby, reduce
prssures on the extenal account, the Government revised its fiscal deficit target for FY91 from
3.8 percent of GDP (including grnUts) to 2.5 percent of GDP. However, effots to control the
fiscal deflcit and credit expnson in FY91 were inadequate. Instead of falling, the budget deficit
rose sharply to 7.1 percent of GDP in FY91 (Table 1.1). Meanwhile, the net domestic assts of
the banki system increase by 23.3 percent in 1991 compared with a progrmmed increase of
10 percent
1.7   The FY92 budget, a read before Parliament in June 1991, lowered the deficit target to 2
percent of GDP (imcluding grants). New revenue-raising measures were inroduced. Also, In an
attempt to tighten expenditure, a high level budget review committee at the Ministry of Fane
met each month and inteified monitoring of the fiscal situation. Cash management by the
officers of all ministries was also enhanced.
1.8    Nonetheless, mid-way through FY92 (Der 1991), the full year budget deficit was
projected at well above the origial 2 percent target primarily due to a sizable Suppleme
Budget, enditure over   In a number of the large mhdstries, the assumption of signficant
amounts of parastatal external debt service obligations, and continuing weakess  in tax
adminitration  Meanwhile, the current account of the balance of paymens improved In 1991,
mostdy becas the Government canceled or postponed non-essental imports. Inflation increased
from 15.7 percent in 1990 to 19.6 percent in 1991.

1.9   Pardy becase of the deteriorating macroeconomic policy performance, and party in
concer over Increasngly poor governan, donors at the Consultative Group (CG) meeting in
November 1991, decided to postpone aid pledges and agreed that there should be fiurther
consultains in about six months to review progress in a number of areas. Later, in December
1991, the IMF was unable to complete the mid-term review of the third year of the ESAF becaue
Kenya missed three of the four ESAF quantitative performance criteria. However, after another
round of consultations between the IMF and the Government in April 1992, a Shadow Program
was agreed and the Government adopted new measures to achieve fiscal compression during the
latter part of the fiscal year, in line with a revised deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP (including
grants). During this period the monitoring of unauthorized overdrafts by Minitres was
tigened, and higher VAT rates were levied on oil products, soft drinks, beer and tobacco
producs. A panel of enior permanent secretaries also undertook a review of own-financed
development projects and stopped several low-priority investmenrs which were not at an advanced
stage oi Implemetation. During the last six weeks of FY92, the Government froze al
expende (commt  and cash), except wages, salaries and essential services.
1.10 An IMFtIDA mission conducted an interim review of the Shadow Program in September
1992. It found preliminary indications that fiscal discipline had increased and that this had helped
to reduce the fiscal deficit to about 3.8 percent of GDP (including grant, commitment basis) for
FY92. But although the growth in expenditure and credit to the Central Government slowed, the
money supply has continued to expand by about 20 percent per annum. The expansion has been
driven largely by the access of a number of distressed banks to the overdraft facility of the
Central Bank and signals a failure to enforce prudential regulations. This has fuelled ina
(which reached over 25 percent in June 1992 on a year-over-year basis), rendered open market
operations ineffective, increased pressures for large wage increases in the Central Government,
tred real deposit interest rates negative and eroded real producer incenives. In turn, higher
inflation seriously undermined some of the recent positive developments in the foreign exchage
regime-including the Introduction of convertible foreign exchange bearer certificates (FOREX-Cs)
in October 1991-by causing the real effective official exchange rate to appreciate, and widening
the sra between this rate and the premum on FOREX-Cs. Arrears on extel debt are also
accumlating. Several measures in the IMF Shadow Program address these macroeconomic
difficulties. Their implemeon and impact are scheduled for review by the IMF in Janwury
1993.
C. DEVELOpM bT sRTEGY AND MIUM-TERM ECONOMIC FRAMEWORIK
1.11   The Govenent's Strategy. The Governmen's long-tena development strategy is
articlated in Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1986, Economic Management for Renewed Growth, and
the series of policy framework papers (PFPs), including the most recent one which covers
1991192-93194. lhe Sessional Paper emphasizes the need to creae productive employment
oppornities for a labor force that is expected to increase annually by about 400,000 entrns
over the next 15 years. GDP growth is to be generated primarily by the private sector. 'he
Gov 'ments role increasingly is expected to be the provision of an appropriate enabling
environmenlt for private sector development rather than direct participation in economic activity.
The sategy, which is sound, emphasizes the need to stghen lins between rural non-frm
activities and the formal sector, and restucture manufactring to improve efficiency and enhace



export competitiveness. It ailo calls for sound macroeconomic management involving the
reduction in the fiscal and external deficits, and a contractionary monetary stance.
1.12 When formulated in 1991, the PFP for 1991192-93/94 specified the aims of the
Government as: achieving output growth of over 5 percent; reducing inflation to the average level
forecast for Kenya's main trading partners (about 5 percent); and reducing the external current
account deficit to a susinable level of 2.8 percent Including grants by 1993/94. Toward this
end, the Government indicated that it would: (a) downsize the parastatal sector and limit the
growth in the civil service; (b) reduce the budget deficit to levels which do not crowd out the
private sector, and which can be sustained by foreign and non-inflationary domestic financing; (c)
limit the use of new non-concessional external financing; (d) pursue a flexible exchange rate
policy; (e) reorient trade and industrial incentives to reduce the anti-export bias, encourage
efficiency, promote the growth of non-tradidonal exports, and encourage domestic and foreig
invesmt; (f) rationalize the b-.dget by limiting public sector employment and improving the
quality and implemenion of the public investment program (PIP); and (g) fiurther improve
farmer incentives, agricultur input supply and agricultural services, particularly for
smallholders. hIe Shadow Program of April 1992 supports the broad objectives and strategy of
the PFP.
D. COUNTRY ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
1.i13 Objectives. The Bank shares the vision of the Sessional Paper No. 1. Accordingly,
IDA's country assisace strategy has four main objectives: (a) encouraging the Government to
provide a stable mareconmic enironment; (b) supporting changes in the incentive framework
and infrastructure that would facilitate the development of an efficient and export-oriented private
sector; (c) significandy increasing the efficiency of the public sector, including the parstatals; and
(d) addressing longer-term human resource issues and arresting the deterioration of Keonyas
fragile environment. IDA Is pursuing these objectives through policy-based sector adjustment
lending, investment lending and economic and sector work QA"SW) in priority areas.
1.14 Priorifies. The priority areas for IDA's country assistance are: (a) improving publc
sector efficiency, by conaining fiscal expansion, improving the efficiency of public spending,
rationalizing public sector employment, and limiting the scope and size of the parastatal sector.
This objective Is being pursued through, inter alia, the Parastatal Technical Assin   Credit in
support of parastat reform, and through EDSAC which was approved by the Board in 1991.
Ihe latter focuses on fiscal containment of the largest public-spending sector (para. 1.22); (b)
developing an export-oriented private sector to reduce depndence on foreign sains. Supot
for these efforts is being provided through policy-based lending-the Agriculture Sector
Adjusment Operations (ASAOs) and the Export Development Program (EDP)-and infrastructure
investme  to relieve transport and other physical bottlenecks; and (c) st  the basis
for equitable and sustainable development, by addressing hulman resource and env m
issues. ITe human resource sategy is being implemented throu EDSAC, and inestment
operations for the universities, health rehabilitation and population. The Prtcted Areas and
Wildlife Project, which was approved in 1992, is providing assistance in the area of wildlife and
vonment managemnt (Table 1.2).

1. 1S   Cunrent Status ot Country Assistance. Kenya has received six sector adjusutm  credits
since 1986. The sector  approach to adjustment was adopted for three main rzasons: (a) two
SALs in the early 1980s were largely unsuccessfiul because of limited implementation capcity,
inadequate preparatory economic and sector work, unrealistic time schedules for Implementation,
and unwarted optim   about the likely impact of adjustment; (b) sectoral programs stressed
incremental changes that were implementable and politically sustainable; and (c) sector ministries
were expected to eoxercise greater ownersiip and accountability if they were difretly iolved in
the design and implementation of the reforms.
1.16   After the conditionality had been met, the final tranches of ASAO I, the Industial Sector
Adjustment Credit (SAC) and the Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) were disbursed In
1988, 1990 and 1991, respectively. However, the Bank is holding socond tranche releases of
ASAO H, EDP, and EDSAC because of the Government's recent poor m   nic
management (paras. 1.6-1.10) and failure to meet sector-spocific conditions. This is consistent
with the country assistance strategy articulated in February 1991 and discussed by the Board in
September 1991. It calls for a reduction in the proposed lending program under two sets of
circumstances. First, in the event that macroeconomic management remains sound, but progrss
on the proposed adjustment operations proves difficult or is delayed, the particular adjstment
operation and assoated IDA projects would be dropped from the lending program in that year.
Second, in the event that the macroeconomic framework is no longer on track, IDA would cut
back the lending program by dropping all adjustment lending and those investmt projects which
would not be viable in such an environment. The second situation now obtains in Kenya.
Accordingly, IDA is expected to commit only about $60 million for projects in FY93-the
parastatal reform technical assistance project, an agricultural sector management project and a
drought recovery project-compared with $339 million wbich was committed in FY92 for
adjustment programs and investment projects.
1.17 The resumption of disbursements from ongoing adjustment operations would require
continued fiscal discipline, significant monetary tightening and implemenion of agreed sectoral
reform measures. Furthermore, for the Bank to consider adjustment operations in the fire, the
Government needs to adopt viable macroeconomic policies, make progress on agreed sectora
reforms, and demonst  a strong commitment to much improved publc sector management.
Specificaily, this entails: (a) progress in implementing a strong and tran parast l refm
program; (b) commitment and inital steps toward a comprehensive civil service reform program;
and (c) improvements in the efficiency of public expenditures, especily a well-prioritized public
investme  program (PIP) (paras. 1.24-1.29). The Government also needs to demonsta
commitment to private sector development by adopting measures which improve macroeconomic
management, and the regulatory and incuive framework (par. 1.30-1.33).
1.18   At the same time, the straty calls for a continuation of ESW. The reason is that ESW
enhces the policy dialogue and strengthens aid coordination. Of course, it also meets the
nalytical needs of the current and prospective lending program. At present, it is focused on
three key areas of the country strategy: (a) deepening structural adjustment in order to accelerate
growth and employment; (b) rationalizing public expenditures; and (c) addressing longer-term
issues of sustainable and equitable development. The recent country economic memorandum
(CEM) focused on the linkages between public sector adjustment, and stabilization and growth.
The CEM for FY93 is addressing the issue of employment creation. A private sector asesmet

by IDA is at an advanced stage of preparation. A public expenditure review is scheded to begi
In mid-FY93 and a povet proflle will be completed early In FY94.
Poligy Reform Issues
1.19   Adjustment Undermined by Stabllizdtlon Problems and BackTraclh ng. Kenyes first
seor adjustment credit-ASAO I-was approved in 1986 and included measures to improve the
timelins, availability and applicaion of key agricultural Inputs, enhance innives to farmers,
tionalize public expenditures, amd restructr key agriculu  partatals. Indeed, producer
prices were improved, feilizer imports and prices were liberalized, and meat prices were
decontrolled. However, progress in eliminating movement controls on maize was slow due to
Government concens over food security and a lack of commitment by the implementg agenc.
The parastta restucturing was also slower than expected. ASAO) U was a follow-on operation
and was intended to broaden and deepen the policy reforms begun under the previous operatio,
including the eliminaion of cotrols in maize marketing. But at end-October 1992, sveral of the
sector-specific conditions for releasing the second tranche of ASAO II had not been met.
1.20  ISAC was approved in 1988. I objectives were to: initate the process of import
liberalization by introducing a system of automatic licensing for most imports and replacing
quantitative restrictions with equivalent tariffs for a large number of imports; decontrol prices of
selected commodities; Improve investment incentives; and begin the process of reforming two
development finance instituions (DFIs). Progress in implementing the program was satsfactory
In all areas and the second tranche of the credit was released on schedule in October 1989. The
Import licensing system was liberalized in principle, although long administive delays are now
apparent. Meanwhile, the maximum t       declined from 170 percent to 60 percet wbile the
number of tariff rates    from 24 to 10. The remainig quantitve restrictions on imports,
which in 1987/88 covered 24 percent of all imported items, were eliminated except for items
reicted for security, environmental and health reasons Oess than one percent). Exot
incentives are being improved and a privae export processing zone has begu opeations. Price
contls have been substantially reduced. The marginal company tax rate was lowered from 45
perent to 35 percent and the DPI restructuring was initiated. A follow-on opeation (EDP)
focusing on export development was presented to the Board in December 1990. In August 1992
the Government began serious attmpts to meet the sector-specific conditos for the release of the
second wanche of EDP. At present, a few outstanding sector-specific issues remain
1.21   PSAC was approved in 1989 to support the first phase of refoms in the financial sect
and was disbursed as scheduled. Under this operation interest rates were liberalized, open market
opetions were introduced, baking legisaton was modernized, and staff of the Cental Bank
were trained in bank supervision. A number of troubled financial instiutons were restuced
and the opeation of the Stock Excnge were streamlined. However, there are inraing
concerns about: (a) weaknesses in prudendal supevision; and (b) the financial distress of some
istiutions whose problems were not addressed under PSAC. These combined wealmesses are
now undermining the objectives of financial reform and raising concerns about the stability of the
finanial system.
1.22  In 1991, the Goverment embraced educadon reforms under EDSAC. The aim was to
reduce the rapid growth in public spending on education which had become fiscally unsstnable
and, because it is exclusively driven by excessive recruitment of teachers, has crowded out non-



-9 -
wage ependitures. It has also severely imjacted on the qualkt of public educaion. Measures
were agreed to reduce the rate of growth of the recurrent budget for education; expand access to
education and Increas retention at the primary and secondary levels; enhance the quality and
relevance of education at all levels; and strengthen sector management and planning. In addition,
in early 1992, the Government Introduced user charges In public universities. Implementaion of
EDSAC generally has been good but further actions are required in some areas to meet the sector
specific conditions for second tranche release.
1.23   At present, the dialogue on sectoral adjustment continues with the Kenyan Authorities, In
the context of tmauche release conditions for EUSAC, EDP and ASAO Il.However, the overal
effectiveness of the sectoral reforms which are in place is being seriously compromised by
recurring stabilization problems which are linked to inaction and back-tracking on public sector
issues. Paras. 1.6-1.10 have already explained that in FY91 the fiscal deficit widened, monetary
growth quickened and inflation rose. At the same time, evidence indicated that dinisraive
controls on imports and maize movement were re-emerging. Analysis also showed that the public
sector was: (a) eroding the gkowth in total factor productivity and national income; (b)
undermining the private sector's ability to respond to the reform measures introduced since 1986;
and (c) discouraging private invement by creating an uncertain business environment which Is
characteized by government interfence and corruption. The corollary is that public sector
adjustment is of the bighest priority for stabilization and growth in the short as well as long-term.
1.24  PubUc Sector Adj ent Urgently Needed. Stabilization and accelered growth
require inter alia significant improvements in the efficiency of current and development
expendits, and part  reform. Improving the efficiency of current expet     requires
tackling the civil service wage bill and the underlying strucural factors which drive it-the
complex organization and functions of the central government, overstaffing and the deteriorating
poductivity of the civil service. Over the medium- and long-erm, comprehensive civil service
reform should aim tO improve organizational synergy, reduce vacancies at higher levels of the
sevice, rmse wage mpession, and raise substantaialy exenditure on non-wage oprations
and maence (O&M). Ihe Govarnment has accepted the need for civil service reform and in
early 1992 prepared a detailed action plan. However, this action plan reman an intnal
working document; the extent of the Government's commitment to the reform proposals is
unknown.
1.25 Efforts to improve the efficiency of public expenditures have included the budget
raionalization program (BRP) and public investment program3nin. lhe BRP was epected to
acieve its objective, in part by ensuring the provision of adequate resources for O&M, and by
concentrating financial and managerial resoi V es on a smaller munber of high-priority projects.
Ihe need for the BRP stemmed from the Government's recognition of the principal limitation of
the budgetary process, nmely, the absence of a clear prioritization of expendues. One
consequence was that ministries frequentiy violated expenditure ceilings set by the Trasury.
Anher was a blurring of the distnction between recurrent and development estmates, with
Ministries atemptng to finance underfAuded items in the former through the latter.
1.26 To date the BRP has achieved some success in process issues but this has not translated
it a more efficient allocation and udlization of expenditure. On the contray, the ratio of O&M
expenditure to personne expelnditures continued to decline even after the BRP was Introduced.
For Instce, between FY81 and FY86, non-wage O&M declined as a perntage of tota



-10-
recurent expenditures from 36 percent to 26 percent. Since FY86, when the BRP was
Intrduced, it declined even further to 22 percent. The decline was even more pronounced in
somn3 sectors. The following two factors are among the reasons why the BRP has failed to
achieve its targets. First, personnel emoluments were a significant and seemingly intractable
amount of recurrent expenditure while the share of interest payments doubled. Second, because
the burden of expenditure cuts fell primarily on nonwage recurrent expenditure, ministries
depended on the development budget to finance O&M. Subsequently, releases from the
development vote have become more erratic. Ministries have reacted to this by turning more and
more to the donor-financed portion of the development budget for the funding of their non-wage
O&M. Consequently, they have been reluctant to reduce the number of projects in their
portfolios as this would limit the number of candidates for aid funds.
1.27 Not surprisingly, the designation of projects as high priority in Kenya's PIP does not
appear to be based on any economic analysis or sectoral strategy. Tbis is the case,
notwithstanding the fact that the PIP comprises three main elements needed for well-founded
prioritization: (a) policy statements and lists of priority activities prepared by ministries and some
state corporations; (b) an enumeration of projects together with information on their total
estimated costs, cumulative expenditures, and the balance required for completion; and (c)
expenditure phasing for each project. Furthermore, the absence of recurrent cost estimates for
projects is another major deficiency. Ihe challenge for the Government is to reintroduce
elements of financial planning and discipline into the budgetary process, including the
programming of public investment.
1.28 Parastatal reform is also crucial if Kenya is to attain its medium-term stabilization and
growth objectives, and improve the longer term prospects for sustained and accelerated private
sector development. The reasons are three-fold. Fhrst, data for 1986-90 show that the
produtivity of the sector worsened by about 2 percent anmnlly. During the same period, the
prgoductiity of the private sector improved by around 5 percent each year. Accordingly, Bank
estmates suggest that GDP growth during the period could have been at least 2 percentage points
higher per year if productivity growth in the parastatal sector were similar to that of the private
sector. This would cut the time for doubling Kenya's per capita income from approximately 35
years of GDP growth continues at historical levels) to around 17 years. Second, the parastatal
sector is a drain on the Government's budget. For instance, the net outflows from the Cental
Government budget to parastaas were equivalent to at least one percent of GDP in FY91, mainly
reflecting debt servica payments assumed by the Government and taxes collected but not remitted
to the Treasury. Thrd, releasing resources which are being used inefficiendy, reducing the
pressures on the fiscal deficit and eliminating statutory parastatal monopolies would all support
private sector development.
1.29 In 1991 the Government announced its intention to carry out a comprehensive parastatal
reform program. On July 1, 1992, the Government made public its Policy Paper on Public
Enterprise Reform and Privatization. It has also established a Parastawl Reform Policy
Committee (PRPC) to guide the divestiture process, a technical secretariat to support the work of
the PRPC and the Department of Government Investment and Public Enterprises which inter alia
will design and implement the reform of public enterprises. To date, divestitre and liqcauon
of a few enterprie is near completion and agreement has been reached on a target of at least 20
firms to be divested over the next sixteen months, out of the 207 enterprises identified for
pdvadzaton b:, 3OK. The Government has also defined major restructuring plans for five of the



-11-
largest 'strategic0 parastatals. MTe proposed actions will focus inter alia on: (a) orgzational
and operational restructuring, including the divestiture of 'non-core' activlties; (b) market
liberalization to encourage competition; and (c) the introduction of performance contats. In
addition, the Government has outlined a new system of corporate governance to rationalize the
relationship between the Govenment and the parastatal sector. The system requires that senior
appointments and compensation should be linked to ability and performance. The Parastat
Technical Assistance Project will assist the Govermment in implementing these difficult tasks.
1.30 Actions Required to Promote Private Sector Development. The on-going private sector
assessment by MDA has Identified several constraints to private sector development and investment
in Kenya. The main disincentive stems from the high levels of uncertnty associated with
conducting business in Kenya. Physical infrstructure is also a major constraint.
1.31   Apart from the destabilizing effects of macroeconomic Imbalances, uncertaity arises from
the discretionary treatment of businesses by Government. An example is the adoption of
automatic import licensing under ISAC and EDP (pars. 1.20), which was intended to reduce the
scope for the harassment (i.e. discretionary treatment) of businesses by the Govemment.
However, during periods of foreign exchange sbortages, the "automaticity of import licensing
dispea. Future reforms should focus on removing the licensing system all together.
Relatedly, in August, 1992, the Government introduced a very limited foreign exchange retention
scheme for non-traditional exporters. This scheme needs to be broadened considerably. The
coverge of the import duty/VAT exemption scheme should also be expanded, and fbreign
xchange and price controls elhiinated. There is also a need to improve the investment climate
by: (a) redefining the criteria applied by the Government in evaluating applications for investment
approvals so that the private sector has greater freedom to take appropriate commercial risks; (b)
removing all restrictive provisions of the Trade Licensing Act, thereby dereating retail and
wholesale trade; (c) simplifying tlve business registration process and licensing requirements; (d)
updating the legal provisions for bankruptcy and liquidation to improve speed and flexibility; and
(e) abolishing all parastatal monopolies of a statutory nature. At present, many of the Acts
establhing parastatals allow them to restrict and regulate the movement, use, storage, packagg
and prcing of the product or service in question.
1.32  In agriculture, uncertaity stems from the pervasiveness of controls, and delays in
payments to producers from Government controlted-marketing boards. Reforms should include:
(a) the elimination of all movement controls on maie, adminstered producer and consumer prices
and the marketing role of the National Cereals and Produce Board; @b) the remova of the miling
monopoly in coffee operated by the Kenya Planters Coopeatve Union, and the processing and
marketng monopoly for smallholder coffee given to the cooperative sector; (c) an irement in
the system of admstred payments to coffee processors and traders; (d) the phasing out of the
marketing functions of the Cotwon Board and the need for its approval for lint imports, divesting
te primary marketing functions of cooperatives, and introducing an open auction system for lint;
and (e) the elimination of government control of ownership, production, disbtion and prices in
the sugar sub-sector. In the financial sector, unceranty stems from the erratic performance of
the Central Bank in safeguarding the ingriy of the financial system. Ihere needs to be more
selective use of Cental Bank financing of insolvent financial institutions. Also, the Central Bank
should abandon its reliance on credit controls and resort to more Indirect and market-based
instruments of monetary management.



- 12 -
1.33   Another iimpiment to private sector development is the fact that although Kenas
physical inaue Is relatively developed, it is inadequately mainUined. Tbis is particularly
oticeable in the transport sector where sections of the highway system need complete
rehabiliton, and In Mombasa Port where efficiency has deteriorated markedly. Issues related to
cost recovery, the composition of expenditures, particularly inadequate allocations for nonwage
O&M, and procedures for allocating budgetary resurces, are common to most subsectors. The
delivery of cetain services, such as rural water and municipal services, Is also weak. Most towns
face severe financial containts and find it difficult to provide services (water, transport and
egy) for their growing populations.
1.34 Targeted Interventions Needed for the Poor. The Government needs to supplement its
growth-oriemed policies with clearly defined poverty alleviation initiatives. Indeed, the sheer
magnitude of the projected increases in the labor force-over 400,000 new entrants compared with
modern sector job creation (during 1986-90) of about 90,000 per annum-suggests that the
majority of potential new entrants will not find work and may end up living in poverty. At the
same time, the Government will face the difficult task of coupling fiscal prudence with
expditures which target the poor. This will be especially true in the provision of socia
services.
1.35   The resurgence of old diseases such as maia, growing regional and gender diqsaities in
terms of education, health and nutrition, and increasing population pressures on the envirment,
are some of the areas which need to be urgently addressed. Meanwhile, AIDS has become a
significant new public health problem. About 200,000 Kenyans are now estimated to be HIV-
positive and around 2,500 new AIDS cases are diagnosed annually. By mid-1991, about 10,000
AIDS cases had been recorded.
1.36 Efforts to improve access and raise the quality of social services should include stronger
attempts to reoriet public expenditures rather than increase them. One reason is that the
provision of social services already is a large claimant on the Govermnent's resources. In health,
outpatient charges were recently reintroduced in Nairobi along with a mechanm  to protect access
to medical services by disadvantaged groups. A direct charge for students in public universities
was also intoduced with provisions to assist individuals from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds. Still, continbutions by beneficiaries, especially in primary and secondary education,
e already a major item in many family budgets; increased contributions may conflict with the
investment outlays in farms and small businesses that are essential for private sector growth.
1.37   Poverty reduction in Kenya also requires efforts to increase women's agricultura
productivity and income. Ths stems from the migration of men to the cities leaving many
women with sole responsibility for sustaining their families. These households are generally
poorer than male-headed ones, with less access to land, credit and extemion services. EfWxts are
underay to identify ways of assisting women, reducing poverty among female-haded
households, increasing agricultural productivity, and Improving mitrition. The primary focus is
on reaching women through agricultura etension. However, greater attention should be placed
on expanding secondary school places for girls, and improving community-based water supply
schemes. Incrases In women's incomes will also have a direct bearing on efforts to reduce the
population growth rate (para. 1.40).



- 13 -
1.38  Sharper social targeting will impoii new and more complex demands on Kenyas
insttonal capacity for designing and implemendng human resource policies and Interveadons.
But although the Government has a relatively good capacity for the designing and Implementation
of surveys, there Is a need to improve the processing and analysis of data. A permanent
capability should also be developed to monitor the impact of policies on the most vulnerale
groups in Kenya and, through regular feedback, to inform policy design. This capability would
enable the fmmulation of a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction including a program of
well-targeted trnfers and safety nets. Hence, the shift from expansion to quality and equity
Improvements must be accompanied by a commensurate effort to build institonal capacity in tIe
human resource sectors.
1.39  Management of Environment DegrJation and Population Pressures Should Be
Strenlgthened. Poverty and population pressures on limited land resources are the main
ontributors to environmental degradadon in Kenya. Depletion of forests and woodlands is a
major cause of soil erosion and land degradation, contributing to reduced fertiity, lower water-
holding capacity, a reduction of dry season water resources, and the destruction of wildlife and
nral abitats. Environmental problems are particularly severe in ASAL regions, which are
more susceptible to ecological damage resultig from population pressures. Huma encroachment
i excerbaing conflicts with wildlife, particularly in dispersal areas around nadonal parks where
Increased faming activides are cuttng off wildlife's migratory routes and access to dry season
waer and pasture. In addition to its importance in terms of biodiversity and habitat presvaion,
wildlife is the cornerne of the toudsm industry. Aside from Its efforts to deal with forestry
issues, the Government has strenhened overall environmental management. Priorities are to
inprove policies and insttutions in the forestry sector, arrest the recent deterioration in the
wildlife sector, and formulate a strategy for environmenlly sustainable development in ASAL
areas. However, whUe the preparation of the strategy for the ASAL areas is proceeding apace,
work on the national environmental action plan (NEAP) has ewpeienced significant delays. IDA
wM shortly provide financial support for the preparation of NEAP but the success of the effort
wil depend ultimately on strong Government commitment.
1.40 Evidence from the 1989 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey points to a marked drop
in the fertlity rate-from 7.7 in 1984 to 6.7 in 1989. The Survey indicates widespread awareness
and approval of family planning and a sharp increase in the prevalence of moder contraceptive
methods. However, although the decline has been remarkable, Kenya's population wi contine
to grow rapidly because there are stUl large numbers of women entering their childbearing years.
Ihe challenge, therefore, is to strengthen the Government's family planning program not only to
flitate the pace of fertility decline in the short-run, but also sustain the pace over time.
1.41   Summing Up the Reform Agenda. The Government should proceed agessively and
decisively with public sector adjustment, including paras   reform. This is crucial to the
success of past sectora adjustment and growth. In addition, growth needs to rise and remain
above historica levels if Kenya is to reduce existing unemployment and absorb future large
increases in the labor force. This will require the sinultaneous implementaton of two sets of
strategies. First, the adoption of a comprehensive set of initatives aimed at speeding up public
sector adjustment (paras. 1.24-1.29) and the emergence of an outward looking private sector
(paras. 1.30-1.33). Second, reaching the poor must be a priority in its own right. Kenya's
achivements in terms of human resource development have been uneven among regions and
socioeconomic groups. Thus, reform efforts in the social sectors should explicitly incorporate the



- 14-
objective of mproving both quality and access for low-income groups. Such an approach calls
for improved targeting of social expenetures and a clear Government commitment which is
reflected in the organzation of the human resource sectors and in the way they are financed
(paas, 1.34-1.39).
Ote Isues
1.42  IBID and IDA Portfolo Perforance Should Be hnproved. At present, the Bank
Group has one loan and 27 IDA credits under implementation in Kenya. Total amounrs
outstandng on loans and IDA credits are $450 million and $1,931 million respectively. Ninety-
five loans and credits have been disbursed fully. Since 1987, new IDA commitments amounted to
$1,321 million (able 1.2) for a total of 21 credits, including six sector adjustment operations.
There has been no IBRD lending since 1986, when the debt service ratio began to exceed 20
percat. Meanwhile, net Bank Group transfers to Kenya were negative $39 million in 1987 and
about negative $1 million in 1991. The negative transfeas resulted from: (a) the rising burden of
interest payments; and (b) the restructuring of the project portfolio. Net transfers increased in
recent years due to the resumption of quick-disbursing lending and the IDA reflows initiave.
However, they fell agin In FY92 when IDA held tranche release of ASAO II, EDP and EDSAC
foUowing the deteioration in the macroeconomic framework and failure to meet sector-specific
conditionalities.
1.43 Several areas for improvement have been identified in the Bank's portfolio and in
Implementa-tion performance. Credit effectiveness is often delayed because of the dme taken to
obtain the Government's legal opinion and clearance of project documents. The management of
procuvment, especially of technical assistance, needs to be standardized and speeded-up.
Compliance with audit requirements should be significantly improved. Further, delays in inta-
governmental payments and in the setting of domestic tarfs (e.g. railways), and lack of effeive
coordination among official agencies have resulted in project implementation delays. A
comprehensive action plan to taclde these and other portfolio management issues in Kenya was
lauched by IDA during 1989/90 and is beghing to yield encouraging results.
1.44  Futwe IDA Lending Stil Depends Upon Maeroeconomc            mt and the
bmplementa--on of Econodic Reforms. The need to grow qicldy, create gnmificandy more
jobs and reduce poverty suggests tha the Govermnent should make a much more ambidous and
sustained adjustment effort. As indicated earlier, this requires actions such as ineasg the
efficiency of public inves    inter alia Improving the allocations for non-wage O&M;
pastatal reform, including the divesture of producdon and service actvities better suited for the
private sector; and regulatory reform aimed at promoting private sector development The
leading program envisages a volume of IDA asistance to Kenya of rougly $240 million per
fisc  year if these actions are taken. As the balance of payments position is ptojected to improve
under the medium-term stabilization/adjustment program, the strategy calls for a reduction of
quick4-dirsing assistance, which will fall from roughly 50 perce  of Bank lending over FY90-
91, toon annual average of 35 percent duing FY92-94. In FY92-93, the share Is 31 percent. If
the maroeonoDmXic framework is inappropriate or implementation of adjustment meae Is poor,
th Bank would not provide any adjustment lending and would reduce new investment lendig to
core projects only (paras. 1.16-1.17). In essence, these are the criteria by which Kenya's
pefDrmace will be judged and resources allocated.



- 15 -
1.45   Given the issues raised earlier, investment projects are contemplated in areas such as rural
water supply (para. 1.37). To improve Kenya's neglected infrastructure, the lending program
also includes projects for ASAL (para. 1.39), transportation, energy and the strengthening of local
government self-financing (para. 1.33). The human resource element will feature lending for the
population program and health (para. 1.35). Consistent with the Women in Development Action
Plan for Kenya, attention is being given to gender issues in projects. A primary focus will be on
agriculture, where efforts are underway to increase the productivity of women farmers through
extension.
1.46 If the lending level of approximately $240 million per year is realized, IBRD's share of
total debt is expected to fall to 5 percent, and IDA's to rise to 30 percent by 1995. At the end of
1991, IBRD and IDA respectively held 14 percent and 24 percent of Kenya's stock of long-term
public and publicly-guaranteed debt (excluding IMF). With respect to scheduled public debt
service, IBRD's share is expected to fall below 25 percent by 1995 while IDA's share may rise to
about 5 percent. Within the preferred creditor category, which includes IMF, AFDB and EIB,
IBRD's share in disbursed and outstanding debt is expected to declicr to about 11 percent by
1995.
1.47 The Scope for IFC Activities Affected by Inplementation of Reforms. IFC has
invested in 15 enterprises in the industrial, financial and tourism sectors, with total gross
commitments of $149 million, of which $21 million represents equity holdings. In industry, IFC
has invested in the pulp and paper, textiles, leather, cement, and agro-processing subsectors. IFC
has also broadened its involvement with the private sector in Kenya through the establishment in
1989 of the Nairobi office of the African Enterprise Fund (AEF). The AEF allows IFC to make
loan and equity investments in smaller projects than IFC's mainline business. In addition, the
Africa Project Development Facility (APDF), based in Nairobi, continues to assist entrepreneurs
to prepare project proposals and financing. To date, APDF has assisted 17 Kenyan firms and
channelled about $50 million to them in loans and equity.
1.48 During the early 1980s IFC was able to average two new projects per year but the last
three years have wvitnessed a decline to one per year. The prospects for the next few years wiUl
depend on the Government's ability to reduce the large public sector claims on the economy's
resources, and to improve the climate for private investment.
1.49 MIGA Activities. Kenya has been a full member of MIGA since November 1988. At
present, the IFC/MIGA affiliate, Foreign Investment Advisory Services (FIAS), is providing
assistance to the Government in preparing an investment policy statement. Four projects have
also been registered with MIGA. This is a necessary precondition for securing guarantees. To
date, however, no guarantees have been requested.
E. DONOR ACTIVITIS
1.50 Kenya is assisted by a large number of bilateral and multilatera donors who have ctively
supported the Government's adjustment efforts. Japan recently became the largest bilateral donor
to Kenya, followed by the United States and the United Kingdom. A significant number of
bilateral donors extend only grant assistance to Kenya. Over the years, the country has also
benefitted from debt forgiveness of bilateral loans, most notably from the United Kingdom,



- 16 -
Germany, the United States and France. Major multilateral donors, besides the World Bank
Group, include the African Deve!opment Bank, the European Community, and the European
Investment Bank. The country also participates in the Special Program of Assistance (SPA),
which has proven to be an effective vehicle for mobilizing and coordinating donor support.
1.51   Effective donor coordination will remain an important element of the country strategy. At
the CG in November 1991, all participants agreed that new commitments should only be made
after the Government had demonstrated its commitment to decisive action to correct
macroeconomnic imbalances; to rationalize public enterprises and improve their financial
discipline, accountability and transparency; to launch a substantial civil service reform effort; to
improve the efficiency of public expenditure as a vehicle for providing basic economic and social
infrastructure to the people of Kenya; and to provide an environment which is consistently
supportive of private investment and initiative. Bilateral donors also wish to see progress on
political reforms which would reinforce the benefits of economic structural change.
1.52   The Bank remains committed to mobilizing resources for Kenya through avenues such as
the SPA, to the extent that Kenya's policy performance justifies. When appropriate, the Bank
will continue the practice of holding CG meetings. Monthly informal donor meetings in the
Resident Mission and sector coordination groups will continue to be convened, and the close
working relationship with the IMF will be preserved.

PART 11: THE PROECT
2.1    Bacl.Ugd: Kenya's government involvement in the economy is highly intrusive; the
public sector accounts for about 16 percent of output directly, while about 240 state-owned
enterprises account for an additional 10-12 percent of GDP. In 1990, public investment reached
53 percent of the total, of which more than half was accounted by the parastatal sector.
Parastatals are fully or partly owned by the Government, direcdy or through development finance
institutions. A number of government departments and regulatory bodies are involved in
commercial activities, often in conflict with their regulatory roles. Poor accountability to either
supervising agencies or market forces has led to widespread inefficiency, bad business practices,
and misallocation of resources. Most parastatals are less profitable than comparable private sector
firms, although they are accorded preferential treatment and are subsidizeu, mostly through
indirect or off-budget subsidies. A large number of them incur persistent losses and constitute a
significant drain on the Govermuent budget; during FY91 net budgetary contributions to
parastatals was equivalent to at least 1 percent of GDP. At the same time inefficient modes of
government regulation raise business costs and afford considerable scope for rent seeking. Past
attempts at parastatal reforms and restructurings have failed to yield adequate efficiency gains as
they were viewed mainly as technical exercises, were ad-hoc in nature without a policy
framework, and failed to address the underlying causes of inefficiency.
2.2   Since 1986, Kenya's sectoral reform programs (supported by five adjustment credits) have
aimed at improving economic efficiency by focusing on competition and liberalization policies,
and institution strengthening. Reforms are improving incentives in production, trade and finance,
and broadening the role of market signals in guiding resource allocation decisions. The transition,
however, has been marked by persistent and large budgetary and external payments deficits, as
productive capacities are reoriented, and the Government continues to face difficulties in reducing
the growth of public spending. It is clear that the major impediments to increased economic
efficiency are the presence of a large paatatal sector, that contributes to the budget deficit and is
largely unresponsive to market incentives, and the anti-competitive and distortionary activities of
public regulatory bodies. To enhance the response of productive sectors to liberalization, the next
stage of economic adjustment will need to: (i) reduce the Government's role in productive
activities that are better left to the private sector; (ii) improve the efficiency of public enterprises
(PEs) that will remain in state hands (referred to as strategic PEs); and (iii) ensure that regulatory
institutions and mechanisms are used to supplement rather than supplant market mechanisms, by
reducing unnecessary controls, ensuring transparency, and strengthening competition policies.
2.3   In November 1991, the Government of Kenya announced a comprehensive framework and
strategy for Parastatal Reform as a reflection of its renewed commitment to reform and adjustment
to economic realities. It has since taken the following steps to initiate the program including: (i)
publication of a list of 207 public enterprises to be eventually divested through a competitive and
transparent process, (ii) appointment by Presidential decree of a Parastatal Refbrm Program
Committee (PRPC), headed by the Vice President, (iii) establishment of an executive secretariat
and technical unit (ESTU), headed by a senior experienced Kenyan manager, to act as the
implementation unit of the privatization program, and (iv) establishment in the MOF of the
Department of Government Investment and Public Enterprises (DGIPE), headed by a person of
Permanent Secretary rank, to take a lead role in the reform of the 33 strategic PEs which will



- 18-
remain in the public sector. Although the PRPC has a wide mandate to oversee the parastatal
reform program in general, the Government has decided to restrict its activities to privatization.
DGIPE has been given the authority to carry out effective oversight of the reforms involving PEs
that remain in state hands (either permanently or temporarily), as well as the permanent
supervisory functions appropriate to the Government as owner of PEs. More recently, on July 1,
1992, the Government published a policy paper outlining (i) objectives of the reforn program
which are to enhance the role of the private sector in the economy, to reduce the role and
rationalize the operations of the public enterprise sector, and to improve the regulatory
environment; (ii) the two insruments that will be used to achieve Govermnent's aims - a
privatization progcau and a public enterprise reform program; and (iii) the principles, policies,
and procedures which will guide the reform program.
2.4 Project Objectives and Outcomes: The main objective of the TA Project is to support
the Government's parastatal reform program by providing the technical, financial and institutional
assistance which it requires over the next 24 months. The project will help in laying the basis of
a successful and credible series of reforms which are aimed at improving resource allocation and
increasing production efficiency. Expected key outcomes by project's end include: (i)
privatization of at least 20 PEs out of the 207 earmarked for eventual divestiture and liquidation
of a number of uneconomic PEs; (ii) improvement of the efficiency, profitability and
accountability of the remaining PEs, both the 33 to be retained and those to be divested (187 out
of the 207) beyond a 24 month time frame, by phasing out subsidies, establishing a corporate
governance system that reduces political interference, and dealing with excess indebtedness; (iii)
adoption and implementation of restructuring plans for S of the largest PEs which will involve
partial privatization and the cessation of uneconomic activities; and (iv) a more efficient,
experienced and sophisticated stock exchange.
2.5   In addition, the project's broader impact is expected to include significant reductions in
the PE sector's drain on the exchequer and concomitant increases in tax revemne through
improved profitability, and improvements in the, enabling and competitive environment through
changes in the legal and regulatory framework, the reduction of entry and exit restrains, and
rationalization of public service regulation. These gains will, in turn, contribute to the positive
momentum of a shift of emphasis in economic activity from the public to the private sector.
2.6   Proed Des.rtion: The proposed TA project would consist of a coordinated set of
technical assistance interventions over the next 2 years directed at both the parastatal sector and
the enabling environment for the parastatal and private sectors. Approximately 27 percent of the
funds from the credit ($8.85 million) are designed to support institutional development and build
capacity for implementing reforms; another 13 percent ($4.19 million) covers the costs of studies,
reviews, and data base development (which directly or indirectly support institudonal
performance); and the remainder of the funds must under 60 percent, or $18.79 million) are for
specialized technical assistance to support the divestiture and restructuring of the selected public
enterprises mentioned above. Total project costs are estimated at US$31 '3 million equivalent, of
which US$28.86 million are foreign costs. The IDA Credit of US$23.32 million would finance
about 81 percent of foreign costs and 73 percent of total costs. Government's contribution of

uatorylegal framework.
2.8    LI wj Learned snd PWeet utginabIll: The design of the proposed TA Project
has benefted from experience in implemeing similar projects in Sub-Saharan Africa as well as
previous TA projects in Kenya. The key lessons include: (I) the importance of a link between the
degree of Govemment commiment to the TA project in question and parallel (as well as
subsequent) adjustment operations; (ii) the need to support in-country training programs based on
borrower needs and resources and to limit overseas training to justifiable exceptons; (iii) the
Importance of clearly defining the responsibilities of any project implementation unis, (lv)
providing systematic and adequate supervision with appropriate technical experdse, (v) avoiding
where possible the use of expatriates (funded from the project) in line management positions and
Instead using arrangements whereby a Kenyan manager works closely with, and learns fom, the
expatriate advisor, and (vi) building in flexibility to modify the project during implementatio
ralher than setting up a rigid "blueprint approach" more suited to capital iDVnem  projects.
2.9    BwoJd Jnb_en;taUor  The following understandings have been reached with respect
to arrangemen for implemenion, project monitoring and for the mid-term review. In tem  of
project implemenation, the responsibility for implementing the TA will be primarily divided
betwen the ESTU and the DGIPE as follows: (1) ESTU will have full responsibility for managing
the pydvazation component of the TA and intactng direcdy with IIDA on all matters reated to
Implementation of tli component; (i) DGIPE will have fuil responsibiliy for managing the PE
reform component of the TA and ieracting directly with IDA on all matters related to
implemention of this component; (iii) to ensure consistency and integrity of the overall TA,
GIPE will also coordie the TA sub-components designed to stengthen the Auditor Gnerals
Office (State Corporation's), the Registar General's Deparmnt, the Capital Markets Authority
and the Nairobi Stock Exchange, and the Office of the Attorney General in close consultation with
the agencies involved, and (v) ESTU and DGIPE will each appoint  erionaly recoized
expes in appropriate fields, acceptable to IDA, to visit Kenya at least twice a year to help the
management of these units in overseeing project imlementation and provide appropriate advice.
2.10  Ratioalem orlnArohiemmt:  Reducing the Govermet   role in the economy and
more rapid development of the private sector are essential steps for deepening the reform pocess
and sustaing growth. In addition, reducing parastata claims on budgetary resources wDI be
critcal to the achievement of the Government's stabilization aims. At the same time, the
Government i keenly aware of the highly political nature of the reforms it plans to undertake. In
ligt of these political concerns, the Government feels that a too-visible donor invlvement,
especially in setting the type of conditionality that would have to be associated with an adjustmen
operstion, would be politically inappropriae at the present time. However, the Governmt



-21 ^
recognis that It does not have the necessary technical expertise to design and implement a
comprehensive parsatal reform proam. For this rewn, it has Indicated that at this stage of
the reform program It wishes only technical assistance from IDA. Policy-based suppot would
come at a later stage once the Government has demonstraed to local constiuencies that it filly
owns the reform program and that it Is not donor driven. Tbe sustainability of the program,
especially given the difficulties such reforms have faced in the past, will depend critically on (i)
providing the necessary technical expertise (drawing on experience In other countries), (ii)
developing a program of reform which is comprehensive in scope covering both privatization and
PE reform, and (il) coalescing the domestic actors involved In the reform program, ensuring
transparency in hmplementatrou, and designing mechanisms to mitigate the adverse social effects
that would inevitably result from a parasttal reform program.
2.11   A*mW A          Prior to negotiations, agreement was reached iu=ulia on the creation,
staffing and detailed work programs of ESTU and DGIPE; GOK's PE reform and prvtzation
policy which was published as an official document; how many enrprises would be prvatzed
and when; an administrative arrangements for managing and coordinating the two project
components and implemeon of their action plans. During negotiations, agreement was
reahed on the enterprise to be liquidated; technical assistance required to Implement the agreed
restructui of 5 major enterprises remaining in GOK ownership; a mid-term review one year
after credit effectiveness; and a new corporate governance system providing adequate autonomy to
managements and accountability to supervising GOK agencies. Actions to be taken prior to
include formal Government approval of a new system of corporate goverance;
privatiztion, or bringing to point of sale, of 5 enterprises; agreement on a tentative timetable for
phasing-out direct subsidies and eliminating indirect ones; and appointment of key staff to ESTU.
In additon, detailed provisions will have been put in place for efficient and transparent
implementation of the privatization procedures agreed on earlier. By the end of the Sect
iondmwsoft ghZs a total of 20 enterprises will have been brought to the point of sale and all
privaton transactdons for 10 of them will have been completed.
2.12 Befnti: The main benefits of the proposed project are those that would accrue from
Implementation by the Government of an efficient, transparent and sustainable paastatal reform
program. These would include: (i) improvements in allocative and productive efficiency which
would raise employment and incomes over the long run; (ii) enhancement of investment
opportunities for the private sector which could attract additional foreign investment; (iii)
divestture of non-strategic parastals and improvements in the performance of strategic flrms that
would increse the Govermen's net worth and improve Its budgetary siion; and (iv)
separai  of regultory from commercial hmctions to level the playing field between the public
and private sectors. As the Implementtion of parastat reforms would also require
complementary policies of a broader, economy-wide naure (eg, to deepen tancal and capital
marets), economic benefits would be larger than those measured through quani ve indicators.
The proposed project will be judged succsfil if all the indicators of expected outcomes (see
param 2.4) are realized.
2.13  BILm: The main risks associated with the operation are:  ) Government unwillingness
or inability to adhere to agreed policies and procedures that can ensure the transparency and
efficiency of the reform process; (i) inability of the Govemment to sustain its commitment to
parast  refrm in the face of social dislocations and opposition resulting from the loss of
patrnage and rent-seeking oppornties by some groups; Qii) inability or disinterest by the local



-22 -
market and frign Investo  to absorb divested asets. As part of a sategy to deal with these
risb the Project seek to ensure that (a) the   ttutiondl setup and Implementation capacity b
adequte to neet the needs of the proposed reform program, (b) agreed procedures provide, to the
ext  possibl, safeguard that can   ure the transparency of the divetue process, and (c)
desig of the comporens of the TA, and the monitoring process (including mid-term review) will
fac ethe Impl on of a comprehesive program of refoms Including critical cages In
tih leg/     ypoliy freworks. This has been secured, not only through geral
ud_ with the Goverment, but also by ascaining at negodadons how agreed policies
and m im    are bein Implemented in practice. To deal with the socio-political risks the
Govemna has ke upfront actions that demonstathe iseriousess of its           anm _   d is
ImplementIng a safety net mechaism to m ine the transitional costs for displaced labor. To
deal with a cauous market, the Govenmment will need to focus on ensuing some eady
prlvation successes to enhance credibiity among private investors and implement
complentay policies to improve the enabling emironment for domeic and fin invetors.
2.14                  I am sadsfled that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Asocation and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

DisburUm k Iwes
1.         Overall disbursements of the 28 investment projects In the Kenya portfolio are about
the same as andcipated under the disbursement profile for such projects, though for the last two
years actual disbursements have lagged estimates - by 21 percent in FY91 and 24 percent In
FY92.
2.         Two projects financed prior to FY84 (Credit 1238-KE, Population 11 and Credit
1390-KE, Secondary Towns) closed on December 31, 1990, but are still showing up In the
Schedule D because of delays in reconciling the balance under the special accounts.
3.         Several older projects can be considered as slow disbursing. In the case of the
Second Highways Sector project (1984), lack of counterpart funding has been a major cause of
disbursemet lags, while increasing construction contact prices and has required two extensions
of the closing date for the project which is now expected to be on December 31, 1992.
Regardn the Sixth Education project (1986), which is generally progressing well, the main
source of delay has been the slow tendering and contract award procedures relating to one of the
project components. Slow disbursements on the Animal Health Services project (1987) are due in
pat to the restucturing of the project which will henceforth provide services through the private,
rather than the public sector; and in part to IDA being the financier of last resort under this
cofinanced project.
4.         Counter,,=t funding issues and implementation issues in general, will be reviewed
with the Goverment during, respectively, a Public Expenditure Review, and a Country
Implementation Review, both of which are scheduled for the second half of FY93.
