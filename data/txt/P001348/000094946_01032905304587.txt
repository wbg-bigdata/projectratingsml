3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3 1 Original Objective
The objective of the project was to support parastatal reform as a means to reduce the
Government's role in the economy Specifically, the objectives of the Parastatal Reform and
Privatization Programme (PRPP) as established in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) were to (i)
enhance the efficiency of the PE sector, (ii) reduce the financial burden of public enterprises on
the public sector budget, and (iii) enable PEs to operate on the basis of market principles by
enforcing financial discipline, promoting operational autonomy, and enhancing accountability
The key measurable outcomes of the project included (i) the privatization of at least 20 public
enterprises out of the 207 earmarked for divestiture, and the liquidation of uneconomic public
enterprises, (ii) improvement of the efficiency, profitability and accountability of the remaining
PEs by phasing out subsidies, establishing an improved corporate governance system, and dealing
with excess indebtedness, (iii) adoption and implementation of restructuring plans for five of the
largest PEs which included partial privatization, and (iv) improvement in the efficiency and
effectiveness of the Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE)
The project's objectives were clearly stated and relevant to the Country Assistance Strategy
Whilst the original objectives were ambitious, the risks associated with them were clearly
recognized in the SAR The objectives were in line with the state-of-the-art thinking about PE
reform at the time
3 2 Revised Objective
Project objectives were revised twice The first revision was undertaken in 1996/1997 and the
second in June 1998 when the first of two requests to extend the project was granted by IDA
During the first revision, the development objectives were unchanged, while specific actions were
revised to account for new Govemment policy directions as spelled out in a Structural Adjustment
Credit (SAC), the Enhdnced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), and the Policy Framework
Paper (PFP, 1996-1998) These changes committed the Govemment to far-reaching actions with
regard to public enterprises which had traditionally been protected and which were considered
strategic
The first set of revised project objectives was focused on providing technical assistance for (i)
privatization of companies, by number and name, as detailed under the SAC/ESAF programs, (ii)
the restructuring, preparation for privatization, and commercialization of specific parastatals,
namely Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
(KPTC), Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA), Kenya Ports Authority (KPA), and the
National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB), and (iii) support for implementing agencies such as
the Department of Government Investment and Public Enterprises (DGIPE) and the Executive
Secretariat and Technical Unit (ESTU), responsible, respectively, for financial oversight of public
enterprises in the country including the collection and analysis of financial data and advice to the
Government on loans, guarantees, subsidies, etc, and for managing the privatization process
The second set of revised project objectives focused on completing complex preparations
underway for the restructuring, commercialization and privatization of KPTC, KRC and the KPA
- 2 -



Indeed, the extensions of the credit in 1998 and in 1999 were granted primarily to capitalize on
the extensive efforts under the credit which had resulted in Parliamentary passage of the
Communications Bill of 1998 which split KPTC into separate and privatizable companies a
telecommunications company, a postal corporation, and a regulatory body, the Communications
Commission of Kenya (CCK) The Minister of Finance in his 1998 budget speech reiterated
Government's commitment to privatize railway and port operations Therefore, an additional
objective to be achieved during the extension of the project was to achieve further progress to
commercialize and privatize operations at KRC and at KPA by developing a strategy to award
concessions and management contracts for these companies' operations
3 3 Original Components
The components of the project were reasonably related to achieving the project's objectives The
project had two major components (i) a privatization /divestiture component, and (ii) a PE
reform component The privatization component funded expenditures to a) support the
development of ESTU as an effective institution for implementing the Government's privatization
program, b) privatize or bring to the point of sale at least 20 PEs, and liquidate a number of
non-viable PEs, (c) support the development of the capital market authority and the NSE, and (d)
implement special studies, training and investment promotion activity
The PE reform component financed technical assistance to (i) strengthen the Department of
Governnment Investment and Public Enterprises (DGIPE), (ii) restructure five large PEs (KPTC,
KRC, KPA, KTDA, and NCPB), (iii) design and administer a safety net for retrenched workers,
and (iv) help DGIPE implement sector-wide reforms Lessons learned from similar projects in
sub-Saharan African and prior projects in Kenya were incorporated in the design of the
components
3 4 Revised Components
The project was revised in 1996/97 to include additional activities The Government would take
specific actions at KRC with regard to (i) performance contracts, (ii) locomotives maintenance,
(iii) separation of passenger and freight services, (iv) privatization of Gulf Marine Services, and
(v) retrenchment At the KPA actions to be achieved were (i) performance contracts, (ii)
development and implementation of a management contract for the container terminal, (iii)
review of the equipment maintenance contract, and (iv) retrenchment NCPB was to be
privatized by the sale of silos, development of the process of strategic reserves, and a large
retrenchment program intended to take the Government out of the grain storage business
Privatization of NCPB was also supported by an IDA-financed agricultural adjustment credit
(ASAP II, Cr 2204-KE) The operations of KTDA were to be rationalized The
commercialization and privatization of the KPTC also was to be undertaken
These revised components represented a shift toward much more complex processes involved in
the privatization of strategic PEs which required intensive preparation, complex policy reforms,
and the need to address sensitive issues such as foreign control in strategic sectors
The second project revision in 1998 focused on completing privatization preparation activities in
the telecommunications, railways and ports sector
- 3 -



With hindsight, the revised objectives, although requested by and agreed with the Minister of
Finance, were not realistic They did not realistically account for the risks associated with the low
local implementation capacity, the complexity of the transactions, and the Govemment's actual
readiness to undertake substantial reform in a very short timeframe
3 5 Quality at Entry
Original Objectives
The rating for quality at entry is unsatisfactory because the Borrower was not ready for
implementation at the time the Credit was signed in December 1992 It took about 14 months for
the project to become effective because of the Govemment's unwillingness to make amendments
to key laws which were conditions of effectiveness
Revised Objectives
The objectives were revised to focus on the preparation for privatization of major strategic
parastatals, this represented a major shift from the original objectives of
restructuring/commercializing these entities In reviewing quality at entry at the time of the
amendment of objectives, two assessments were required first, whether the project inputs would
be sufficient to bring the entities to the point of sale, and second, whether the broader
privatization dialogue, in the context of the adjustment/ESAF program, would facilitate successful
development outcomes Ideally, the 1996 and 1998 revisions would have benefited from a
broader privatization knowledge base than was available at the time of initial project appraisal in
1992
Overall, the assessment was that quality at entry was unsatisfactory on both counts, i e neither
project outputs nor development outcomes could have been expected to be realistically achieved
With regard to the achievement of project outputs, the implementing agency did not have
sufficient capacity nor the necessary legal mandate under the State Corporations Act to privatize
certain entities With regard to the achievement of development outcomes, political consensus
had not been sufficiently built to actually bring transactions to the point of sale
The following comments reflect on the quality at entry of the project and with the hindsight of
nearly 10 years of privatization experience which the preparation team could not have benefited
from at the time
*  The policy climate was inconsistent with the proposed project activities The program was
donor-driven, there was no serious political commitment on the part of the government, and
efforts were not made to lay the groundwork of understanding, consensus, and commitment at
the highest levels where vested interests we're strongest The result was lack of ownership,
political interference and delays in project implementation
*  At the time that the project was designed, it was not fully appreciated how important the
political aspects of a privatization program could be, especially as the process, in the second
phase, included the larger, more complex and visible strategic enterprises During preparation
and appraisal, dialogue focused primarily on achieving consensus at a narrow technocratic
-4 -



level in the Ministry of Finance and in the implementing agencies (ESTU and DGIPE)
Broader dialogue and consensus-building in the parent ministries, with management and the
Boards of the enterprises themselves, and at the highest political levels were minimal
Similarly, public awareness-raising and communications with the private sector, employees,
and civil society were not included in the project as originally appraised
*  There was also lack of focus initially on the key strategic enterprises Initially, the focus of the
project in the context of the ESAF and PFP was on reducing the numbers of enterprises rather
than on creating fundamental changes in the economy by re-orienting the respective role of the
public and private sectors in the larger companies, especially in the infrastructure sector As a
consequence, many small companies with relatively little importance in the overall economy
were privatized or liquidated leaving the larger strategic ones for later Further, the
Government's perception remained that the performance of "strategic" enterprises in the public
sector would improve by merely restructuring the enterprises and establishing performance
contracts, without changing incentive structures for investment and commercial operation
*  Given the absence of political consensus at the highest levels and the inadequacy of the legal
and institutional framework, prompt implementation of privatization in the economically
important strategic enterprises was especially difficult
1 Existing statutes, including the State Corporations Act, posed obstacles that were not
resolved during project preparation and design
2  Implementing agencies and target PEs had a low capacity to undertake a set of activities
whose targets and time frames were very ambitious and complex
3  Lack of institutional authority led to slow and complicated management of the process and
accusations of lack of transparency Although the ESTU and DGIPE were created to
privatize and manage the program, there was no legislation or other legal authority given
to the ESTU or to the parent ministry of finance to drive the privatization process, and the
line ministries, the boards and management of the companies maintained authority in ways
which stalled the process
Indeed, it may not have been possible to develop the requisite dialogue and consensus necessary
to implement the project, given the constantly changing institutional and political environment
During the period from 1992 through June 2000 there were over five changes of ministers, over
five changes of permanent secretaries at the Ministry of Finance, four heads of ESTU, and
numerous changes in the line ministries and in the companies being prepared for privatization
Equally, there were many changes in the make-up of the cabinet, whose approval was required for
sector reforms or privatizations
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4 1 Outcome/achievement of objective
Significant progress was achieved in improving the efficiency of the PE sector and in mitigating
the financial burden of the sector on public expenditures Government subsidies to PEs have
declined significantly from Kshs 3 2 billion (US$43 0 million) in 1993/94 to Kshs 1 74 billion
-5 -



(US$23 0 million) in 1997/98  It has been estimated that subsidies largely in the form  of
subsidized loans would have escalated from Kshs 8 0 billion (US$108 0 million) in 1992/93 to
approximately Kshs 16 0 billion (US$216 0 million) a year by 1997 if the reform program had not
been implemented The divestiture process generated Kshs 7 2 billion (US$97 0 million) in
revenue for the Govemment Another Kshs 2 9 billion (US$39 0 million) was generated for
holding companies These revenues have been used to- reduce the public debt, provide general
budgetary support and new investments by the holding companies
Divestiture of PEs (See Section 10 for a list of the companies by type of divestiture, sector, buyer
and realized proceeds )
Among the non-strategic PEs, the Govemment fully or partially divested or closed 168
enterprises of the original 207 PEs slated for divestiture Of these, 54 were divested through
preemptive rights, 22 through receiverships, 16 through liquidation, 16 through competitive
bidding, 10 through public flotation, one through a management buy-out, and 29 tea factories
were sold to tea farmers Eleven enterprises were partially divested The'enterprises that are
now in the private sector have greatly improved perfommance The number of non-strategic PEs
reported to be actually divested during the project period is subject to some question The figures
include public enterprises that already were in receivership and included transactions that had been
completed before the PRPP began It also included firms that existed in name only, defunct finns,
and those whose interests were very small
Progress has been slow with respect to the reform of the core and more strategic PEs, although
the completion of the Kenya Airways privatization and progress on the privatization of Kenya
Telecoms were notable successes on the strategic PE front However, few efficiency
improvements have accrued in the railways, ports, power and telecommunications sectors despite
the extensive technical work performed and sector reforms made Because these companies play
a significant role in the economy, the lack of progress in privatizing these companies-even until
today--accounts for the limited overall impact of the program on the economy
4 2 Outputs bv components
Institutional Strengthening
*  ESTU Management ESTU management was strengthened with the hiring of a project
coordinator, a privatization advisor with intemational privatization experience, a financial
analyst, an administration and personnel officer, a research/administrative assistant, an MIlS
specialist, and an accountant In the second phase of the program, as the focus on strategic
enterprises began, an information, education and communication (IEC) effort was developed
with the assistance of an intemational public relations firm
*  DGIPE Strengthening Local and overseas training was provided to DGIPEs staff
Performance contracts were introduced but not operationalized Several diagnostic and
related studies were conducted Significantly more capacity is needed to allow complex
privatization processes to be implemented
In the public enterprise reform component, the following outcomes are noted
-6-



Restructuring of Five Major PEs The overall economic impact of the privatizations was rather
modest, at least in relation to the potential This is because the more ambitious privatization
program adopted in 1997/98 is still largely at the level of intentions Significant but very delayed
progress occurred as follows
*  Kenya Post and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) There were five major contracts
let to prepare for the privatization of the telecommunications sector Booz Allen undertook a
comprehensive review of the regulatory framework for the communications sector and
developed new legislation-the Communications Bill of 1997 which resulted in the separation
of KPTC into separate privatizable companies and a regulatory agency Additional
consultancies by KPMG, Hymans and Tysons undertook the valuation of the assets of the
parent company, an actuarial evaluation of the pension liability and a proposed allocation of
existing assets among the newly formed companies Rothschild was the first transactions
manager charged with selling Kenya Telecoms followed by Solomon Smith Barney/Citibank
Linklaters in alliance with a Kenyan legal firm provided legal services support to the
transactions managers British Postal of the UK developed a strategy for the
commercialization of the postal services Specific outcomes for the KPTC agenda have been
its separation into a telecommunications company (TKL), a Postal Corporation (POSTA), and
a regulatory body (CCK) POSTA aims to be a more commercial and efficient postal service
provider, and CCK is a newly established authority aimed at strengthening the regulatory
framework Because of the importance of the privatization of TKL, IDA granted the
Government's request to extend the project based on a timetable for privatization activities
which was to be completed with the sale of Kenya Telecoms, initially by June 2000 and later
delayed to December 2000 High quality preparatory, legal, and investment banking support
has been provided by the project At the time of publication of this report, Kenya Telecoms
had been well prepared for final sale, and the Government was considering attractive bids for
the sale of the company The project also provided high quality support to the government
allowing the development and sale to Vodafone of a second cellular telephone license
i Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) About 10 contracts were let to pursue the privatization
of KRC including those focused on preparing for a major downsizing of the company to
14,500 workers These contracts included a detailed study and cabinet paper on the financial
and social costs and .possibilities for splitting the railway into freight and passenger services
This included a divestiture study on Gulf Marine Services carried out by Vipul Shipyard Pvt,
the company that owned the boats that linked with the railway system and worked on Lake
Victoria In addition, there were several local contracts for the internal reorganization,
briefing of staff, development of staff reduction plans and counseling for those who would
lose their jobs These studies were carried out by the Federation of Kenya Employers,
pre-retirement counseling was carried out by a consortium including Kenya Institute of
Management and a management of change workshop was carried out by Manpower Services
Ltd of London In addition, a contract to undertake locomotive maintenance was let to
General Electric A contract to study privatization options was undertaken by CPSC
Transcom This detailed preparatory work, however, did not progress adequately to allow
completion of a concession arrangement with a private operator
-7 -



* Kenya Port Authority (KPA) The project supported development of a performance contract
to bring in new private management at the port resulting in a notable increase in the ports
throughput Eventually the managers withdrew at the end of their contract because of
difficulties in achieving the level of day-to-day control from Government for management and
maintenance which they felt was necessary to implement agreed improvements The
Government did, however, respond by changing the entire Board at the port Despite
tremendous vested interests opposed to privatization of the port/container terminal's
management, improvements continue to be achieved as a result of Government's placement of
improved management on an ad hoc basis However, given the need for major investments in
the container terminal, improvements are sub-optimal and the situation is not sustainable
* National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) A contract with Agriconsult of Australia was
reached as part of an agreement under an agricultural adjustment credit that the government
would commercialize the entity and get out of the business of managing a strategic reserve
The government's contract with Agriconsult allowed the advisors to sell off the silos and to
undertake a retrenchment program which has improved the environment for grain production
in the country
The targets set for the project were ambitious and exceeded implementation capacity The related
ESAF was suspended in 1997 and the SAC was closed in June 1998 without the disbursement of
the second and last tranche of approximately US$88 million In addition, many of the agreed
actions in the PFP were not implemented The privatization of Kenya Airways is often quoted as
the most notable achievement of the government's privatization program However, this
privatization was implemented primarily by IFC The project financed the contract for legal
services provided by Kaplan and Stratton
Safety Net The Government did not mobilize resources for a safety net for redundant employees
As a result, only some PEs could meet a portion of their redundancy obligations from their own
resources
Capital Market Development The capitalization of the NSE increased from Kshs 23 1 billion in
1992 to Kshs 129 6 billion in 1998 Tumover increased during the same period from Kshs 387
million to Kshs 4 6 billion The privatization of Kenya Airways yielded significant foreign direct
investment and has helped to influence future divestitures of other key parastatals The breadth of
public ownership resulting from the divestitures was quite limited, as only 10 divestitures were
transacted through public flotation
Progress in improving corporate govemance was limited To increase the autonomy of the
Boards and management of parastatals which is restricted under the State Corporations Act, the
Government exempted large parastatals from the provisions of the Act Perfommance contracts
have been instituted, but it is not evident that they have yielded the desired results Political
interference in day-to-day operations has continued

4 5 Institutional development impact
The project had a positive impact on some small enterprises that were privatized and which
became more efficient in their operations However, many of the small firms--for example, the
ginneries--were sold by what were considered non-transparent processes to parties which have
ceased to operate because of inadequate investible funds The result has been that the cotton
ginneries have become, in fact, a major bottleneck and a major reason for the dramatic decline of
the cotton sector in Kenya The project had little, if any, impact on institutional development for
the large PEs that were not privatized Despite legal reforms in the telecommunications,
electricity, and railways sectors, efficiency gains in those companies have not been achieved and
are unlikely until they benefit from private investment and management
The Government institutions that were a focal point for the project, ESTU and DGIPE, gained
exposure to PE reform processes through training activities and enhanced staffing However,
capacity building remains incomplete Just prior to the closing of the project, virtually the entire
staff of the ESTU and of the DGIPE were dismissed, a new Investments Secretary from the
private sector was appointed, and those staffs will be entirely rebuilt to take on the complex
challenges of PE reform and privatization of strategic enterprises in the future
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5 I Factors outside the control of go vernment or implementing agency
For the strategic PE's being prepared for privatization, the fundamental factor which controlled
the pace and achievements of the privatization program was that private "outside" ownership
threatened vested interests and their control of resources These vested interests resisted change
in cabinet, on the Boards, and among the suppliers to the companies
The continuing economic slump generated higher unemployment and social distress which made it
more politically challenging for the Government to undertake PE restructuring when redundant
workers faced more circumscribed employment options Associated security concems negatively
affected the perception of foreign investors about the relative merits of Kenya as a place for viable
investments The private sector suffered from reduced access to credit owing to weakness in the
commercial banking sector which experienced a growing share of non-performing loans The
unprofitable track records of a large majority of parastatals also hindered privatization efforts
5 2 Factors generallv subject lo government control
For the strategic PEs, there was an absence of political will and commitment at the highest levels
of the govemment -- an absolutely essential ingredient to resist the vested interests opposed to the
privatization process If commitment had been present, Government could have implemented the
agreed upon system of corporate governance for strategic parastat als However, this was not
forthcoming
5 3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control
The capacity in implementing agencies to undertake parastatal reform increased somewhat during
the project period Indeed, the table in Section 10 documents substantial success with respect to
-9-



divestiture, liquidation and sale of small and medium, non-strategic enterprises However,
capacity within the ESTU and the DGIPE is totally inadequate to successfully undertake more
complex reform for the larger public enterprises The sale of the larger companies is a highly
political exercise which cannot be accomplished by a technocratic implementing agency Without
adequate legal and political authority to push through highly politicized, high profile divestitures,
failure--or even success--would be outside the implementing agency's control
5 4 Costs andfinancing
The original credit amount was SDR 16 1 million (US$23 32 million equivalent) At the end of
the project, SDR 15 15 million (94 percent) or US$21 13 million equivalent had been disbursed
The remaining undisbursed balance of SDR 947,515 92 will be canceled
6. Sustainability
6 1 Rationale for sustainability rating
The sustainability of the gains made under the project are rated as unlikely Large numbers of
non-strategic PEs were liquidated or privatized However, the impact of those liquidations and
privatizations on the economy have been relatively modest, given the small size of those
enterprises, and the one-time proceeds from those sales have been spent Progress in reforming
strategic PEs was modest, and the impact of the inefficient operations in the economy of
infrastructure services held by the strategic PEs is cited by the private sector as the single most
important drain on competitiveness and productivity Further, the private sector's confidence and
willingness to invest is deeply affected by its perception of the Government's lack of commitment
in transferring control of key economic activities to the private sector in order to achieve
increased efficiency, productivity and competitiveness
Reform of strategic PEs remains highly uncertain During the June 1999 ICR mission, Bank staff
recommended that Kenya continue its work in privatization This recommendation was based, in
part, on the observatio:l that all persons interviewed in Kenya during the June 1999 mission
expressed interest in continuing the privatization process Indeed, the June 2000 passage by
Cabinet of a new "Privatization Policy and Framework" and the appointment of a new
Investments Secretary from the private sector to head a newly reorganized privatization unit
within the Ministry of Finance seemed to signal government's commitment to continue the
privatization process This combined with well-managed efforts to finalize the sale of Kenya
Telecoms and to procure transactions advisors for the sale of a concession to manage KPA and
KRC seemed to signal renewed commitment to the process However, the actual preparation of
Kenya Telecoms, KRC, and KPA resulted in their not being brought to the point of sale prior to
the project's final closing in June 2000
Some progress over the years has been made in raising the level of dialogue and support among
civil society and technocrats for privatization However, the necessary political consensus and
support at the highest level, which are necessary to proceed with a complex privatization program
focused on the strategic parastatal enterprises, is clearly absent
6 2 Transition arrangement to regular operations
World Bank support through this technical assistance project has been at the level of a) building
capacity in the ESTU and in the DGIPE to manage the parastatal reform and privatization
- 10-



process, and b) support for the necessary technical assistance and transactions management
support to prepare the various companies for privatization Little sustainable capacity has been
built at this technocratic level necessary to manage a complex program to privatize infrastructure
and strategic parastatals However, the most important ingredient necessary for a meaningful
privatization program and project is political commitment, and that key element is absent, making
the past technocratic inputs inadequate to ensure transition to regular operations
7. Bank and Borrower-Performance
Bank
7 1 Lending
The Bank's performance in project identification is rated as satisfactory because the project is
consistent with the Govemment's development strategy and priorities and with the Bank's
assistance strategy for the country
The Bank's performance in project appraisal has been rated as unsatisfactory Project components
and objectives as originally identified were realistic, although, as stated, it was premature to
undertake the project The Govemment had not obtained the requisite support needed to get it
started This is the reason that the date of loan effectiveness was fourteen months following loan
approval As an example of the absence of sufficient preparedness, the SAR stated that a DGIPE
priority task is the preparation of, within 6 months of credit effectiveness, a comprehensive 5-year
PE reform program and a timetable embodying all relevant principles, actions, and procedures
stated in the SAR This highly ambitious schedule was unrealistic given the starting point of
DGIPE Part of the agreed upon tasks for DGIPE was the hiring of a project director and
professional staff Adequate staffing and capacity building were clearly needed first steps before
DGIPE could have proceeded with developing a strategic reform program timetable
Bank performance is rated unsatisfactory in part with the benefit of hindsight Kenya had one of
Africa's first privatization programs, and therefore the appraisal team could not benefit from the
lessons to be leamed regarding the extremely high risk of inadequate political commitment, the
needed authority and capacity of the privatization entities, and the political complexity of
restructuring and privatizing strategic infrastructure and utility sectors In fact, privatizing utilities
was not yet accepted practice at the time of appraisal in 1992 Although these risks were
recognized during preparation and appraisal and accurately identified in the staff appraisal report,
the mechanisms to address them were not sufficiently robust to overcome implementation
challenges and exit measures were not developed
With the perspective of experience and with advice for the future, which will focus on the larger
politically sensitive companies, it is felt that more preparatory work should have been done,
commitment built, and legal authorities established prior to the project being taken to the Board
7 2 Supervision
The Bank's performance in supervision is also rated as unsatisfactory A succession of three task
team leaders in the first three years of the project somewhat impeded effective project
supervision The Washington-based interactions were characterized by delays For procurement
processes, when the Bank was not appropriately consulted and when its guidance was lacking,
- 11 -



decisions were reversed leading to implementation delays
In 1996, the Task Team Leader relocated to Nairobi which improved the quality of Bank
supervision, as well as procurement activities The quality of technical support provided by the
Bank was of high quality, including advice on the selection of experts involved in diagnostic and
preparatory studies
7 3 Overall Bank performance
Viewed from the narrow perspective of implementing a TA project, the-Bank's overall
performance in completing narrowly defined project outputs and achieving project objectives as
originally stated in the staff appraisal report is rated as satisfactory Bank overall performance
with respect to achieving the successful outcome of a complex privatization program associated
with the strategic infrastructure parastatals is unsatisfactory It was expected that several large
companies would be privatized in the two year project extension, which was totally unrealistic
given experience in other countries This unrealistic goal was, however, the objective of the
structural adjustment and ESAF programs and is not the standard by which the project should be
judged Unfortunately, during project implementation, those unrealistic expectations were
accepted as the objective of the project itself By accepting unrealistic expectations and failing to
adequately manage the associated risks, overall Bank performance is therefore judged
unsatisfactory
Despite delays, the project effectively supported the privatization or liquidation of large numbers
of small companies, prepared high quality technical inputs and supported ambitious sector reforms
in the telecommunications, electricity, and railways sectors, and supported transactions advisory
and legal work necessary to bring Kenya Telecoms to the point of sale These achievements are
objectively unsurpassed in other African countries
Again with the hindsight of experience and looking to the future, the project and the supporting
dialogue under the structural adjustment and ESAF programs were not conceptualized and
designed in a way that was sufficient to address and meet the complexity of the objectives sought,
especially in the second phase of the program when revised objectives began to address reform in
the strategic enterprises to support the ESAF and SAC The groundwork had not been
adequately laid to obtain the requisite consensus for parastatal reform, especially for PEs that are
highly visible and which play an important role in day-to-day economic life While the risks
associated with lack of ownership and commitment were recognized, especially when the SAC
was canceled in 1998, mitigation measures were not adequate There is the sense that the Bank
and the IMF felt that agreements could be made at the technocratic level and with the Ministry of
Finance without carefully assessing and addressing concems among line ministers and among the
management and employees of the subject PEs
The project was designed and managed adequately to achieve the narrowly defined project
outputs However, the expectation that several strategic enterprises would be privatized should
not have been undertaken in the absence of commitment and ownership at the highest levels
within the govemment
Borrower
- 12 -



7 4 Preparation
The Govemment's 1992 policy paper that laid out its public enterprise reform program was a
useful starting point for parastatal reform Yet much remained to be done to translate the policy
thrust into a detailed work program and appropriate procedures and processes to implement a
credible reform program More preparatory work was needed before the country could embark
on an ambitious undertaking, as there was an absence of adequate consultation with stakeholders
7 5 Government implementation performance
The Borrower has been severely criticized for lack of progress under this program, even though
an objective review of what was achieved in Kenya compared to other African countries, would
seem to indicate that Kenya's overall performance has been relatively satisfactory It may be that
Kenya is being judged by unrealistically high standards and expectations because Kenya has, in
fact, achieved as much, if not more than countries that are commonly cited as success stories and
models to be emulated
Major progress was made in a) privatizing small and medium companies, b) privatizing Kenya
Airways, major portions of Kenya Commercial Bank, selling a second cellular telephone license,
commercializing the NCPB, and c) undertaking policy reforms and legislation needed to
restructure and prepare the telecommunications sector for privatization The Govemment's
performance on strategic parastatal reform is considered incomplete given that no major
company's privatization was completed during the project period It is also noted that despite the
exceptional success of the Kenya Airways privatization, the fact that the govemment considers
this privatization a "failure" because of its loss of management control is considered evidence of
the Government's lack of commitment to move forward on parastatal reform and privatization
This lack of commitment, as evidenced by ambivalence about the Kenya Airways model, is owing
to a fear of foreign domination, ideological opposition to privatization, fears of redundancies, and
the need to ensure greater citizen participation in the privatization effort However, this is
understandable and a common problem with privatizations throughout the world
76 Implemnenting Agency
The roles and responsibilities of the three governmental entities involved in parastatal
reform--DGIPE/ESTU, the Treasury, and the Parastatal Reform Program Committee--were not
clear and hampered implementation In addition, the limited capacity of DGIPE/ESTU, which are
jointly responsible for coordinating parastatal reform and privatization, became known when the
more ambitious program was adopted by the Government in 1998 They lacked the ability to
handle technical activities such as procurement and the development of terms of reference for
competent consultants for restructuring studies and legal reviews of parastatals The expanded
program was not matched by commensurate strengthening of the DGIPE/ESTU
A pro-active attitude was lacking within management of enterprises to be privatized While
political interference persisted during project implementation, in 1996 an effort to promote public
education was undertaken to develop the necessary support among the stakeholders and within
civil society necessary to help sustain the reform and privatization program A public relations
program was conducted that included seminars and workshops for targeted groups, but it was
quite limited in scope in terms of its coverage, periodicity, and dissemination
- 13-



7 7 Overall Borrower performance
The Borrower's performance in implementing the project was marginally satisfactory
The Borrower's performance in implementing the overall privatization and parastatal reform
program in the context of the ESAF and SAC is rated as unsatisfactory because of
non-transparent processes, the focus on small companies, the lack of meaningful sectoral reforms
and company restructuring, and continued gross inefficiencies in the public enterprise sector
While some important changes were made in the PE sector, the thrust of the project's intent
toward more robust parastatal reform was not matched by the requisite govemment commitment
nor implementation activities
8. Lessons Learned
Quality at Entry Careful project preparation and appraisal are key to success PRPP illustrates
the value of project quality at entry, by virtue of the fact that key activities were not undertaken
prior to the project getting underway Some of these activities include participatory project
preparation involving as many stakeholders as possible with the purpose of building consensus
Such a process would have laid a firm foundation upon which the project would have rested
Clear objectives and formal agreements on outputs and outcomes were needed including
measurable and monitorable performance indicators A comprehensive risk analysis would have
highlighted the project's vulnerabilities and allowed a focus on preparing mitigation measures for
the variables which put the project most at risk of not achieving its objectives
Clear Sign of Political Commitment from the Top is Essential: Although there was consistent
and mutually reinforcing advice and support from the Bank Group through the project, the ESAF
and the SAC, this dialogue was with a limited group of technocrats and did not holistically focus
on the various stakeholder groups and interests whose consensus was needed to make the process
work Indeed, in the absence of political commitment and active efforts to build consensus for
reform, a privatizationi program focused on politically important strategic enterprises cannot be
undertaken
Institutional capacity and authority are essential: Privatization in Kenya lacked visible,
unequivocal support from the highest levels which is necessary for the privatization of key
infrastructure sectors The institutional capacity to undertake complex transactions was not
present for such a task to be successful
Effective communication, dialogue and consensus building with the Borrower: A lesson
learned is that a more comprehensive mechanism is needed for effective communication between
the Bank Group and the client A common understanding on what needs to be done, including
dialogue on key policy issues and directions needs to be undertaken with all levels of government,
with the line ministers and with the companies involved Effective communication should be
supported by appropriate information and education efforts within the country to raise awareness
and build consensus, understanding, and transparency about the reform and privatization
processes
The dialogue should be driven by the pace dictated and owned by the Government and not
- 14 -



by conditionality: Work programs and timetables should be prepared by the Govemment in
consultation with the stakeholders Even if the pace is slower than ideal, such a govemment and
stakeholder driven process will more realistically reflect what is doable and politically sustainable
Infrastructure privatization is more difficult The PRPP focused on small and medium sized
PEs, as well as large, strategic public enterprises as part of its reform effort Infrastructure
privatization is substantially more difficult, sensitive and costly in comparison to privatizing small
and medium finns operating in competitive markets Infrastructure privatization invariably
requires redefining competition policy in different market segments and establishing new
regulatory frameworks and institutions This often requires legislative approval for new sector
policies and associated statutes which results in a considerably longer lead time for infrastructure
privatization transactions The risks of privatizing infrastructure parastatals are greater, simply by
virtue of the breadth of public infrastructure and its visibility in day-to-day life Projects need to
differentiate the level of technical assistance, technical oversight, and dialogue needed for different
types of privatization
Build transparency in the privatization process: Although regular independent audits were
performed under the project, the transactions were not perceived to be open, and the absence of
transparency inhibited the attainment of ownership of the project by key stakeholders The
privatization transactions needed to be more transparent through regular publication and publicity
about proposed actions and implementation progress Semi-annual reports to Parliament may
have helped to provide transparency and introduce accountability A transparent process with
accountability can be an important means to gain public support for privatization
Expand the number of citizens benefiting from privatization The perception exists in some
quarters that only a small number of Kenyans benefited from privatization Only 10 of the
hundred or so companies that were privatized were offered by the sale of shares on the NSE For
those few companies, the share offerings were oversubscribed In the future, the use of flotation
can increase the number of shares the public can purchase This process can help not only to
increase the number of citizens able to own a share of privatized enterprises, but it can also
increase popular support for privatization Public flotation, in conjunction with marketing the
large companies to strategic investors to ensure improved performance, is a recommended model
for future privatization
Need for a more solid safety net: Obligations to employees of PEs who were retrenched were
not fulfilled The economic slump and rise in unemployment and social distress impeded the
prospects forjob relocation and alternative employment Future projects should carefully develop
and propose safety nets to accompany the privatization of the larger companies where
redundancies will be large
Do not set unrealistic expectations for the privatization of politically complex and visible
companies unless the requisite high level ownership and commitment is present Conditionality
cannot substitute for these prerequisites

9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/imnplementing agency
The Government's comments note the major accomplishments of the project including progress in
the divestiture of public enterprises, the improved financial performance of privatized enterprises,
and positive steps made toward the privatization of some of the more strategic sectors Also
noted are the accomplishments made in moving forward on developing a consensus among line
ministries and parastatals in support of privatization Sector-wide reforms were implemented that
reduced direct and indirect subsidies from the exchequer to parastatal'
The Government notes that the Bank underestimated the implications of the project, the time
needed for consensus building, and other considerations required for the Government to
successfully undertake a substantial reform effort Concem was expressed that the Bank was
evaluating success against moving targets, until recently Also noted were the difficulties and
delays in the procurement process
The Govemment states that it met its obligations under the project yet acknowledges that the
political will to tackle the issue of corporate govemance was weak, and that a strong political
consensus in support of major privatizations was slow to be achieved Proactive support from the
management of the enterprises being privatized was rare during PE refomm The Government
recognizes that future privatizations will require resolution of complex issues and the requisite
capacity to tackle them
