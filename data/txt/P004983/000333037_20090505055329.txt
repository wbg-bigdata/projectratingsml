    of t h e f i v e nominees r J r D i r e c t o r s were, i n t h e rnisslon's opinion, of "very
    i n d i f f e r e n t quality."            The remaining two were not y e t nominated.

                        ( i i )   Proposals from t h r e e consultant Firms had beeil invited but
    not yet received.

    passes.

                        (iv)      The nomination of t h e Chairman of t h e Au6hority was t h e
    subject of much conjecture during negotiations and i s still a rnatter of con-
