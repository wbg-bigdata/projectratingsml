Loan and Project Summary
Bogrower:         Republic of Korea
B.neficiarilis    Pusan and Taejon City Governments
Amounts           US$40 millicn equivalent
Termr2            15 years, including 5 years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate
Relgnding T!j1m1s  The same terms as the Bank loan, including foreign exchange
and interest risks, plus a 0.05% p.a. handling charge
Proiect           The proposed project supports the Government's 1990-96
Descrigpnoan    National Wastewater Treatment  Plan to  improve the water
quality in Korea's rivers and coastal waters by, among other
things, constructing sewage treatment plants in two of the
largest municipalities. Under the project, sewage treatment
plants would be constructed or expanded in Pusan and Taejon,
Korea's second and sixth largest cities. The project would
include construction of: (a) the first phase of Yongho sewage
treatment plant in Pusan, with a daily maximum capacity of
340,000 m3/d, a sewage pumping station and about 11.4 km of
interceptoro to carry sewage to the plant; and (b) the second
phase of Wonchon Dong treatment plant in Taejon and 11.9 km of
interceptors, to double existing capacity on completion.
Technical assistance would also be provided to (i) help
supervise treatment plant construction and (ii) update the
cities' Sewerage Master Plans (SMPs), including a review of
policies and management systems for sewerage activities and
design of a program to convert the sewer systems from
combined-type   systems,  carrying  both   stormwater  and
wastewater, to hygienically superior separate systems whicb
carry wastewater in sanitary sewers and stormwater in storri
sewers.
BLenefits         The project would improve the environment in Pusan and Taejon
and nilks:        and reduce health hazards  for the local populations by
providing wastewater treatment for a total of about 1.75
million people and increasing the population served by sewage
treatment from 45% to 60% in Pusan and from 35% to 55% in
Taejon. Updating of the cities' SMPs under the project would
not only establish programs for the conversion to more
sanitary and environmentally acceptable separate sewer systems
but would also def ine procedures to streamline subsector
institutional arrangements, which may be replicated by other
municipalities.  While the project's civil works components
present no special risks, implementation of the SMPs to be

f. THE SEC=O
A. Water Resources
1.1      Korea has enjoyed several decades of economic growth, marked by
improvement of livin^ standards, expansion of industry and intensification of
agriculture. Together. these factors have caused water demand to grow from 80%
of the total average annual run-off of Korean rivers in 1980, to 110% in 1990,
with 155% expected in the year 2001.
1.2      Korea's rivers are its only reliable water source since geological
conditions are not conductive to significant groundwater development. Annual
run-off of the rivers, at 25.7 billion m3, however, is not evenly distributed:
about two thirds is concentrated in the three summer months. Retention of these
high flows has been provided through construction of dams to store water for
various uses. The dams' storage supplied about 18% of total water demand in 1980
but is projected to supply 36% in 2001. However, due to scarcity of suitable
sltes for further development as well as pnpulation pressure on land, the
construction of large dams is being phased out. Since the volume of water
resources cannot be further enhanced from storage, the re-use of water by various
users along the rivers will increase.
1.3      The quality of water in the principal rivers varies.   Quality is
relatively good in the upper and middle courses of the Han and Geum Rivers, with
heavier pollution occurring only in the lower stretches. However, the Nakdong
and Youngsan Rivers have been seriously polluted from their middle courses. Some
branch rivers which flow through large cities or industrial complexes cannot be
used for water supply, and their pollution levels exceed even the levels
considered acceptable for use in irrigation. Nany local water courses carry
great volumes of domestic and industrial wastes and are septic and malodorous.
1.4      The major polluting sources in 1989 were livestock farming (41%),
population  (37%) and industry  (22%).   Additional pollution was caused by
agricultural run-off, which washed into the river system part of the
approximately 2.0 million tons of fertilizer used by farmers.
1.5      Recognizing that further increases in the quantity of water available
are limited, the Government is focusing its water management efforts on
preserving and improving water quality by, among other things, systematic
monitoring of water quality in rivers and coastal waters, initiating studies on
the degradation of natural waters by wastes, organized sequencing of water uses
in order to provide the highest quality water only where it is needed and lower
quality water to consumers with less stringent requirements, treating wastes
before their discharge into water courses, and providing incentives to induce
water conservation. Adequate treatment of wastewater prior to its discharge into
rivers has therefore become important in Korea both to protect the env.roament
and, in particular, to ensure the future availability of water resources for
multiple uses.

1.6      Korea's population in 1990 was *etimated at 43.8 million, of which 34.6
million were urban, living in 246 munLeLpalitiee.  While th- country's overall
population growth rate declined to about 1.7% in 197080 and to lses than 1% in
th- lait decade, tho urban population expanded by 3.2% p.a. during 1980-87. As
a perventage of the total population, the urban population grew from 50% in 1970
to 791 in 1990, ane is expected to exceed 80% of the total population by the year
2000. This burgeoning of the urban population makes improved water management
a necessity nationwide.
C. nervice Levels
1.7      Water SuLi1. Piped water supply services reached 84% of the population
in 1990. The cities were generally better served, at 90%, compared to 57% in
rural areasl the unserved population relied mainly on wells. Country-wide, water
supply production increased from 158 liters per capita per day (lcd) in 1970 to
345 lcd in 1990. This rapid growth in per capita demand during the last 20 years
reflects the alleviation of shortages in water supply, industrialization, rapid
urbanization and higher living standards.
1.8      Sanitation and Sewerace. Homes in Korea use traditional toilets, with
excreta holding tanks, and flush toilets. The flush toilets are connected either
directly to a sanitary sewer or to a combined sewerl in the latter case the law
requires pre-treatment before the discharge, consisting of a septic tank for
homes or more sophisticated facilities for hotels, apartments, etc. to remove
solid contents from the toilet wastes. The percentage of population with flush
toilets is fast growing, reaching 61% in 1989, and projected at 80% by 2001.
1.9      The contents of holding tanks (nightsoil) and septic tanks (sludge) are
collected by the municipalities or private contractors and disposed of in
nightsoil treatment plants (NTP). In 1989, the municipalities operated 154 NTPs
with a combined treatment capacity of 13,000 m3 per day (m3/d). With expansion
of conventional sewage treatment plants, the role of NTPs in the cities will
eventually be confined to the cities' non-sewered fringe areas. However, NTPs
will remain a low-cost environmental protection measure for most provincial
towns, at least in the foreseeable future.
1.10     Most municipalities have combined drainage systems which carry both
stormwater and wastewater and discharge the mix directly into the nearest river.
Solids are eliminated through the individual septic tanks which are mandatory for
all buildings. Recent large-scale urban development schmes include separate
sewer systems in which stormwater is conveyed to the nearest stream by a storm
sewer and wastewater (sewage) is collected and conveyed to treatment plants by
sanitary ewers. In 1390, about 25% of Korea's urban population was served by
separate sewer systems.
1.11     From the point of view of public health, the separate sewer system is
much superior to the combined system since it ensures that wastewater is confined
within the system and in not allowed to contaminate the environment. While the
advantages of separate systems are understood, the Government also recognizes
that rapid conversion of the citiles' exitLng combined sewers to separate sewer

systems would be extremely expanslve and cause dLsruptLons durlng constructitn.
It has therefore decided on an alternatLve way to make combLned sewers mt. -
manltary and effectlve by (a) step-by-stsp conversion of existLng combLnesd
zyste-m to separate systems and (b) constructLon of interceptors along the rlvers
to collect flows from comblned sewer outlots and to delivor raw sewage to the
treatment  plant.   Because  atormwater  in  combLned  *ewers vastly  exceeds
wastewater, the interceptors are designed to dLicharge overflows lnto the rlver
durlng heavy ralna.  Pollutlon from overflows la at present relatively low,
eatlmated at 3% to 5% of the annual volume of sewage. The lnterceptors therefore
substantLally reduce pollution ln lnner-clty rivers.
1.12     Sewage treatment plants (STP) ln Koroa's major cltles mainly use a
conventLonal actlvated sludge process whlch la partLcularly suLtable for large
communltles and areas wlth hlgh population denaltles where land li at a premlum.
In 1990, about 20 munLclpalitLes had STPz either in operation or under
constructLon, with a total capacity of 5.6 milllon m3/day to serve about 31% of
the urban population.
D. Sector Organlzation
1.13     Key  Lnstitutions  in  wastewater  management  are  the  Ministry  of
EnvLronment (MOE) and the MiLnitry of Constructlon (MOC). MOE's prlncipal role
is Ln regulating, monitoring and enforclng water pollutlon control activltles.
It is involved ln the construction and operation of lndustrlal wastewater
treatment plants, and was recently mado responsLble for planning and coordlnatlng
constructLon of municipal wastewater treatment plants. MOC's prLncLpal role is
in monitorlng and managLng water resources, Lncluding construction and operatlon
of dams. MOC also provides guidelines for the plannlng and deolqn of municipal
sewer  systems  and  coordinates  system  constructlon  and  operatlon.    The
organlzational structures of MOE and MOC are shown in Charts 1 and 2.
1.14     Other agencLes involved ln the sub-sector are the munLcLjatlitLes whlch
are responsible for development, operation and maintenance of sewerage systems,
includlng treatment facilltles, and the Mlnlstry of Home Affalrs (MOHA), whlch
provides advioory asosLtance to municipal systems and consolidates the
munLcipalitLes' statistical lnformatlon. The alloc-tlon of flnancial resources
and forelgn loans to the various agencles li declded by the EconomLc Plannlng
Board and the HMnLstry of Flnance (MOP).
E. Natlonal Wastewater Treatment Plan
1.15     In 1987, to strengthen water pollutlon control, MOC began preparatlon
of a long-term develoiment plan for improved water supply and wastewater
treatment facilities and Lnvitod the Bank to assiot ln that task.  The Bank
report,   Korea - Iseerae and Wastewatcr Hanaaements Issues. OLons and
R9commendal&o2n (April 1968), helped formulate the National Water Improvement
Program (KWJP) which was approved by the Government ln September 1989.
1.16     The two key elements of the NWIP, upgrading of municlpal water supplles
and improvement of water quality in rlvers and coastal waters, are each covered
by an actlon plan.    Measures related to water quality are Lncluded in the
Natlonal Wastewater Treatment Plan (NWTP), whlch will be implemented during 1990-



96 at an estimated cost of W 2,136 billion (US$3.1 billion). The NWTP addresses
the major polluting sources throughs (a) relocation of some industries to
eliminate pollution sourcas from upper catchment areas reserved for water supply;
(b) provision of wastewater treatment plants for industry and livostock farms;
and (c) substantial reduction of municipal pollution through tne construction
of *swage treatment plants in 64 municipalities to increase the population served
from 31% in 1990 to 65% in 1996. Government's financial support to the cities
for improving sewerage facilities is based on the self-financing capacity of the
cities and varies from 60% to 80% of construction costs for interceptors and
sewage treatv.nt plants.  However, the six largest cities, i.e., those with
populations gr£atsr than one million and with the status of a "Special City",have
to finance all their investment.
F. grevious Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.17     To date, the Bank has financed five water supply projects and prepared
a sewerage sector study which assisted the Government to formulate its sewerage
sector strategy (para 1.15). The First Water Supply Project (Loan 2072-R0, 1982)
expanded water services Ln five cities. The Project Performance Audit Report
(PPAR) (No. 8174, 1989, SecM39-1544) found that the project was successful,
although demand took longer than expected to materialize in some of the cities.
The Second Water Supply Project (Nakdong Barrage, Loan 2350-K0, 1984) eliminated
sea water intrusion in the Nakdong delta, increased the water '-ailable for
municipalities in the Nakdong basin, transferred technology in leak detection,
established a computerized accounting system for water operations in more than
20C municipalities, and resulted in establishment of a Natural Environment
Preservation Area for migratory birds in the Nakdong estuary.   Tho Project
Completion Report (PCR) (No. 8675, 1990, GecM90-753) found that the project was
completed on time, successfully achieving o! surpassing all of its objectives.
1.18     The Third Water Sup9ly Project (Metropolitan Region, Loan 2491-R0, 1985)
provided about 1.3 million m /day of water to 25 municipalities within the Seoul
Metropolitan Region, improved the organization of water and sewerage services in
the Region, established corporate planning in the Korea Water Resources
Corporation (ROWACO),I and assisted the Government to establish national
policies for bulk water tariffs. The project was successfully completed after
a one-year extension and achieved all of its objectiveas.   The PCR is under
preparation.  The Fourth Water Supply Project (Namgang and Taegu, Loan 2615-So,
1986) expanded water servicea in 14 municipalities and contributed to improving
the organization of water and sewerage services in the project area. It was
successfully completed as scheduled and achieved its objectives. The PCR is
being prepared. The Juam Regional Water Supply Project (Loan 3178-KO, 1990) will
provide water services in nine municipalitiec, including Kwangju, increase the
efficiency of leakage control programs, and support improvements in the planning
and information systems of the project agencies.
t y KOWACO is a semi-autonomous public corporation under MOC, which operates
regional systems providing water in bulk to groups of municipalities and
industrial zones, and builds and orerates multipurpose dams.



1 19     These Bank-supported projects were implemented largely by MOC, with some
involvement of several municipalities and kOWACO. All projects achieved their
physical and institutional objectives within the established achedulec (with the
exception of the one year delay in Ln. J491-KO) and estimated cost.  In all
cases, the projects were prepared up to the detailed design stage at the time of
appraisal, procurement was grouped into major contracts, ard institutional
components were directed at improving existing well-defined procedures in
reasonably managed and disciplined agencies. The agencis were responsive to and
maintained the projects' institutional improvements after completion of works.
The lessons learned from past lending indicate that (a) an advanced level of
project preparation at appraisal, (b) disciplined and well-managed implementing
agencies and (c) well-defined project objectives contribute substantially to a
project's success.
1.20     The design of the proposed project  incorporates elements of the
experience gained by the Bank during implementation of provious projects in
Koress appraisal took place after the detailed designs of proposed facilities
were completed; procurement of each civil works as well as equipment are grouped
into major contracte; and institutional objectives focus on key development
aspects.
G. Rationale for Bank Involvement in the Proposed PrQiect
1.21     The proposed project to construct or expand sewage treatment facilities
in two of Koreats largest cities would be a logical outgrowth of the Bank's
involvement in the 1988 sewerage sector study (para. 1.15) by providing the Bank
with an opportunity to assist the authorities to implement the study's two main
reconmendations, i.e., to increase construction of wastewater treatment
facilities and to accelerate conversion of combined sewers. Both activities
would have a substantial, lasting and positive hygienic and environmental impact
by improving the quality of life in Korea's two large cities through efficient
collection and treatment of the wastewater which now leaves the cities' rivers
highly polluted.
1.22     The  project  also  responds  to  a  primary  government  objectives
environmental protection. Korea's growing industrialization, high population
density, and very limited water resources have caused the Government to Flace top
priority on efficient use of water and maintenance of water quality in rivers.
Environmental protection of water resources in Korea is now not merely an
aesthetic and hygienic consideration but an issue of economic survival. Sector
agencies recognize the seriousness of this situation and look to the Bank for
assistance in identifying technical, managerial and administrative innovations
to deal with these problems. Through the project preparation the Bank has been
providing this assistance, drawing on its familiarity with the Korean water
supply and sewerage sector, its experience in supporting sector development
worldwide, and its particular interest in addressing environmental issues, an
interest now shared with the Korean Government.



II. P!ROJEC;T AREA. SERVICES MND DEMAN
A. Proict Ar-a
2.1      The project would be carried out in the Special Citieo of Pusan and
Taejon.  Pusan, Korea's *econd largeet city and the country's largest port, is
situated about 440 km southeast of Seoul.   Tasjon, the sixth largest city, is
situated about 160 km mouth of Seoul in tho central part of the country. Both
cities are important cultural and commercial centers, and both have allocated
great importance to improving the local environment. In selecting these cities
for inclusion in the project, consideration was given to their importance in the
country's devolopment, the need for the proposed improvements, and the cities'
coanitment to emploaentation of these works.
B. Urban Growth and Economic Activity
2.2      Puan. Pusan extends along a narrow plain expanding from the southern
sea shores to mountain ranges in the north.  Its population has tripled from
about 1.3 million in 1963, when the municipality was upgraded to Special City
status, to about 3.9 million in 1990, and is projected to reach 4.8 million in
the year 2001. Its administrative area aloo grew from 360 km2 in 1963 to 435 km2
in 1988 to 526 km2 today.
2.3      Pusan has more than 40,000 factories employing almost 600,000 pereons
in major light industries like chemicals, textiles and leather as well as heavy
industries like metallurgy, machinery and shipbuilding. The port handlea about
50% of the country's export traffic and 95% of it. container traffic.
2.4      Taeton.  Taejon's growth owes much to it. geographical setting as the
major transportation junction linking the Seoul metropolitan area, the industrial
southeast, and the agricultural southwest. In addition, to reduce population
pressure on the capital, the Government is transferring several research and
education institutions (para 2.5) and moving some of its administrative offices
from Seoul to Taejon. To reflect that decision, the Taejon administrative area
was enlarged from 88 km2 to 537.5 km2 in 1989 when Taejon was upgraded to Special
City status. Its population reached about 1.06 million in 1990 and i. projected
to grow to 1.65 milllon by the year 2001.
2.5       Manufacturing in Taejon consists mainly of labor-intensive light
industries such as textiles, leather and needlework located in about 500
factories employing about 50,000 persons. Although Taejon has a relatively weak
industrial base, a new science town and a high-tech ind6dtrial complex, to be
completed in 1992 and 1995, respectively, will allow substantial expansion of
science and technology-oriented industries.
C.  Ztexr SuDolv Swzvice
2.6      Water sujply services in the project cities are managed by the Pusan and
Taejon Water Agencies, which are both self-financing municipal corporations. In
1990, the Pusan Water Agu..cy pyovided service to commerce, industry and 3.8
million residential consumers (97.5% of the city population) through 294,000
connections. Average production was 1.5 million m /d or 360 lcd, about 38% of



- 7 -
which was non-revenue water; about 61% of water sales were to residential
consumers, 30% to commerce and industry, and 9% for public use. The capacity of
the water supply system is about 2 million m3/d, and the Agency plane to expand
production and distribution Zacilities to 2.5 million m /d in 1995 and 2.8
million m)/d in 2001.
2.7      In 1990, the Taejon Water Agency provided service to commerce, industry
and 904,000 residential consumers (85% of the city population) through 89,000
connections. Average production was 303,000 m3/d or 335 lcd, of which 36% was
non-revenue water. About 61% of water sales was to residential consumers, 34%
to comerce and industry, and 5% for public use. Production capacity is now
about 410,000 m3/d, but production and distribution facilities will be expanded
in five-year stages to reach about 1.0 million m3/d by 2001.
D. Seweraae Services and Drainace
2.8      Sewerage services in Pusan and Taejon are provided by the cities
Sewerage Divisions. The sewerage systems are mainly the combined type and were
constructed gradually over many years, initially for drainage purposes. As a
result, they consist of both open channels along roads and buried conduits.
WastewLter is permitted to enter the systems only after solids are removed in
septic tanks, which are compulsory for all buildings
2.9      The Pusan system covers over 118 km2 (1990) or 83% of the city's built-
up area.  Some 3.7 million people or 95% of the city's population is served
through 294,000 connections. The system has a total length of 4,200 km, of which
37 km are separate sanitary sewers, including interceptors. The population with
flush toilets, about 2.6 million or 67% of the city population, disposes of
wastewater through septic tanks in the sewerage system; the remaining 1.3 million
people use traditional toilets in combination with vaults to store nightsoil.
The daily maximum generation of wastewater is estimated at about 1.3 million
m3/d, of which about 0.53 million m3/d is treated at the Suyeong and Janglim
wastewater treatment plants, serving about 1.8 million or 46% of population.
Nightsoil and sludge from septic tanks, amounting to about 1,300 m3/d, is
collected by contractors and disposed of in the Yongho and Kamjeong nightsoil
treatment plants.
2.10     The Taejon system, covering over 51 km2 or 70% of the city's built-up
area, serves about 0.8 million people or 73% of the city population through
92,600 connections.  The system's total length is 1,360 km, of which 147 km are
separate sanicary sewers, including interceptors. The population using flush
toilets, about 0.48 million or 46% of the total city population, disposes of
wastewater through septic tanks in the sewerage system; the remaining 0.58
million people use traditional toilets combined with vaults to store nightsoil.
The daily maximum generation of wastewater is estimated at about 0.3 million
m3/d, of which about 0.13 million m3/d is treated at Wonchon Dong wastewater
treatment plant, serving about 0.4 million people or 38% of the city population.
Nightsoil and sludge from septic tanks, amounting to about 500 m3/d is collected
by contractors and disposed of in the Samcheon nightsoil treatment plant.



B. Solid Waste Diucogal
2.11     The solid waste generated in Pusan, totallng about 8,500 t/d,  is
collected by the city and deposited in the Sugdae-dong sanitary landfill, located
about 25 km from the city center. The landfill has been in use since 1987 and
is expected to be filled in 1992. Studies of new landfill sites are ongoing.
2.12     In Taejon, the city collects about 1,600 t/d of solid waste out of a
total generation of 1,700 t/d. The remaining 100 t/d are collected by private
contractors or disposed of in household plots. The c!.ty's solid waste sanitary
landfill, located about 5 km from the city center, is also expected to be filled
by 1992. A new site, about 12 km from the city center and with an expected
capacity for about 15-20 years, has been identified and a feasibility study for
the site is being prepared.
F. Sewerage Master Plans
2.13     The development of sewerage systems in Korea has been guided by sewerage
master plans; the plan for Pusan was completed in 1974 and that for Taejon in
1982.  Besides providing "as made" drawings of the existing sewerage system and
identifying locations for wastewater treatment plants, the master plans assess
the level of pollution in receiving water bodies and the state of repair of
combined drainage and sewerage systems, and recommend approaches to system
expansion.
2 14     During the preparation of studies and designs for the wastewater
treatment plants to be constructed under the proposed project, the
recommendations of the relevant master plans were reviewed and their validity
concerning the location of treatment plants confirmed. At the same time, an
earlier recommendation favoring separate sewer systems citywide was revieed by
accepting combined systems in the city's built-up areas and separate systems in
new housing and industrial developments. However, the review of master plans was
general and did not provlde the details needed for the city to manage further
development of the systems. A detailed updating of the sewerage master plans for
both Pusan and Taejon is therefore included in the proposed project (para 3.12).
G. Demand for Sewerage Services
2.15     The target for development of sewerage services during about the next
ten years is to provide the cities' entire populations with sewerage services,
including full secondary treatment of all wastewater generated in the planning
areas.  Accordingly, the sewerage development program for Pusan proposes to
achieve the following by the year 2001: (a) the phasing out of separate nightsoil
treatment; (b) increasing wastewater treatment capacity to 1.6 million m3/d or
98% of average dally generation of wastewater in the city; and (c) expansion of
the swer system to 7,700 km, of which 1,500 km would be sanitary sewers and 130
km interceptors.
2.16     Also by the year 2001, the Taejon sewerage development program proposes
to achieve: (a) the phasing out of separate nightsoil treatment; (b) increasing
the treatment capacity to 0.8 million m3/d or 100% of the average daily



generation of *ewage in the city; and (c) expansion of the newer system to 3,200
km, of which 760 km would be sanitary sewers and 100 km interceptors.
2.17     Details of the water supply and sewerage services provided in both Pusan
and Taejon ar- given in Annex 1.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives
3.1         The  objectives  of  the  proposed project  are  to:  (a)  improve
environmental conditions in two of Korea's largest cities; (b) reduce pollution
in the country's water courses and coastal waters, which is crucial for the well-
being of a large part of the population; (c) reduce the health hazards associated
with contaminated river water, particularly for the lowest-income population
which is most exposed to this water; and (d) continue supporting technological
and institutional improvements in the sector.
B. Description
3.2      The project would be implemented over a five-year period and would have
the following components:
(a)   in Pusan,  construction of the first phase of Yongho sewage
treatment plant, with a daily maximum capacity of 340,000 m3/d,
a sewage pumping station, and about 11.4 km of large-diameter
interceptors. The treatment plant would use an activated sludge
process and anaerobic digestion of sludge, which would be
dewatered and disposed of at a sanitary landfill; and
(b)   in Taejon, construction of the second phase of Wonchon Dong
sewage treatment plant and 11.9 km of interceptors, to increase
daily maximum capacity from 150,000 m3/d at present to 300,000
m3/d at completion. The treatment process would be the same as
that used in the first phase and in the Pusan plant.
Under both components, technical assistance would be provided to: (i) update the
Sewerage Master Plans of the project cities, including a review of policies and
management systems for sewerage activities and design of a program for the
introduction of separate sanitary sewer systems in the cities; and (ii) provide
engineering services to supervise construction of the treatment plants. A
detailed description of the project components is given in Annex 2, and the
location of the proposed works is shown on Maps IBRD 23319 and IBRD 23320.
C. Status of Proiect Preparation
3.3      The Pusan and Taejon Sewerage Divisions completed engineering designs
for both civil works components with the assistance of consultants in May 1991
and December 1990, respectively. Both designs follow Korean design standards for
sewerage facilities, with some minor modifications based on the latest experience
in Japan and the United States. Works in Taejon have already begun, due to a
deadline imposed by the opening in August 1993 of an international trade
exposition, Expo '93.
D. Proiect Coat
3.4      The project would have a total estimated cost of W 190.6 billion
(US$264.7 million), including taxes estimated at US$23.2 million equivalent but



- 11 -
excluding interest during construction.  The foreign currency requirement ic
estimated at W 54.1 billion (US$75.1 million) or 28% of the total. The Pusan
civil works component is expected to cost about W 148.8 billion (US$206.6
million), of which W 35.6 billion (US$49.4 million) or 24% of the component's
total cost would be foreign exchange. The Taejon component is estimated to cost
about W 41.8 billion (US$58.1 million), of which W 18.5 billion (US$25.7 million)
or 44% of the component's total coat would be foreign exchange.  The Taejon
component would have a higher foreign currency requirement than the Pusan
component mainly due to the use of a different technology for sludge digestion
which requires more equipment.   Project technical assistance is expected to
total 1,450 person-months, to be provided by local consultants.
3.5      Base costs reflect end-1991 price levels.  Physical contingencies are
estimated at US$11.4 million or 5% of base costs. Price contingencies are
estimated at US$24.4 million, or about 10% of base costs plus physical
contingencies, and assume the following annual rates of inflation: for local
costs, 9% for 1991 and 5% for 1992 and thereafter; and for foreign costs, 3.4%
for 1991 and thereafter.  Cost estimates are based on detailed designs, bids
received for ongoing civil works in Taejon and recent contracts for similar
works. The cost estimates are shown in Annex 3 and summarized in Table 3.1.

E. Financing Plan
3.6      The proposed Bank loan of US$40 million equivalent would finance about
15% of the total project cost or 53% of the foreign exchange requirement,
excluding interest during construction financed locally. At the Government's



- 12 -
request, the Bank loan would finance only materials and equipment for the
project. Civil works and technical assistance would be financed locally through
a loan of US$40.3 million from Regional Development Fund, capital contributions
of US$64.4 million from the cities' General Accounts, US$122.1 million from
internal cash generation, and US$5.3 million am a central government contribution
related to Fxpo '93 in Taejon. Th- project financing plan is suimmarized in Table
3.2.

3.7      The borrower would be the Republic of Korea.  The proposed Bank loan
would be for 15 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The loan would be re-lent in equal amounts of US$20
million to the Pusan City Government (PCG) and the Taejon City Government (TCG)
on the same terms as Bank loan plus a 0.05% p.a. handling charge. The execution
of Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Central Government and the Pusan and
Taejon City Governments is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. The
foreign exchange and interest riaks on the loan would be borne by PCG and TCG.
Separate Project Agreements including operational, financial and monitoring
covenants, would be executed between the Bank and the cities.
F. Implementation
3.8      The Sewerage Divisions of the Pusan and Taejon City Governments would
carry out the project and operate and maintain the completed facilities.
Implementation would be under the overall supervision of the Sewerage Divisions'
Directors, who are experienced engineers. Day-to-day construction supervision
would be provided by consulting engineers appointed in April and December 1991
in Taejon and Pusan, respectively.   The consultants' duties would include
verification of compliance with specifications for works and goods, supervision
of construction, testing and commissioning of completed works, advising on
training of staff to operate the completed facilities, and preparation of
documents for procuring treatment plant equipment.



- 13 -
3.9      The project implementation period would be from 1990 to 1994, including
commissioning and start-up operations of the completed facilities, The schedule
(Annex 4) is based on previous experience and performanc' of the implementing
agencies with construction of similar worLo& and is coneidered realistic.
3.10     Civil works in Pusan would be divided into four contracts, three for the
interceptors, including the pumping station, and one for the sewage treatment
plant. Construction of interceptors started in November 1991 and would end in
September 1994. About 4.8 km of interceptors would be constructed in an open cut
and tho remaining 6.6 km with the tunneling method to avoid disrupting traffic
on heavily traveled roads. Civil works for the treatment plant would be carried
out from December 1991 to December 1994.    The equipment contract would be
awarded in September 1992 and installation completed in December 1994. Start-up
operation of the treatment plant is planned for July 1994, with the completion
of testing in December 1994 when the plant would start full operations. This
schedule is considered realistic since it was achieved during construction of two
similar treatment plants (Suyeong and Janglim) completed in 1989 and 1990.
3.11     Civil works in Taejon are divided into three contracts, which have all
been awarded to local contractors.  The first interceptors contract (5.7 km)
started in early-1990 and completed in March 1991; the second contract (6.2 km)
was completed in December 1991.  The sewage treatment plant contract started in
December 1990 with scheduled completion in December 1993. The equipment contract
would be awarded in May 1992 and installation completed in December 1993.  The
commissioning and start-up operation of the treatment plant is planned for
September 1993, with the completion of testing in December 1993 when the plant
would start full operation.
3.12     Consultants to undertake the Sewerage Master Plan studies were appointed
in July and November 1991 in Pusan and Taejon, respectively, and will complete
the assignments in December 1992. The description of consultant duties is shown
in Annex 2 and terms of reference for the studies are available in the Project
File. The consultants terms of reference are satisfactory. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the project cities will complete updating their
Sewerage Master Plans by December 31, 1992.
G. Land Accruisition
3.13     Land is required for both the Pusan and Taejon treatment plants and the
Pusan pumping station. The interceptors are constructed on land owned by the
cities. The Pusan Sewerage Division has purchased about half of the land
required for the treatment plant in 1990, and the remainder in December 1991.
Land is owned and used by two commercial corporations for storage of containers
and for sorting scrap metals. Both companies have other branches with suitable
land to which they are moving their operations. Land needed for the pumping
station is now used for commercial car wash which will be moved to other location
after the land is compensated in June 1992.
3.14     The Taejon Sewerage Division has purchased most of the land for the
Wonchon Dong treatment plant and in June 1991 it has satisfactorily compensated
six families who have now left the lend. Negotiations on compensation of the
remaining 11 houses, of which Glight were family-owned used for living and three



- 14 -
were commercial propertioe were comp1-ted in December 1991. 'he compensation of
families included besides the monetary component al3o a right to purchase a
serviced plot on cost in nearby land development scheme, recently completed. The
owners of comercial properties agreed with monetary compensation only. The
conditions and procedures used for resettlment of compensated families were
found satisfactory by the Bank and in accordance with Bank policies for
involuntary resettlement.
H. Prourement
3.15     The project would be executed through seven civil works and two supply
contracts. All seven civil works contracts are locally financed and procured
under local procedures; of these works three contracts (US$19.1 million) are
under construction in Taejon.
3.16     The bulk of equipment, totaling about US$65.3 million, would be procured
through international competitive bidding (ICB), following Bank guidelines. Also
in accordance with Bank guidelines, a preference margin equal to the amount of
the customs duties or 15% of the C.I.F. bid price (whichever ia lower) would be
granted for domestic goods at bid evaluation. Various materials contracts, not
exceeding US$300,000 each and aggregating about US$1.5 million for both
components, would be procured through local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures,
which are satisfactory to the Bank. Civil works (US$148.7 million) and technical
assistance (US$3.5 million) will be locally financed and procured. Prior Bank
review would be needed for goods contracts over US$1.0 million each, which would
include about 98% of the value of Bank-financed equipment.   The proposed
procurement arrangements are shown in the Table 3 3.

I. Disbursement
3.17     The procwede *f the Bank loan would be disbursed againot 100% of foreign
expenditures for dirt-tly imported equipment and materialu; 100% of   local
expenditure- (*x-factcry) for locally manufactured *quipment and materials? and
65% of local expenditures for other equipment and materials procured locally.
Disbursemnts for equipment contracts costing US$1.0 million or less each would
be made  on the  basis  of  Statements  of Expenditure  (SOE).    Supporting
documentation for these expenditures would be retained by the cities, made
available for review by Bank supervision missions, and regularly audited by
independent auditors (para. 4.5). An IBRD Special Account of US$2.CI million,
representing an estimated average of 4 months' disbursement, would be e.   lished
by each city to facilitate loan disbursement against eligible expenditues. The
IBRD Special Account would be replenished quarterly or whenever the available
balance in the account drops below 50% of the initial deposit, whichever occurs
first.
3.18      While project implementation would extend over five years from 1990 to
end-1994, the Bank loan would be disbursed in three years, which is the time
allocated in the project schedule for manufacture and installation of Bank-
financed equipment. Project works are expected to be in operation by end-1994,
but payments may extend through mid-1995, The loan closing date would therefore
be December 31, 1995. A schedule of estimated disbursements as well as a profile
of disbursements under previous Bank-aesisted water and sewerage projects is
given in Annex 5. Since the Bank is financing only equipment and materials for
the project the disbursement profile is not considered relevant to the proposed
project.
J. oneration and Maintenance
3.19     When completed, project works would be operated and maintained under the
overall supervision of the Pusan and Taejon Sewerage Divisions.  Under the
existing system, maintenance of combined drainage systems is decentralized to the
city districts (Gu). Wastewater treatment plants, including interceptors and
sewage pumping stations, are operated and maintained by the respective treatment
plant centers.   The Sewerage Divisions provide technical guidance and, as
required by the budgets of the respective units, allocate funds from Sewerage
Special Accounts, which are managed and administered by the Sewerage Divisions
(see para. 4.5).  This existing allocation of duties and responsibilities is
reasonable and would also be extended to facilities to be provided under the
project.
K. Environmental Imoact
3.20     Korea's very advanced environmental leg: ilation, endorsed in 1990,
consists of an Environmental Policy Basic Law complemented by regulations for
air, noise and vibrations, water quality, hazardous chemicals, and settlement of
environmental disputes. Accompanying the regulations are a series of standards
to be observed by all parties, including municipalities. Failure to comply with
the regulations incurs heavy penalties and even imprisonment, with the intention
of punishing both individuals and institutions not in compliance. With these



- 16 -
onforcement capabilities, the Ministry of Environment (MOE) has ensured
compliance with its regulations.
3.21     With the assistance of consultants, the project cities prepared for
MOE's review Environmental Impact Assessments for the proposed investments. In
approving the project, MOE required various measures to reduce negative
environmental impacts during construction and operation of the facilities. The
actions required during construction are standard for all construction sites and
cover reduction of dust, washout of soil from the construction site, the mode of
transporting excavated and construction materials, and restrictions on
tranmporting materials during peak traffic hours.   These requirements are
included  in  specifications  for the project's  civil works  contracts,  and
compliance will be enforced by construction supervision staff. With regard to
operations, MOE requires sanitary greenbelt around sewage treatment plants,
facilities to prevent excessive odor and noise, investigation of ways to use
digested sludge for agriculture in addition to or instead of disposal at sanitary
landfills, and, specifically for the Pusan works, dlscharge of effluent from the
completed plant from a sea outfall reaching beyond the sub-bay, and, for the
Taejon component, the securing of land for a possible tertiary treatment facility
as a contingency in case that it would be required in the future.
3.22     The cities have accepted and are complying with these actions. Designs
include sanitary greenbelt around the treatment plants, deodorizing facilities
at the plants, roofs covering all technological units at the Pusan plant and
sludge thickenere in the Taejon plant. The Pusan authorities are exploring the
use of digested sludge from other treatment plants for agricultural purposes.
In Taejon, all currently produced digested and dewatered sludge is used by a
landscaping company; consequently, landfill disposal should be rare. The current
practice used for disposing at sanitary landfills in both cities is appropriate.
The sludge is deposited in separate sections together with materials from
construction demolition; the generated leachate is treated before discharge.
The Pusan sea outfall reaching beyond the sub-bay will be constructed as part of
the reclamation of the entire sub-bay scheduled for completion by 2001, and land
for a possible tertiary treatment facility in Taejon has been secured in the
city's land use plan. These actions are considered satisfactory.
3.23     The overall environmental  impact of the project would be highly
positive. While full restoration of water quality in water courses and coastal
waters in the project area would be achieved only gradually by the year 2001, the
project's positive environmental effects would be achieved more quickly, as it
would considerably reduce pollution of inner-city rivers and drains through the
construction of interceptors and would bionificantly improve water quality in the
recipient water bodies through the treatment of sewage. The Yongho plant in
Pusan would daily remove about 36 tons of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and 34
tons of suspended solids (SS) which are now polluting the environment.
Similarly, the Wonchon Dong plant in Taejon would daily remove about 27 tons of
BOD and 24 tons of SS, about half of which would be directly attributable to
works under the proposed project.   A detailed assessment of the project's
environmental impact is provided in Annex 10.
3.24     Both treatment plants to be constructed under the project represent one
of several plant expansion phases, with others following shortly. Designs for



- 17 -
this current phase of plant investment and assessment of the related
environmental impacts were prepared on the basis of likely assumptions
extrapolated from currently available data. However, subsequent phases of plant
expansion would benefit from an evaluation of the actual performance of
constructed plants. Therefore, during negotiations, assurances were obtained
that six months prior to completion of each treatment plant, the relevant project
city will implement an Environmental Monitoring Program, satisfactory to the
Bank, to collect and evaluate data on the plant.' performance and the
envirormental impact of plant operations.
L. SpaevisiQn
3.25     Project superviaion by the Bank would require about 58 staff-weeks over
the life of the project, of which about 18 staff-weeks would be at hoadquarters
for review of progress reports, procurement actions, correspondence, etc. and 40
staff-weeks would be in the field. Supervision would be provided by sanitary
engineering and financial staff as well as specialists in water pollution control
and environmental issues.  The borrower's contribution to supervision would
entail reports on various specific subjects, including regular reporting on
implemen-ation progreos  and coordination of Bank field visits.  A project
supervision plan is given in Annex 6.

IV. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
A. Imoplmentina Agenciee
4.1      The project would be implemented by the Sewerage Divisionu of the Pusan
City Government (PCG) and the Taejon City Government (TCG), assisted by
consultants (para. 3.8). The Divisions are considered capable of handling this
responsibility in view of their recent satisfactory performance in implementing
two similar projects in Pusan and one in Taejon.
B.  Oroanization and Manacement
4.2      Municipal services in Pusan and Taejon are provided by the City
Governments which are organized into bureaus for finance, health, industry,
construction, etc. The bureaus, hea.ded by Director Generale reporting to the
Mayors, are responsible for overall planning, budgeting and general guidance of
the respective activities. Operation, maintenance and construction of facilities
are generally decentralized to the city districts (Gus).   The PCG and TCG
construction bureaus are divided into a number of divisions, including the
Sewerage Divisions.
4.3      Besides providing overall planning, budgeting and technical guidance to
the districts, the Sewerage Divisions are directly responsible for the
construction and, through the treatment plant centers, for operation of sewage
treatment facilities, including interceptors. The districts are responsible for
construction, operation and maintenance of both combined and separate sewerage
networks.   In Pusan, these activities are carried out by the districts'
Construction Divisions, whie in Taejon the activities are divided between the
Construction  and  Sewerage  Sections  of  the  Construction  Division.    The
organizational structure of the cities is shown in Charts 3 to 5.
C. Accounting and Auditino
4.4      Budgets are prepared under MOHA guidelines and approved by the City
Mayors and councils. Revenue and expenditures of the cities are divided between
the City General Accounts and Special Accounts. Revenue-earning activities such
as water, sewerage, and housing are organized as City Special Accounts which are
expected to be financially autonomous. The project Sewerage Divisions would
maintain the project accounts within their Sewerage Special Accounts.
4.5      The Pusan Sewerage Special Account (PSA) and the Taejon Sewerage Special
Account (TSA) separate assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to
sewerage operations. Using accrual accounting, the Sewerage Divisions of PCG and
TCG consolidate their own activities with those of the districts and prepare
annual income statements and balance sheets. The accounts of the cities and the
Sewerage Divisions are satisfactorily audited by public accounting firms.
Monthly financial reports comparing budgeted figures witn actual results are
prepared for both the city Construction Bureaus and divisional management.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the financial statements of
PSA and TSA will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
that such statements and audit reports, with the audit also including a separate
opinion on Statements of Expenditure and the Special Accounts for the Bank loan,



- 19 -
will be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year.
D. Billing and Collectlons
4.6      The  preparation  of  combined  bills  for  water  supply,  sewerage,
electricity, television, solid waste, and gas (Pusan only) is the responsibility
of an Integrated Billing Section in each district of the two cities. Maintenance
of the computerized billing and accounts receivable system in contracted out to
private computing firms which provide suammry reports, including details of
delinquent account", to the districts and utility companie-. The system works
satisfactorily. Bills, which are paid at banks, are due for payment within one
month of the billing date, and interest penalties are charged on overdue
accounts.  If the combined bill is not paid within two months, providers of
utility services are notified so they can take appropriate action. Accounts
receivable for PSA and TSA at the end of 1990 were equal to 33 and 42 days' sales
respectively, which is satisfactory.
E. Staffina and Training
4.7      About 500 staff work on sewage collection and treatment in Pusan and 125
staff in Taejon. Staff numbers and efficiency are satisfactory; there are less
than two employees per thousand sewerage connections in both Pusan and Taejon,
which is comparable to levels in efficient utilities in other countries.
4.8      Training in management, administration and accounting is organized at
the national level by MOHA. MOC is responsible for engineering and technical
training.  These arrangements are satisfactory.  Consulting services to be
provided under the project would, among other things, identify further training
needs of technical staff (Annex 2).

V. FIUNCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Rate Structure and Revenue
5.1      Sewerage tariff policies were introduced in Korea in 1983 and determined
on the basis of MOHA guidelines requiring that tariff, be valid until December
31, 1991. Accordingly, each municipality established sewerage tariffs to recover
its estimated operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and interest on
borrowing.  Sewerage tariffs for Pusan and Taejon were established in 1985,
based on estimated 1985-91 expenses. No tariff increases were approved during
this period. Domestic and commercial customers are billed at increasing block
rates, based on metered water consumption. Government and industrial customers
ar- charged at a fixed rate per cubic meter. In 1990, the average sewerage rate
was W 80 per m3 in Pusan and W 73 per m3 in Taejon.
5.2      A recent draft of a national tariff study prepared by consultants for
MOC recommends that tariffs be reviewed annually and in principle be set at a
level sufficient to cover operating expenses, including depreciation, and provide
a rate of return on net revalued fixed assets. The study recommends that the
rate of return should be assessed separately for each city or town and should be
at a level which would permit a portion of capital expenditure to be financed
from internally-generated funds. The recommendations of the study are included
in HOCs guidelines on methodology for setting sewerage tariffs after January 1,
1992, when the validity of current tariffs terminates and responsibility for
various aspects of urban management, including the setting and approval of
sewerage tariffs, will start to be decentralized to the cities. This process is
expected to take from one to three years. Within that transitional period MOC
will remain responsible for review and approval of sewerage tariffs proposed by
the cities to ensure that the recommended methodology is being followed.
B. Fixed Assets and Revaluation
5.3      When the Sewerage Special Accounts were established by PCG and TCG in
1988 and 1986, respectively, fixed assets were valued at replacement cost less
depreciation, and treated as an equity contribution. Since Korean law covering
Special Accounts requires the revaluation of fixed assets every five years, the
fixed assets of PSA and TSA should be revalued as at December 31, 1992 and
December 31, 1990, respectively. The TSA revaluation was completed in October
1991. During negotiations assurances were obtained that the fixed assets will be
revaluated periodically in accordance with Korean law.
C.  P
5.4      PcG and TCG finances are satisfactorily managed.   Both cities have
generated cash surpluses on their General Accounts and, in aggregate, on their
Special Accounts in recent years. A summary of the cities' financial status in
1989 and 1990 is avaLlable in the Project File.

D. Pusan Sewerace Siecial Account
5.5      Past Performance and Present Position.  Since its inception, PSA's
financial performance ham been satisfactory, am indicated by its revenues which
increased by 30% between 1988 and 1990, despite the lack of tariff increases
during the period. In 1990, the rate of _..turn was 4.7%. (Previous operating
expenses and rates of return are not comparable to 1990 data as assets and
depreciation were not fully introduced into the accounts until 1990.)
Internally-generated funds financed about 60% of 1988-90 capital spending. Other
finance was provided by capital contributions from PCG and loans. At December
31, 1990, long-term debt was only 12% of total capitalization, and PSA had a
strong current ratio of 4.4.
5.6      Financlal Pla. PSA's capital spendlng requiroments and financlal plan
for the 1990-95 project implementatLon perLod are as follows:

5.7      The PSA financial plan, including the Pusan City contribution from the
General Account and the Regional Development Fund Loan and its terms, was
confirmed during negotiations.
5.8      Future Finances  Financial projections for PSA during 1991-98 are given
in Annex 7.    innex 9 shows the assumptions used in preparing financial
projections for both PSA and TSA.  Based on the projections, PSA's financial
performance should continue to be satisfactory throughout the projection perLod.
5.9      The project would constitute about 28% of PSA's estimated capital
spending of W 525 billion between 1990 and 1998. To help finance this large
program, a 5% rate of return would need to be achieved in 1992.  This would
require an estimated 15% tariff increase in January 1992 and future tariff
increases estimated to annually average about 7%.
5.10     The tariff increase required from January 1, 1992 cannot be expected
since, on the same date, the newly elected City Council will assume
responsibility for tariff setting, among other things.  Consequently, it is
expected that the validity of existing tariffs will be extended and new tariffs
introduced in the course of 1992 with any shortfall of revenue being met from the
City's General Account  (para 4.4).   Thi3 would be satisfactory.   During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that starting from January 1, 1993, PCG
will charge sewerage tariffs yielding adequate revenue to meet operation and
maintenance costs, including depreciation, and debt service payments in excess
of depreciation, as well as provide a rate of return of at least 5% p.a. on net
fixed revalued assets in operation.
5.11     Between 1991 and 1998, PSA's net internal cash generation is expected
to increase 2.6 times, mainly because of revenue increases and the continuation
of relatively low debt payment levels. PSA's working ratio (operating expenses
except depreciation, as a percent of revenues) would be at satisfactory levels,
not exceeding 32% throughout. Sewage volumes would increase by an average annual
rate of about 9.5% during this period. Long-term debt, as a percentage of total
capitalization, would be in the low range of 7% to 12% between 1991 and 1998.
It is estimated that about 56% of PSA's 1991-98 capital spending could be
financed from internally-generated funds, thus reducing the burden of financing
capital spending from PCG's General Account.
E. TAeion Sewerage Special Account
5.12     Past Performance and Present Position.   TSA's revenues and expenses
increased by 31% and 27% respectively between 1988 and 1990, a period of no
tariff increases. There was little variation in net operating income, and rates
of return were less than 1% in each year. Internally-generated funds financed
only about 17% of 1988-90 capital spending, the rest being financed largely from
equity contributions provided from TCG general revenues. At December 31, 1990,
long-term debt was only 5.8% of total capitalization, and TSA had a strong
current ratio of 4.4.

5.14     The TSA financial plan, including the Taejon City contribution from its
General Account, the Regional Development Fund loan and its terms, and the
Central Government contribution was confirmed during negotiations.
5.15     Future Finances.  TSAIs financial projections are shown in Annex 8. The
project would constitute about 15% of TSA's estimated capital spending of W 270
billion between 1990 and 1998.   To help finance TSA's immediate and future
investment needs, a 3% rate of return would need to be achieved in 1992, which
would in turn require a tariff increase of about 56% in January 1992.



- 24 -
5.16     Like Pusan, Taejon faces practical difficulties in arranging a tariff
increase starting on January  1,  1992  (para. 5.10).   Accordingly,  during
negotiations, assurances were obtained that from January 1, 1993, TCG will charge
sewerage tariffs that would yield adequate revenue to meet operation and
maintenance costs, including depreciation, and debt service payments in excess
of depreciation, as well au provide a rate of return of at least 3% p.a. on net
fixed revalued asnets in operation.
5.17     Between 1991 and 1998, TSA's net internal cash generation is expected
to increase by about 4.8 times, mainly because of the 1992/93 tariff increases
and the continuation of relatively low debt payments. TSA's working ratio would
be at satisfactory levels, not exceeding 38% throughout the period.  Sewage
volumes during 1991-98 would increase by an average annual rate of about 13%.
Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization would be in the very low
range of about 5% to 12% during the period. It is estimated that TSA will be
able to finance abaut 32% of its 1990-98 spending from internally-generated
funds, thus reducing the burden on TCC's General Account.
F.  Monitoring and Evaluation
5.18     Project performance would be monitored against the implementation
schedule (Annex 4) while the implementing agencies' operational, financial and
managerial performance will be assessed against the monitoring indicators given
in Annex 11. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that PCG and TCG
would send the Bank semi-annual project progress reports, including revised
project coot estimates and implementing schedules, not later than March 31 and
September 30 of each project year, as well as their updated financial projections
not later than September 30 of each project year.

VI. PREM= JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Benefits
6.1      The right of every citizen to enjoy a safe and pleasant environment was
recently added to the Korean constitution.  Accordingly, the Government hau
adopted various policies and programs with the ultimate goal of improving the
condition of the country's overall environment, which was allowed to deteriorate
during past decades of rapid economic development. One of the main environmental
programs would arrest the growing pollution of national water resources and
gradually restore them to their original state. Since a substantial portion of
water pollution is generated by the population (para. 1.4), the Government's
effort focuses on the accelerated construction of municipal sewage treatment
plants under its Nationel Wastewater Treatment Plan (para. 1.16). This Plan,
which is one of the most ambitious clean-up programs in a developing country,
will help sustain urban and industrial growth, with minimum adverse effects on
the environment and, at the same time, will substantially contribute to gradually
improving the water quality of the country'a rivers. The proposed project would
help the Government implement this program ia the cities of Pusan and Taejon and
would thus contribute to the protection of the nation's water resources.
6.2   The direct benefits of the project would come from removing domestic sewage
from the inner-city rivers and improving the living standards of the cities'
populations, eepecially those living and working in close proximity to waterways
which are now polluted by a considerable volume of raw sewage (paras. 2.9-2.10).
The interceptors to be constructed under the project would ensure that an
increased volume of wastewater would be contained within the system and not
allowed to contaminate inner-city waterways. This would reduce the health risk
from contact with river water, improve the air quality by eliminating unpleasant
sewage odors from the atmosphere, and improve the cities' visual and aesthetic
environment. The project works would also increase property values in areas
adjoining the currently polluted waters and, in Pusan, would remove a substantial
portion of the wastewater currently polluting the city's harbor, facilitate
control of pollution from ships, and help improve the appearance of both the
harbor and the local beaches, which are important to tourism.   This should
benefit the local tourism industry ae well as fishing and the harvesting of
seaweed.
6.3   Other project benefits would be derived from updating the Sewerage Master
Plans, using modern computer-based technologies (para 3.12). The updated Plans
would support the cities' ambitious development plans covering the next decade
and, by including detailed programs for the conversion to more sanitary separate
sewerage systems as well as procedures to streamline institutional arrangements
in the sub-sector, would allow both Pusan and Taejon to upgrade the sanitation
services they provide. In addition, the approval of appropriate sewerage tariffs
being sought under the project would assist the sewerage agencies to meet their
financial objectives, thus helrtng to ensure an undisturbed flow of finance for
planned development and improvement of the systems (paras 5.10 and 5.16).
6.4   The main beneficiaries of the proposed sewage treatment plants would be
users of the currently polluted river water downstream of Taejon and of the
coastal waters in the Pusan area.  The Taejon treatment plant would reduce



- 26 -
pollution in the downstream river, which is used by the neighboring communities
to extract water for domestic and industrial consumption and for agriculture.
The Pusan treatment plant would treat a substantial volume of raw sewage now
polluting Pusan harbor (Annex 10, para. 14), which is the largest in Korea, and
reduce the pollution load now reaching the adjoining Bay famous for its tourist
resorts and sandy beaches.
B. Rate of Return
6.5   A valuation of project's economic benefits in monetary terms has not been
made because the data on changes in water quality and respective impacts on
current and potential water users in the project locations are not available.
Also, the methodologies available for estimating the economic benefits which
would result from improving the quality of water in recipient to a particular
standard have many limitations.
6.6     The financial rate of return (FRR) which in constant prices relates the
sewerage revenues to the capital and operating cost of sewerage facilities was
computed aA an approximate indication of minimum economic return. FRR for Puinan
amounts to about 10% and for Taejon to 5%. These are adequate considering the
social nature of the project and the intangible health and environment benefits
cited above. The difference in the two cities's FRR is attributable largely to
more demanding financial performance covenant (tariffs to provide rate of return
on assets of 5% in Pusan as compared to 3% in Taejon, due to relatively smaller
capital contribution from General Accounts in Pusan than in Taejon) as well as
to the economies of scale benefiting larger facilities in Pusan. Detailed
computation of FRR, including assumptions used are shown in Annex 12.
C. Least-cost Solution
6.7   The technical alternatives selected for the project represent the least-
cost solutions to improving the sewerage systems in both Pusan and Taejon. The
locations of the sewage treatment plants, the scale of their phased expansion,
and the treatment technology, interceptor alignments, and design of the Pusan
pumping station were selected based on an evaluation of several alternatives
studied during preparation of the Sewerage Master Plans for the project cities
(paras. 2.13-2.14). In both plants, treatment would be carried out using the
activated sludge process, which has been found to be the most appropriate for
large communities and in areas of high population density where the cost of land
is at a premium.
6.8   The Sewerage Master Plans for the project cities were prepared up to eight
years ago when the cities' characteristics and development plans were clearly
different from the present situation; nevertheless, the contents of the Plans in
terms of delineating catchment areas and locating the treatment plants are still
considered accurate.  However, to ensure that subsequent phases of the plants'
expansion represent optimal choices and least-cost œolutions, the Plans would be
updated under the proposed project to take into consideration developments within
the cities since the Plans were prepared and, consequently, the changing water
supply and sewerage requirements.   Factors to be considered in the Plans'
updating include expansion of the city boundaries, establishment of new



- 27 -
industries and industrial estates, the relocation of other industries, and the
now housing areas built.
D. Affordability
6.9   Sewerage charges in Korea are now very low, and the tariff increase
proposed for both project cities as of January 1, 1993 is not expected to impose
an undue burden on households at the lowest income levels.  The lowest paid
workers are mainly in unskilled jobs like street cleaners and laborers, with an
estimated monthly income in the first quarter of 1991 of about W 400,000. Since
the average household contains four persons and 1.5 wage *arners, the lowest
average household income is about W 600,000 a month.   Assuming that such
households consume about 250 lcd of water, the average sewerage charge at the
increased levels proposed would represent 0.35% of gross household income in
Pusan and 0.37% in Taejon.
6.10 However, the level of sewerage tariffs would relate to the efficiency of
implementation and operation of project facilities. The sensitivity analysio
assessing (a) an increase in the capital cost by 10%; and (b) an increase in the
operating cost by 10% indicated that tariffs are most sensitive to the capital
cost. An increase in the capital cost of 10% would increase tariffs by about 9%
while same increase in operating cost results in a tariff increase of 1%. A worst
scenario assuming 10% increase in capital and operating cost would result in a
10% increase of tariffs. This would raise the charges as a proportion of gross
household income from 0.35% to 0.39% in Pusan and from 0.37% to 0.40% in Taejon.
The combined water and sewerage charge, including these possible adverse effects
would be about 1.5% to the households in both cities. This is only a fraction of
the 4% to 6% coneidered affordable for water and sewerage services in other
developing countries. The expected continuation of increases in per capita and
household  incomes  in Korea would reduca these percentages  even  further.
Estimated future tariffs after project works are in operation would not
significantly affect affordability.
E. Environmental Impact
6.11 The Government of Korea places high priority on the efficient use of water
and the improvement and maintenance of water quality.   As a result, it has
launched a National Wastewater Treatment Plan which, when completed, would make
Korea one of the few developing countries with extensive sewage treatment
facilities in place and functioning.   The proposed project would support
implementation of this Plan in the country's second and sixth largest cities,
with the key objective of substantially improving the condition of the
environment in these cities by removing pollution from wastewater discharges into
the cities' rivers and coastal areas. At completion, the facilities constructed
under the project would remove pollution equivalent to about 36 tons of SOD and
34 tons of suspended solids each day in Pusan and about 27 tons of BOD and 24
tone of suspended solids in Taejon (Annex 10). Implementation of project works
would provide proper treatment for about 60% and 50% of sewage generated in Pusan
and Taejon, and consequently result in a major improvement of the environment in
the project area, higher living standards for the local population, and
elimination of damage from raw sewage by eliminating offensive odors, improving
the appearance of waterways, and reducing sludge and litter in the harbor and on
the beaches of Pusan.  Furthermore, as part of the project, the cities will



- 28 -
institute an Environmental Monitoring Program to collect and evaluate relevant
data on pollution in all water courses, so that ongoing water pollution control
can be adeuately managed and future facilities may be optimally designed.
F. Proj2*t Risks
6.12 The project's civil works components present no special risks. A possible
risk could be that delays in adequate tariff increases would limit internal cash
generation. In view of commitments of the cities it can be assumed that such a
shortfall would be compensated from the general revenues and would not result in
delays of construction. Implementation of the SMPs to be updated under the
project and realization of the environmental benefits expected from the
conversion to sanitary separate sewer systems lie beyond the project time frame
and consequently cannot be assured. Howaver, popular pressure now being exerted
in Korea for much stronger environmental protection measures significantly
increasos the probability that the SHPs will be carried out by the year 2001 as
now planned.

VII* AMENTS EACHED MM RECOMMATION
7.1      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Pusan and Taejon
City Governments that:
(a)   the Cities will complete updating their Sewerage Master Plans by December
31, 1992 (para. 3.12);
(b)   six months prior to completion of each project treatment plant, the cities
will each implement an Environmental Monitoring Program, satisfactory to
the Bank, to collect and evaluate data on the plants' performance and the
environmental impact of plant operations (para. 3.24);
(c)   the cities' Sewerage Special Accounts will be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank, and such statements and audit reports,
with the audit also including a separate opinion on Statements of
Expenditure and the Special Accounts established for the Bank loan, will
be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal
year (para. 4.5);
(d)   the fixed assets will be revaluated periodically in accordance with Korean
Law (para 5.3);
(e)   the Pusan and Taejon City Governments will charge, from January 1, 1993,
sewerage tariffs yielding adequate revenue to meet operation and
maintenance costs, including depreciation, and debt service payments in
excess of depreciation, as well as provide a rate of return of at least 5%
and 3% p.a. on net fixed revalued assets in operation in Pusan and Taejon,
respectively (paras. 5.10 and 5.16); and
(f)   the cities will send to the Bank semi-annual progress reports, including
updated project cost estimates and implementation schedules, not later
than March 31 and September 30 of each project year, as well as updated
financial projections for their Sewerage Special Accounts no later than
September 30 of each project year (para. 5.18).
7.2      During negotiations, the financial plans for the Pusan and Taejon
Special Sewerage Accounts for the project period, including the Central
Government contributions, the cities' contributions from the General Accounts,
and the availability of the Regional Development Fund loans and their lending
terms, were confirmed with the Government of Korea and the Pusan and Taejon City
Governments (paras. 5.7 and 5.14).
7.3      Signing of Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Central Government and
the Pusan and Taejon City Governments will be a condition of loan effectiveness
(para. 3.7).
7.4      Subject to the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project
constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$40 million equivalent, for a
period of 15 years, including a grace period of five years, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate. The borrower would be the Republic of Korea.

1.          Pusan, located about 440 km south-east from Seoul, is Korea's second
largest city and largest port. It has both light industri-e such as chemicals,
textiles and leather as well as heavy industry such as metallurgy, machinery and
shipbuilding concentrated in more than 40,000 factories employing near to 600,000
persons.
2.          Pusan's population has tripled from about 1.3 million in 1963, when
the municipality was upgraded to the special City status, to about 3.9 million
in 1990, and in expected to grow to 4.8 million in 2001. Its administrative area
also grew from 360 knm in 1963 to 435 km2 in 1988 and was increased to 526 1m2 in
1989. Administratively, the city is divided into 12 district. (Gu) and 220 sub-
districts (Dong).
Water SUPD1V
3.          The water supply services are managed by the Pusan Water Agency which
is a self-financing municipal corporation. Water services were provided in 1990
to 3.8 million, or 97. 5% of the population. The daily average production was 1.5
million m/d, or 360 lcd (including about 38% of non-revenue water). Out of
294,000 service connections in 1990 about 78% were residential, using about 61%
of water supplied; of the remaining usage about 30% was commercial and industrial
use, and 9% was public use.
4.          The production capacity of the water supply system is about 2 million
me/d and the facilities include three water intakes, five water treatment plants
of sizes varying from 8,000 m3/d to 1.0 million m3/d, two balancing reservoirs
with the total volume of 2.0 million m3 and about 10,000 km of pipes of various
diameters, of which the distribution network is 7,700 km. The Water Agency plans
expansion of production and distribution capacities to 2.5 million m/d and 2.8
million m3/d in 1995 and 2001, respectively.  The past and projected daily
average water production and sales are shown in Table A-l.1.

Sewerace MKater Plan
5.          The initial sewerage master plan, prepared in 1974 under German
government assistance, proposed to combine 14 natural drainage catchments within
the City into three treatment districts, each served by several wastewater
pumping stations and one wastewater treatment plant. This plan was updated in
1984 in connection with preparation of a long-term plan for the city.  The
updated plan has recommendeds (a) elimination of several pumping stations by
increasing the number of treatment districts from three to six; and
(b) completion of the separation of the existing combined sewerage system in the

8.          The master plan evaluated alternative arrangements for collection of
storm and wastewater and recommended the separate systems as a least cost
solution to be imp.emented by 2001.  The interceptors to be constructed and
provided with storm overflows in the interim would be later modified and serve
as trunk mains within the sanitary sewer system. The projected development of
the drainage and sewerage system and served population are shown in Table A-1.6
and A-1.7.

Sewerace System
9.          The development of the drainage and wastewater collection system is
substantially behind the above master plan projections. The built-up area in
1990 was 142 km2, of which 118 km2, or 83% war provided with sewers.  The total
length of the system was about 4,205 km, including 4,168 km of combined sewers,
32 km of interceptors, and 5 km of sanitary sewers.  The number of sewerage
connections in 1990 reached 94,000 connecting about 95% of the population.
10.         The combined systeme normally include open gutters along roads,
unsuitable for receiving raw sewage. The city regulations, therefore, require
each premise to arrange for pre-treatment (mainly by septic tanks) before
discharging into public sewers.
Sewage Treatment
11.         The construction of treatment plants also started later and with some
modifications as compared to the master plan. The first plant completed in 1988
was the first phase of Suyeong (230,000 m3/d)g its final capacity of 420,000 m3/d
is expected to be in operation in 1998. The second plant completed in 1990 was
the first phase of Janglim (300,000 me/d); its final capacity of S00,000 m3/d is
planned to be in operation in 2001. The next is the first phase of Yongho, to
be completed in 1994, and increased from planned 240,000 m3/d to 270,000 m3/d.
The current construction program for treatment plants is shown in Table A-1.8.

Note: numbers in brackets indicate completed capacities
12.         The existing as well as proposed treatment plants use a conventional
activated sludge process, including sludge digestion in anaerobic tanks followed
by dewatering and disposal in the city's sanitary landfill.
13.         The maintenance of the sewerage system, with the exception of
treatment plants, interceptors and sewage pumping, is provided by the district
and sub-district construction divLisons. The treatment plants, interceptors, and



- 34 -
ANNEX 1
Page 5
sewage pumping stations are operated and maintained by the respectLve treatment
plant staff.
14.         The treatment plant units are headed by the di, ctors who report to
the mayor through the director general of the construction bureau. They are
supported by a staff of about 100 at each Suyeong and Janglim plants. Financing
of operation and maintenance of the entire sewerage system is provided from the
sewerage special account administered by the sewerage division.
Njahtsoil Disoosal. and Treatment
J5.         In 1990, the population of about 1.3 million (33%) were using
traditional toilets in combination with a vault to store the nightsoil, and the
remaining 2.6 million (67%) used flush toilets discharging  into septic tanks.
The nightsoil as well as the sludge from septic tanks is collected by private
contracors and disposed of in the two nightsoil treatment plants (NTP) located
at Yongho and Kamjeong. The NTP at Yongho consists of anaerobic digestion and
activated sludge process with a total capac'tty of 1,250 kilo-liters (kl) per day.
The NTP at Kamjeong uses three technologies in parallel, namely the Zimpro method
(high temperature under high pressure), anaerobic digestion and waste
stabilization ponds, with a total capacity of 2,200 kl per day. In 1989 the
plant processed daily about 1,300 kl, of which 700 kl was nightsoil and 600 kl
sludge from septic tanks. The digested and dewatered sludge is sold to farmers.
16,         In 1990 the Yongho NTP treated about 400 kl per day.  The treatment
facilities include anaerobic digestion tanks, sludge thickeners, and sludge
dewatering on belt press machines. Gas generated during anaerobic digestion is
used for heating the digestion tanks. The dowatered sludge is either disposed
of in the city's sanitary landfill or sold to farmers.  The supernatant is
treated by an activated sludge process and after treatment is diecharged in the
Yongho River and the Suyoong Bay.
Solid Waste Management
17.         In 1985 the city collected daily about 8,500 t of solid waste and
disposed it in Seokdae Dong sanitary landfill.  The sludge from Suyeong and
Janglim STPe amounting to 120 t/d is deposited in that landfill. The city is
starting separation of wastes; it is now being applied by users and arrangements
are under preparation for separate collection and reuse.
TAEJON COMPONENT
Ponulation
18.         Taejon, located about 160 km south from Seoul, is Korea's sixth
largest city.   Its manufacturing consists mainly of labor-intensive light
industries such as textiles, leather and needlework concentrated in about 500
factories employing over 50,000 persons. Though Taejon has a relatively weak
industrial base, the new science town (Taedok) and the high-tech industrial
complex with planned 150 enterprises, tj be completed in 19912 and 1995,
respectively, will provide for substantial expansion of science and technology-
oriented industries.
19.         To reduce the immigration pressure on the capital the Government
decided several years ago to move a number of the country's administrative
offices from Seoul to Taejon. To reflect that decision the Taejon administrative
area was gradually enlarged from 88 km2 in 1980 to 204 km2 in 1983 and finally to
538 km2 in 1989, when Taejon was upgraded to Special City status.   Through
absorption of noighboring localities, the population increased from 0.65 million
in 1980 to 0.80 million in 1983, and reached over 1.0 million in 1989 with 1.65
million expected in 2001. Its administrative area of 537 km2 is divided into
five districts (Gus), which are further subdivided into 76 sub-districts (Dongs).

Water SuODly
20.         The water supply services are managed by the Taejon Water Agency
which is a self-financing municipal corporation. Water servicos were provided
in 1990 to 904,000, or 85% of the population. The daily average production was
303,000 m3/d or 335 lcd (including about 36% of non-revenue water).  Out of
89,000 service connections in 1990 about 75% were residential, using about 61%
of water supplied.
21.         The production capacity of the water supply system in 1990 was
409,000 m'/dt the facilities include four water intakes, five water treatment
plants of sizes varying from 9,000 m3/d to 300,000 m'/d, balancing reservoirs with
the total volume of 117,000 m3, and about 3,400 km of pipes of various diameters,
of which the network with diameters greater and smaller than 50 mm was 840 km and
2,550 km, respectively.   The Water Agency is expanding its production and
distribution facilities to 609,000 m'/d to be in operation in 1991, and plans to
expand its capacity to about 1.0 million m3/d by 2001.

Sewerage Master Plan
22.         The initial sewerage master plan which outlined the improvements of
the sewer system and treatment of wastewater up to year 2001 was prepared in
1982. The plan was updated in 1989 prior to preparation of the detailed design
of the second phase of the treatment plant to reflect the changes in population
projections and enlarged administrative area. The city's administrative area is
naturally divided into six drainage basins all finally discharging into Kapchon
River. Within these basins the 1989 plan defines the sewer planning area as
being the built-up area either provided or to be provided with sewer.  The
projected sewer planning area is shown on Table A-1.10.

23.         The updated projections of wastewater generated in the sewer planning
area are based on the following assumptions: (a) domestic--on past and projected
water supply, leakage ratio, and losses during water use; (b) industrial--on unit
demand of water for various light industries and unit demand per employee for
high-tech industrial complex; and (c) infiltration - on the present ground water

24.         The  1989  revision  of the master plan  follows  the  principal
recommendations of the 1982 plan concerning the proposed construction of
interceptors and treatment plants in four phases up to year 2001.   The
modifications, resulting from the faster growth and enlargement of the city area,
include a longer interceptors, as a result of moving t:ie third and fourth phase
of the treatment plant from Wonchon Dong to a new lo ation at Tae Dong, about 14
km downstream. However, the 1989 revision recommen4ed maintaining the combined
system in already built up areas and adopting the separate systems only in now
developments. This represents a major departure from the initial master plan
which recommended the separate system as the least cost solution. The phasing
of treatment plants, length of interceptors, wastewater flows and related
population as projected in the 1989 plan are shown on Tables A-1.12 through
A-1.14.

Sewerage System
25.         The built up area in 1990 was 73 knm, of which 51 kin, or 70% was
sewered, providing services to about 1.0 million, or 87% of population. The
total length of the system was about 1,500 km, including 1,355 km of combined
sewers, 108 km of sanitary sewers and 39 km of interceptors.  The number of
sewerage connections which are billed sewerage charges has increased from 77,300
in 1986 to 92,600 in 1990.
26.         The combined systems normally include open gutters along roads,
unsuitable for receiving raw sewage. The city regulations, therefore, require
each premise to arrange for pre-treatment (mainly by septic tanks) before
discharging into public sewers.
Sewage Treatment Plant
27.         The sewage treatment plant (150,000 e3/d maximum capacity) is located
at Wonchon Dong, which was the point where the recipient, the Kapchon River,
crossed the boundary of the city before extension of its administrative area.
It uses a conventional activated sludge process, followed by sludge thickening,
anaerobic digestion and dewatering. Dewatered sludge is currently given to a
private landscaping company free of charge. The plant primary treatment has been
in operation since December 1986 and in full operation from June 1990. From
December 1990 the plant also receives through the interceptor all nightsoil
collected in the city after its pre-treatment in the nightsoil treatment plant
at Samcheon (para 29 below).
28.         The maintenance of the sewerage system, with the exception of
treatment plant and interceptors, is provided by the districto and sub-districts.
The treatment plant and interceptors are operated and maintained by the treatment
plant section. The section is headed by the plant director who reports to the
mayor through the director general of the construction bureau. He is supported
by a staff of 55 of which 44 are technical and 11 administrative personnel.
Financing of operation and maintenance of the entire sewerage system is provided
from the sewerage special account administered by the sewerage division.
Niahtsoil DieDosal and Treatment
29.         The nightsoil collected in 1990 reached a daily average of 515 kl,
of which 205 kl was the nightsoil and 310 kl the septic tanks sludge.  The
nightsoil as well as sludge from septic tanks is collected by private contractors
and disposed in Samcheon NTP operated by the city's Cleansing Department. It
is further estimated that about 200 kl/d of nightsoil and sludge is
uncontrollably disposed, or used in gardens and farms. The NTP has a capacity
of 300 kl/d and consists of grit chamber, screening, anaerobic digestion and
activated sludge treatment for supernatant.  In December 1990 the biological
operations of the plant (anaerobic digestion and activated sludge treatment for
eupernatant) were discontinued and after processing it through the grit chamber
and screening the collected volume, is now being discharged in the Wonchon Dong

third phac- of the treatment plant at Tao Dong.
Solid Waste NUanament
30.         In 1989 the city collected daily about 1,600 t of solid wastes out
of about 1,700 t generated daily in the city and disposed this quantity in the
sanitary landfill which is expected to be filled during 1992. A new site with
a capacity for about 15-20 years has been identified near to the proposod
expansion of the sewage treatment at Tas Dong and the feasibility study is under
preparation. It is expected that the surplus of dowatered sludge from the sewage
treatment plant, which would be not disposed otherwise, would be disposed in the
new sanitary landfill.

6.          The plant aesign focuses on mitigation of environmental impacts, such
as odor from raw sewage and noise from pumps and blowers, as well as on its
aesthetic appearances all tanks are roofed, air is deodorized in the central
facility located in the administration and control building and the structures
are design to protect against noise. The surface of the plant is designed as a
combination of a park and recreational facility, with 30 m wide green belt around
the plant, the roof over both primary and secondary settlers and aeration tanks
(225 m x 135 m) equipped with recreational facilities for various sports
accessible to neighbors, and roofo over oludge thickening tanks provided with
greenery.
sewac*  Pumoina Station
7.          The pumping station is located about 25 m deep under the crossing of
two main roads, 2.4 km west from the Yongho plant. The interceptor entering the
pumping station has a diameter of 2.6 m to be constructed by tunneling method.
The inflow is by gravity.  The pumping station will be equipped with five
vertical sewage pumps (2 x 140 mn/m; 3 x 110 m3/m) and will lift the sewage by
about 16.0 m in the existing boxed sewer (6.0 m x 2.5 m) which will bring the
sewage, again by gravity, into the treatment plant at Yongho.  Besides the
pumping plant the main facilities of the pumping station will include the grit
chamber, screens, transformers, deodorization facility, safety overflow and lift
to a loading bay for removal of solids retained in the grit chamber and on
screens.

S.          The interceptors in the total lengths of 11.4 km include the
construction of new conduits (8.8 km) and the existing concrete channel of the
Da-ycon River (1.6 km). The new conduits will be constructed mainly by the
tunneling method to avoid disruption of heavy traffic in the center of the city
and along main roads.  All facilities are designed for maximum hourly flows
projected for final stage (9.4 m3/sec at the treatment inlet). The location,
dimensions and length of interceptors to be included in the project are shown in
Table A -2.3.

a 30 m wide green belt around the plant, the deodorization facilities, and noise
abatement structures.
Interceptore
14.         Phase II includes construction of a greater length of interceptors
than initially expected in the design mainly due to the city's effort to improve
its appearance in connection with the EXP0'93. The conduits are constructed of
circular pre-stressed concrete pipes except for about 3.6 km of main collector
which is a rectangular box constructed in situ. The conduits are designed for
hourly maximums projected for 2001. The location, dimensions and lengths of
interceptors to be constructed within the project are shown in Table A-2.6.

PUSAN AND TAEJON SEWERAGE PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.    The financial projections were prepared by the Bank appraisal mission with
the assistance of a local firm of consultants. The projections are in current
Won. The following assumptions apply to both PSA and TSA except where stated.
Income Statements
2.    Revenueos Revenues have been adjusted to the level required to produce a
minimum of a 5% rate of return on net fixed asseto in operation from 1993 to 1998
in PSA, and 3% in TSA. Assumptions were made that POO and TCG would increase
tariffs by 15% and 56% on September 1, 1992, giving average annual increases for
1992 of 5t and 18.81%, respectively. Estimates of sewage volumes were based on
projected water consumption.
3.   Qerat&on ExDensess Projected 1991 expenses are based on budgeted figures.
Inflation has been added to expenses at 5% per annum for 1992 and thereafter.
Personnel, electricity, chemicals, and maintenance expenses cover the treatment
plants and the administration expenses of PC4 and ToG sewerage divisions.
operation and maintenance expenses incurred at the district level relate to the
sewerage network and are shown separately under the heading "District 0 & M".
4.   Personne1j  The  projections  includ   e stimated  additional  staffing
requirements when the treatment plants are placed ln service, as well as a 3%
annual increase.
5.   Electricity and Chemicalos Projected expenses are based on increases in the
volumes of treated sewage.
6.    Intearated  Billinc Charge: Tne projected  charges  are  lncreased  in
proportlon to the lncrease in sewage quantities.
7.    Waintenanco and District O&M: Expenses are projected to increase in
proportion to additlons to flxed assets in service.
S.   Da2g81Ltjon3 Depreciation has been calculated at an average rate of 2.66%
for Pusan, and 2.79% for Taejon based on average actual rates for 1990.
Balanc- Sheets
9.    Fixed Assets: These are assumed to be revalued every five years in
accordance wlth Korean law covering Special Accounts. Revaluation rates are
based on actual and projected local inflatlon. A revaluation of PSA fixed assets
ls assumed at the end of 1991 and 1997, and at the end of 1990 and 1995 for TSA.

10.   Accountg Receivable: Based on past experience, these have been assumed to
equal 30 days for P8A, and 40 days for TSA.
11.  XElveaoriess These have been assumed to  increase in proportion to
additional net fixed assets in service.
12.   Accounts Pavable: Historical figures have been projected to increase in
line with operating expenses.
13.   Capital  SurDlus:  Additions  to  capital  surplus  consist  of  capital
contributions as shown in the source and application of funds.
14.   Log2rs  The cities Regional Development Fund is financed by the sale of
compulsory bonds. The funds are used for development projects administered by
other special accounts. Finance from the Regional Development Funds would be
provided over 10 years including a two year grace period at an 8% interest rate.
15.   The US$40 million (Won 28.8 billion) Bank loan would be on-lent by the
Government in equal amounts to PCG and TCG over 15 years, including 5 years
grace, at the Bank interest rate plus 0.05% p.a. handling charge. The on-lending
interest rate has been assumed at 7.75%.
16.   Source and Anolication of Funds: Other capital contributions relate to
actual and estimated future network construction contributed from city funds and
developers. (KLDC agreed contribution for Taejon treatment plant, phase 3,
represents equivalent expenditures for a separate treatment plant which KLDC
should normally construct in connection wi:h its land developments).

PUSAN AND TAEJON SEWERAGE PROJECT
Environmental Imp-act Assessment
General
1.          Korea has very advanced environmental legislation, endorsed in August
1990, consisting of an Environmental Policy Basic Law and complemented by
separate regulations for air, noise and vibrations, water quality, hazardous
chemicals,  and settlement of environmental disputes.   The regulations are
accompanied by a series of standards to be observed by all involved bodies,
including municipalities. Failure to comply with the regulations results in
heavy penalties and even imprisonment, with punishment directed at both the
responsible individuals and institutions.   The rulings of the Ministry of
Environment (MOR) are therefore taken very seriously by the cities. Pressure
being exerted by city residents to protect and improve the urban environment is
also strongly influencing official decisions and leading to improved city
environments.
Pusan Sewae Trgeatment Plant
2.          Assessment.  An Environmental Impact Assessment (zrA) of project
activities in Pusan was prepared by the city administration, assisted by
consultants (Samwha Engineering) in September 1987. The report assessed the
potential environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the Yongho
sewage treatment plant (STP), which would have a maximum daily capacity of
560,000 m3 in 2001.
3.          The EIA differentiates between impacts occurring during construction
of the plant, which are similar at all construction sites and dealt with by MOE's
separate standard regulations, and impacts occurring during the operation of the
treatment plant. Those related to operation of the treatment plant are summarized
in Table A-10.1.

Table A-10.1: Pusan - Summary of EIA Report
Identified Environmental ImDactg           Procosed Mitigation MeasMres
a) Potential problems with settlement      Special foundation recommended.
due to unsuitable soils for foundation
of structures.
b) Air pollution during operation          No epecial measures required,
of the plant.                              amounts are insignificant.
c) Odor from generated gases and noise    Estimated to remain within Korean
from operation of equipment.               standards. Greenbelt 30 m wide
around the plant to be grown as a
protection against possible increase
in odor and noise levels. 1/
d) Disposal of the sludge generated        The sludge will be disposed of in
in the plant (31 t/d).                     the city'e sanitary landfill.
e) Improvement of seaweed production       No verifying details provided.
harvested at a farm in Suyeong Bay.
f) Improvement of water quality in
Pusan Bay to Class II (harbor area).
g) Improvement of water quality in
Suysong Bay (receiving effluent from
Yongho treatment plant).
1/ Proper operation of the plant should make it virtually odor-free.
4.          The improvement ot water quality as shown in (f) and (g) above is
based on the following: the water quality in the Bays before (1986) and after the
project (2001) was projected on the basis of mathematical modelling. The results
showed substantial improvements of water quality in coastal water under various
flows in the rivers and combinations of tidal changes. For example:
Year        ti 00                     ear        1962001
----COD mg/l----                     ----COD mg/l---
Inner area   8.0         4.0         Inner area  3.0         1.5
Outer area   1.0         1.0         Outer area  1.5         1.0
Notes COD - Chemical Oxygen Demand (used in saline waters).
5.          Observations of the current water quality in the Suyeong sub-bay
which receives discharges from several small rivers indicated relatively high
levels of pollution (7-14 mg/l COD) as compared to the outer areas (COD less than
2 mg/l). The report, therefore, recommended that the plant's effluent should be
discharged through an outfall into the Day near Tongsaengmal Point to avoid
further pollution of the sub-bay. The outfall should be constructed after
completion of the reclamation of the sub-bay, which is propooed in the Pusan City
Development Master Plan.
6.          Required Mitiaatina Actions. MOE approved the city's EIA report in
October 1988, after receiving several additional explanations, and set out the
following actions to be implemented by the city:
(a)   prevention of soil erosion and deposition of sediment, and cleaning
of vehicles transporting excavation materials during construction;



- 66 -                           ANNEX 10
Page 3
(b)   foundation of water retaining structures on special piles;
(c)   covering over water retaining  structures and  installation of
deodorizing filters for sludge operations;
(d)   planting of trees within a 30 m wide greenbelt around the plant;
(a)   consideration given to using dewatered sludge for agriculture or
composting;
(f)   protection of receiving waters by using sanitary sewers, maintenance
of adequate planu  performance, and pro-treatment of industrial
effluent suspected to be harmful to plant operation;
(gq   discharging of treated effluent into the outer bay near Tongsaengmal
Point, possibly through a diffuser; and
(h)   preparation and implementation of an "after-project" environmental
management plan to monitor ecological and environmental changes
during operations, including the impact on the nearby seaweed
cultivation.
7.          While MOE's approval applies to the final stage of the Yongho
treatment plant, expected to be completed in 2001, it implies that oome of the
special mitigating actions should be used for the first phase, even when not
slecifically identified. The approval does not specify any special requirements
regarding the construction or operation of interceptors or the pumping station
for which the design proposals are environmentaly sound.
8.          Status  of  Mitioatino  Actions.    The  city  has  accepted  full
responsibility for mitigating actions and is complying or will comply with all
of MOE's environmental requirements for construction, operation and monitoring
of the first phase of the Yoigho plant. In this connection, it intends to:
(a)   carry out a study of the use of dewatered sludge for agriculture or
composting, prior to completion of the plant's final phase;
(b)   study separation of the sewerage system in conjunction with updating
the Sewerage Master Plan, which is scheduled to start before end-
1991; the course of action will be decided once the study results
are available;
(c)   eliminate the possibility of toxic contamination of sewage from
uncontrolled industrial discharges due mainly to accidents by
relocating industrial establishments now in residential areas to
separate industrial estates. This is expected to be completed in
1996. Industries with similar types of wastes are being grouped
together and provided with pro-treatment to comply with MOE's
regulations for discharges into public sewers, with final
(secondary) treatment at the existing plant at Janglim;
(d)   discharge plant effluent into Suyeong Bay near Tongsaengmal Point
and, by the year 2001, carry out reclamation works in the sub-bay.
A conduit will be constructed for the Yongho River, which is the
recipient of Yongho treatment plant effluent, up to Tongeaengmal
Point, where the reclamation works will end. The ongoing sub-bay
reclamation has reduced the sub-bay area to less than half over the
past 15 years. The reclaimed land is being utilized for extension of
neighboring chemical-port facilities.
In addition, most interceptors passing through heavilv traveled roads and
intersections will be constructed by tunneling to avoid traffic disturbances. The
remaining parts will be constructed in the river flood reserve, with only a minor
impact on the population during construction. The transport of excavated soils

ANNEX 10
Page 4
and construction materials will be concentrated outside of peak traffic hours.
The pumping station will be situat-d underground and its ventilation provided
with an effective deodorization filter. The procurement of land for these works
involves no resettlement or demolition of houses.
9.          Reauirementg for Treatment Performance  MOE'e standards require that
effluent from STPe should not exceed the following key parameters:
Parameter                      Up to 12/31/1995         From 1/1/1996
BODS mg/i                             30                       20
SS   mg/l                             70                       20
Total Nitrogen (N)                    --                       60
Total Phosphorus (P)                  --                        8
Note: BODS - Biochemical Oxygjen Demand (5-days laboratory test)
SS   - Suspended Solids
10.         The new values to be appliee from 1996 may in general create some
difficulties for the cities since the operational experience at existing sewerage
treatment plants in Korea shows that BODS and S in the final effluent are
normally above 20 mg/l. They may also require greater efforts to comply with
requirements for total N and P.
11.         Environmental Imoact on Receivina Water. In 1996, about 340,000 m3/d
with average concentrations of 127 mg/l of BODS and 119 mg/l of S5 are expected
to be treated at the Yongho plant and discharged into Suyeong Bayl of the total
treated, about 200,000 m3/d will originate in the catchment of the Tongchon River
(draining into the harbor) and 140,000 m3/d in the western coastal catchment of
Suyeong Bay. By quantity, this will represent a load of 43.2 t/d of SODS and 40.5
t/d of 8S, of which 25.4 t/d of SODS and 23.8 t/d of 5S will originate in the
Tongchon River catchment and 17.8 t/d of SODS and 16.7 t/d of SS in the Suyeong
area. The Yongho plant will remove about 36.4 t/d of BODS and 33.7 t/d of SS, and
the residual pollution of the Suyeong Bay will be equal to about 6.8 t/d of SODS
and 6.8 t/d of S8. The summary review of the Yongho Plant's impact on removing
the generated pollution is shown in Table A-10.2

12.         augong SA. Suyeong Bay in scenically attractive and is mainly used
for recreational activities. A small area is also used for seaweed cultivation.
In 1990, on the basis of regular monitoring, the Bay was identified as having
water quality of Claus It (COD less than 2 mg/l, coliform bacteria less than
1,000 M4PN/l00 ml). The occurrence of "red tides" causing serious environmental
damage has never been observed in the Say.
13.         Suyeong sub-bay is protected from sea currents, and the dispersion
of pollution during diurnal tides is limited. Current discharges of untreated
wastewater from three minor catchments (Namohon, Taeyeonchon, and Yonghochon)
have about 17.8 t/d of BOD5 and 13.9 t/d of 88, resulting in relatively high
pollution as compared with the rest of the Say. After completion of the project,
the current discharge will be eliminated and collected by interceptors. Sub-bay
pollution will be limited to the residual load from the Yongho treatmeat plant,
estimated at 6.8 t/d of BODS, or about 11.0 t/d of BOD5 le  than at present.
Such a roduction (about 62%) will represent a substantial improvement compared
to the existing situation.
Pusan Day
14.         The Pusan Bay is mainly used as an international harbor. Port
facilities handle about 95% of Korea's container transport and slightly less than
half of its other sea transport. Observations of water quality in the Tongchon
River, near its opening into Pusan Bay, have indicated values in the ranges of
60 mg/l of BOD5 in 1987 to 78 mg/l of SODS in 1989, with higher concentrations
during the dry season. Water quality data for Pusan Bay in 1990 Indicated heavy
pollution in the upper part of the inner bay (harbor), with COD ranging from 2
mg/l to 26 mg/I and coliform more than 70,000 MPN/100 ml, depending on the tide
in the harbor and precipitation in the catchment. After completion of the
project, pollution in Pusan Bay will be limited to occasional discharges of
wastewater from storm water overflows. All other wastewater will flow into the
Yongho plant, and its residual pollution will be discharged into Suyeong Bay. The
project would therefore substantially contribute to improving water quality in
the inner area of Pusan Bay and In Pusan harbor.
iS.         A water quality monitoring and evaluation program in Suyeong Bay will
be establiehed under the project to study the impact of discharges from the



69 -
ANNEX 10
Page 6
Yongho treatment plant on water quality in the sub-bay and in the Bay. The
objective of the program is to identify the need for special dispersion outlets
after completion of the final stage of the plant. The information obtained from
the study will also be an important input for the successful and effective future
management of pollution control measures at the plant.
16.         gonitorina and Institutional Capabilities.  The city has highly
qualified personnel, supported by laboratory and other equipment, capabl, of
conducting reliable monitoring and research programs. The performance monitoring
of the two existing STPs is satisfactory. The city also monitors water quality
along Kwanganri Beach during the summer. The Health and Environment Research
Institute monitors water quality in main streams, rivers, and coastal areas and
cooperates on several research projects with area universities and research
institutes such as the National Environmental Research Institute (NERI) of MOE
and the Korean Institute of Construction Technology (KICT).
17.         MOE's Regional Office in Pusan if also equipped with satisfactory
laboratories and qualified personnel. During construction and operation of the
STP, it will periodically monitor compliance with the EIA's standards for
discharge, as well as the environmental quality of the area. The city and MOE's
Regional Office have been effectively monitoring the compliance of industrial
establishments with the effluent standards.
Taeion Sewage Treatment Plant
18.         Assessment.  An EIA for the plant was prepared by the city with the
aesistance of consultants (Hyundai Engineering) in December 1989. The report
assessed the potential environmental impacts related to construction and
operation of the treatment plant at Wonchon Dong which will be expanded by
150,000 m3/d to a maximum daily capacity of 300,000 m3 in 1993.  The report
states that while this expansion phase will substantially contribute to improving
the quality of bota the inner city and the receiving rivers, it is only the
second of four phases proposed to treat all sewage generated in Taejon City. The
remaining two phases are planned to be completed in the year 2001.
19.         The EIA differentiates between impacts occurring during construction
of the plant, which are similar at all construction sites and dealt with by OE's
separate standard regulations, and impacts occurring during operation of the
treatment plant. Those related to operation of the plant are summarized in Table
A-10.3.

20.         The status of water quality in receiving waters of the Kapchon River
before (1986) and after the project (1994) were estimated in the report on the
basis of mathematical modelling as follows:

21.         R2cuirements for Mitigating Actions.  MOZ approved the city's EIA
report in March 1990, and set out the following actions to be implemented by the
city:
(a)   prevention of soil erosion and deposition of sediment, and cleaning
of vehicles transporting excavation materials during construction;
(b)   proper foundations for water retaining structures;
(c)   installation of deodorizing filters for sludge operations;
(d)   planting of trees within a 30-m wide greenbelt around the plant;
(e)   securing of a landfill site for sludge disposal;
(f)   prevention of toxic substances from entering the treatment plant;
(g)   implementation of an ecological study for the Kapchon River after
the start of plant operations;
(h)   securing of a site for possible tertiary treatment in case the need
arises; and
(i)   preparation and implementation of an "after-project" environmental
management plan to monitor ecological and environmental changes
during operation of the treatment plant.
22.         Status  of  Mitiaatino  Actions.    The  city  has  accepted  full
responsibility for mitigating actions and is complying or will comply with all
of OE's environmental requirements for the treatment plant, which are included
either in the designs of facilities or in the contract for construction. The site
for expansion of the plant if tertiary treatment is needed has been secured in
the city land-use plan.
23.         A site for a new sanitary landfill with a capacity for about 15 to
20 years has been identified near the proposed expansion of the STP at Tae Dong
and the feasibility study is being prepared. The new oanitary landfill will start
operations from 1993, and it is expected that surplus dewatered sludge from the
plant, which would not be disposed of otherwise, would be disposed in the new
landfill. At present, all dewatered sludge is given to a private landscaping
company free of charge. There are indications that the established procedure will
continue.
24.         The operation of existing and construction of new interceptors
present no major environmental problem. The conduits are located within flood
reserves along the rivers and do not involve disturbance of traffic or demolition
of any property.

25.         Construetion of the treatment plant requires compensation for 17
plot. and houses at the site. At appraieal, six families were compensated and
left the site. Negotiations are ongoing with the remaining eleven families, of
whom six would be compensated for land plus houses and five for houses only
(since the land owners were compensated earlier). The conditions and procedures
used for compensation and resettlement of now compensated families were reviewed
by the Bank during project appraisal, found satisfactory and in accordance with
Bank policies for involuntary resettlement. The past and ongoing negotiations
are monitored by the Vice-Mayor to ensure that the achieved agreement is
satisfactory to all parties. The Bank will be informed of the outcome of
negotiations.
operation of Facilities
26.         In 1990, the annual average SOD5 and SB at the entry point in the
existing STP (first phaas of Wonchon Dong) were 105 mg/l and 97 mg/l,
respectively. The concentration increased from January 1991, when the plant
started to receive the city's nightsoils BOD5 ranged from 111 mg/l to 188 mg/l
and SS from 99 mg/l to 184 mg/l. The effluent BOD5 and 8S during this period were
both less than 14 mg/l. The treatment efficiency of the existing STP is
considered adequate and satisfactory.
Environmental Impact on Receiving Haters
27.         The project is designed to have a positive impact on both the inner
city rivers upstream of the treatment plant and on the recipient waters
downstream of the plant. The monitoring of water quality in the inner city rivers
started only in 1990 when interceptors constructed under the first phase of the
project were in place. Since these represent less than 20% of the total length
of conduits required to collect all wastewater along the rivers, the volume of
wastewater polluting the rivers is still considerable, resulting in
concentrations of BODS in 1990 of 20 mg/l to 40 mg/l. These concentrations will
gradually be reduced with the ongoing construction of intercepting conduits. A
noticeable positive impact, however, is expected only after periods of heavy
rains when floods wash away the organic sediments accumulated earlier in the
river beds.
28.         In 1994, about 300,000 m3/d of water with an average concentration
of 110 mg/l of SODS and 100 mg/l of SS are expected to be treated at the Wonchon
Dong plant and discharged after treatment into the Kapchon Riv .. ThjLs is
equivalent to a load of 33 t/d of BODS and 30 t/d of SS. The plant will remove
about 27 t/d of BOD5 and 24 t/d of SS which would otherwise pollute the city's
inner rivers as well as the Kapchon River downstream of the plant. In the
approximately 15 km stretch between the Wonchon Dong plant and the confluence
with the Kum River, the Kapchon River water is currently not used for any purpose
except occasional irrigation of small farms. The area will, however, be developed
for Taejon's new high-tech industrial complex to be completed in 1995. In
expectation of this development, MOE has recently reclassified the Rapchon River
to Clbas IV (SODS less than 8 mg/l) which could be achieved only after the
interceptors proposed for third phase of treatment expansion are constructed. A
summary review of the Wonchon Dong plant's impact on removing pollution is shown
in Table A-10.4.
