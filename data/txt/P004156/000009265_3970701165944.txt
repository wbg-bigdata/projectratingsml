Implementation Completion report
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
Pusan and Taejon Sewerage Project
(Loan 3450-KO)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Pusan and
Taejon Sewerage Project in the Republic of Korea, for which loan No. 3450-KO
in the amount of US$ 40 million equivalent was approved on March 26, 1992 and
made effective on August 26, 1992.
The loan closed on June 30, 1996 compared with the original closing date
of December 31, 1995. Out of the total loan, an amount of US$ 6.0 million was
canceled in July 1994 by Pusan, and US$ 0.46 million canceled in December 1995
by Taejon. The final disbursement took place in September 19, 1996, at which
time a balance of US$ 19.6 thousand equivalent was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division, Country
Department I, East Asia and Pacific Region and reviewed by Mr. J.Shivakumar,
Chief of Infrastructure Operations, and Mr. Walter Schwermer, Project Adviser.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's completion mission, in
November 1996. The borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing
its own evaluation of the project's execution and initial preparation which is
attached in Appendix A and B. The borrower also commented on the draft ICR.

REPUBLIC OF KOREA
Pusan and Taejon Sewerage Project
(Loan 3450-KO)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
i.          The  project  was  designed  to  support  the  Korean  Government's
efforts to improve water quality in rivers and coastal waters, and was a
logical continuation of the Bank's Sewerage and Wastewater Sector Report
(1988) in which the main recommendations were to increase construction of
wastewater treatment plants (WTP), and to accelerate conversion of combined
sewers. Through the project preparation the Bank drew on its familiarity with
the Korean water supply and sewerage sector, its experience in supporting
sector developments worldwide, and its interest in addressing environmental
issues.
Project Objectives
ii.          The objectives of the project were to:  (a) improve environmental
conditions  in two of Korea's  largest  cities;  (b)  reduce pollution  in the
country's rivers and coastal waters, which is crucial to the well-being of a
large part  of  the population;  (c)  reduce  health  hazards  associated  with
contaminated water bodies, particularly to the lowest-income section of the
population which is most exposed to this problem; and (d) provide continued
support for technological and institutional improvements in the sector.
iii.         In Pusan, the project consisted of the construction of the first
phase of Nambu (previously called Yongho) WTP, a sewage pumping station and
about 11.4 km of large-diameter interceptors. In Taejon, the project consisted
of construction of the second phase of Wonchon Dong WTP and 11.9 km of
interceptors.
iv.          During project identification a review was made of the existing
Pusan and Taejon sewerage master plans (SMP), which were already over ten
years old and did not provide sufficient detail to further develop the
systems. It was agreed that both project cities would update their SMPs by
December 31, 1992 to take into account any developments since the plans were
prepared,  and to  establish  programs  for  conversion  to more  sanitary  and
environmentally acceptable separate sewer systems.
v.           The WTPs constructed under the project were part of the plan for
further expansion of treatment capacity and sewer construction projects.   As
the  improvement  of environmental  conditions  was  a main  objective  of  the
project,  assurances  were  obtained  that  the  actual  performance  of  the
constructed plants would be monitored to ensure compliance with environmental
regulations as well as to provide useful data for future expansion programs.
Both cities agreed to implement an Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) to
collect and evaluate the impact of plant operations.
vi.          The financial viability of the two implementing agencies,  Pusan
and Taejon sewerage division, depended upon the ability to generate adequate
income to meet all financial obligations on a timely basis and sustain a



iii
satisfactory level of working capital to continue operations. To this end both
cities agreed to set sewerage tariffs yielding adequate revenues to meet
operation and maintenance costs including depreciation, and to provide a rate
of return of at least 5'6 in Pusan and 3% in Taejon on their respective net
revalued fixed assets. The rate of return covenants were used to measure the
financial performance of both cities' sewerage facility. Due to national anti-
inflationary policies, sewerage tariffs were not increased in 1992 or 1993,
and the rates of return targets were not achieved (para 17-21).
vii.        The project objectives supported the Korean Government's 1990-96
National Wastewater Treatment Plan (NWTP) to improve the water quality in the
country, and reverse environmental degradation due to the country's rapid
industrialization. The planning was sound and the results would suggest that
the project was well founded and the agreements reached to promote the
achievement of the objectives were realistic and well conceived.
Implementation Experience and Results
viii.       The project achieved its overall objectives.  The identification
phase was carried out in a very satisfactory manner. The feasibility studies
and detailed design benefitted not only from the extensive involvement of
local agencies, but also from the evaluation of issues by infrastructure and
environmental units within the Bank. There is strong evidence that the project
is sustainable, given the commitment of national and local governments to
improve environmental conditions in the country, and Pusan and Taejon have
recently advanced their investment programs for additional wastewater
treatment facilities.
ix.                The only delay in implementation was in Pusan where the WTP
is located close to a residential area. Neighboring resident representatives
held lengthy discussions with the city to ensure that the appearance and
operation of the completed plant would not adversely affect their living
conditions. This matter was resolved by a partial redesign of the component
which was satisfactory to the residents.
x.          The project's  cost,  including interest during  construction,  as
estimated at appraisal was US$ 272.1 million of which US$ 40.0 million
equivalent was to be financed by the Bank. The balance was financed from local
borrowing, the cities' general accounts, internal cash generation, and a small
capital contribution from the central government to Taejon city towards the
international Expo'93 exhibition. The original closing date was set at
December 31, 1995, but due to the delay in implementation in Pusan, the
closing date was extended to June 30, 1996. The actual project cost was US$
278.6 million which is only fractionally higher than the appraisal estimate.
xi.         A   number   of   institutional   strengthening   initiatives   were
implemented under the project to update the cities' SMPs, provide operator
training during start-up and commissioning, provide guidance on sewerage
tariff structures, and improve environmental monitoring. Overall Bank
supervision was satisfactory, being handled by an experienced sanitary
engineer, supported by environmental and financial specialists. The borrower
and implementing agencies performed well and relations with these agencies and
consultants were cordial and productive.
xii.        The financial performance of both project cities was,  however,
unsatisfactory. This was mainly due to the delay in raising sewerage charges
which, during appraisal had been expected to be increased in 1992, but due to
national anti-inflationary measures, this did not happen. However, substantial



iv
additional tariff increases were introduced in Pusan in 1995 and an additional
increase of over 30% is planned for 1997. This is not the case in Taejon where
relatively small increases of 9.8% were introduced in 1994 and 1996, but these
were insufficient to make the agency profitable. Taejon has been designated a
spill-over city for Seoul, and keeping charges at lower levels is a factor in
encouraging development in this area. (para. 21 & 25)
xiii.       Actual  revenues  in  1995  were  30%  less  than  projected  during
appraisal  in  Pusan,  and  40%  less  in  Taejon.  Another  reason  for  the
unsatisfactory financial performance and reduced revenues was lower water
consumption due to very low rainfall for the past three years. A water
conservation campaign introduced mainly in Pusan, resulted in lower billing
than originally projected.
xiv.         On balance,  the project outcome can be considered satisfactory.
The only major problem was the failure to increase sewerage tariffs as had
been expected during appraisal, and the non-compliance of the financial ROR
covenants. Although the financial covenants were not complied with, at project
completion the overall target for internally generated funds had been
satisfactorily addressed in Pusan. In Taejon, increase in sewerage tariffs has
been at lower levels to encourage development in the city. The loss of revenue
due to lower tariffs did not affect the financing of the project as the
shortfall was made up from the cities' general account and local borrowing.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
xv.          Benefits from the project will be sustained given the cities' and
government's commitment to improve the environment, and their provision of
skilled and well trained staff to service and operate the facilities.  This
commitment is also supported by the citizens of Pusan and Taejon (paras 24-
25) . Both cities will continue to monitor environmental conditions at the
plants and the receiving waters.
xvi.         The main lessons to be drawn from the experience in implementing
the project are as follows:
a) the close relationship between the Bank and the borrower provided the
basis for wide-ranging discussions, not only to create appropriately
designed projects, but also for provision of well trained institutions
to support and operate the facilities, environmental monitoring, and the
ability of operating agencies to further develop the systems.
b) where sewerage facilities are located close to residential areas,
discussions should be held at an early stage with residents'
representatives to reach acceptable plant design standards, as well as
tolerable methods of operation; failure to do this can lead to
construction delays.
c) as an alternative to using the rate of return covenant to measure
satisfactory financial performance of a sewerage utility where assets
are  mainly  underground,  out  of  sight  and  difficult  to  value,  an
acceptable measure is the agency's contribution to investment from
internal resources; this covenant was adopted for the follow-up sewerage
project in Pusan (Korea: Waste Disposal Project Ln.3830-KO).
d) the potential for the success of any project is increased if it fits
into the government's sector development policy.






Implementation Completion Report
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
Pusan and Taejon Sewerage Project
(Loan 3450-KO)
PART 1: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Project Objectives
1.          Korea experienced a sharp upsurge in economic growth during the
past three decades, which was accompanied by an increased demand for water
supplies for domestic and industrial use. The outlook for the next decade is
for continued expansion in the demand for water. The treatment and safe
disposal of wastewater is a major concern of the government, and to help
resolve this problem, the National Water Improvement Program (NWIP) was
approved by government in 1989.
2.          The two key elements in the NWIP were the upgrading of municipal
water supplies and the improvement of water quality in rivers and coastal
waters. The NWIP was formulated with the assistance of the Bank report Korea -
Sewerage and Wastewater Management, Options and Recommendations (April 1988),
and the objectives of the Pusan and Taejon Sewerage Project conform to this
program.
3.          The aim of the development of sewerage systems in the two project
cities by 2001 is to provide the total population with sewerage services,
including full secondary treatment of all wastewater generated in the planning
area.  The  objectives  of  the project  were  to:  (a)  improve  environmental
conditions; (b) reduce pollution in the water courses and coastal waters; (c)
reduce health hazards associated with contaminated rivers; and (d) continue to
support technological and institutional improvements in the sector.
4.          The project objectives were well defined, realistic and important
for the sector development, and had the full commitment of the Pusan and
Taejon city governments and their respective sewerage agencies.
5.          The Pusan component of the project consisted of the construction
of the first phase of the Nambu (previously called Yongho) waste water
treatment plant (WTP), a sewage pumping station and 11.4 km of large-diameter
interceptors. The Taejon component consisted of the construction of the second
phase on Wonchon Dong WTP and 11.9 km of interceptors.
6.          The  Pusan Sewerage Management  Office,  and the Taejon  Sewerage
Division already had considerable experience in implementing similar projects,
and were satisfactorily assisted by consultants throughout the preparation,
implementation and commissioning periods. There were no undue risks as the
professional ability and extensive work experience of the agencies' staff
enabled them to respond to changes occurring during implementation.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
Physical Objectives
7.          The design of all project components represented the least-cost
solution to improve sewerage systems in Pusan and Taejon, and the resulting
construction was carried out successfully.



2
8.          In Pusan the construction of the Nambu (previously known as Yongho
in the SAR) WTP was completed in June 1996, but the final completion of the
sea outfall is not expected until October 1997. Test operations commenced on
November 1, 1995 and were completed in May, 1996. At appraisal, construction
of civil works, the installation of equipment, commissioning and testing, were
planned to be completed on December 31, 1994.
9.          Due  to  objections  from  neighboring  NGOs  on  the  visual  and
operational effect the WTP would have on the neighborhood, the treatment plant
had to be partially redesigned, replacing an open concrete channel on the
Daeyon river by a tunnel, and eliminating the booster pumping station on the
trunk main. The delay in completion was due to negotiations with NGOs,
redesign and new bidding.
10.         In Taejon the construction of the second phase of Wonchon Dong
sewage treatment plant and the sewer interceptors (increased from 11.9 km at
appraisal to 20.7 km) was completed in January 1994, and test operations were
finished in July 1994.   At appraisal the planned date  for completion of
construction, commissioning and test operations was December 31, 1993.
11.         The actual project cost, including interest during construction,
is US$ 278.6 million which is only about 2% higher than the appraisal estimate
of US$ 272.1 million. The Bank financed US$ 33.5 million of the project out of
the approved loan of US$ 40.0 million (Pusan canceled US$ 6.0 million from
savings made on equipment and the partial redesign of the component, and
Taejon canceled US$ 0.4 million). The balance of the project cost was financed
from local borrowing, the cities' general accounts, and a contribution from
the central government to Taejon city towards the Expo'93 exhibition.
Environmental Objectives
12.         The successful completion of the project is expected to provide
long-term environmental benefits to the two cities and their surrounding
areas. These include conservation of aquatic resources, reduced health hazards
associated with contaminated water, improved quality of receiving bodies of
water, increased land and property values, and enhanced aesthetic appearance
of river and coastal recreation areas.
13.          The measures taken to reduce negative environmental impact during
construction  are  standard  to  all  construction  sites  in  Korea,  and  were
satisfactorily observed in both cities.
14.         The regulations relating to the operation of WTPs, the potential
environmental impact and mitigating measures to be taken, are comprehensive in
nature, and under MOE regulations, are required to be accurately monitored on
a continuous basis. There are no special requirements regarding the operation
of interceptors or pumping stations, and the designs for these are
satisfactory and environmentally sound.
15.         In Pusan,  the monitoring contract was modified to reflect the
start of the first test operations and full testing commenced in June 1996
when the plant went into full operation. On the city's own initiative a sea
environment research program will also be carried out.
16.         In Taejon the first monitoring before completion of construction
was carried out in November 1993 and January 1994, but due to unsatisfactory
results had to be repeated, taking into account other factors such as river
flow and depth, and the quantity and characteristics of discharge into the



3
river. The water quality showed higher concentrations of BOD, COD and SS
compared to the values predicted in the 1989 Environmental Impact Assessment
study. It is reported that these high concentrations are partly due to Stage
III of the Wonchon Dong WTP, which is currently under construction.
Financial Objectives
17.         The financial objectives were established so that both cities'
sewerage agencies would improve their financial situation in order to progress
towards  self-financing  status  in  the  future,  and  contribute  to  funding
investments. To support this objective, the two city governments agreed that
revenues from sewerage charges would be set to cover operating and maintenance
costs including depreciation, and produce annual rates of return of not less
than 5% in Pusan and 3% in Taejon. These targets were used as a covenants to
measure the financial performance of both cities' sewerage facility.
18.         Due to national anti-inflationary policies, the Government opposed
any utility tariff increases in 1992 or 1993. In April 1993, these policies
were followed by the cities when the authority to set tariffs was devolved to
the municipalities, and as a consequence the rates of return targets were not
achieved. From 1994, both cities increased the sewerage charge which resulted
in an improvement in revenue generation (para 23). This indicates that in
spite of the fact that financial covenants were not complied with, the overall
target for internally generated funds had been addressed in both cites. The
actual rates of return achieved compared to those required at appraisal are
shown in Table 1.
Table 1. Rates of return
Pusan                         Taejon
Year               Required    Actual              Required    Actual
1993                 5.0%        1.4%                 3.0%       -0.5%
1994                 5.0%        1.5%                 3.0%       -0.7%
1995                 5.0%        2.2%                 3.0%       -1.6%
1996 (est)           5.0%        2.9%                 3.0%        0.0%
19.         The major reasons Pusan sewerage division did not achieve the rate
of return  target were  due to the advancement  of its  capital  expenditure
program, the extremely high increases in revalued fixed asset values in 1993,
and the reduced volumes of waste water processed. At appraisal the projected
capital expenditure for 1995 was W 74 billion whereas the actual figure jumped
to W 120 billion as environmental pressures forced the city to bring forward
construction  of wastewater treatment  facilities.  The  revaluation  of  fixed
assets, covering the five years to 1993, increased fixed asset values by over
85%.  Wastewater volumes were 28% below the appraisal estimate due to severe
water  shortages  over the past three  years,  which  resulted in lower  than
projected revenues.
20.         While  wastewater  volumes  were  7%  less  than  projected  during
appraisal, the main reason Taejon failed to generate sufficient revenues and
achieve a positive rate of return is because it failed to increase tariffs to
an adequate level. During negotiations, Taejon agreed to take all necessary
measures to achieve a rate of return of 3% per annum, and it was expected that
tariff increases in the order of 20% to 25% would be required for the period
1992 through 1994 to help meet this target.
21.         Once  national  anti-inflationary  pressures  were  lifted  and  the
authority to set tariffs was devolved to the cities, Taejon city kept annual



4
sewerage charge increases at under 10%, which were insufficient to achieve the
required 3% rate of return.   The situation was discussed with Bank missions
and it was reported that local political pressures were foremost in keeping
tariff increases at lower levels than other special cities in Korea. Taejon
has been designated a spill-over city for Seoul, and keeping charges at lower
levels in Taejon is a factor in encouraging development in this area to take
some of the pressure off the overdevelopment of Seoul.
22.         While the financial performance in both project cities has been
less than satisfactory, operational expenditure remained as projected, which
is a positive indication that the shortfall in revenues has not affected the
operation and maintenance expenditure on the facilities. The lower than
expected income was made up from the cities' general accounts and local
borrowing from the respective regional development funds and Pusan received a
W 18 billion loan from the Environmental Development Fund.

23.          In Pusan,  average sewerage tariffs were increased by 9.9%  from
January 1, 1994, by a further 19.7% from January 1995, and an additional
increase of 37.4% in December 1995. In Taejon they were increased by 9.8% in
November, 1994 and by the same percentage in June 1996. Additional increases
of 34.9% in Pusan and 10% in Taejon are planned to be introduced early in
1997. Both cities have included annual increases of their sewerage tariffs in
their respective Five Year Plans from 1997 through to 2001.
24.          The recent substantial increases in sewerage tariffs in Pusan have
been agreed after a series of discussions between the city and resident
organizations, as the improvement of the environment is now a major issue with
all citizens. Pusan recently suffered from contamination of the Nakdong river
(the main water source for the city), with drought conditions now being into
the third year, and 'red-tides' experienced in some of the river estuaries,
beaches and coastal areas.
25.         The increase in average sewerage tariffs in Taejon has been at a
lower levels to encourage development in the city (para 21), and unlike Pusan,
the city of Taejon has not experienced the same environmental problems or
water shortages. In addition, the city has not needed to generate large
revenues from tariffs to fund expansion of its wastewater treatment
facilities, as land developers are funding around two-thirds of Phase III of
the Wonchon Dong WTP.
Institutional Development
26.         Under the project the sewerage master plans (SMP) for both cities
were updated with the maximum use of computers to simplify their maintenance,
and to update and make amendments as and when required. This updating is
designed to ensure that subsequent expansion of wastewater treatment
facilities represents best choices and least-cost solutions. Treatment plant
operators received training during the commissioning of the new treatment
plants, which use the latest technology to ensure optimal performance.
27.          The sewerage agencies'  finance  staff,  assisted by consultants,
have developed the skills necessary to prepare detailed annual tariff increase
submissions. The agencies' aims are to set sewerage tariffs consistent with
economic and social objectives and with due consideration of the residents'
willingness and ability to pay.

Sector Policies
28.         The project has not deviated  from the sector policies  of the
Government as prescribed by the Ministry of Construction and Transportation
(MOCT) and the Ministry of Environment (MOE). The completed project therefore,
conforms with the detailed designs approved by MOE, and was consistent with
government's and Bank's development/country strategy.
Financial Rate of Return
29.         The  financial  rate  of  return  (FRR)  of  the  completed  project
relates sewerage revenues (adjusted to include approved tariff increases) to
the capital and operating costs of sewerage facilities, and is computed as an
approximate indication of minimum economic return. The FRR is 7.0% for Pusan
and 0.4% for Taejon, as compared to 9.5% and 4.9% respectively at appraisal.
These reductions in the FRR are the consequence of the delay in imposing
higher sewerage tariffs, as well as reduced billings due to water shortages.
30.         The difference in the two cities' FRR is attributed largely to the
tariff increases introduced earlier, at higher levels in Pusan than in Taejon
(para 23). With regards to Pusan, the matter of tariffs was satisfactorily
addressed from 1994 onwards with annual increases averaging over 30%, and
considering the social nature of the project with intangible health and
environmental benefits, the recalculated FRR is considered adequate. The FRR
for Taejon is unsatisfactory. Action needs to be taken by the responsible city
officials to remedy the situation of Taejon's sewerage agency and ensure that
long-term sustainablity is not threatened.
C. Major factors Affecting the Project
31.         Firms  of  Korean  consulting  engineers  were  engaged  under  the
project  to  supervise  day-to-day  construction;   verify  compliance  with
specifications for works and goods; test and commission completed works;
advise on training staff to operate the completed facilities; and prepare
procurement documentation. The performance of these consultants for both
project components was good and contributed significantly to the successful
implementation of the project.
32.         The standard of performance of the contractors for civil works,
electrical and mechanical work on the treatment plants, interceptors and
related tasks was generally good. Performance on equipment supply contracts
was satisfactory; deliveries were on schedule, and all equipment supplied
conformed to specifications.
33.         The  clear  sector  policies,  guidelines  and  local  government
commitment to both components, together with the significant environmental
benefits, were a major factor in the positive results of the project.
34.         Both  cities  provided  capital  contributions  from  their  general
accounts, and the central Government provided equity funding for the Taejon
component linked to that city's Expo'93 international exhibition. The Regional
Development Funds in both cities provided loans to help finance the project.
Pusan also obtained a loan on preferential terms from the Environmental
Management Corporation (EMC) which was not expected at the time of the
appraisal. Taejon obtained a loan from EMC towards stage III of the Wonchon
Dong WTP which is presently under construction.



6
35.         The commitment of the management and staff in Pusan and Taejon
sewerage divisions was generally very good and their internal administrative
procedures worked satisfactorily. The regular submission of project progress
reports was adequate but the submission of managerial and financial monitoring
indicators was occasionally delayed, leaving Bank supervision missions to
complete some of the data.
36.         In Pusan,  lower than expected equipment costs coupled with the
elimination of the booster pumping station led to a reduction in the project
costs of some US$ 6 million. Pusan city initially considered using this amount
to help finance an incinerator for the disposal of sludge, but later decided
against this course of action and in July 1994, on government request, the
Bank loan was reduced from a total of US$ 40 million to US$ 34 million. The
partial redesign of the WTP due to objections from neighboring NGOs was the
main reason for the delay of about 18 months from the original estimate (para
9)-
D. Project Sustainability
37.         The project's  achievements  are  likely  to be  sustainable.  The
training of operators during test operations ensured transfer of knowledge on
the proper maintenance of facilities and assisted the sewerage agency staff in
both project cities to plan, design and implement further sewerage projects.
Some project benefits, like the protection of water quality and the
environment, are being expanded at a national level through the National Water
Improvement Program (NWIP).
38.         The  up-dating  of  the  sewerage  master  plans  will  assist  in
providing as-built drawings of all plant and network, introduce agency staff
to the latest technological advances in computerized planning systems, and the
detail needed for the cities to manage further development of their wastewater
treatment facilities. These generated benefits should help to sustain
operations.
39.         A  potential  problem  which  could  threaten  sustainability,  is
failure to continue tariff setting at levels which would allow the two
sewerage divisions to operate as self-sufficient public enterprises. Such a
failure could result in a reversal of the progress made in encouraging these
agencies to follow sound financial practices. The Taejon sewerage division
currently operates at a loss and corrective action, including substantial
increase in tariffs, is needed to correct the present unsatisfactory
situation.
40.         The setting of tariffs has political implications, and therefore
during the completion mission, both cities confirmed that the shortfall in
revenues to finance expansion and cover adequate operation and maintenance of
the sewerage facilities, would be made up from the cities' general accounts
and local borrowing. Although revenues are less than the projections made
during appraisal, there has been no cut-back in providing the necessary funds
for operation and maintenance (para 22).
41.         To make amends for the failure to increase tariffs to an adequate
level during 1992 through 1994, Pusan city held meetings with resident groups
to discuss the environmental implications of any delay in providing safe
disposal of wastewater. The citizens acknowledged that there is a cost
involved in creating a clean environment for themselves and their families,
and supported the increase in average sewerage tariffs by 37.4% on January 1,
1996, and are prepared to accept annual increases in the order of 20% p.a.



7
from 1997 through 2001 (para 24). These annual increases appear in the city's
Five Year Plan.
E. Bank Performance
42.         The   Bank's   activities   during   the  preparation,   appraisal,
negotiation and loan approval stages were satisfactory and thorough, with
considerable support provided to the borrower and the implementing agencies.
The need for quick implementation of the project was important as the
international trade exhibition Expo'93 took place in Taejon between August and
November 1993, and the additional sewerage facilities were essential for this
important event.
43.         The  technical  alternatives   selected  for  the  project  were
appropriate, and represented the least-cost solution to improve sewerage
systems in the project cities. There were no unusual risks, although at
appraisal it was recognized that a delay in adequate tariff increases would
restrict internal cash generation, which could place a burden on the cities'
general accounts. This situation did arise especially in Taejon where
additional city resources were needed to support the project.
44.         The establishment of sewerage tariffs in Korea is relatively new
and it was initially the responsibility of central government to set the
rates.  Bank  staff  have  provided  continuing  guidance  on  sewerage  tariff
structures and policies to MOCT since the start of the preparation and
appraisal process. A government-financed national tariff study was prepared in
1991 which was the basis for MOCT guidelines on the methodology for setting
sewerage tariffs, now being used by municipalities which, since project
appraisal, have been delegated the authority for approving these charges.
45.         Continuity  of  Bank  staff  during  implementation  was  highly
satisfactory with the same appraisal team also taking part in supervision
missions.  This continuity was especially important as some of the key staff
of the borrower and the implementing agencies changed during implementation.
F. Borrower Performance
46.         The  performance   of  the   implementing   agencies,   government
ministries and departments, from project preparation through completion was
good, as were the technical capabilities of the Pusan and Taejon sewerage
agencies, supported by consultants. This is particularly commendable as there
were staff changes in several key positions.   Delays and unforseen problems
with a few components were in most cases due to factors beyond the borrower's
and implementing agencies' control.
47.         The project's positive environmental impact is confirmation of the
cooperation  of  the  Korean  authorities,  especially  MOE.  Pusan  and  Taejon
sewerage agencies have implemented Environmental Monitoring Programs (EMP)
which  meet  MOE  and  the  Bank's  requirements.  For  the  Taejon  component,
environmental monitoring is continuing under Stage III of the Wonchon Dong WTP
which is already under construction. Pusan city has entered into a contract
with the Environmental Research Institute of the Pukyung University in Pusan
to provide environmental monitoring.   The first report was submitted to the
Bank in March 1994 and the final report will be issued once the final results
are documented after completion of construction of the sea outfall and outlet,
presently expected to be in September 1997.



8
48.         The status of performance on the major covenants in the loan and
project agreements is shown in Part II Table 10 of this report. Compliance
with these covenants has been satisfactory except for the failure to achieve
rate of return targets in both cities.
G. Assessment of Outcome
49.         The  project  results  are  rated  satisfactory.  Objectives  were
achieved, and there is transparent sustainability of the completed facilities.
Clear environmental and health benefits have ensued, and developments in
treatment plant construction and network extension are already in progress.
50.         The  institutional  developments  that  took  place  during  the
implementation of the project will have a lasting impact on the efficient
operation  and maintenance  of the  Pusan  and Taejon wastewater  facilities.
Updating sewerage master plans using modern computer-based technologies,  and
the streamlining of sub-sector institutions will allow both cities to upgrade
the sanitation services they provide.
51.         The experience  gained  in preparing  recommendations  for  tariff
negotiations, and the relevance of increased charges on the financial
performance of the agency will lead to a greater awareness of the importance
of the guidelines established during project appraisal. An annual review of
tariff levels is now required, instead of the previous situation whereby
tariff levels had remained unchanged since their introduction. While sewerage
tariffs were not increased during project implementation to the levels
required to meet rate of return targets, both cities have recently raised
their average sewerage charges and annual increases are planned for the future
(para 23).
H. Future Operation
52.         The completed project works will be operated and maintained under
the overall supervision of the Pusan and Taejon sewerage agencies. Staff
numbers and efficiency are satisfactory and there are less than two employees
per thousand sewerage connections in both cities. The maintenance of the
combined drainage system is decentralized to the city districts (Gu) . WTPs,
interceptors and sewage pumping stations are operated and maintained by the
respective treatment plant centers.
53.         Both  sewerage  divisions   are  experienced  in  satisfactorily
operating  WTPs  similar  to  the  ones  constructed  under  the  project,  and
additional training was provided to operators on the new technologies
introduced  during  the  project.  The  sewerage  divisions  provide  technical
guidance and, as required by the budgets of the respective units, allocate
funds from Sewerage Special Accounts (SSA) which are managed and administered
by the sewerage agencies.
54.         The  existing  allocation  of  duties  and  responsibilities  is
satisfactory and has been extended to the new facilities constructed under the
project. Both cities have additional WTPs and sewer interceptors under
construction using the SMPs updated as part of the project, and the
institutional  developments  are  keeping  pace  with  the  growth  of  the
organizations.
55.         For wastewater treatment efficiency,  and to ensure environmental
guidelines are adhered to, the performance of the constructed WTPs will be



9
continuously monitored for BOD, SS, phosphorus and nitrogen. This monitoring
program also applies to new plants already under construction in both cities.
I. Key Lessons Learned
56.         A major factor in the success  of this project was  the active
participation by national and city governments in its preparation and
implementation, and the close relationship between the Bank and the borrower,
which helped to create an appropriately designed project, with experienced
agencies to service and operate the completed facilities.
57.          The delay in completion of the Pusan component was due to lengthy
negotiations with neighboring NGOs over the design and operation of the new
WTP.   Pusan city now acknowledges that full discussions  with all adjacent
residents and workers at the earliest opportunity is of paramount importance
in order to design plants of an aesthetically acceptable standard, with local
amenities or recreation facilities provided if at all possible, and that
operating systems should take into account the close proximity of residential
areas (para 9).
58.         The calculation of the rate of return for the sewerage divisions,
relies on a realistic valuation of the sewerage fixed assets (para 19). Due to
the inherent difficulty in valuing assets (mainly underground and out of
sight),  compounded  by  the  volatility  of  asset  values  in  Korea,  it  is
considered advisable in future to focus on the main concern which is the
overall target for internally generated funds. The covenant's objectives
promote financial viability, satisfactory financial performance, prudent
financial management of the project entity, and supports socio-economic goals.
The cash generation covenant was used in the on-going follow-up project (the
Waste Disposal Project - Loan 3830-KO)
59.         The agreed project Financing Plan required increases in sewerage
tariffs to levels that would produce a minimum rate of return. Subsequent
national anti-inflationary measures were imposed that restricted the ability
of the agencies to make these increases, and assurances were received that the
shortfall in revenues would not delay the project, and that adequate funds
would be provided for proper operation and maintenance of the facilities (para
18).
60.         The potential for the success of any project is increased if it
fits into the government's development policy for the sector and can draw on
other projects and related studies. In this case the Bank report 'Korea -
Sewerage and Wastewater Management, Options and Recommendations (April 1988)'
assisted in formulating the National Water Improvement Program (NWIP) which
gave clear support for this type of project (para 2).

Note: The supervision missions ratings were high although one financial covenant
relating to rate of return was not complied with. Failure to achieve this rate of
return did not affect the implementation of the project, and did not reduce in any
way the expenditure on system operation and maintenance. The shortfall in revenues
was made up from equity contributions from the cities' general accounts, and from
local borrowing.

APPENDIX A
AIDE MEMOIRE
November 25, 1996
Pusan and Taejon Sewerage Project
(Loan No. 3450-KO)
1.    A World Bank Project Completion Mission visited Korea from November 21
to 25, 1996 to obtain the views of the borrower and the implementing agencies
on the implementation process, discuss the borrower's responsibilities in
preparing implementation completion reporting, and to collect additional data
for the preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission
is grateful for the cooperation and assistance received.
2.    The Pusan and Taejon Project (Loan No. 3450-KO), in the amount of US$ 40
million, was approved by the Board on March 26, 1992, and declared effective
on August 26, 1992. An amount of US$ 6 million was canceled in July 1994 by
Pusan due to lower than expected civil works costs coupled with the
elimination of the booster pumping station. An amount of US$ 0.4 million was
also canceled by Taejon in December 1995. The loan closing date was originally
planned for December 31, 1995, but due to the delay in completion of the Pusan
component the Government requested an extension of the closing date to June
30, 1996, which was approved by the Bank.
Pusan component
3.    In Pusan, the project consisted of the construction of the first phase
of the Nambu wastewater  treatment  plant  (WTP),  sewer  interceptors  and  a
tunnel. The WTP had to be partially redesigned due to objections from
neighboring NGOs, and new bidding delayed the construction.   Civil works on
the WTP was completed in June 1996, and construction of the sea outfall and
outlet is expected to be completed by October 1997.
4.    The Sewerage Management Office provided the mission with its evaluation
on the implementation of the Pusan component, which covered project execution,
cost benefits, Bank's and borrower's performance, and the city's commitment to
the project's objectives.
Taejon component
5.    In Taejon, the project consisted of the construction of the second phase
of the Wonchon Dong WTP, plus the construction of sewer interceptors.
Construction was completed in January 1994; test operations commenced in
February 1994, and were completed in July 1994.
6.    In November 1995, the Taejon Sewerage Division provided the Bank with
its evaluation report on the implementation of the Taejon component.
Project summary
7.    Project  implementation  of  both  components  was  satisfactory  and  the
achievements  are  expected  to  be  fully  sustainable.    The  environmental
monitoring program is in progress. The financial performance of both sewerage
divisions during implementation has been disappointing due to the delay in
increasing sewerage tariffs, and the rates of return covenants in the project
agreements have not been achieved.
8.    Compliance with all other major covenants has been satisfactory.

3. Implementation Record and Minor Factors Affecting the Component
With the final project completion year set at 2011, the total treatment
area is 43.88 km2 comprised of the Pusanjin region centering around Dongchun,
Daeyoun region, Yongho region, and part of the Dong-ku and Nam-ku regions. The



33
Dongchun Basin, Daeyoun, Yongho and part of the Nam-ku region (Namchun and
Kwangan) have been designated as Treatment Project #1, and a facility with the
daily sewage treatment capacity of 340,000 m3 will be established in this region
by 1996.   At the second phase of this project, the treatment capacity will
increase by 244,000 m3 per day totaling 584,000 m3 per day with 1,084,000 people
in the year 2011. This value will be under the standard water quality value as
determined by the Environmental Protection Law for Discharged Water.
The "Standard Sludge Activation Method" will be used for the treatment, and
the sludges produced during the treatment process, will be handled through the
existing Sludge Treatment Facility. The construction plan for the second stage
of the project will require sufficient preparation in advance such as reviewing
various other plans with different views.

4. Bank Performance
An assessment of the Bank's performance is satisfactory in component
identification, preparation assistance, appraisal, and supervision, but deficient
in disbursement from the loan during the construction.
5. Borrower Performance
The performance of the borrower is very satisfactory in terms of
preparation, execution, and operation of the project.
6. Assessment of Outcome
This project began with the Korean Government's loan request to IBRD for
the sewage treatment project. The fundamental objective of this project is in
improving the water quality of the daily urban sewers and waste waters flowing
into the rivers and coastal region. the surveying and planning of the project
was entrusted to a consulting company by the City of Pusan, and approved by the
Ministry of Construction with the overall supervision of the project done by a



35
group of supervisors. The construction and supervision were performed by Hyundai
Precision Industries Ltd. and the Supervisors of the City of Pusan respectively
to accommodate the needs of the project at hand.
7. Future Operation
This treatment facility has been operating at a value lower than the
standard environment values since the pre-construction stage after analyzing the
aftermath of the environment, and the Roots Blower that has been used as the
oxygen supplying device at the aeration facilities has been replaced by a Turbo
Blower in order to treat the sewer more efficiently, and improve the operation
of the aeration tank which is the most important element in treating waste
waters. The Turbo Blower is more effective, has the ability to control the
volume of air automatically at ease, and has a longer life cycle.
The ventilation and Deodorizing Facility has also been installed around the
treatment facility to reduce and prevent the odors and air pollution from being
produced at the time of the treatment process.  By installing the Centrifugal
Thickener at the treatment facility for the first time in Korea to reduce sludges
which are pollutants, and promote efficient treatment, costs have decreased.
Automatic measuring devices of essential elements for the water quality
improvements have prevented the spoilage of water in advance. In addition, the
building of a roof on the facility and using it as a welfare facility has
promoted public welfare of the region which indicates a new function for the
sewage treatment facility. This new function gives a glimpse of the future of
the facility. However, the incineration of the sludge or the installation of
manure manufacturing facility can be taken into consideration as a positive



36
measure for environmental protection for the future.
8. Key Lessons Learned
This project was planned and analyzed carefully in advance by the City of
Pusan by taking into consideration the increase of sewage volume following the
population increase in the future. The lessons learned are the construction of
a treatment facility to accommodate such increases to reduce operation costs, the
ability to fully utilize the space that is smaller than other treatment
facilities in Korea, and the formation of the treatment facility into a park.
The investment of the Sludge Central Concentration Facility at the sewage
treatment facilities of Korea is notable as concern towards the future
environment.

TAEJON CITY



39
1.    Component Obiectives
Taejon City carries out the sewerage project based on the Master
Plan established in 1982 in order to prevent environmental pollution
which would result from rapid population growth and industrial
development, and has already constructed and operated a sewage
treatment plant with a capacity of 150,000 m3/day.
In the late 1980's, Taejon City enlarged its administrative area and
Taedok Science Town was developed within the city.    Eventually,
Taejon City was promoted to the Great City as of First of January in
1989. As a result, since the existing sewerage master plan becomes
unsuitable for the present situation, its amendment is required.
Based on the amended master plan, the second phase construction
project of Taejon Sewage Treatment Plant is initiated.
The project encompasses the preliminary and detailed engineering
works for the extension of the sewage treatment plant with a
capacity of 150,000 m3/day and thus it shall provide the citizens
with a healthy environment resulting from the improvement of water
quality of receiving water bodies, the Kap-chon and Kum-gang rivers.



40
2.    Achievement of Component Obiectives
Indirect and direct benefits of this project are expected as
follows:-
2.1   Indirect Benefit
1)    Preservation of aquatic resources by water quality improvement
2)    Improvement of living environment and public health
- Decrease of occurrence of water born diseases
3)    Improvement of city aesthetic view
4)    Rise of cost and added values of land
5)    Increase of ratio served by flushing toilet
- Improvement of treatment efficiency and saving of 0 & M cost of
the nightsoil treatment plant
6)    Exemption of installation of septic tanks or sewage clarifying
facilities
- Saving of construction, 0 & M, and collection costs
7)    Improvement of function as an educational or cultural city.
2.2   Direct benefit
1)    By-products
A by-product in the sewage treatment plant is biogas or methane gas
produced by anaerobic digestion of sludge.
2)    Saving of construction cost of the nightsoil
Treatment plant Treatment of 200 kl/d septage by sludge treatment
facilities in the sewage treatment plant will result in the cost
saving of an additional nightsoil treatment plant.
3)    Saving of medical expenses for public health
Saving of parasiticide expenses



41
The sanitary treatment of nightsoil will benefit public health of
Taejon citizens not by taking parasiticide.
4)    Increase of employment (manpower for construction and 0 & M  of the
sewage treatment plant)
5)    Improvement of water quality of receiving bodies.



42
3.    Implementation Record and Maior Factors Affectina the Component
The daily maximum design sewage flow is 150,000 m3/day.   When wet season,
incoming sewage flow is estimated to be 288,000 m3/day through
interceptors, and the excess flow is designed to be discharged directly to
the Kap-cheon river only after primary treatment and chlorination.
Industrial wastewater is mixed with domestic sewage and treated in the
plant.    The sewage treatment process is a secondary treatment process
with a traditional activated sludge, and the sludge is digested by
anaerobic process and is then dewatered by mechanical means.
Methane gases which are by-products during sludge digestion process are
used as fuel of gas generators.   This electric power is supplied to the
air blowers which require electric power most of all electrical
equipments.
The second phase treatment plant is located at Wonchon - dong, Yusong ku
which is the same site of the existing first phase one.
In the amended sewerage master plan describes the construction plan of
sewage treatment plants as the following <TABLE 1>

4.    Bank Performance
An assessment of the Bank's performance are satisfactory in component
identification, preparation assistance, appraisal, and supervision.
5.    Borrower Performance
As assessment of the performance of the borrower and implementing agencies
are highly satisfactory in preparing, implementing, and where relevant,
operating the project or component.
6.    Assessment of Outcome
Taejon city government receive loan from IBRD to supply good quality of
domestic, industrial and agricultural mater through improving living
environment, public hygiene and sanitation as well as preserving water
resources.
Taejon City government give basic plan and detailed design to Engineering
Company, receive admission from Ministry of Construction and complete this
project with management of supervision group.
This project completed successfully, having with help of Taejon city, good
experience on design and supervision of Supervision Group, and a lot of
experience of Sambu-Togeon Construction Company to reach the objectives of
this project.
7.    Future Operation
The operation of 2nd Phase of Taejon STP have to be made under
environmental standard, after impact and before construction is estimated.



45
We control blowing air with speed controller of measuring DO in aerator,
and make it automated and check by time concentration indication etc. in
primary,final settling tank and thickener.    So we can get effects to
minimize cost and operate efficiently.
We estimate impacts before and after operation in the air quality, water
quality, noise, odor etc.
We install FRP covers in thickener and digested sludge thickener for
deodorization.
Existing STP are operating by conventional central control system, but
this STP will install distributed control system, therefore we can monitor
and control between center and field.
8.    Key Lessons Learned
This project reflect increase of industrial and domestic wastewater
because there is fast increase of population for optimum characteristic of
Taejon City in which will be opened Taejon Expo, and have Daeduck Research
Institute as well as updated industrial and technical complex.
It is outstanding that Taejon city reduce cost for construction and
operation,  improve  living  environment,  minimize  adverse  impact  for
environment, and make STP coexist in surrounding Expo Apt. and research
institute.
