XEMORANDUM AND PEI         O F TE PRESIDENT
OF THE IZR  TO TIl EXCUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAM TO THE RSPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR           DSWR   PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommenlation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Korea for the equivalent of US$40 million to
help finance a project for sewerage in Pusan and Taejon. The loan would be at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 1S years,
including five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be relent in equal
amounto to the Pusan and Taejon City Governments on the same terms as the Bank
loan, including foreign exchange and interest risks, plus a 0.05% p.a. handling
charge.
2.              * iorond.  in 1987, to strengthen water pollution control, the Ministry
of Construction began preparation of a long-term plan to improve wastewater
treatment facilities and invited the Bank to assist in that task. The resulting
Bank sewerage sector study helped formulate th& National Water Improvement
Program which was approved by the Government in September 1989. Under the
Program, the water quality in rivers will be improved during 1990-96 at an
estimated cost of US$3.1 billion equivalent by: (a) relocating some industries
from upper catchment areas reserved for water supply; (b) providing wastewater
treatment plants for industry and livestock farms; and (c) substantially reducing
municipal pollution by constructing sewge treatment plants in municipalities.
The project would support investments in two major municipal treatment plants.
3.     Most municipalities have combined sewer systems carrying both stormwater
and wastewater and discharging the mix directly into the nearest river. Sewage
treatment plants constructed for such systems include interceptors laid along the
rivers to collect flows from sewer outlets and to deliver raw sewage to the
treatment plant. The Government acknowledges the need to convert combined systems
to hygienically-superior separate systems, in which sanitary sewers collect and
convey wastewater to treatment plants and storm sewers collect and convey
stormwater to the nearest stream. Plans for the conversion of two of these
systems would be prepared under the project.
4.    Proiect Obiectives.  The objectives of the project are tot (a) improve
environmental conditions in Pusan and Taejon, Korea's second and sixth largest
cities; (b) reduce pollution in Korea's water courses and coastal waters, which
is crucial to the well-being of a large part of the population; (c) reduce health
hazards associated with contaminated river water, particularly for the
lowest-income population which has the greatest exposure to this water; and (d)
continue supporting technological and institutional improvements in the sector.
5.   pescrigton.  The project would have two componentst (a) construction of
the first phase of Yongho sewage treatment plant in Pusan, with a daily maximum
capacity of 340,000 un/d, a sewage pumping station and about 11.4 km of
interceptors to carry sewage to the plant (78% of total costs); and (b)
constructton of the second phase of Wonchon Dong sewage treatment plant in Taejon
and 11.9 km of interceptors, to double existing capacity to 300,000 m3/d at
completion (21% of total costs). Technical assistance (1I of total costs) would
be provided to eac! city tos (i) supervise construction and (ii) update the
cities' Sewerage Master Plans (SMPs), including a review of policies and
management systems for sewerage activities and design of a program to convert the



existing combined sewer systms to separate systems. *t breakdown of couts 4nd the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule S. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Korea
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Mapa are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 9904-RO dated January 31, 1992, is being distributed
seaprately.
6.    *m^ltation  The project would be carried out over a five-year period
by the Pusan and Taejon municipalities assisted by consultants. The agencies are
considered capable to implement the project in view of recent successful
performance in constructing two similar projects in Pusan and one in Taejon.
7.    =roeat  utstainabillit. Project beneficiaries would collect through user
charges adequat- funds to secure financing for satisfactory operation and
maintenance of provided facilities. In addition, the updating of SMPs under the
project would establish programs for the conversion to sanitary separate sewer
oystems, including design of procedures improving institl~ttional arrangements.
8.   Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Involvement. Previous Bank-assisted
projects in the sub-sector were for water supply. Of the five pro;ecto in total
four were successfully completed. Evaluations (Schedule C) indicate that
adequate preparation and realism in setting project targets contributed to that
success. The construction of municipal wastewater treatment plants started in
Korea only within the last decade with Bank involvement limited to the sewerage
sector study. Latest progress in planning and constructing facilities and
development of sector institutions, which both reflect recommendations of the
Bank's study, indicate  Cevernment's strong commitment to development of the
sewerage sector. In line with these lessons, preparation of the proposed project
is well advanced, and actions sought under the project have firm support from the
responsible authorities.
9.    Rationale for Bank Involvement.   Bank involvement in the project is
justified by its familiarity with the Korean water supply and sewerage sector,
and its particular interest in addressing environmental issues, an interest now
shared with the Korean Government. The project would also be a logical outgrowth
of the Bank's 1988 sewerage sector study by providing an opportunity to render
assistance in implementing the study's two main recommendations which advised
phased construction of wastewater treatment facilities and accelerated conversion
of combined sewers. Both activities would have a substantial and lasting impact
on improvirg the environment of Korea's rivers and coastal waters.
10.  Actiong Aqreed. Effectiveness of the Bank loan would be conditional on the
execution of Subsidiary Loan Agreements between the Government and the two
project cities.   Assurances were obtained from the Pusan and Taejon City
Governments that they woulds (a) update 'heir Sewerage Master Plans by December
31, 19921 (b) prior to project completion, prepare an Environmental Monitoring
Program to evaluate the environmental impact of the facilities providedt and (c)
from January 1, 1993, charge sewerage tariffs to achieve a rate of return on
revalued net fixed assets in operation of not less than 5 p.a. and 3% p.a. in
Pusan and Taejon, respectively.



11.  ZnamMja    gggg&s.  The overall environmental impaft of the project is
highly positive: together, the treatment plants would each d'iy remove from the
cities' wastewater the equivalent of about 63 tons of biochemical oxygen demand
and 58 tons of suspended solids which now pollute the environment. Satisfactory
measures woui'd also be taken to mitigate negative environmental impacts of
treatment plant construction and operation. In addition, the project citiee would
institute Environmental Monitoring Programs to collect and evaluate data on
pollution in water courses, for improved water pollution control.
12. Proar&m_ blective Cateaories. The project would particularly benefit the
health of the low-income residents of Pusan and Taejon, who tend to have greatest
exposure to the inner-city waterways now contaminated by considerable volumes of
raw sewage.
1-3. Benefits. The project would improve the environment by providing wastewater
treatment for about 1.75 million people, increasing the population served from
43% to 60% in Pusan and from 35% to 55% in Taejon. The interceptors and the
treatment facilities would ensure that wastewAter would be contained within the
system, would thereby eliminate health hazards, odors, and other pollution-
related problems from the inner-city rivers and would contribute to increasing
values of properties along the strea  cleaned as a result of the project.
Updating of SMP's would establish programs for the conversion to more sanitary
acceptable separate sewer systems, and define procedures to streamline
institutional arrangements, which may be replicated by other municipalities. The
Bank's review of designs during project preparatior. haa also resulted in changes
which have improved treatment technology and facility operations.
14.  Risks.  The project'. physical components present no special risks. A
possible risk could be that delays in adequate tariff increases would limit
internal cash generation. In view of coamitments of the cities it can be assumed
that such a shortfall would be compensated from the general revenues and would
not result in delays of construction. Implementation of improvements in the sewer
systems to be outlined in the SMPe and realization of the environmental benefIts
expected from the conversion to sanitary sewer system lie beyond the project
time frame and consaquently cannot be assured. However, popular pressure now
being exerted in Korea for much stronger environmental protection measures
significantly increases the probability that the SMPs' recommendations will be
carried out.
15.   *eg mmndationI I am satis£fed that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

2 years of grace and 8 interest). The aggregate amount of IDC is based on
Cities' paying an average interest rate of 7.81% on borrowing of up to US$80.3
million to support the proposed project. The portion corresponding to the Bank' s
interert (on borrowing of up to US$40 million) is allocated as foreign cost,
while the remainder is allocated as local cost. Cities would finance the TDC from
internal resources.
