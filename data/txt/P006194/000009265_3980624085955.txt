IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BOLIVIA
ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT (ETAP)
(CREDIT 2443-BO)
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Environmental Technical
Assistance Project (ETAP), financed by Credit 2443-BO in the amount of three million three hundred
thousand Special Drawing Rights (SDR 3,300,000) approved on December 21, 1992 and declared
effective on June 18, 1993. The Credit was fully disbursed and closed as planned on June 30, 1997.
The last disbursement was made on May 21, 1997. There was no co-financing.
The ICR was prepared by Gary Hunnisett (Environmental Specialist) of the Bolivia Resident
Mission, and reviewed by Cesar Plaza (LCSES), Pierre Werbrouk (LCSES), and Deborah Bateman
(Resident Mission Representative). The borrower prepared a separate report which is included as an
appendix to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Credit Agreement and its
Amendments, correspondence between the Association and the Borrower, the Aide Memoir of four
supervision missions, Auditors Reports, final and annual reports prepared by the National Environment
Fund (FONAMA) and the National Secretariat of National Resources and Environment (SNRNMA),
individual consultant evaluations prepared by Valeria Merino (1995), Pablo Pisani (1996),
Management Systems International (1996) and those prepared by consultants for supervision missions,
and internal IDA Memoranda. As the report was prepared by staff at the Bolivia Resident Mission,
there was no special ICR mission.

IMPLEMENTATION CONPLETION REPORT
ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
CRED1T 2443-BO
BOLIVIA
Evaluation Summary
1.    This was the first IDA-assisted environmental technical assistance project in Bolivia. It
was designed to complement the Global Environmental Biodiversity Project (GET Grant No.
28620-BO). It was appraised on Nov. 18, 1992, approved by the board on December 21, 1992,
and declared effective on June 18, 1993. Two project preparation facilities (P-69 1 -BO, P-69 1-1-
BO) totaling US$1,030,000 and a Japanese Grant facility (N JGF-991-BO) totaling US$349,085
helped initiate the Project. The first disbursement of the JGF (US$70,000) was made on January
10, 1991.
2.    At the time of appraisal, total project costs were estimated at $US5.52 million of which
US$4.80 million was to be financed by an IDA credit and $US715,000 was requested of the
Government of Bolivia (GOB) as counterpart funding. By the time the project was closed IDA
had disbursed US$4.8 million (100 percent) and the GOB disbursed US$432,000 (78 percent) of
the amount agreed. The project was designed to be completed in four years and to close on June
30, 1997. The final total project cost was US$5.192 million and the last disbursement was made
on May 12, 1997.
3.    The objectives of the project were to: (a) strengthen the institutions responsible for the
management of natural resources and environmental protection via means of improved physical
facilities, financing of consultants advisors, and staff training; (b) (i) develop laws and regulations
which would improve the legal basis for natural resource management (i.e. forestry, water and
biodiversity laws); prepare draft regulations to the preceding plus the biodiversity law;
development of a National Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) System; (ii) training of
private and public sector personnel in EIS and environmental economics; and (iii) establishment of
an environmental law library; and (c) (i) design and execute practical field oriented pilot projects
in environmental education in representative rural, tropical, and urban regions of Bolivia; and (ii)
using the best practices developed in the pilot projects, incorporate a model program of
environmental education into the National Education System.
4.    The environmental institutional framework in existence when the project was designed and
approved was the Secretaria Nacional de Medio Ambiente (SENMA). However, soon after
execution started a new Government took over and introduced significant changes in the
organization and functions of public sector institutions. This brought about the establishment of a
much larger lead institution for dealing with resource management and environmental protection:
The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MDSMA). As a result, the project's
institutional strengthening component had to be limited in scope to the funds originally allocated
to this component. These changes also affected FONAMA (Fondo Nacionalpara elMedio



iii
Ambiente) which is responsible for obtaining and administering funding for environmental protection
and was in charge of managing the project's funds. FONAMA, which had originally been established
under the umbrella of the President's office, was placed under the authority of the MDSMA, thus
losing to a large extent decision-making independence.
5.    Changing the structure and functions of the environmental lead institution after the project
had been initiated was not without difficulties. The authority of FONAMA was greatly reduced.
Its functions in part were usurped by the newly created MDSMA. The latter ministry never
realized its full potential. There was an increasing lack of transparency in the personnel
recruitment process, and a general weakening of support for environmental issues towards the end
of the project.
6.    In spite of the organizational changes the institutional strengthening component generally
met the SAR objectives. Institutions were equipped with supplies and computers; staff underwent
adequate training; national and international consultants were hired as required; and the profile of
the institution responsible for environmental planning and management was greatly enlarged.
7.    The environmental education component was executed as planned by Non Governmental
Organizations (Table 5), and the lessons learned were incorporated into the National Education
Reform Plan initiated by GOB. This process was facilitated by the formation of a Subsecretariat
of Environmental Education. The training component for Government staff was modified to
focus more on short courses related to EIA, as opposed to long-term university level courses in
environmental economics.
8.    Largely with funds from the Credit, the Government incorporated sustainable development
planning into all aspects of Government activities. The environmental laws and regulations
developed under the Credit (Table 7) generally exceeded the goals outlined in the SAR, except for
the Water Law and the Biodiversity Law which were drafted and submitted for Congress approval
but still remain stalled in the Senate. The failure of the latter to pass in the time frame of the
project was more than offset by the passage of equally important legislation for environmental
management (Table 5) not included originally in the project.
9.    With the assistance of project funds, the Government met its international commitments to
the UN Ozone Reduction and Global Warming Programs, produced national level watershed and
forest cover maps, and a new National Environmental Action Plan.
10.   The factors limiting project performance were: initial delays in procurement from failure
to have worked out the details of the mechanism by which GOB would pay taxes and import
duties; delays in payment of counterpart funds; inadequate transparency in the personnel selection
process; the lengthy period required to organized the MDSMA delayed implementation by one
year; the numerous changes of MDSMA Mvinisters (3), and National Secretaries (4) greatly
reduced MDSMA's authority, and its ability to get key legislation passed.
11.   Sustainability of the project is "uncertain". The prospects for the sustainability of the
institutions developed under the Credit was enhanced with the recognition by the United Nations
in August of the lead role played by Bolivia in incorporating sustainable development into national



iv
policy. MDSMA was not substantially changed by the incoming Government (August 1997).
While application to include major ministerial staff into the civil service reform program was made
in 1996, a decision on the request was not made by the time project was finished. This resulted in
an unfortunate loss of professionals trained with Credit funds at the end of the project (July
1997). This was only partially offset by proposed new initiatives from Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) and the Government of Denmark.
12.   The performance of the Association was "satisfactory". It demonstrated flexibility in
adapting to the challenges raised by the creation of a new Ministry unforeseen in the SAR, and
combining supervision with technical assistance.
13.   Borrower performance was similarly "satisfactory". Key SAR target objectives were met.
Audits, financial management by the project management unit, and reporting were good. The
only factors limiting a higher rating were the failure to incorporate key staff into the civil service
program and to advance more rapidly into a decentralized implementation phase.
14.   The project outcome was rated overall as "satisfactory". SAR key target objectives were
met. This included notably the incorporation of sustainable development into national planning,
passage of key environmental legislation, development and implementation of an EIA system, and
the incorporation of environmental education in the national education reform program. The
ratings arrived at by all the supervision missions were similarly "satisfactory".
The Key Lessons Learned
Use of NGOs
15.   The approach of using NGOs as executing agents for the environmental education pilot
projects was very successful. The concept merits replication in similar environmental projects.
The competitive advantage of the NGOs stemmed from their close working relationship with local
communities and in some cases having staff belonging to those communities.
Use of 'Pilot Projects"
16.   The concept of using "pilot projects" in environmental education was very successful.
Teaching materials, effective practical aids and curricula were developed and refined with the benefit
of practice. The final 'best practice"products are being incorporated into the National Education
Reform process, and are more practical as a result of the experience gained in the pilot projects.
Effective Supervision
17.   In supervising the project the Bank demonstrated two important elements which in part
account both for the relative success of the project, and the fact that the objectives of the
environmental legislation component were exceeded: (i) flexibility, the Bank accommodated the
need to modify the project's original design to reflect the new structure of MDSMA priorities and
additional goals of the incoming Government; and (ii) supervision, in providing close day to day
technical assistance, coupled with consultative supervisory missions, the Bank was able to assist



v
GOB in developing national plans, strategies, and laws.
The Importance of Project Ownership
18.   It is preferable to develop a project with the Government who will be executing it. The
ETAP Project was designed under one Government, and implemented under another. This
resulted in delays in implementation and different levels of commitment to project priorities.
Staffing and Salaries
19.   More attention should be paid to distinguishing between a "consultant" and a "line
position" when agreeing to fund staff. In the ETAP project, there were too many line positions
being funded as "consultants". This limited the project's sustainability and did not foster the
GOB's ownership of the project.
20.   A clear policy on the salary levels should be agreed during negotiations. During the
course of the ETAP project there were many instances of MDSMA staff performing the same
service, but receiving different salaries.
Taxes and Counterpart Funds
21.   Prior to project implementation agreement should have been reached regarding the GOB's
responsibility for paying taxes on goods and for allocating counterpart founding, more attention
should have been paid to the details of how GOB would pay taxes on goods and salaries and
counterpart funds.
Government Commitment
22.   The institutional instability of FONAMA during the life of the project confirms that unless
an implementing institution has the Government's clear and unwavering support, it is unlikely its
performance would improve no matter what level of "institutional strengthening" initiatives are
introduced in a project.
Sustainability
23.   More attention should have been paid to the concept of project sustainability in the
project's design. This could have been achieved by: (i) an agreement to include key project staff
into the Civil Service Reform Program could have been a condition of effectiveness; (ii)
counterpart funds could have been allocated to supporting permanent staff positions in the
MDSMA; (iii) a follow up project to implement the laws, norms and regulations approved under
the project should have been agreed with the GOB as part of the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) dialogue.



PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.    Project Objectives and Descriptions
1.    Objectives. The objectives of the ETAP Project were to: (i) strengthen the Borrower's
institutions involved in the promotion of sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the
environment; (ii) to develop the Borrower's skills to plan, evaluate and implement environmental action
programs; (iii) to rationalize and improve the Borrower's environmental, legal and regulatory
framework; and (iv) to raise public awareness of environmental issues.
2.    Content: In order to attain the objectives, the project included three main components:
(a) Institutional Strengthening of Environmental Agencies: This included: (i) staff training in
both the National Environmental Fund (FONAMA) and the National Secretary of Natural
Resources and Environment (SNRMA) of the MDSMA in such issues as: environmental
impact assessments, environmental economics, data collection and storage, administration,
environmental legislation and regulations and public dissemination procedures; (ii) financing
consultants and staff salaries; and (iii) procurement of equipment.
(b) Environmental. Legal and Regulatory Framework: this included: (i) development of
regulations for the Environmental, the Forestry, the Water, and the Biodiversity Laws; (ii)
support for passage of the latter three laws themselves; (iii) development of regulations on
environmental impact assessment, environmental quality control, environmental aspects of
mining and hydrocarbon exploration; (iv) support to Environmental Congressional
Commissions with consultancy services for technical assistance; (v) workshops on public
participation in planning and implementation of regulations; (vi) training of public and private
sector personnel on environmental legal issues; and, (vii) establishment of an environmental law
library.
(c) Environmental Education: Pilot projects were to be carried out by selected NGOs in
primary schools of three representative areas of Bolivia. Teachers were to receive training in
environmental education and methodology plus textbooks designed by NGOs sponsored by the
project. The pilot projects were designed to serve as a model to introduce curriculum changes
into the National Education Reform Project.
3.    Achievements. The overall outcome of the project was rated satisfactory in each of the
four supervision missions carried out between 1994-1996 (Table 11). The annual Audit carried
out by Coopers and Lybrand were similarly satisfactory.



2
4.    The overall satisfactory ratings of the project are due to the notable success of the
environmental legislation and regulations and of the environmental education component. The
protracted and ongoing instability of FONAMA, and the failure of the MDSMA to incorporate its
technical staff into the Civil Service Program limited the effectiveness of the institutional
strengthening component.
5.    Institutional Strengthening Component: Since the project was designed prior to the
establishment of the MDSMA funding under the Credit had to be limited supporting one of the
five National Secretariats of the MDSMA. The National Secretariat of Natural Rescues and
Environment (SNRMA) including its three sub-Secretariats. One, for the development and
enforcement of environmental laws (Subsecretary of Environment), a second for the execution of
the environmental education component (Subsecretary of Promotion) and a third for Biodiversity
Conservation. This last one was latter additionally supported by a GEF Grant to establish a
National System of Protected Areas.
6.    The role of FONAMA in a long range planning, and in exclusive financial control and
responsibility for fund raising, was partially superseded by the creation of the MDSMA. While
under the project FONAMA was strengthened in terms of infrastructure, equipment and financial
management systems, it became a weaker institution due to diminishing political support and
institutional independence.
7.    Although the project management unit within FONAMA was able to effectively manage
the project's funds and adhere to IDA's guidelines, the institution itself was unable to realize its
primary function of raising funds for environmental issues, or of efficiently managing the fiduciary
fund for protected areas or the projects of bilateral donors.
8.    Training and Environmental Education Component: More than 1,000 persons from
the private and public sectors received training in environmental legislation, Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA), and control of environmental quality. Short courses in EIA and EIS were
targeted at government personnel in the Secretariats of Mining, Industry, Agriculture, Transport
and Energy as well as the newly created regional environmental units. A revised version of the
National Environmental Action Plan was produced in 1996.
9.    Under the Urban (La Paz) section of the Environmental Education component, 3,000
teachers manuals on environmental issues and 38,960 student workbooks were produced and
distributed in 180 participating urban primary schools. Sixty four workshops were given to train
more than 1,000 education professionals. Rural programs conducted by NGOs in the altiplano,
tropical and valley regions of Bolivia introduced environmental education, texts, teacher and
parents training and practical horticulture practices into 76 schools (Table 5). Evaluation of the
success of the component was determined by: (i) field visits from MDSMA and WB Resident
Mission personnel; (ii) reports filed determined by NGOs; and (iii) field visits by Bank supervision
missions.



3
10.   The education unit of the MDSMA-SRNMA successfully worked with the Curriculum
Reform Committee of the National Education Reform Program to incorporate the lessons learned
from the environmental education pilot projects into the National curriculum.
11.   Legal and Regulatory Component: The GOB passed the Forestry Law (N0 1700 July
12, 1996) and its regulations D.S. No. 24453 , Dec. 21/96. The six regulations to the
Environmental Law (atmospheric contamination, aquatic contamination, solid wastes, toxic
wastes, prevention and control, and general regulations) were passed on December 8, 1995
(Supreme Decree No 24176). Additional regulations and laws not planned under the project were
passed with significant input from project personnel. These included the Mining Law (C6digo de
Mineria - March 17,1997 Law N° 1777), and its regulations (D.S.24782, August 1, 1997), the
Agrarian Reform Law (Law INRA N° 1714, Oct 18,1996) and the Hydrocarbon Law (NO 1689,
April 30, 1996) and its regulations affecting environment (D.S. N°24335, July 19, 1996).
12.   Significant exceptions to the pattern of legislative successes were the failure during the life
of the project to obtain Congress approval of the Biodiversity Law and the Water Law.
However, this was offset by the fact that the Borrower exceeded the objectives of the Credit
Agreement in passing important environmental legislation not foreseen originally under the
project.
13.   Through its lead role in the National Coalition of Ministries for Development (CODENA)
the MDSMA introduced "Sustainable Development and Environment" as themes in all
government planning. Project supported technical staff assisted this process, and in producing
key laws which had important consequences and effects on the environment.
14.   The MDSMA, during the course of the project developed a capable financial management
unit which gradually assumed much of the financial control originally assigned to FONAMA
under the SAR.
15.   The environmental law library was developed with a Micro Isis format as planned.
16.   Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project: The Borrower
successfully met the majority of the actions agreed upon in Schedule 4 of the Credit Agreement (Table
10) and the SAR (Table 5), although delays were common.
17.   The major positive factors affecting the outcome of the project were: (i) the creation of a
Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment was an ambitious and sophisticated
undertaking. For the first time in the history of Bolivia environment was placed high on the
political agenda; (ii) in the first few years at least, the technical people beneath the level of the
sub secretaries were very qualified; (iii) the commitment of Government to the environment,
resulted in most of the laws and regulations planned under the project getting passed by the
Congress; (iv) the use of NGOs to execute the education component was very successful; (v) the
organizational structure of the administration created with the support of the project was largely



4
maintained intact, and continues; (vi) the key institutions involved with environmental
management have adequate infrastructure equipment, and reference collections; and (vii) the
Government succeeded with the help of the project in raising the national awareness on issues
relating to the environment.
18.   The major limiting factors affecting the project were: (i) the dramatic and extensive
transformation of the former Subsecretary of Environment into a larger "Super Ministry" with
wide coordinating powers took longer than planned and consumed the Government's energy for
almost a full year of the project; (ii) after the initial few years of enthusiasm, lack of transparency
in the selection process often led to hiring less than qualified individuals to hold key project posts.
This was compounded by failure of the project to adequately define "consultants", resulting in
"consultants" occupying line positions in the Government, a factor that led to unsustainability of
personnel; (iii) the turnover of political authorities (4 ministers, 5 secretaries) led to lack of
continuity and reduced the beneficial effect of the training programs; (iv) disagreements within
Government often led to postponing support for critical legislation; and (v) there was a serious
lack of political commitment to FONAMA by the incoming Government, an institution the project
was designed to strengthen.
19.   Project Sustainability: The prospect for sustainability of the project activities is
"uncertain". On the positive side: (i) the Government initiated the process of transferring much
environmental responsibility and authority to the regional and municipal governments. In spite of
limited regional capacity this was a positive precedent that will be difficult to reverse; (ii) actions
sponsored by the Government of Denmark, the Inter American Development Bank, and the IDA-
Mining Industry and Environment Project are designed to provided ongoing support to many of
the initiatives developed under the ETAP project.
20.   Factors limiting prospects for sustainability included: (i) the Civil Service Reform
Program did not begin soon enough to absorb the staff of the MDSMA before the end of the
project, resulting in many trained staff leaving. There is, however, a stated desire by the new
Government to incorporate key positions as the Civil Service Reform Program continues to
develop; and (ii) the original plan of the Bank to have a follow-up operation to assist the GOB
implement the legislation and regulation developed under the project was not an immediate
priority of the Government which took office in August 1997.
21.   In summary, the ETAP Project contributed significantly to changing environmental
management practices in Bolivia (notably EIA), assisted with the approval of sound environmental
legislation and the development of environmental education curriculum which is being
incorporated into the national Education Reform. These effects will long outlive the life of the
project.

B.    IIDA's Performance
22.   IDA's performance was "satisfactory". The reasons for the evaluation are summarized as
follows:
23.   The time allocated to project preparation activities between April 1991 and September
1993 was 155 SW weeks. After project implementation the average time allocated to supervision
was 36 SW per year. This included local supervisory staff time plus time of consultants who
supported the four supervision missions. The commitment to supervision from both headquarters
and the resident mission allowed for the incorporation of a large component of technical
assistance, which in part was responsible for the project's relative success.
24.   IDA demonstrated flexibility in adjusting the project's design to the institutional reforms in
the public sector made by the Government which took over shortly after the project had begun
and which were not reflected in the project documents. As a result, three amendments were made
to the Credit Agreement:
(i)   January 11, 1994, reflecting changes in Government structure and signing authorities;
(ii)   December 16, 1994, pushing implementation dates back by one year; changes in
implementing NGOs; and
(iii)   October 27, 1995, reviewing threshold for prior review on consultant's contracts and
for the procurement of goods and services.
C.   Borrower's Performance
25.   The overall success of the Borrower in implementing the project was '<atisfactory" for the
following reasons:
26.   Both GOB and SNRMA were active, helpful, and committed to objectives of the project
and Legal Agreement. They were exemplary in planning for supervision missions and in
attempting to comply with the recommendations made by missions' Aide Memoirs.
27.   The Borrower's record in achieving project targets was good. Reporting and financial
management were adequate. Cooperation with IDA and visiting evaluation teams was also
excellent.
28.   It is worth noting that these positive features about the relationship were achieved during
a period of intense political disagreements within the Government, social unrest and resistance
from minority groups to many of the far reaching reforms (capitalization, decentralization,
dramatic reforms of the land, forest and education sectors) being put forward by the Government.
In addition, there were few precedents to follow in attempting to implement the Agenda 21
Agreements of the UNCED Conference in Rio. Introducing sustainable development elements
into all Government planning was a pioneer effort for which Bolivia received official



6
acknowledgment from the World Conference on the Environment sponsored by the United
Nations in the summer of 1997.
29.   In some areas, the Government was less than successful in carrying out its obligations. Its
commitment to FONAMA, the lead agency designed by the previous Government to coordinate
project execution was minimal at best. It was also slow in developing efficient techniques to
manage funds and to handle its obligations to pay taxes. There was inadequate consultation
between ministries, and considerable lack of transparency in staffing, particularly in the latter
stages of the project. The Govemment did not fully meet its obligation to budget counterpart
funds, nor did it abide by the Credit Agreement to seek IDA's approval before making changes in
institutional structure or in making appointments of key staff.
D.   Assessment of Outcome
30.   The project outcome was rated "satisfactory" both for having met the key SAR objectives
and on the basis of the consistently positive evaluations of the supervision missions. While there
were limiting factors to project performance, the positive factors far outweighed them. Both are
discussed in the following paragraphs:
31.   The MDSMA was established by the incoming Government of 1993 as an innovative, high
power new ministry. It began a series of environmental reforms which saw the passage of much
needed new and dynamic laws affecting the environment. The regulations to the Environment
Law set standards for air and water quality as well as solid and toxic waste disposal. The Forestry
and Land use Laws can be considered models in Latin America, and ones which can potentially
transform the way tropical rainforest is managed. The implementation of an environmental impact
system and quality control enforcement has similarly resulted in a noticeable improvement in
mining operations that are being planned and executed. Norms developed were based on
internationally accepted standards modified for Bolivian conditions. They provide a solid basis for
an ongoing and dynamic basis for further reform based on experience in implementation.
32.   An environmental education component is now being introduced to the National Primary
School Curriculum, in part based on the model of the pilot projects carried out with ETAP
funding.
33.   The institutional structures charged with environmental stewardship were expanded not
only by creating a central Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, but extending it
into the departments and municipalities, as well within the line sectors. Unfortunately, FONAMA
was left notably weakened in the process.
34.   As the mandate of the central Government stewardship were experiences of working with
a diverse coalition Government group became evident, the N/IDSMA fell into a notable decline.
The transfer of responsibility for the MDSMA to a succession of ministers, lack of cooperation
between ministries, and the increasing demands to focus on electorally popular measures which



7
were not forthcoming from the environmental changes being put forward, left the MDSMA at the
end of the project in a weakened and vulnerable position, with credibility strained, international
finding reduced, and a weak political capacity to meet many of the original objectives reduced.
35.   The initiatives undertaken, however, and the sheer inertia of their effects leave the
prospects for ongoing improvement in environmental management positive. Without the ETAP
project this prospect would have been unlikely.
E.    Current and Future Operations
36.   There are no plans for IDA involvement in a future operation at the time of this writing.
37.   IDA agreed with the previous Government to consider its request to incorporate an ETAP
II into the CAS to consolidate and implement the laws and policies developed and to assist with
the process of decentralization of environmental management. The outgoing Government
submitted the request in August 1997. The incoming Government of September 1997 did not
include such a request in their discussion with IDA on CAS strategy and reportedly indicated no
interest in borrowing for environmental aspects.
38.   GOB rather felt that similar offers of financial assistance would be sufficient to continue
the initiatives begun with ETAP support. An Interamerican Development Bank Project will be
strengthen: (a) the sector environmental units in energy, mining and transport; (b) environmental
units in the departments and municipalities; (c) the MDSMA, particularly with regard to their
capacity in EIA training; and (d) the Geographic Information System with respect to evaluation of
forestry and watershed management. A Danish project was not defined at the time of the
completion of the project, but the planning team expressed interest in assisting with
implementation of the EIA system and decentralization. The IDA supported Environment
Industry and Mining Project will supplement both efforts.
F.    Key Lessons Learned
The Inportance of Project Ownership
39.   The project was designed by an outgoing Government, and began to be implemented by a
new Government only two months later. The program design was not consistent with the
structure and goals of the incoming Government. It is clear from this experience that projects
suffer when they are designed under one Government and executed under a subsequent one
whose structure and priorities are distinctly different.
Support to Staffing
40.   The project design did not adequately address what was meant by a "consultant", and
ended up supporting far too many Government line positions as consultants. When the funding



8
ended these people left and the Government was weakened by their departure. A salary policy
consistent within all levels of Government and agreed to be all donors would minimize this
problem if contracting key line officials as consultants were absolutely necessary.
Taxes and Counterpart Funds
41.   The project design did not adequately address the issue of how taxes were to be paid for
by the Government, and what steps would be taken if the Government was unable to meet their
tax liabilities. Similar problems arose with counterpart funds. The lesson is that solutions to these
possible issues should be more clearly thought through before a project begins.
Government Commitment
42.   The collapse and ongoing instability of FONAMA during the life of the project serves to
emphasize that unless an institution has the clear and unwavering support from the Government, it
is unlikely to improve its performance no matter what level of "institutional strengthening"
initiatives are introduced under a project.
Supervision
43.   Persistency in applying strictly IDA regulations to contracting of all personnel and follow-
up on all procurement decisions were instrumental in reducing non-transparent practices in the
contracting process. Day to day supervision greatly helped this process.
Use of NGOs
44.   The use of local NGOs to implement pilot projects in environmental education was very
successful. The ministry properly used them to execute the project, and their own role was one of
fiscal control and supervision.
Use of "Pilot Projects"
45.   The concept of using "pilot projects" in environmental education was very successful as
evaluated during the supervision missions. teaching materials, effective practical teaching aids,
and curricula were refined and developed in representative areas of the country. The final "best
practice" products are being incorporated into the National Education Reform Process, and are
more practical as a result of the field trial experience.
Sustainability
46.   Sustainability may have been improved by having paid more attention to the concept in the
project design phase. For example: (i) an agreement to have key technical personnel
incorporated into the civil service may have been made part of the loan agreement; (ii a follow-up



9
project to implement the legislative changes made under the project could have been part of the
original long range planning process of IDA; and (iii) it could have been insisted as a condition of
effectiveness that counterpart funds would be used to support key staff positions and to plan for
ongoing sustainability.

FONAMA y de algunos organismos no gubernamentales para la Gesti6n Ambiental
en Bolivia.
2. Apoyo al Programa de Legislaci6n Ambiental para Bolivia (PLAB).
3. Apoyo al desarrollo del Programa de Conservaci6n de la Biodiversidad para Bolivia
(PCBB).
4. El Programa de Entrenamiento y Educaci6n Ambiental para Bolivia (el que esta

Uno de los primeros 6xitos concretos del Programa de Fortalecimiento de la Gesti6n
Ambiental para Bolivia (PFGA), es el PCBB, cuyo objetivo principal es el de desarrollar
e implementar el Sistema Nacional de Areas Protegidas en Bolivia (SNAP). El PCBB ha
sido financiado a partir de abril de 1993, mediante un Fondo Global Ambiental (GETF),
administrado primariamente por el BIRF (GET Grant Agreement No. 28620-80). Este
Fondo Global es alimentado con recursos que provienen, hasta el presente, de dos
fuentes exclusivamente en calidad de donaci6n (GEF con $us 4.3 millones; y el
Gobierno de Suiza con Sf 5.2 millones). Estas dos contribuciones tienen el merito de
haber consolidado el funcionamiento del SNAP, como uno de los mas importantes
proyectos sobre areas protegidas en Latinoam6rica. Una tercera fuente de
financiamiento del PCBB es Alemania (con DM 6 millones).
DESARROLLO DEL PROYECTO
A. El Proyecto de Asistencia Tecnica Ambiental (ETAP), entra en vigor a partir del 20
de marzo de 1993, sin embargo el dep6sito inicial en la Cuenta Especial se efectua
el 8 de julio de 1993 y el primer desembolso se realiza el 29 de julio de 1993. La
fecha de cierre del Proyecto de Asistencia Tecnica Ambiental de acuerdo al
Convenio de Credito 2443-BO sera el 30 de junio de 1997.
1. El Proyecto de Asistencia Tecnica Ambiental (ETAP), esta financiado con
recursos del Convenio de Credito N° 2443-BO, inici6 oficialmente actividades en
julio de 1993, este proyecto esta administrado por el Fondo Nacional para el
Medio Ambiente (FONAMA) e inicialmente fue ejecutado por la Secretarfa Nacional
del Medio Ambiente (SENMA). El ETAP ha sido diseinado para desarrollar y
fortalecer la capacidad de gesti6n ambiental de la SENMA y a partir de octubre de
1993 al Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Medio Ambiente, de algunas ONG's
ambientalistas y de las Comisiones Ambientales del Congreso Nacional, a traves
de la ejecuci6n de tres componentes: a) el Programa de Fortalecimiento
Institucional (con sus subcomponentes: i) Programa de Entrenamiento y
Capacitaci6n en Evaluaci6n de Impacto Ambiental; ii) Programa de Calidad
Ambiental; y iii) Desarrollo de la Capacidad Institucional en Planificaci6n y Gesti6n
Ambiental); b) el Programa de Legislaci6n Ambiental para Bolivia; y c) el Programa
de Educaci6n Ambiental, en sus fases piloto a nivel urbano y rural.
2. El 6 de agosto de 1993, se efectuo el cambio constitucional en el Gobierno de
Bolivia, procedi6ndose con la reestructuraci6n del Poder Ejecutivo, mediante Ley
de Ministerios del Poder Ejecutivo N° 1493, de fecha 17 de septiembre de 1 993,
y posteriormente reglamentada mediante D.S. NO 23660 en fecha 1 2 de octubre
de 1993. Como efecto de esta Ley y su Reglamento, se elimina la SENMA,
creandose a cambio el Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Medio Ambiente
(MDSMA), quien asume los compromisos establecidos en el Convenio de Credito
No 2443-BO. El FONAMA pasa a ser una entidad desconcentrada bajo la tuici6n
del MDSMA.

De mi consideraci6n:
Hago referencia a sus notas BV/1227/97 del 22 de diciembre de 1997, a
trav6s de las cuales solicita los comentarios de este Viceministerio en relaci6n
al informe de conclusi6n del proyecto de referencia.
Al respecto, me permito comunicarle las siguientes observaciones sobre el
citado documento:
* En relaci6n a la evaluaci6n del uso de ONG s como agentes ejecutores de
proyectos de educaci6n medio ambientales, tal vez seria necesario que
explique en mayor detalle los mecanismos de acci6n de las mismas as!
como los parametros que se han utilizado para la evaluaci6n de su
desempefno.
* Punto 9 " Componente de Capacitacion y Educaci6n" es necesario explicar
con mayor detalle el tipo de cursos que se han brindado, el nivel de
participaci6n del sector p6blico, privado y la sociedad civil, y los
mecanismos que se han creado para que este proceso sea sostenible a largo
plazo.

* Punto 12 "Componentes Legales y Regulatorios": es importante mencionar
que si bien a trav6s del presente financiamiento se logrd la promulgaci6n de
distintas Leyes y Reglamentos relacionados con temas medio ambientales,
en muchos casos no se logro crear la capacidad administrativa, ni los
mecanismos necesarios para Ilevar a cabo un seguimiento adecuado del
cumplimiento de estas normas. Por otro lado, se deberia incluir en el
documento el hecho que los est6ndares establecidos de estas normas, se
han basado en parametros norteamericanos y europeos que son dificiles de
cumplir, especialmente a corto y mediano plazo.
* Punto 20 "Sostenibilidad del Proyecto": si bien el apoyo financiero de
organismos multilaterales (BM y BID) y de gobiernos amigos (Dinamarca) es
y ser6 valioso en los pr6ximos afios, de ninguna manera los mismos pueden
considerarse como elementos de sostenibilidad del Proyecto, especialmente
a largo plazo. En este sentido, seria propicio indicar que no se ha logrado
consolidar hasta la fecha un mecanismo que ileve en un periodo razonable a
la sostenibilidad financiera de aspectos medio ambientales.
* Tabla 2: Prestamos del Banco Mundial relacionados al cr6dito 2443-BO: Los
cr6editos 2119 -B0 y 2187-B0 han concluido el 31 de diciembre de 1997.
