REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
REPUBLIC OF BOLIVIA FOR A
RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a pro-
posed development credit to the Republic of Bolivia for the equivalent
of US$8 million on standard IDA terms, to help finance the first
stage (1973-1974) of the Plan for the technical and financial reha-
bilitation of the National Railway Enterprise of Bolivia.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Bolivia" (WH-213a, dated November 9, 1972) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on November 20, 1972. It incorporates the
findings of an economic mission which visited Bolivia in January/
February 1972 and of a subsequent visit. More recent economic devel-
opments, particularly those related to a financial reform program
introduced on October 27, 1972, are highlighted below. A summary of
Country Basic Data is attached as Annex II.
Background
3.        Bolivia is the most underdeveloped country in South America.
The vast majority of its population is engaged in low-productivity
traditional agriculture; only a fraction of the labor force is employed
in enclave-type export activities in the fields of mining, petroleum
and, more recently, cotton. Economic development has been hindered by
geographical isolation and political instability. The revolution of
1952 largely abrogated feudalism but led to serious declines in overall
output which did not recover until the early 1960's. Despite appre-
ciable GDP increases in the second half of the 1960's the problems of
poverty and underemployment remain overwhelming and the living standards
of the majority of the population are very low. GNP per capita reached
US$176 in 1971 but the harshness of the environment, the regional
income disparities and the skewed income distribution mean that living
standards of most of the population are at subsistence levels.
4.        After a decade of post-revolutionary economic disorder, the
country entered a period of consolidation and by 1965 reached limited
economic viability. Rapid economic growth ensued in the following



-2-
three years, with GDP increasing at an average annual rate of 6.5
percent. Growth in this period was propelled by substantial increases
in private investment and by satisfactory export performance due,
principally, to exports of petroleum. Economic activity, however,
slowed down after 1968 and during 1969-71 the rate of growth of GDP
dropped to 2.8 percent annually, barely above population growth. Three
main factors appear to have been responsible for the loss of growth
momentum (i) the resurgence of political instability which impaired
confidence and led to a decline in private savings and investment;
(ii) the hostility of the authorities to foreign private investment as
expressed in the form of nationalization of foreign-owned properties;
and (iii) the continuing deterioration of public sector finances, which
limited the public sector's ability to offset the decline in pri-vate
investment.
5.        While the decline in private investment during 1969-71 was
the result of a crisis of confidence and thus of a transitory nature,
.the deterioration of public sector finances reflected a deep-seated
structural characteristic of the Bolivian economy. As a result of the
nationalizations carried-out during the 1952 revolution, Bolivia's
public sector has become one of the largest in Latin America and one on
which the people have progressively grown to depend for their liveli-
hood.  With the scarcity of employment opportunities in the private
sector and the high level of open and disguised unemployment, pressures
to expand the ranks of public servants have proved difficult to resist.
Large expenditures on wages and salaries by the Central Government and,
by the state enterprises, combined with a weak tax system which relies
heavily on the external sector and is poorly administered, has left
precariously few resources for public investment.  Moreover, the
inability of the public sector to generate an adequate volume of savings
severely limited the capacity to utilize external development funds.
The weakness of the public finances has also caused the public sector
to rely heavily on internal credit reducing the availability of domestic
savings in support of private investment. Thus, the inordinately high
consumption by the public sector has been responsible for a drop in
overall investment activity with its adverse effects on economic growth.
Recent Economic Developments
6.        The slow rate of economic growth in the last three years
accentuated social tensions in the country. On coming to power in the
second half of 1971, President Banzer's Government faced the urgent
need to provide jobs for the urban unemployed and to set the basis for
the sustained growth of private and public investment. To achieve the
first objective, the Government put into effect an "Emergency Program"
financed by a US*12 million loan and a US$? million grant from USAID,
which aimed at creating jobs on public works. To establish a more
favorsble climate for private investment new laws offering guarantees



-3-
and incentives to private investors were prcmulgated; in addition, the
Government settled all outstanding claims arising from earlier nationali-
zations.
7.        Government efforts to stimulate the growth of public invest-
ment were carried out in two phases. The first phase involved
improvement of the overall planning mechanism by means of administrative
reforms, including the transfer of the planning func.tion to the Presi-
dency of the Republic. At the same time, the Government took steps to
improve pricing policies for some public undertakings, particularly in
power and transport. Power rates were increased substantially in La
Paz, Oruro and Cochabamba to achieve a satisfactory return on capital,
and significant increases were made in railway tariffs in order to support
the proposed rehabilitation program. The second phase aimed at pro-
ducing a prompt and significant improvement in the finances of the
Central Government and the state economic enterprises. The design and
implementation of this phase took somewhat longer due to the difficulties
encountered in its technical preparation and in the creation of a
political consensus conducive to its orderly implementation.
8.        The need to implement a program for a substantial improvement
in public finances has existed for some time, but became especially
pressing in 1972. The authorities were faced at the beginning of the
year with the need to finance a Central Government deficit equivalent
to about 6 percent of GDP as a result of falling revenues and increasing
expenditures. The Government's monetary program envisaged Central Bank
financing of the Treasury at some 2 percent of GDP during 1972, but the
annual target was exceeded by the end of July. In the absence of an
offsetting contraction of credit to the private sector which would have
depressed the growth prospects of the economy, inflationary pressures
led to declining foreign exchange reserves. The previously unimportant
black market in foreign exchange boomed and by mid-September, US dollars
were traded at a premium of one-third over their official value.
Throughout this period the Government was preparing a program to cope
with the situation. The resulting Stebilization and Development Plan
was put into effect on October 27, 1972.
9.        The Plan's objective is to strengthen public finances and to
increase resource availability for public investment in 1973, while
preserving internal stability and balance of payments viability. Its
most important elements are as follows: (i) a reduction of the par
value of the peso from $bll.88 to $b20.OO per US dollar; (ii) the intro-
duction of a 20 percent tax on the value of traditional exports and of
a 15 percent tax on non-traditional exports; (iii) a 5 percent tax on
the revaluation of corporate assets resulting from the devaluation of
the peso; (iv) a general increase of $b135 per month in salaries and
wages to compensate for the anticipated increase in the cost of living
to be followed by a one-year long wage freeze; and (v) a freeze on
residential rents.



10.       The Plan aims at reversing the outflow of foreign exchange
reserves in 1973 and achieving a considerable improvement in the finances
of the public sector. The Treasury's balance on current account is expected
to turn around from a deficit of $b500 million in 1972 to a surplus of some
$bhOO million in 1973. Most of the improvement is expected to come from
the introduction of new export taxes, yielding about $b750 million. The
principal state export enterprises -- COMIBOL and YPFB -- would also contri-
bute to the build-up of public sector savings. The Plan also anticipates
increases in public utility tariffs in line with domestic price increases.'
The increased level of public saving should allow an acceleration 'of public
investment expenditures without recourse to Central Bank credit, thereby
freeing resources for private investment.
11.       On the whol5,-'.the Government's program meets the reqi#iiements of
the situation and is in'line with the recommendations of the'Baik''-s'latest
economic report. The lasting success of these measures will depend to a
large extent on the Government's ability to hold the line on incomes. As a
result of the devaluation of the peso, the price level is expected to rise
during the next several'months and to stabilize itself in 1973-714 at a level
some 25 percent above thart of 1972. The $b135 per month wage increase will
raise nominal wages on average by some 15 percent.  The measures imply, there-
fore, a scaling down'of the large increase in public sector real wages which
took place in the'immediately preceding years. They would have the effect,
however, of increasing real incomes of the lowest paid workers.
12.       While as a con'sequence of the Stabilization Plan fiscal prospects
for 1973 appear to be bright, prospects for subsequent years depend on the
implementation of reforms capable of inducing more lasting improvements.  The
Government is conscious of this situation. The stabilization decree stipulated
that a program for the reform of the Government revenue system be :submitted
for Cabinet approval within the next six months. A reasonable;'objective for
such a program wTould be to raise public sector savings from abou't 3.7 percent
of GDP in 1965-71 to over 6 percent in 1973-77.  This level of public savings
ought to make it possible for the country to raise gross capital fonration
from 16 percent of GDP in 1965-71 to 18 percent in 1973-77, and permit an
annual expansion of domestic output of between 6 and 7 percent per annum.
Since the public investment program is expected to average about US$110
million annually over the next five years, the above-mentioned level of public
savings would cover some 70 percent of public sector investment during the
period -- a reasonable proportion given the relatively low level bf income
in the country.
External Assistance Requirements
13.       To launch the Stabilization Plpn, the Government obtain-ed the
support of USAID which recently authorized the conversion of a US$20
million investment-support-loan into a program loan.  An IMF mission is
currently in Bolivia studying the possibility of a Stand-by, and the
Government is discussing with private foreign banks the possibility of
obtaining supplementary funds in support of the Plan. The authorities



-5-
are also hopeful that implementation of the Plan will lead to a consi-
derable increase in the activities of the other Washington-based develop-
ment agencies in support of public investment over the coming five years.
14.       The above-mentioned public investment program of about US$110
million annually during 1973-77 is expected to contain projects suitable
for external project lending with a foreign exchange component estimated
at some 60 percent of total costs. If external lenders limited their
financing to this foreign exchange component, they would cover only
about 80 percent of the public sector's gross external capital require-
ments. To fill the remaining gap, even taking into account available
program financing, it would be necessary for external lenders to cover
some local costs of development projects in addition to their foreign
exchange component.
15.       The above resource requirements for the public sector are
consistent with the country's overall balance of payments financing
needs. To sustain a growth rate of GDP of between 6 and 7 percent per
annum, gross capital inflows in 1973-77 will have to average some US$68
million annually, as compared with average inflows of US$146 million in
1965-71. On the basis of the "pipeline" of undisbursed loans and the
existing lending programs of the principal bilateral and multilateral
agencies, Boliva's public sector may reasonably expect to obtain an
average of US$50 million annually from these sources in 1973-77. The
remaining US$18 million are likely to come into the country in the form
of suppliers' credits and private capital inflows. If this pattern of
financing materializes, Bolivia's outstanding external debt repayable in
foreign currency would increase slowly, from US$532 million at the end
of 1971 to US$628 million at the end of 1977. However, the external debt
service ratio would fall from its height of 18 percent of exports of
goods and services in 1971 to 13 percent by 1977. Bolivia is a very
poor country and the harshness of the environment renders economic
development costly. External capital requirements for development are
quite high, but with the recently enacted measures, especially those
increasing public sector savings, the prospective improvements in pro-
ject preparation and the strengthening of development institutions,
it is reasonable to expect that they will be forthcoming. Given its
poverty, the outlook for satisfactory performance stemming from the
recently adopted reforms, and the present lack of creditworthiness for
Bank lending, Bolivia may be considered to be IDA-worthy. The successful
implementation of the Stabilization Plan would contribute greatly to
Bolivia's economic growth as well as to its creditworthiness, and would,
therefore, justify the above external financial assistance. Indeed,
if the balance of payments effects of the Plan materialize as envisaged,
Bolivia, while continuing to be IDA-worthy, should be in a position to
seek part of the external financial assistance required from development
agencies on conventional terms.

PART II - THE BANK GROUP'S ROLE IN BOLIVIA
Introduction
16.       Bank Group assistance so fer made available to Bolivia reflects
the country's difficult budgetary position, the low income level of its
people, and its limited cepacity to service external debt. Except for a
Bank loan to help finance an "enclave" project, lending to Bolivia has been
in the form of IDA credits only. We have so far limited our financing to
those projects which made no call on the Government's budget for domestic
financing.
Status. of. Bank Group Operations
17.       A summary s,tatement of Bank Group Operations is attached as Annex I.
Until now, the sectorkl distribution of our lending has been1fa.irly limited.
IDA has mpde three credits each for power generation and distribution ($22.t1
million), and for livestock development ($10.2 million).   The oie and only
Bank loan ($23.25 million) helped finsnce thetconstruction of a pipeline to
transmit natural gas for export.
Electric .Power
18.       Our first lending operation in Bolivia consisted of two IDA credits
totalling $15 million. The newly established Government-owned Empresa-Nacional
de Electricidad (ENDE) benefited from $10 million to build the Corani hydro-
electric plant and transmission and distribution facilities. 'The-Bolivian
Power'Company received the other $5 million, through the-Government, to build
the Chururaqui hydroelectric project and some trpnsmission lines. Both
projects were executed efficiently and completed on time.   In 1969, a $7.4 million
credit was made to assist'ENDE constructing the Santa Isabel hydroelectric plhnit.
The Santa Isabel project is. now expected to be completed in early 1973, the
delay of about 10 months being accounted for by unexpectedly difficult excavation
conditions.
Livestock
19.       In 1967, IDA made its first credit of $2 million for livestock
development in the Beni region. The proceeds, together with a contribution
by Banco Agricola, supported a credit program for beef ranchers,'and related
technical services. The money was taken up rapidly and IDA followed up
with an.interim credit of'$l.h.million in 1970 Meanwhile, work proceeded
on a third livestock project for which IDA lent $6.8 million in June 1971.
This project comprises credit.programs for beef ranchers in the Beni region
and for small sheep ranchers on the Altiplano. Disbursements on this credit
have just started.
The Ges Pipeline
20.       The only Bank operation in Bolivia has been the $23.25 million loan
of July 1969 (revised in July 1971) to Compania Yacibol Bogoc Trsnsportadores
(YABOG) for the construction of a 330 mile gas pipeline from Santa Cruz to the
Argentine border. The IDB also assisted in the financing of the project.



-7-
Over the twenty years of the sales contract proceeds from gas exports to
Argentina are expected to reach about $300 million. Payments will be
applied in the first place, to service the loans made to finance the
pipeline and to compensate the Gulf Oil Corporation for the properties
taken over by the Government.
21.       The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's eighth operation
in Bolivia, bringing the amount of IDA assistance to $40.6 million.
External financing to Bolivia, other than by the Bank Group, is principally
provided by USAID and the IDB. USAID has been active in transport,
agriculture, electric power and mining, and also made available significant
amounts in program assistance. The IDB mainly financed road transport,
manufacturing and mining investments as well as investments in the social
sectors. The past lending of the main official lending agencies is
summarized below:

Future Direction of Bank Group Lending
22.       The problems which the Bolivian Government is confronting are
formidable. The country's poverty, coupled with the heritage of political
instability, severely limits the scope of Government action. Nevertheless,
the Government is endeavoring to accelerate economic development to draw the
peasants of the Altiplano out of the subsistence econonw and to alleviate
the critical unemployment situation. This demands increasing amounts of
investment, both public and private. It is in this context of Bolivia's dire
poverty, insistent expectations, increasing demands on domestic resources and
foreign exchange earnings, and the encouraging efforts of the present Govern-
ment to remedy past deficiencies and to reorganize for the future, that
external assistance programs for Bolivia need to be considered. Responding
to early indications from the Bolivian Government regarding its plans for
a significant expansion in its public investment and savings effort, we



-8-
considerably expanded our project preparation efforts. As a result, we
hope to be able to increase significantly Bank Group lending to Bolivia
during the coming years. In so doing, we plan to continue our efforts to
support the building up of an adequate infrastructure of power and transport,
and to help in the Government's efforts to expand and diversify Bolivia's
exports, but put greater emphasis on helping the Government in creating
additional employment opportunities.
23.       In May/June 1972, a field appraisal was undertaken of the expansion
programs of both ENDE and BPC. These two companies have prepared programs
for the much-needed expansion in their power distribution and transmission
programs which would merit financial support from IDA. We expect to present
these projects to -the Executive Directors in the course of this fiscal year.
2h.       In our futire assistance to Bolivia we hope to be able to enter
a new field, that of mining and metallurgy. In view of the predominance of
this sector for export earnings, a Bank mission studied the sector in
February-March 1971. Subsequent discussions^with the Bolivian Government
indicated a basis for starting off on an active program of project identifica-
tion and preparation. In June 1972, we apprpised a project for the expansion
of a tin tailings recovery plant located at Catavi. This project is expected'
to be. presented to the Executive Directors in this fiscal year.  We have also
commenced preparatory work on a program of credit for medium miners which we
expect will result in an operation in FY 197h. We expect to proceed there-
after with the preparation of a project for assisting the small miners.
25.       Our plans for the agriculture sector include assistance for
improving poultry and dairy production in the Cochabamba area, and for
expanding and improving the production of cotton in the Santa Cruz region.
26.       With the progress made by the Government in its plans for fiscal
improvement, it will now be possible to explore possibilities for-projects
which are dependent upon contributions from the Central Government.  The
Government's recent. fiscal action justifies consideration by the Bank Group
of the proposed railway credit which -- unlike earlier operations -- will
depend on a financial contribution from the Central Government, albeit in a
small amount.



-9-
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
Introduction
27.       The topography of Bolivia, with three distinct and separate
regions, makes the provision of trpnsport facilities a formidable and
costly task. The problem is aggravated by the sparse population which
means that land transport must cover long distances to serve small
volumes of traffic. The existing transport system is the cumulative
result of isolated responses to specific demands over the last 100 years.
Commencing with the privately-owned railway companies building lines from
major mining areas of the Altiplano to Pacific ports between 1870 and 1920,
railway development-received further stimulus from the Brazilian and
Argentine Governments after 1935 and road development was promoted by the
U.S. in the 1960's. On the whole, therefore, the land transport system
has been shaped by a variety of autonomous and uncoordinated impulses.
This piece-meal genesis did not result in an integrated transport system.
The Various Transport Modes
26.       The existing highway system is almost entirely confined to the
south-western part of the country. Even with considerable US Government
assistance during the last decade, only about 800 km of roadway, out of the
existing network of 4,000 km of primary and 2,700 km of secondary roads,
have so far been paved. A tentative highway plan was drawn up in 1969-70,
envisaging a massive road construction and upgrading program along with
improved road maintenance, but the poor state of public finances allowed
little progress in these directions. Despite the rudimentary highway system,
however, the trucking industry has growm repidly in the last decade and
carries at present about 60 percent of domestic freight. It does so,
howTever, at high cost. The lack of direct road access to the ports and the
relative advantage of the railways on heavy and long hauls, has meant that
the role of road transport in external trade has been negligible.
29.       The potential of inland water transport has not yet been exploited
in Bolivia. The two major rivers, the Beni and the Mamore, are isoleted
end still in their natural state. They are used only for short hops by
primitive craft, and by a small fleet of outmoded motorized vessels carrying
food, cement and fuel for the Beni region in the north. Traffic generated
in Bolivia over the Amazon and the Paraguay rivers is as yet insignificant.
The most important waterborne traffic is by steamer across Lake Titicaca.
30.       The two modes of transportation that have shown rapid development
are air freight and pipelines. Three major airports and numerous unpaved
airstrips support a fleet of over 200 airplanes transporting some 200,000
passengers and 36,000 tons of freight annually. The hauling of fresh beef
from the lowlands to the urban centers and the Altiplano mining towns has
become an important service. Bolivia installed over 2,000 km of oil pipelines
between 1949 and 1967. They allow access from the major production fields
to the Pacific seaport of Arica and the Argentine border town of Yacuiba,
and carry about 95 percent of all petroleum transported. The Bank-financed
gas pipeline conveys gas over 550 km from Santa Cruz to Yacuiba.



Railways
31.       The Bolivian economy relies primarily on the railway system to
carry its external trade, and a significant part of its domestic freight
and passenger traffic. The system consists of about 3,500 km of railway
line.  Except for two branch lines, the system is administered by the
Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles (ENFE).   The reilways form two separate
systems: the Western and the Eastern system, linked only by a long detour
through Argentina.
32.       The Western system was built in the period between .1870 and 1920,
largely in response to the need of the mining industry to transport its
products to the Pacific ports.   These lines were built with private capital,
albeit often backed by Government guarantees.   This system consists of
2,300 km of meter-gaukge railway, linking the main towns in the south-
western part of thesiountry and providing access to the port,aff` Matarsni in
Peru, to those of Arica and Antofagasta in Chile, and (via.VJ-Ulazon) to the
Argentine ports.  About 55 percent of the traffic consists of exports and
imports, including about 90 percent of minerals transported.
33.       The Eastern system consists of two major lines operating over
1,200 km, and was built after 1937.   One connects Corumba on. the Brazilian
border to Santa Cruz, and the other connects Santa Cruz with Yacuiba on the
Argentine border. A third line, extending north-eastwards from Santa Cruz,
is presently under construction. Its construction is financed by Argentina
and the line will provide access to the unexploited Beni region.   The
railways are the only significant mode of transport in Eastern Bolivia, the
region where most of the new exports (cotton, timber and fruits) originate.
About 70 percent of the traffic on the Eastern railway system.consis;ts of
exports and imports
3b.       Comparisons of railways marginal costs with those-estimated for
roads in the west (excluding road infrastructure) indicate*that road costs
are considerably higher for freight and for the preponderance of passengers
(second class). Analysis of ENFE's freight traffic shows that a large
proportion consists of bulky, relatively low value products with long hauls,
for which transportation cost is a prime factor. On the basis of the existing
data it can, therefore, be concluded that the railways have an important role
to play in the Bolivian transportation system.
Transport Coordination and Planning
35.       The Bank Group becpme associated with Bolivia's transport development
in 1962 iwhen we financed a consultant's survey of the various railways then
operating in Bolivia.  In 1964 the Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles was
established, partly on the strength of the consultant's recommendations.
During 1967-69 the Bank Group administered a National Transport Survey financed
by the UNDP. The Survey concluded that, except for pipelines, the economic
costs of providing transport services are not covered by collected user charges,
due not only to inadequate charges but also to evasions of them. The poor
quality of the statistics available precludes an accurate estimation of the



real subsidy provided by the Government to the various transport modes
and the Government proposes to study the entire question of road and
rail charges as e prelude to adopting corrective measures.
36.       Given Bolivip's limited resources and the high cost of road
and rail construction in Bolivia, sound transport planning and coordination
must play an important role in the future development of Bolivia's trans-
port system. Numerous proposals had been made for major new investments
in the sector, such as the interconnection of the Eastern and Western
railway systems, extending the railways to Trinidad in the Beni region, and
the construction of roads, at times paralleling the railways. Bolivia's
weak public finances have deterred the implementation of these proposals,
and only externally-aided projects, such as the USAID-financed Alto-Oruro
road, and the Argentina-financed extension of the railway north from
Ssnta Cruz, have gone forward. While many of these proposed works may even-
tually be justified, it is desirable that the investments be planned
rationally and integrated into a national plen.
37.       The Bolivian Government has recently effected various measures that
should result in the introduction of sound transport planning and coordination.
Under a recent Administrstive Reorganization Law (September 1972) this is to
be undertaken at three levels. First, each transport agency (ENFE, Servicio
Nacional de Caminos, Lloyds Boliviano) is to have a group responsible for
accumulating data, initiating investment proposals and making related
studies. The Planning Unit in ENFE became operational a few months ago. With
the assistance of foreign experts, ENFE is building up a nucleus of personnel
to allow this Unit to maintain and analyze current statistics, assist management
in monitoring the execution of ENFE's investment plan, and in undertaking traffic
costing studies. Second, the Ministry of Transport has been made responsible
for formulating and executing transport policy. It will receive the proposals
of the various transport agencies and adjust these to the national transport
requirements.  The Government proposes to augment the staff in this Ministry to
undertake the required studies and to prepare investment programs. Technical
assistance is expected to be provided by the UNDP. Finally, the investment
proposals, as screened by the Ministry of Transport, are to be considered by a
National Economic and Planning Council which determines overall priorities.
38.       It is expected that this new system of planning will assist the
Government to take rational decisions in the field of transport. The Government
already proposes to study the economic justification of the possible inter-
connection between the Eastern and Western systems, the extension of the railway
line north of Puerto Msmore and the proposed Cochabamba-Oruro highway. It will
also carry out the study of road user charges, referred to above, to guide
future transport policy.

PART IV - THE RAILWAY PLAN AND THE PROJECT
Problems of the Railways
39.       Since its creation in 1964, ENFE has suffered from managerial,
financial and technical problems which have been aggravated by the
paucity of investment. In 1969, the UNDP agreed to finance a program of
technical assistance which was administered by the Bank Group. Under
this program, a team of French consultants, Sofrerail, assisted ENFE to
prepare a five-year plan for the modernization of ENFE which is beset by
virtually all the difficulties encountered in many of our railway pro-
jects: poor operations, badly maintained and over-aged equipment, lack
of experienced management and a low standard of staff training;, lack of-
commercial'policy, low traffic density leading to uneconomic lines and
services, and excess svtaff. These resulted in a difficult financial
situation, aggravate& by insufficient financial support from Government,
and in the threat of continuously diminishing capability to move export
and import traffic.
Railway Development Plan
40.       The Bolivian Government and ENFE have adopted a Five-Year
Rehabilitation and Investment Plan for modernizing the railway system.
The Plan is estimated to cost about $37 million equivalent. It will be
executed over the period 1973-77. Its objective is to technically and
financially rehabilitate ENFE, and to develop the railway system in such
a way that it can efficiently meet-the future transport needs'of the
economy.
41.       The Plan envisages three inter-related groups of actions:
acquisition of equipment to make up for the heavy arrears of maintenance
and replacement and to expand ENFE's transport capability; financial
rehabilitation of the enterprise; and the modernization of the engineering
and commercial practices, and of the managerial methods. The prepon-
derance of expenditure during the Plan will be on procuring rolling
stock (31 percent), improving track, and related civil works (30 percent)
and substituting diesel motive power for the more costly steam traction
(15 percent). The financial rehabilitation of ENFE is of considerable
significance in view of the difficult fiscal problems that confront the
Bolivian Government. During the last two years the Government has
contributed US$3.0-3.5 million equivalent per year to ENFE to meet the
deficit on operations and to service ENFE's debt. These deficits are
planned'to be eliminated by 1977-78, by mounting efforts in three
directions: by reducing unit costs, increasing traffic and charging
realistic tariffs. The rehabilitation of ENFE, along with the intro-
duction of modern operational, commercial and management methods, has
been detailed in a comprehensive Program of Action which establishes
time-phased targets for the rehabilitation of the enterprise, including
modernizing the workshops, redeploying and reducing the staff, and
streamlining the traffic operations.



- 13 -
The Project
42.       The Five-Year Rehabilitation and Investment Plan (1973-77) is
to be implemented in two stages. The Project consists of the first two
years (1973-74) of the Plan at a total estimated cost of about $11.6
million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost would be $7.9 million
equivalent. The Project's emphasis is on improving the quality of
ENFE's operations, and constitutes the minimum investment required to
allow better use of existing facilities and to cope with the immediate
prospective increase in traffic0 The acquisition of new motive power
and rolling stock has, therefore, been kept at a modest level.
43.       A Report entitled "Appraisal of a Railway Project:   Bolivia"
(No. PTR-llla) dated November 15, 1972, is being circulated separately.
A credit and project summary is attached as Annex III. The calculations
contained in the Appraisal Report and cited in this one are based on the
exchange rate prevailing in Bolivia prior to the devaluation effected on
October 27, 1972 and without the application of a shadow exchange rate.
The change in the parity of the Bolivian peso and the expected increase
in domestic prices is not likely to effect the estimates of costs rela-
tive to those of benefits to such an extent as to alter the overall
judgment regarding the economic justification of the Plan or the Project.
This is so because, while the foreign exchange cost of the Project is
substantial, and will rise when expressed in local currency, the benefits
being predominantly savings in alternative transport costs and having an
even more substantial foreign exchange component, will also rise. More-
over, to the extent that benefits take the form of assured continuation
of exports, the value of such benefits will rise pari passu with the
extent of the devaluation. The expected increase in the domestic con-
tribution required for implementing the Project is covered by the
Government's undertaking to provide all funds required by ENFE to carry
out the Project, and prospects for fulfillment of this undertaking are
advanced by the tax measures applied in association with the devaluation.
44.       At the negotiations, held in W*shington in April and October
of 1972, the Government of Bolivia was represented by Mr. Guido Gutierrez,
Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Civil
Aviation, Mr. TWlter Jorgensen, Under-Secretary in the Ministry of Finance,
and Mr. Oscar Zapata, Director in the Ministry of Planning. ENFE was
represented by its General Manager, Mr. Rene Navajas.
Program of Action
45.       An important aspect of the Project is the carrying out of a
comprehensive Program of Action. The UNDP has agreed to provide the
necessary technical assistance to support this Program. The Program
of Action, summarized in Schedule 3 of the draft Credit Agreement, con-
sists of various actions which would be executed according to a fixed
time schedule. It extends over the entire Plan period (1973-77), but
significant advances by the end of 1974 are planned. The Program of
Action establishes targets for the following steps:



(i)    extending the track rehabilitation schem.e, which is
underway, to cover the whole system by mid-1974;
(ii)   rehabilitating the existing main line diesel locomotives
and diesel rail cars by the end of 197h;
(iii)  rehabilitating the existing passenger and freight cars;
(iv)   modernizing and concentrating the work shops, including
the establishment of an organized-store and supplies
system;
(v)    es 1blishing an effective operations and car*, allocation
sy- m for the entire railways by mid-1973;
(vi)   establishing a commercial department and introducing a
new passenger tariff schedule by mid-1973, as,was
already introduced for freight in mid-1972;
(vii)  redeploying of staff and, reducing it by about 750
employees to achieve a target of 5,500 by 1977;,
(viii) the closing of the Sucre-Tarabuco line, which has.no
prospects of generating sufficient traffic to justify
its continuance;
(ix)   improving the financial performance of ENFE, to achieve.
the following targets:
1972   1973   1974   1975   1976   1977
Working
Ratio %       110    101     97     9Q     64     79
Operating
Ratio %       126    116    112    104     98     92
The progressive improvement in ENFE's financial condition requ,ired to
achieve these targets will be the cumulative effect of executing all
aspects of the Action Program. The introduction and maintenance of a
rational tariff structure is, however, of critical significance. ENFE
started to move in this direction by making a new freight tariff structure
effective in July 1972. The new rates are based on marginal costs of
transporting each commodity and,take account of competition from other
modes of transport. This new tariff schedule should raise average
revenue per ton-km by about 10 percent. The new passenger fare structure,
to be introduced in mid 1973, is expected to raise average revenue per
passenger-km by about.10 percent. The Government and ENFE would also



- 15 -
undertake in the Credit and Project Agreements to maintain rates in real
terms by the prompt introduction of tariff increases to compensate for future
cost increases; while this understanding does not cover the adjustment now
made necessary by the recent devaluation and consequent domestic price changes,
the Bolivipn authorities will in fact have to institute prompt tariff increases
to meet the 1973 financial performance targets, and we are confident they will
do so.
The Financing Plan
46.       The Project would be financed from the following sources:
$ million
Foreign cost    Local cost      Total
Government                     -               2.8         2.8
Proposed IDA Credit           7.2              0.8         8.0

7.9             3.7        11.6
Thus, external agencies would be financing 76 percent of the Project cost.
Their total financing would exceed the foreign exchange costs of V7.9 million.
This is justified in view of the analysis of external financing requirements
cited in paragraph 14. It should also be noted that the domestic contribution
would be provided entirely by the Government, as ENFE's finances will not allow
it to contribute to investment during 1973-74. The total Government contribu-
tion to ENFE will be much larger, as the Government will Plso have to assist
ENFE to meet its operational deficit and to service its debt. The total
Government assistance to ENFE during the 1973-74 period will, in fact, amount
to $7.5 million equivalent.

The IDA Credit
07.       The proposed IDA credit of $8 million would finpnce the following
items:



- 16
US$ million
Way and Wbrks                         2.5
Motive Power                           1.2

Grand Topt,al                         8.0
The Way and Works item includes material and equipment required to
implement the track rehabilitation program and to facilitate the intro-
duction of modern track maintenance practices.  It also covers,the first
phase of bridge strengthening and of protection works on the Oruro-
Cochabamba line which crosses the Eastern Cordillera, and the.procurement
of telecommunication equipment to improve traffic control.  The investment
in motive power would allow the procurement of 13 rail tractors to re-
place large locomotives that are presently being used for shunting
operations, and add three more diesel rail car sets to the existing
fleet, in part to replace old uneconomic passenger coaches, in part to
carry increased passenger traffic between the urban centers,.  The $2.4
million allocated for rolling stock would finance 200 freight cars, out
of the 850 required during the Plan Period, to replace the e,xisting
over-aged and small capacity cars and to provide additional capacity.
The locomotive and car maintenance item relates to the provision of
components to rehabilitate existing diesel locomotives andt railcars and
to improve existing passenger and freight cars.
Procurement and Disbursement
48.       Most of the contracts to be financed by the proposed credit
would be awarded after international competitive bidding.  One exception
will be the procurement of $500,000 worth of components and new parts for
locomotive and rail car rehabilitation and maintenance. Their procure-
ment will involve negotiated procurement from the original suppliers of
the locomotives and railcars. These components are needed to restore
to service capital assets now out of service. Suppliers credits are not
normally available for this type of purchase. Another exception will
be the local procurement of permanent way material (mainly sleepers) in
an amount estimated at about $800,000 equivalent.
49.       The disbursements regarding expenditure on the components and
new parts will be made on the full CIF costs of the items, while that
for the locally procured permanent way material will be on the basis



- 17 -
of ex-factory costs. The disbursement of the proposed credit is pro-
jected to be:
FY 197t        $4.3 million
FY 1975        $3.7 million
Project Execution
50.       The Project would be carried out by ENFE.  The Board of ENFE
is chaired by the Minister of Transport, Communications and Civil
Aviation and consists of six members, including the General Manager of
ENFE. The enterprise is presently governed by a law promulgated in
July 1970 which assures it of sufficient automony. The technical
assistance of 210 man months already provided under the UNDP-financed
program has significantly improved the technical performance of ENFE's
staff. The UNDP has agreed to continue supporting a program of
technical assistance to ENFE, and allocated up to $1 million for
providing about 180 man months of expertise, from October 1972 up to
June 1974. This phase of technical assistance is focussed largely on
the execution of the Plan. The continuation of this assistance during
the Project period will provide further training for the staff and
support for the management, thus ensuring satisfactory execution of the
Program of Action.
Economic Evaluation
51.       The Project is economically well justified.  As the first part
of the Plan, it will improve the operating efficiency of the railway
system and expand its capacity to meet the future demands of traffic.
If the Railway Rehabilitation and Investment Plan were not to be imple-
mented, the decline in the quality of service and the reduced capability
to move traffic would result in a massive diversion to more expensive
road traffic. The economic rate of return for the Plan, which takes
into consideration the higher cost of transportation by road and the
potential loss of traffic, has been estimated at 21 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHDRITY
52.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Association and the
Republic of Bolivia, the draft Project Agreement between the Association
and the Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles, the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of
Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft
agreements conform to the normal pattern of credits for railway
projects and include undertakings in the matters heretofore described.



- 18 -
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - REODMMENDATION
54.       I recomtend that the Executive Directors approve the pro-
posed credit.

-  us$6.8 million Credit of June 25, 1971, for Livestock Development (Cr. 261)
This is the third development credit for financing programs of credit
to the livestock sector. While the earlier two credits were committed rapidly
and disbursed, there ias ~been some delay in conmitments under -te third credit.
The delay is ascribable to the unwarranted expectation amongst potential borrowers
that the lending rate would be reduced. The rate of commitments is., however,
reported to be improving of late.
US$7.8 million Credit of April 2, 1969, for Power Generation (Cr. 148)
The completion of the Santa Isabel hydroplant, being built by the
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE) has been delayed by about a year due
to adverse geological conditions in tunneling. This, along with wage increases
has also increased the cost of the project by about $2 million. These over-runs
are being met by ENDE from its own funds.
