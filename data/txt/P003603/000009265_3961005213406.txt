MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMh1aDATION OF THF PRESIDENT
OF THE INTIERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT AND
TIlE INTERNATIC'..1 DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECU]IVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN ANI) A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REiPUBLIC OF CININA
FOR AN ENTERPRISE HOUSING AND SOCJAL SECURITY REFORIM PROJECT
].         I submit for your approxval the followinZgI memoranidum anld
recomeneidation on a proposed loan of $275 inillion equivalent and a proposed
credit of SDR 53.1 million ($75 millioni equivalent) to the People's Republic
of China to help finanice an EnterprLse Housing and Social Security Reformr
Proj ect   The loaln would be at the lBank's standard variable interest rate,
with a maturitv of 20 vears, includinrg           o vars of riace. 'lli credit would be
on standard IDA terms, with 35 years maturitv. The Government of China would
make the loan/credit proceeds available, except $1.5 million used for
technical assistance for its own departments, to the municipalities of Beijing
($168.5 million), Chengdu ($80 million), Ningbo ($55 million), and Yantai ($45
million) for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at an interest rate equal
to 87% of the JBRD loan rate.  The municipalities would make availablo about
$325 million of the proceeds to participating financial intermediaries (PFIs)
on agreed terms to partly finance long-term mortgage loans to Housing
Management Companies for construction and acquisition of rental housing and to
individuals for housing purchase, following lending policies satisfactory to
the Bank Group (para 20).
2.        Background.  China's remarkable economic growth since 1978 has been
accompanied by shifts of control from central to local governments, from
governments to enterprises, and from state plans to market mechanisms. Today,
firms are given considerable management autonomy to plan their production and
allocate resources, and less than 10% of economic output is controlled by the
state plan. It is widely accepted, however, that further reforms in the
enterprise and labor systems are needed to address remaining structural
rigidities. On-going and planned reform efforts focus on restructuring state-
owned enterprises (SOEs) and large collectively-o-wnied enterprises (COEs) in
the cities, in view of their continuing importance n the economy on one hand
and their relative inefficiency on the other. Another important, though less
discussed, element of enterprise reform is providing an enabling environment
for the small but fast developii.g non-state sector enterprises.
3.        In 1990, large and medium sized SOEs and COEs accounted for about
70% of industrial output, and almost 90% of urban industrial employmert.
Notwithstanding their considerable contribution to the rapid economic growth,
their overall efficiency and dynamism remain low relative to non-state sector
enterprises. About a third of all SOEs are believed to be inefficient,
incurring aggregate visible losses equivalent to 4% to 5% of GDP. These
losses require not only regular, large infusions of direct subsidies that are
principally responsible for budget deficits, but also directed credit and
other indirect subsidies. China's long-term economic stability and growth
require that they cease to be sheltered from the hard budget constraints and
be forced to face, or exit, a competitive market environment. Official
government sanction has already been given to some initial measures for SOE
restructuring, going beyond corporatization and marketization, that include
leasing or sale of state assets to non-state investors, mergers and, on an
experimental basis, bankruptcy.



- 2 -
4..       The scope and pace of SOE and COE restructuring, however, has been
limited thus far largely becausz of concern over the potential social impact
of reforms on the over 100 million SOE and COE workers who, under the existing
systems, depend on employers for virtually fr:e housing. They also depend on
unfunded and non-transferable pension rights and health insurance tied with
their employment. The in-kind benefit system limits the o?tions not only for
restructuring of inefficient enterprises but also for management of well-
performing ones as well, The lumpy costs of housing and social security
obligations constrain employment expansion by growing firms, and entry by new
businesses - severely restricting labor mobility. Reform in the housing and
social security sectors is thus a corollary to urban enterprise and labor
systems reform.
5.        Considerations of efficiency and equity in housing and social
security provision also argue for changes in the existing system. The lack of
consumer budget constraints and consumer choice has helped raise quantitacive
standards and overall expenditurcs for housing ana health care to
unsustainably high levels, while liniiting the number of those who benefit and
limiting the choices for those who do. The system allows few alternative
means of obtaining housing and social services when employers fail to provide
them. Severe distortions on the demand side far outweigh any remaining
inefficiencies on the supply side which, as a result of the recent reforms,
functions similar to the market economy counterparts. tiousing developers and,
to some extent, health care providers pay market prices for most input
factors, and compete aggressively for profit, responding to whatever
incentives generated by the demand system. The major supply-side constraint
that does remain relaces to the lack of market-oriented housing finance.
6.        Reform Strategies.  Although the Government policy for housing
reform has existed in its current form for at least six years, progress has
been slow and considerable debate continues on the best way to proceed. The
policy endorses the goal of full commercialization of housing - transformation
of the current housing delivery system into a market-based one. This goal,
however, is to be reached through gradual increases in rents while continuing
to depend on enterprises, forced savings, and discounted sales of housing to
bridge the gap between the rent and cost. This strategy has not only failed
to reach even its modest targets but also continued and reinforced the tie
between job and housing. According to the tradition of encouraging
experiments in order to find alternatives to current practices, the Government
has requested Bank Group assistance in designing and testing an alternative
strategy for housing reform.
7.        The strategy proposed for implementation under the project calls
for a model for a bolder transition, for enterprises to divest their housing
stock and responsibility, converting in-kind housing benefits into cash wages,
and for for-profit companies to charge housing rents and sale prices at levels
covering at least the full cost. The model contains most of the essential
building blocks for a market-based housing system, including:
(a) Autonomous for-profit companies specializing in housing delivery to
consumers. These would take over housing stock currently owned and
operated by enterprises;



- 3 -
(b)  Comnercially viable housing rents (about 20-3() t-imes current
aveiages) and sales prices that would rerover the lo0ng-run marginal
cost of housing;
(c)  Cash wage supplements that would compensate for rent incereases;
(d)  Market-oriented housinig finance that would mnobilize marke; res.our-
ces and provide long-term mortgpage  loans for owner-occupied andl
rental housing; and
(e)  A policy and regulatory framexork that would allow sustainable
operation of the housing management and finance inst i tutioiur.
8.        ln contrast to housing reform, a general consensus exists on the
strategy of reform for pensions, unemployment insurance and health insurance.
Government policy promotes pooling of pensions within a jurisdiction with
individual contributions, and encourages experiments with similar measures for
unemployment and health insurance. These steps address key problems of the
present system, including the vulnerability of the social safetv net due to
the mismatch between resources and burdens. The policy, howevTer, provides
little beyond general directions, lacking specific time-bound targets or
institutional arrangements for managing the new system without depending on of
enterprises. The proposed project would support accelerated implementation of
specific reform steps and development of necessary institutions.
9.        Rationale for Bank Group involvement.  The proposed project is
consiscent with the Country Assistance Strategy (GAS), discussed at the Board
on August 3, 1993. That strategy is to facilitate China's transition to a
market economy while safeguarding the social safety net and the environment.
The project was identified in the GAS as a key element of the Bank Group's
assistance focus to help establish an enabling environmenc for enterprise
reform. Projects for economic law, financial sector, and labor market
reforms, among others, are also being considered for Bank Group assistance.
10.       The new systems to be established under the project would ease a
critical obstacle to urban labor and enterprise systems reform, while also
increasing the efficiency and sustainability of the housing and social
security systems, which represent a large and increasing part of the national
economy. The project would establish basic frameworks that provide for
increased private investment in housing, growth of small and private
enterprises due to reduced entry costs, and further development of the social
security system. Bank Group assistance would be critical, first, in bridging
the funding gap during the transition from a housing finance system dependent
on enterprises and forced savings to one based on market resources, and,
second, in bringing its experience in China's reform process and in policy and
inistitutional development elsewhere to the task of integrating all essc tial
elements of the necessary frameworks.
11.       Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Operations.  The design of
the project has benefitted from findings in a range of Bank Group sector
studies (on China's industrial policies, the social security system, the urban
housing system, and the urban employment and wage system) as well as
experience gained in implementing projects to support industrial investmenit
and enterprise reform, either in subsector or municipal contexts. These



- /4 -
activities, coupled with policv and institutional development experiences
elsewhere, have demonstrated the need for a broad-hased operation to introduce
a wide range of essential reform elements, integrating enterprise management
reforms wi.h efforts to tackle conistraints in the enabling ernvironment.  The
proposed project, by combining actions acros sector boundaries, aims at
establishing a platform for enterprise, hotising and socia  secin ity systems
development.
12.       Lessons have also been drawn from housing, institutionial develop-
ment, and sectoral adjustment operations worldwide.  'The lBank's Hotising Policy
Paper (1992) has 1highlighted the contribution of incorrect pricing of housing
and housing loans to fiscal deficits and macroeconomic instabilitv in many
countries.  The Policy Paper advocates operations involving nioi-traditional
instruments to address broad sector and institutional issues. At the same
time, institutional development and sectoral adjustment operations suggest
that interlinked reforms must be carried out in a carefull sequence of steps,
with strong borrower involvement and technical assistance programs, and
buttressed by Asible benefits at an early stage of implementation.  The
proposed project incorporate elements reflecting these lessons.
13.       Proiect Objectives.  The project will support the implementation of
a strategy to develop a market-based housing system and a robust social
security system which would free enterprises of these responsibilities and
thus help promote labor mobility, enterprise restructuring and management
improvement. Once tested and further developed in four cities, the strategy
could be replicated in othei cities in China.
14.       Project DescriRtion.  The project will help implement policy reform
action plans embodying the reform strategy, descriDed in paras 7 and 8 above,
in four cities: Beijing, Chengdu, Ningbo, and Yantai. All four cities have
reformist agenda and provide a representative sample in terms of size and
location: Beijing has about 6 million permanent urban residents, Chengdu 3
million, Ningbo 600,000, and Yantai 450,000. The progress and impact of the
project would be monitored and evaluatecd during project implementation, with a
view to making mia-course corrections if needed and to disseminating the
strategy elsewhere in China. The project components are described below.
15.       Housing Reform.  In each city, at least one joint-stock Housing
Management Company (HMC) has been established by participating enterprises
that contributed their housing as equity. HMCs will rent and sell existing as
well as newly acquired housing at rents and prices that would be maintained at
levels high enough to recover all current and investment costs and allow for a
margin of profit. Freed of obligations to provide and maintain housing
virtually for free, and partly drawing on dividends paid by the HMCs. the
participating enterprises will provide active and retired workers with cash
wage (and pension) supplements, corresponding to average rent increases and
rationalizing the wage scales.  The HMCs' initial clientele will largely be
limited, by the scope of wage adjustment, to employees of its shareholders,
but will later expand to the public at large. Over the life of the project,
at least 24 HMCs will be established, involving enterprises that employ about
1.7 million workers. These HMCs will manage and provide about 22 million
square meters of housing, or close to half a million apartment units,
representing about 20% of the total urban housing stock in Beliing and
Chengdu, 70% in Ningbo, and virtually all housing in Yantai. fo help secure



Cr
the rights of HMCs, tenants, and lenders, regulations and cnforcement
mechanisms (housing and land leases, property registrationi, condominium
management, foreclosure and eviction) have been established or strengthened.
Technical assistance and training (TA) will be carried out for further
institutional development of HMCs and concerned municipal agencies at an
estimated cost of about $5.4 million.
16.       Housing Finance.  About $325 million of the Bank Group financing
will be used to help establish a sustainable housing finance system and to
.fill the expected funding gap during the transition from directed credit to
market-based resource mobilization. It will finance an average of 50% of
eligible mortgage loans made by participating financial intermediaries (PFIs)
to HMCs for construction and acquisition of new rental housing and to
individuals for new housing purchase. Both types of loan will have a maturity
of 20 years and carry a variable interest rate at least 1% above the 3-year
investment loan rate available from local commercial banks. Two PFIs in each
city will compete to mobilize market funds and provide the mortgage loans.
They would be the Industry and Commerce Bank of China (ICBC) and the People's
Construction Bank of China (PCBC), two of China's largest commercial banks,
and the Yantai Housing Savings Bank. About $2.5 million will be provided for
TA for development of housing finance operations and policy.
17.       Social Security Reform.  Each of the project municipalities has
committed to a time-bound action plan to broaden and consolidate retirement
pension pools across all enterprises in the city, to establish similar pools
for unemployment insurance and health insurance, as well as to revise benefit,
contribution, and funding arrangements for these services. Project-financed
technical assistance would support the implementation of the action plan,
through policy studies and development of municipal institutions that will
take over from enterprises the task of managing the services. To develop a
national policy framework consistent with the municipal reform efforts, the
Government would, in a joint effort among the Ministries of Labor, Public
Health, and Finance, and State Planning Commission and Systems Reform
Commission: (a) develop basic social security and health care information
systems; (b) monitor and disseminate policy analysis and reform experiences in
the project cities; and (c) develop and revise details of national guidelines
for pension, work injury insurance, unemployment insurance, and health
insurance reforms. The project would finance TA for these purposes, about
$15.5 million for municipal labor and health bureaus and $1.5 million for the
central authorities.
18.       The project cost is estimated at $950 million equivalent, with a
foreign exchange component of $342 million equivalent. The Bank Group would
provide a loan of $275 million equivalent and a credit of SDR 53.1 million
($75 million equivalent) for about 37% of the total. In order to provide
support for reform actions that began in the middle of 1993, payments made
between October 25, 1993 and the date of loan/credit signing, for eligible TA
expenditures and housing mortgage loans would be retroactively financed, up to
10% of the loan/credit, or US$35 million equivalent. A breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in the People's Republic of China are given in Schedules



- 6 -
C and D, respectively.  A map is also attached.  Tihe Staff Appraisal Report,
No. 12757-CIIA dated June 10, 1994, is being distributed separately.
19.       Project ImplemenLatiLon.  The project's housing mortgage loan
component, associated reform z'ctions, and TA would be carried out- by PFls,
-IMCs, (and their sharcholdcers). 'Ihe social security reform actions and
associated TA programs will be carried out by the responsible municipal and
central government agencies.  Municipal goverrnments would play a majol
additional role in their capacity as provider of the enabling framework and
also as owners of many of thme IIMC share-holding enterprises. ln order to lead
and coordiniate the policy reforms, each of the municipalities has established
a Project Leading Group chaired by a Vice Mayor and including senior managers
of relevant municipal gov'ertiment units, PFls, and People's Bank of China (PBC)
branches.  To support the Leading Group and to carry out day-to-day
coordination of project implementation, each municipality has established a
Project Maniagement Office (PMO).  To provide national-level policy support for
the project and to monitor, evaluate and disseminate the reform experiences of
the proiect cities, the Government has established a Central Coordinating
Group (CCG) including representatives of, among othiers, the centr&l governm2nt
authorities listed in para 17 above and of ICBC, PCBC, and PBC.
20.       Each municipal government would retain part of the loan and credit
proceeds to finance expenditures on TA for social securitv systems and housir.g
market development. The rest of the proceeds wovld be made available to
participating PFIs, on a first-come, first-served basis, to finance part of
their eligible housing mortgage loans and for the PFIs' TA. The funds would
be made available for 20 years including 5 years' grace, under two options.
Under the first option, the municipality will bear the foreign exchange risk
and provide local currency at a variable rate at least 1.0% greater than the
two-year fixed-term deposit rate, published by PBC. Under the second option,
the municipality would on-lend foreign currency, passing on the foreign
exchange risk to the PFIs and charging a rate at least 0.5% higher than the
rate charged by the Central Government to the municipal governriments (para 1).
The second option would be adopted, as an experiment, by both PFIs in Yantai.
21.       Project Sustainability.  The project's major intended benefit would
be increased sustainability of housing, social security, and enterprise
systems. Expanded pooling, institution of beneficiary contributions, and
other measures would protect the social safety net independent of the
performance of individual enterprises, while restraining the unchecked growth
of welfare costs.  The new housing pricing and financing systems will allow
housing provision without fiscal or financial subsidies. The legal framework
has been and would further be strengtlhened to safeguard sustainable operation
of the new systems. The institutional framework thus created would provide an
environment enabling private housing investment and a core around which social
security and health care management can be further developed.
22.       Agreed Actions.  The following actions were completed prior to
negotiations: (a) incorporation of at least one HMC in each city with its
charter and staffing satisfactory to the Bank Group; (b) transfer to HMCs of
enterprise housing stock, amounting to 8 - 20% of total planned to be
transferred during the project, to the HMCs, with proper titles adequate for
mortgages; (c) adjustment of rents of the transferred housing units and of
wages of the affected employees to levels satisfactory to the Bank Group; and



- 7 -
(d) formal adoption of municipal regulations, satislactor,y to thle Baink Croup,
relating to condominium, eviction and foreclosure
23.       At negotiations, agreements were reached to: (a' man t ain thlie CCC,
Leading Groups and PMOs with satisfactory functions and stciairig; (b) carry
olut housing and social security systems reforms, including associated
technical assistance and traiLing accordinp,g to t.ime-bound(l aCtion pl ans

policies and plans satisfactory to the Bank Group, including a debt service
ratio above 1.5, and (g) carry out monitoring and evaluation of the project
and relevant developmenits according to a plan and schledule satisfactory to the
Bank Group.  Conclusion of relending agreements between each municipality and
two PFIs, incorporating the terms listed in (d), (e), and (f) above, will be
mrade a condition of disbursement of mortgage loans under Lhat- municipalitV's.
part of the project.
24.       Environmental Aspects.  The project is rated "B" for env:ironmental
assessment purposes.  As a condition of lending for new housing developments,
PFIs will require submission of environmental impact assessment and
resettlement plans which comply with local regulations that have been examined
and found acceptable to the Bank Group. Further, plans to resettle 200 or
more persons will be subject to the Bank Group's prior review and approval.
25.       Project Benefits.  The models to be tested under the project would
help increase economic efficiency in the areas of housing and social security
and, more importantly, in the broader labor, enterprise and financial systems.
Efficiency of housing and social security services delivery would be enhanced
by the transfer of responsibilities from enterprises to specialized
institutions, which would be strengthened under the project. Major efficiency
and welfare gains will result as consumers exercise the expanded choice in
housing and health care within clear budget constraints and facing rational
pricing of housing and health care.  Th'se would also help rationalize
household budget allocations as well as reduce burden on enterprises and the
government. These in turn could lead to increased savings, which, along with
long-term mortgage lending, are expected to add stability and depth to the
financial sector.
26.       The new system of labor benefits to be develop-nd under the project
are critical for China's continued economic development, by easing constraints
to labor market and enterprise refofmi. The conversion of in-kind benefits
into cash wages would allow enterprises increased flexibility to add or reduce
employment, to use the compensation system for labor management, and to
allocate investment resources. The new free-standing housing aind social.
security systems would ease entry and exit of enterprises and increase labor
mobility. The increased flexibility and more transparent accounting of
enterprise performance and liabilities allowed by the new systems would help
clear paths to enterprise restructuring. Dissemination of prcject lessons and

2/.       RIisks . The pri0oject, witli its aim of developing and Inanaginrg a wide
variety of new ilistitutJonls alld practices, poses an fo   a Icf o  I cha II e(nge. The
novelty of the systems beinlg estabilished brings with it inajor teclhnical
cna Il enge s.  Extens ive expert ass istance iTn inSt itiuioional, legal, policy and
technical matters has therefore been provided during project. preparation and
would continue during implementation, although di fficulties are ];kely to be
overcome on]y gradually.  Beyonid technical and administrative challenges,
little risk is foreseen in its support for social security reform, since the
measures proposed arc consistent with and complenmentary to the Government's
own, wel 1 - a3ccept ed ref orm programs,
28.       In contrast, the project's housinig systemii reforms face s.gnificant
risk because, while sharing the general goal of establishing a market-based
housing syst-em, th-ey introduce bolder, more comprehensivc changes than have
thus far been attempted under the Government policy. .n view of the pol.itical
challenges involved, the project cities have been selected primarily on the
b)asis of the murnicipal leaders' demonstrated understanding of tho reform model
and willingness to undertake the necessary steps. Their will and capacity to
reform have been demonstrated by the completion of critical and difficult
reform steps, including wage and rent adjustments, before negotiations (para.
22)
29.       Adjusting rent and wage levels to keep abreast of cost and market
conditions, and extending the reforms to increasing numbers of enterprises
will present continued financial and political challenges. The mortgage
lending criteria agreed for the project would allow the mortgage lending to
continue only if these reform actions are sustained.  Managing these tasks
will require public education, political commitment and continued economic
liberalization and enterprise restructuring -- most of which are difficult to
predict or influence. To help manage this piocess, the project includes
systematic and intensive monitcring and evaluation of progress as well as a
mid-term review to allow adjustment where necessary.
30.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and
credit.
