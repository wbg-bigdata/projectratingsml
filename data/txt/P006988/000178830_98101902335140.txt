INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
TO FINANCE URGENT IMPORT REQUIREMENTS
FOR HURRICANE RECONSTRUCTION
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan equivalent to US$25 million to the Dominican Republic to finance urgent
import requirements for hurricane reconstruction. The loan would have a term
of 17 years including a grace period of 4 years. It would bear an annual
interest rate of 7.95 percent. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic
would be the agent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report, "Current Economic Memorandum on the
Dominican Republic", (Report No. 2492-DO) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 11, 1979. Relevant social and economic data are presented in
Annex I. This section describes recent economic trends prior to the onslaught
of hurricanes David and Frederick in August/September 1979. Part III analyzes
the economic impact of the hurricanes.
3.        During 1968-74, the Dominican economy experienced an unprecedented
average annual increase in GDP of 10.5 percent. In 1974-1977, however,
economic growth slowed to only 5.3 percent per year. In 1978, preliminary
estimates indicate a further decline to 3.6 percent, while in 1979 growth
may be negative because of the hurricanes.
4.         Economic growth during 1968-74 was led by exports of sugar, minerals,
and tourism and by a high level of both private and public investment.      During
that period, the Dominican Republic was able to increase substantially the
volume of sugar exports, start the exploitation of ferronickel deposits,
undertake vigorous industrial expansion (mostly in import substitution indus-
tries), and establish itself in the Caribbean tourism market. The main
reasons for slower growth in recent years were poor agricultural perfonnance,
partly as a result of droughts in 1975 and 1977, increases in petroleum prices
since 1974, the drop in sugar prices after 1975, and--more recently--the
depressed world market for ferronickel and bauxite. Manufacturing, oriented
mainly to the domestic market and heavily dependent on imported intermediate
and capital goods, had been particularly affected by the slow growth of the
economy and by slhortages of electricity. Industrial expansion during 1975-78
averaged 4.7 percent per year, compared with the 1968-74 average rate of 13.7
percent.
5.        The country's balance of payments, like that of most energy imporL-
ing, primary products exporting countries, deteriorated in the latter part of
this decade.   Between 1973 and 1978, the cost of petroleum imports in relation
to the value of sugar exports increased from 24 percent to 92 percent and is
expected to reach 109 percent in 1979.    In 1974 the cost 6f petroleumn imports
increased by over US$100 million and was largely responsible for the deficit



- 2 -
in the balance of payments in that year. Steep increases in the price of
sugar created a surplus in 1975; but since then, sugar prices hlave tallen, the
demand for ferronickel and bauxite has been weak, and the production of coffee
and cocoa has stagnated, with the result that the deficit- on current account
has widened. The balance of payments has also become sensitive to flows of
capital from private sources; which in turn reflect the perception abroad of
factors affecting risk and uncertainty in the Dominican economy. Because of -a
de facto dual exchange rate system and the openness of the economy, the
weakness in the balance of payments is partly reflected in the 20 percent
premium at which the U.S. dollar trades in the parallel market. There was an
unprecedented overall balance-of-payments deficit of US$95 million irl 1978,
reflecting an estimated increase in the current accoun' (leficit from US$2' .4
million in 1977 to US$377 million in 1978 due to a continued (lecine in stugar
prices, a drop in coffee and cocoa prices, a substanti-lL reduction of the
volume of coffee and ferronickel exports; and a decline in net capital i.fLows.
Because of the massive increase in petroleum prices, the curr-ent accouLnt
deficit in 1979 was expected to reach US$480 million before thle hurlricanes.
6.        Inflation, which was minimal during the 1960s, accelerated in the
1970s. The average annual increase in the Santo Dominlgo consumer price
index during 1971-77 amounted to 11.8 percent.  This same index indicates a
reduction in the rate of inflation during 1978 to 3.5 percent, refLecting
a fall in food prices following the recovery of domestic food production fron
the effects of drought in preceding years, and stable housing costs. These
categories account for almost two thirds of the weight in the index, and have
been the sources of upward  pressure on prices during most of Lhe dfcrade.
Recent increases in gasoline prices, electricity rates, and wages, have
generated more upward pressure on prices during 1979.
7.        Past fiscal policy was cautious.  In 1968-7i, current budget
surpluses averaged 6 percent of GDP (varying between 3 percent in 1968 andi
10 percent in 1975) and financed, on average, 98.5 percent of Lhe Ce;ltr;l
Government's capital expenditures.  Although the Government's long-term
savings performance was impressive, it was achieved at the expense of Low
growth of current expenditures, especially wages and salaries. During 1968-77,
the average annual growth of recurrent expenditures was about 1.6 perceent in
real terms, and average real salaries of government employees dropped consider-
ably. This austerity limited the Government's ability to operate and maintain
the country's economic and social infrastructure as well as to attract and
retain capable personnel in government service.
8.        In 1978, the fiscal situation deteriorated, with an overall Central
Government deficit estimated at RD$114.5 million, mainly as a result of a
lower current surplus of RD$175 million, compared with RD$278.4 million in
1977. The reduction in the current surplus was attributable to wage increases
granted to public employees, to a reduction of about RD$40 million in revenues
due to lower value of sugar exports, the temporary suspensioni of export taxeXs
on cocoa and coffee, and subsequent reduction by 50 percent of export taxes
on coffee.



- 3 -
9.        The Governlment which took office in August 1978 proposes to adopt
measures to strengthen thie balance of payments and public sector finances,
stimulate export growth and reduce price distortions unfavorable to agricul-
ture and employment creation. Althouglh a comprehensive package of economic
measures has not yet reached the stage of implementation, it is clear that the
Government has recognized the need for appropriate adjustments in policy.      It
has resisted pressure to launch an ad hoc public works program to palliate the
country's acute unemployment problem.    The Government has recently secured thie
approval by Congress of an Export Promotion Law - providing tax incentives to
exports, and allowing those engaged in non-traditional export activities to
sell their foreign exchange earnings in the parallel market, which usually
trades at a premium over the official exchange rate. The Congress is also
considering legislation providing special incentives for agro-industry. The
Government is seeking to strengthen the fiscal situation by channelling the
plethora of earmarked taxes and special funds, which formerly put a large part
of public sector resources beyond the allocation decisions of the annual
budget, into a single consolidated fund and by improving administration of
income taxes and customs duties.    Taxes on liquor and cigarettes were increased
earlier this year, while the tax on gasoline was increased when the prices of
petroleum products were adjusted to reflect the rise in crude oil prices
toward the end of June.   It is expected that draft tax legislation including
value added and sales taxes, and modifications in the real estate tax, will
shortly be put before Congress. Also, measures are being taken to strengthen
the autonomous agencies such as the electricity company, for which an increase
in rates was approved earlier this year, and the sugar corporation, which was
relieved of the burden of a cross subsidy to the electricity company. The
Government's ability to secure approval by Congress of the draft tax legisla-
tion will be critical to its success in improving public sector finances. Its
willingness to apply the Export Promotion Law in a flexible manner, and to
adopt an appropriate monetary program - as soon as the hurricane emergency
permits - will be critical to its efforts to diversify exports and strengtlhen
the balance-of-payments.
10.       Creditworthiness has recently become of some concern.     The large
balance-of-payments' deficit in 1978 resulted in the depletion of the coun-
try's already low net reserves. The level of gross reserves fell to less
thani the equivalent of two months of imports, and the prospect is for further
reserve loss in 1979.   Arrears in current payments, a periodic phenomenon in
the Dominican Republic, are increasing once more. While the Administration
is aware of these problems, its ability to implement appropriate corrective
measures has suffered from legislative delays.     These considerations adversely
affect the country's ability to obtain financing from commercial sources even
thouglh the level of the public external debt in relation to GDP -- 15.3
percent at the end of 1978 -- and the ratio of public external debt service
.to exports -- 10.2 percent in 1978 -- are not high in comparison to other
developing countries. The impact of the hurricanes (discussed in detail
below) will add only one-half percentage point to the debt ratio which was
expected to rise to 18 percent in 1979 because of bunched repayment obligations,
before declining to 15 percent in 1980. The country's future borrowing
requirements, however, will be quite large, and will necessitate both conces-
sionary and non-official funds. The Government has indicated that it will



- 4 -
implement the needed economic measures while addressing the country's social
problems. Because of limited export prospects, the recent petroleum price
increase, and the additional economic constraints resulting from hurricane
damages, there will obviously be difficulties in harmonizing these goals. As
we continue the dialogue on economic policy, we will be monitoring closely tlhe
Government's response to the challenges it faces.    We consider that the
Dominican Republic will continue to be creditworthy for Bank lending provided
the Government expeditiously implements policy measures which have recently
been approved by its Congress and others which it is now preparing.
PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
II.       The Bank Group began operations in the Dominican Republic in 1969.
Except for an enclave mining project, lending to the Dominican Republic was
on IDA terms prior to FY1975. Since then lending has been on Bank tenns,
including two Third Window operations. Two loans, for a tourism infrastruc-
ture project and a second education project, were approved in FY1975 and two
loans, both on Tlhird Window terms, for highway rehabilitation and maintenance
and population and family health, were approved in FY1977. Two loanis, for
irrigation (Nizao Irrigation Project) and tourism (Second Puerto Plata TouL-ism
Project), were approved in FY1979, and a sugar rehabilitation project was
approved in the first quarter of FY1980. Total Bank loans and IDA credits
outstanding amount to US$135.1 million, of wlhich US$88.7 million are undis-
bursed. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group loans and
credits as of October 31, 1979 and notes on the progress of ongoing projects.
12.       IFC has financed two operations in the Dominican Republic, an
investment in a cement plant approved in 1974, and a line of credit [or
sinall and medium scale industry approved in 1978. Other projects are under
consideration by IFC.
13.       In the absence of adequate project preparation and of clear invest-
ment priorities, the Dominican Republic did not in the past make full use of
official long-term external assistance. Total lending of this type amounted
to US$335 million during 1970-77. The present Government has recently
approved a three-year public investment program which is expected to permit all
increase of long term funding from external development agencies. Assistance
from IDB has included agriculture (credit programs and irrigation); power (two
multipurpose hydroelectric projects and rural electrification); water supply
anid sewerage; and higher education.  U.S. long-term assistance consisted
mainly of food (PL480) and loans for agriculture, health and education.
Long-tenn assistance from IDB for the next three years is expected to includle
agriculture (with a major emphasis on agrarian settlement programs anld credit),
potable water, irrigation and power.   AID assistance would concentrate on
agricultural credit, integrated rural development and rural road maintenanllcté.
14.       Bank Group lending to the Dominican Republic has aimed at strength-
ening the balance of payments; improving social services available to the
lower income groups, particularly in rural areas; improving agricultural



- 5 -
production and Land distribution; and strengthening institutions responsible
for major economic sectors.   We have in the aftermath of hurricanes David
and Frederick reviewed Bank lending operations in the light of urgent recon-
struction requirements. This project and an emergency road reconstruction
project, also before the Executive Directors, comprise an immediate lBank contri-
bution to the reconstruction effort. A second road maintenance reconstruction
project which is part of the Government's long term highway rehabilitation
program, has been submitted to the Executive Directors. Other projects under
consideration are an industrial credit operation, a coffee and cocoa rehabili-
tation program and a low income housing project with emphasis on the provision
of sites and services.
15.       The Bank Group's share in the Dominican Republic's external public
debt outstanding and disbursed was estimated at 5.5 percent at the end of
1978. The Bank Group's share of external public debt service in 1978 was
5 percent. Its share of outstanding public external debt would rise to
about 12 percent by 1985, while its share of external public debt service
would increase to about 6 percent.
PART III - THE HURRICANES
16.       On August 31, Hurricane David, with winds of 150 miles per hour,
smashed into the southerni coast just west of Santo Domingo and crossed the
western section of the country to Monte Cristi, on the north coast just east
of the border with Haiti. On September 2, Frederick followed the same path
bringing less wind but deluging most of the country with torrential rains for
four days and causing extensive flooding of low lying plains and in the
fertile Cibao Valley, and landslides in many areas.
17.       The death toll has been set at over 2,000, with the majority of
deaths being attributed to drowning. Greater loss of life was avoided by
moving people, prior to the hurricanes, from squatter settlements in low
lying areas into schools, churches and public buildings offering more substan-
tial shelter.   An estimated 100,000 people are now living precariously in
refugee centers.   Over one million people were still receiving emergency
assistance in October.
18.       Damage to property has been extensive.     Some 2,400 km of roadway
and 58 bridges were destroyed. In the power sector, one hydroelectric
station was destroyed and generating facilities were flooded at two other
dams, while heavy damage was done to the transmission and distribution
network in the southwest. In the industrial sector, damages include the
complete de-roofing of factories in the Haina industrial area and partial
de-roofing of the Herrera industrial estate in Santo Domingo. Damage to
housing is only partially reflected in the total destruction of over 20,000
uniits.
19.       The economic impact of the disaster derives in part from the direct
loss of current production due to the destruction of crops and livestock, time
damage to goods in warelhouses, and the interruption of services, notably in



- 6 -
the public utilities, distribution and transportation sectors. In addition,
there will be an impact on future production due to impairment of productive
capacity which will take time to be restored. This is likely to be significant
in the case of permanent tree crops and forests, livestock, and electricity.
The latter suffered loss of one-fifth of its generation capacity.
20.       Current estimates suggest a production loss of some RD$350-400 million
in 1979, which will have the effect of converting an expected 4 to 5 percent
positive growth in GDP into a negative growth of about 3 percent. While there
should be a substantial recovery in 1980, production losses in 1980 attribut-
able to the hurricanes could be as much as RD$130 million (in 1979 prices)
or 2 percent of GDP.
21.       Economic growth is very likely to be reduced over the medium term,
not only because the repair of damage to assets will take time, but also
because the cost of repair and replacement will require the diversion of
investment from uses which would have created a net addition to productive
capacity. The degree of investment diversion will depend on the extent
to which additional foreign resources become available.
22.       The Dominican Republic is likely to suffer further deterioration
in the goods and services account in the balance of payments. Coffee suffered
extensive damage to the current crop with losses estimated at 25-30 percent
and of about US$40 million in export earnings. In sugar, the production loss
has been put at around 125,000 tons with an export value of US$30 million.
Cocoa export earnings could be down by US$20 million. Earnings from non-
traditional exports will be reduced due to damage to factories and
infrastructure.
23.       The impact of these losses will not be limited to 1979, since not all
the lost production would have been exported before December 31. In 1979,
exports of goods and services will be reduced by US$35 million. An increase
in imports will be required because of production loss for domestic consumption,
damage to inventories of inputs, and to buildings and equipment. The goods
and non-factor services account in 1979 is expected to deteriorate by US$60
million, but the deterioration could be larger if reconstruction efforts gain
momentum. For 1980, an increase in the goods and non-factor services deficit
of about US$120 million can be expected because of hurricane damages.

24.       Assuming an increase of US$60 million in current transfers due
to greater assistance from Dominicans residing abroad, to settlement of re-
insurance claims and to emergency aid, the outlook is for the 1979 current
account deficit to remain at the pre-hurricane projection of around US$480
million. In the capital account, the main changes attributable to the hurri-
canes are inflows of reconstruction loans and reduced disbursement of
previously arranged project loans. Although emergency reconstruction loans
of almost US$300 million are expected to be committed, disbursements during
1979 are not expected to be much above US$50 million.



- 8 -
25.        The basic balance of payments in 1979 is likely to deteriorate by
more than US$30 million when compared with pre-hurricane estimates. Drawings
of US$75 million (net) from the IMF will help to cushion the impact on gross
reserves, but unless payments can be reduced, deferred or additional resources
borrowed, the country's gross reserves will be seriously depleted. Reduction
of the overall deficit by curtailing imports is not feasible for 1979. Prior
to the hurricanes, an overall import increase of 16 percent over the 1978
level had been estimated, of which 14 percent was due to an expected increase
in import prices and 2 percent to increase in real imports. Given the damage
to local crops and the need for imported reconstruction materials, import
reduction seems unlikely and indeed undesirable. In 1979 increased imports
of US$20 million due to the hurricane are likely, while in 1980, the level of
imports is projected to increase by an additional US$368 million due partly to
higher prices and to the inflows of reconstruction imports. The latter will
partly be financed by the disbursement of about US$190 million of special
hurricane reconstruction loans, including this and en emergency road reconstruc-
tion loan. Assuming a substantial recovery in exports, additional transfers
and heavy disbursement of special loans, the overall balance of payments could
improve over former expectations, but a gap of US$119 million is likely to
remain. This would not be sustainable without additional financing, since by
then gross reserves may be approaching depletion. The authorities are consider-
ing an expansion of the list of imports not eligible for official foreign
exchange to dampen import demand. Nevertheless, additional financing over and
above that presently expected will still likely be needed, and is expected to
come mainly from commercial and bilateral sources. This clearly indicates the
need for fundamental adjustments to balance of payments weaknesses that were
already evident before the hurricanes and that have now been further aggravated.
26.       As a result of the loss in production in general and especially in
coffee and cocoa, and also the likely change in the level and structure of
trade, current revenues of Government in 1979 are expected to decline by RD$25
million, or 4 percent of budgeted collections. Without the expected increase
in revenue from imports and from recently introduced higher taxation of
gasoline, this reduction would be greater. The fiscal situation will still be
quite tight; pre-hurricane projections pointed to a decline in the current
fiscal savings of the Central Government from RD$175 million in 1978 to RD$59
million in 1979 and a concurrent increase in the overall deficit from RD$115
million to RD$188 million. In addition to already programmed capital expen-
ditures, emergency expenditure requirements by Government of over RD$110
million have been identified, part of which will have to be met in 1979.
However, because some planned capital outlays will now be deferred, the
increase in the 1979 deficit will likely be modest. Although there are no
estimates of the fiscal impact of the hurricanes in 1980, the expected slower
growth could mean that a projected current surplus of RD$90 million will not
be realized and that the capital program will continue to be determined by
borrowed foreign resources.    Two implications emerge from this situation.
First, the recently approved three-year public investment program may need
to be reduced. Second, measures are required to improve the rate of absorp-
tion of foreign loans in order to expedite disbursement if the Government's
reconstruction efforts are not to be constrained by lack of funds.



-9-
The Reconstruction Program
27.        The total damage to physical assets in both the public and the
private sectors has been estimated at RD$400-500 million. Some of these
assets were covered by insurance and a substantial part of the task of
reconstruction will be left to private initiative. The public sector program
which will address the needs of the destitute and the restoration of public
infrastructure and facilities, is being developed in two stages. The first,
primarily of an emergency nature, provides for the restoration of essential
services and domestic food production capability; the second will involve the
adjustment of the recently completed three-year, public sector investment-,
program in order to achieve a blend of replacement and improvement objectives
and adjustments to changes in resource availability. The first phase emergency
reconstruction program is expected to be 40 percent completed in 1979 and will
continue until the end of 1980. It will cost around RD$230 million. The
second stage is under preparation; the following paragraphs refer to the
emergency reconstruction program.
28.        In agriculture, primary emphasis will be on the recovery of produc-
tion of food crops reflected in a program of soil preparation, fertilizer
application and provision of seeds, with the objective of cultivating over
200,000 hectares with maize, red beans, rice, vegetables, cassava, bananas,
and sweet potatoes. This replanting program will be accompanied by the
repair of irrigation ditches, canals, and dams and the cleaning of drainage
ditches in flooded areas. Another program includes the immediate rehabilita-
tion of plantations of coffee, cocoa, and plantains; a more permanent effort
is being considered for the longer term. The rehabilitation of the fishing
industry will involve the construction of 150 boats in new drydock facilities
while RD$60,000 worth of outboard motors will be imported to replace lost or
damaged ones and to outfit the new fishing fleet. Of the total cost of the
agricultural program of around RD$50 million (not including the regular opera-
tional cost of the Ministry of Agriculture) about RD$14 million will be pro-
vided as credit through the state-owned Agricultural Bank.
29.        In the transport sector, the reconstruction of roads and bridges,
ports and wharves is expected to involve an expenditure of RD$52 million, of
which almost RD$11 million to reestablish road communications is consid-
ered urgent. Deterioration of the Dominican road system has been of concern
for some time. The recent disaster, however, has added emphasis to this need
and has pointed out some weaknesses in the system. Among highways, highest
priority has been assigned to the reconstruction of Azua-Barahona, and Cruz de
Guayacanes-Santiago de la Cruz, Sanchez and Duarte. The first two comprise
the proposed Emergency Road Project. The reconstruction of Sanchez and
Duarte, which require minor repairs, is being under taken with local funds.
The ports of Boca Chica, Haina, Santo Domingo, Barahona and Azua are also to
be repaired. This will involve dredging of channels which have been choked by
silt, removal of sunken or damaged vessels, repair of warehousing and cargo
handling equipment, and replacement of navigational aids.
30.        Repairs to the power generation and distribution system were started
immediately after the hurricanes and there has been substantial restoration
of supply on an emergency basis, but with considerably diminished system
reliability. The longer tenn reconstruction program includes the restoration
of the transmission and distribution network at a cost of RD$20 million of



- 10 -
which 90 percent of expenditures will be to purchase mostly imported materials.
Nearly 1,500 km of power lines will be installed in the process. The second
largest expenditure amounting to RD$14 million will be for the repair of hydro-
generation facilities at Valdesia, Tavera and complete replacement at Jimenoa.
The drying out of the first two should be accomplished within 5 months while
Jimenoa will require 30 months for reconstruction. Damages to thermal units
at Haina and Santo Domingo and to diesel units at Constanza and Ocoa will cost
less than RD$3 million and will require about 3 months for completion. The
diesel units are especially required for handling peak loads and their repair
is critical if presently frequent outages are to be avoided in the near
future.
31.       The program for restoring potable water supply calls for the recon-
struction of collapsed entombment and filtration facilities, replacement of
destroyed mains, cleaning of silt blocked pipes and the repair of electrical
pumping facilities. The projected cost of RD$5 million reflects the fact that
a substantial restoration of supply has already been achieved. This figure
includes a provision for the trucking of water to maintain emergency supplies
in some areas.
32.       Given the substantial damage to housing, the large number of people
living in centers of refuge, and the need to release public buildings for
normal use, the provision of alternative shelter is now urgent. While the
reconstruction program in housing is expected to cost some RD$30 million, the
first phase calls for an expenditure of RD$8 million of which RD$6 million will
be spent in rural areas to provide 3,000 temporary tent shelters with sanitary
and cooking facilities at a cost of about RD$150 each, and about 3,000 prefab-
ricated houses costing about RD$1,500 each. Also 5 to 6 thousand houses will
be repaired under this program. In urban areas the initial objective is to
repair about 7,000 units at a total cost of RD$l million and to provide
multi-family structures to accomodate about 2,000 families at an average cost
of RD$500 per family. Another part of the program seeks to address the needs
of the income-earning homeless by providing low cost lots on publicly-owned
lands together with suitable financing to permit the people to re-house
themselves on land not subject to flooding. Some RD$7 million has been
earmarked for repairing school buildings, and about the same amount for repair
of health facilities. The re-development of these services will be carried
out over the longer term, full account being taken of the changing settlement
patterns and geographical distribution of population in the aftermath of
re-housing efforts.
33.       While most industries are assumed to have had adequate insurance,
the rehabilitation of the industrial sector requires that provision be made
for increased credit for replacing inventories, restoring working capital,
and providing a cushion in cases of inadequate coverage. A recuperation
fund amounting to RD$50 million has been established by the Central Bank
within the Investment Fund for Industrial Development to help this sector in
its reconstruction efforts.
34.       These plans, while still tentative and incomplete in some details,
indicate at once the magnitude of the task of reconstruction and the additional
resources which will be required. The managerial and technical capabilities



- 11 -
exist within the country, but the main shortfall will be in the area of
financial, specifically foreign exchange, resources. The following pledges or
proposals of external assistance have been announced; these figures in some
cases including programmed operations that have been advanced as well as net
increases in lending programs.
Multilateral Assistance
IDB              US$100 million
IBRD             US$50 million
Bilateral Assistance
Federal Republic of Germany: D Mark 20 million = about US$11 million
Venezuela    :   US$40 million
U.S.A.I.D.   :   US$15 million
In addition to the multilateral assistance mentioned above drawings amounting
to SDR50.75 million equivalent to US$66 million have been permitted by the IMF
for emergency balance of payments support. The Dominican Republic may also
benefit from a provision of US$1-1/3 million allocated by the European Economic
Community for assistance to countries which have been hit by hurricane David.
This short list does not fully reflect the external resources which may
become available when discussions with other potential donors and lenders
are completed. Neither does it reflect the substantial contribution of an
emergency nature that has been provided by a large group of institutions
and countries, but it does provide a background against which to appreciate
the crucial role of Bank support in financing the reconstruction effort.
PART IV - LOAN DESCRIPTION
35.       The proposed loan is in response to the request for emergency recon-
struction assistance made by the Government of the Dominican Republic to the
Bank in September 1979. A special Bank mission which visited the country
between September 9 and 14, concluded that one of the ways in which the Bank
could best assist the country's reconstruction effort and minimize the adverse
economic impact of the disaster would be to help finance the imports of raw
materials, semi-manufactured and final goods necessary to restore national
production. Negotiations were held in Washington on November 15, 1979. The
Dominican delegation was headed by Mr. Luis A. Garcia Recio, Under-Secretary
of Finance.
Loan Amount and Objectives
36.       The proposed loan would be in an amount of US$25 million, equivalent
to around 7 percent of the value of imports during 1978 in the Brussels
Tariff Nomenclature sections, covering the range of imports required for



- 12 -
reconstruction. From a balance of payments support view, the loan would
provide financing for about one-fifth of the likely increase in the deficit
on goods and services during 1980 when the major impact of the hurricane on
the import bill will be felt. Of the multilateral and bilateral sources of
external finance, only the IMF's facilities amounting to SDR 50 million or
US$66 million and US$20 million from Venezuela would be disbursed by the end
of 1979. About US$40 million of IDB loans will be quick disbursing with
draw down likely during the first half of 1980. These funds can make a
significant contribution to the immediate reconstruction needs and to some
relaxation of the constraints imposed by the reconstruction effort in the
foreign account. The proposed Bank loan would help to fill the foreign
resource gap and would also make available to the Government local currency
for financing reconstruction and development projects in the public sector.
The need for local currency resources must be seen against the projected short-
fall in 1979 of RD$25 million in current revenues and the adverse impact of
slower growth on revenues in 1980.
Disbursement and Procurement Procedures
37.       Disbursement would be made on the basis of evidence of entry of the
goods into the country and of release of foreign exchange by the Central Bank.
Customs warrants and invoices would provide evidence of entry and of classifi-
cation and value of imports while copies of drafts or other agreed instruments
would provide evidence of payment to suppliers. Imports of goods for necessary
reconstruction works and repair of facilities and for aiding recovery of
national production, and falling within the following sections of the Brussels
Tariff Nomenclature which entered the country on or after October 1, 1979,
would be eligible for reimbursement up to a total of US$25 million.
Section   VI   -  Chemical products
VII  -  Manufacture of plastic and rubber, natural and
synthetic
VIII  -  Wood and wood products
XIII  -  Manufactures of stone, gypsum, ceramics and
glass
XV  -  Base metals and manufactures of base metals
XVI  -  Machinery and equipment including electrical
XVIII  -  Transportation and haulage equipment
Urgent reconstruction requirements for roofing materials, glass, paints and
adhesives and for repair to machinery and replacement of parts inventories
fall into the above sections (Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement).
38.       The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic would be the fiscal agent
for the Government, and would be responsible for the coordination of documen-
tation and its submission to the Bank for purposes of the drawdown of the



- 13 -
loan. International competitive bidding procedures would not be practicable.
For items valued over US$100,000, evidence that price quotations were obtained
from three suppliers would be required in respect of public sector imports,
while private sector imports would be made in accordance with normal commercial
practice. Only invoices valued in excess of US$2,000 would be considered for
reimbursement. (Section 2.02(c), and 2.03 of the draft Loan Agreement.)
Audit
39.       The Central Bank would open a special account in the name of the
Government into which proceeds of the loan would be deposited when disbursed
. The foreign exchange would be credited to the reserves of the Central Bank
and an equivalent amount of local currency determined at the official exchange
rate would be credited to the special account. The funds accumulated in this
account would be available as local counterpart financing for development and
reconstruction projects . Transactions in this account would be audited by
the Ministry of Finance. (Sections 3.02, 3.04 and 4.02 of the draft Loan
Agreement).
Benefits
40.       The major benefit expected from the proposed loan is the restoration
of national productive capacity and growth which provision of imports of
essential building materials, repair parts, and replacement of inventories in
support of a wide ranging and grographically dispersed reconstruction effort
would facilitate.
41.       The sooner the emergency reconstruction effort can be completed, the
sooner the Dominican authorities can turn to the formulation of stabilization
policies, the implementation of the medium and longer term economic measures
and the revision of the Three Year Public Investment Program, all of which
are necessary, if the structural weaknesses of the economy are to be effectively
addressed. Meanwhile, the Bank will continue the dialogue with the Government
on these measures which the revised projections for 1980 indicate to be as
urgent as ever.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The Loan Agreement between the Dominican Republic and the Bank, and
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of
the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of
Annex III.



- 14 -
43.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /_
Credit 352 DO    Yaque del Norte Irrigation Project; $13.0 million
Credit of January 17, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The project is designed to increase agricultural production by
providing a modern irrigation and drainage system for 23,000 ha and improved
water supply for 4,500 ha already under irrigation. Also included are
implementation of an agrarian reform program and technical assistance.
The project is two and-a-half years behind schedule, partly
because of delays in recruiting consultants, and partly because Contract I
financed by IDB could not be signed until rights of way were obtained, a
condition in IDB's loan agreement. Project costs are estimated at 90 percent
above appraisal estimates. A crucial problem has involved delays in the
Government's decision to carry out the land acquisition and redistribution
program. The Government has submitted a bill to Congress for its approval,
which would permit the executive branch to establish a maximum property size
for each area irrigated by state systems. Additional funds are needed to
extend the contract of the supervision firm beyond 1980, as INDRHI's capability
to execute the supervision of construction is not adequate. IDB has, in
principle, indicated it would provide financing. It is expected that the
project will be further delayed because of damages to the works caused by the
recent hurricanes. Cost estimates of hurricane damages are $1.3 million.
It is expected that IDB will finance these costs.
Loan 1051 DO     Tourism I Project; $21.0 million loan of November 6, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
The project is designed to provide infrastructure and other faci-
lities for tourism development in Playa Dorada and Playa Grande near Puerto
Plata. Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily, although
completion of some project components is likely to be delayed by about one
year. Construction of the first tourist accommodations (golf villas) at Playa
Dorada has started. Negotiations with other private investors for a hotel in
Playa Grande and an apartment complex in Playa Dorada are under way. Revised
project costs, including provision for price escalation and land acquisition,
amount to $39 million compared to $36 million estimated at appraisal.
/1   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the actions being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses of projects in execution.

Page 4 of 5
Loan 1142-DO      Second Education Project; $8.0 million loan of July 17, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The project finances the construction, furnishing and equipping
of 204 rural community learning centers; 4 agricultural training centers,
3 vocational training centers; equipping of 14 secondary schools, and of
4 vocational training centers; a text book feasibility study, and training.
The project is over two years behind schedule. Construction of vocational
schools is delayed. However, Congress has recently approved legislation
which will permit execution of this component. Construction of primary rural
schools is underway. Acquisition of equipment for secondary schools was
delayed by procurement problems which have now been resolved. The agricultural
training centers have almost been completed.
Loan 1316-DO      Highway Maintenance and Reconstruction; $5.0 million
Loan of August 10, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The project provides a highway maintenance program; reconstruction
of a 19 Km. road and technical assistance.   Technical assistance is being
provided satisfactorily for the nationwide maintenance program. Purchase
of 95 percent of the maintenance equipment has been made. Works on the
reconstruction of the Puente Rio Camu-San Francisco de Macoris road are now
proceeding satisfactorily, after an initial 3 month delay. The project is
expected to be completed in early 1980. A Project Completion Report will be
issued.
Loan 1325-DO      Population and Family Health; $5.0 million loan of
September 16, 1976; Closing Date:   June 30, 1980.
The project provides for the construction of rural health clinics
and one health sub-center in Regions I and II, communications and teaching
equipment, vehicles and operating costs for community based contraception
programs, and technical assistance. Construction of the health sub-center
and ten rural clinics has been completed. Construction of the remaining 16
clinics is underway. Fellowships for nursing students are being provided.
The first group of medical students has been sent to rural areas for two-month
periods of practice. However, the community-based health family program is
progressing slowly. The program was to include the definition of the levels
of medical attention in rural areas, training of the Secretariat of Health
personnel, and preparation of a health manual, plus improvements in the data
system.
Loan 1655-DO     Nizao Irrigation Project:   $27.0 million loan of
February 16, 1979; Closing Date: December 31, 1984
The terminal date of effectiveness has been extended to December 5,
1979 to permit the Government additional time to fulfill conditions of loan
effectiveness. Bank would agree to the reconstruction of 2 km of Marcos A.
Cabral Canal, damaged by hurricanes, under abbreviated bidding procedures.
