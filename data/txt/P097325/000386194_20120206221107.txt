Program            The program development objective for the operation is improved access to,
Development        and greater value for money (VFM) in, public services. The Country
Objective(s) and   Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board in May 2010. The
Contribution to    proposed operation is a core component of the CAS and will contribute to
CAS                strategic objectives two, three and four: enhance public infrastructure;
                   promote human capital development; and support good governance and
                   accountability. It will complement a range of investment lending operations.
Risks and Risk     Overall Macroeconomic Policy Management.
Mitigation         Risk: Deterioration of the macroeconomic policy stance, since future
                   availability of oil resources can weaken the Government‟s commitment to
                   fiscal and monetary prudence. In addition, Uganda is vulnerable to
                   exogenous shocks (e.g. weather, Euro crisis). Mitigation: The Bank and the
                   Fund will continue their close monitoring and policy dialogue with GoU.

                   Fiscal and debt sustainability.
                   Risk: Despite having committed to fiscal adjustment, further pressure could
                   arise from non-anticipated expenditures and growing resistance to ongoing
                   adjustment, such as electricity increases and non-priority spending. There is a
                   risk of possible debt distress related to higher interest rates on government
                   securities, increased quasi-fiscal risks associated with contingent liabilities,
                   and lowered growth dividends from public investments. Mitigation: The
                   Bank is providing technical support to improve public investment planning,
                   implementation and absorption capacity. Furthermore, the PRSC focuses on
                   policies designed to improve expenditure efficiency and Value for Money.

                   Political and governance risk.
                   Risk: The governance environment continues to present significant
                   challenges. Mitigation: Government has prepared the National Development
                   Plan based on broad consultative process. As a result, third party monitoring
                   arrangements are being designed and political economy assessments are
                   underway to inform and guide Bank‟s interventions. The Bank is working
                   with GoU to strengthen institutions and accountability systems.

                   Exogenous risks.
                   Risk: Uganda is vulnerable to exogenous risks such as fluctuating commodity
                   prices, destructive weather patterns, and the possibility of regional conflicts.
                   Mitigation: The Bank is working with GoU to strengthen the agricultural
                   sector with the objective to improve productivity and diversification. In
                   addition, it will work with GoU to improve environmental and natural
                   resource management, disaster preparedness and the quality of public
                   infrastructure investments. Furthermore, the Bank is working to secure
                   alternate access to seaports.

                   Donor coordination.
                   Risk: The PRSC is part of the JBSF which helps donor coordination, but has
                   also led to heightened transactions costs on the donor side and potentially
                   some rigidity in the implementation framework over time. Mitigation: The
                   Bank and its partners are revisiting the coordination structure under the JBSF
                   to be formalized in a MoU between GoU and JBSF Partners in 2012.

             NINTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT (PRSC 9)


                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.     This program document presents a proposed credit to the Republic of Uganda for
SDR 65.2 million or US$100 million equivalent to finance the Ninth Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC 9). It is the second of three development policy operations (DPOs) to
support Uganda‟s National Development Plan (NDP) and covers the period 2012-13. The
proposed PRSC 9 is prepared under the Joint Budget Support Framework (JBSF). The operation
will improve efficiency in four service delivery sectors by addressing common key binding
implementation constraints in public financial management (PFM), public service management
and public administration, in tandem with sector-specific reforms within Health, Education,
Water & Sanitation and Transport.

2.      The PRSC 9 builds upon reforms initiated under the first (PRSC 8) operation of the
series and provides the foundation for further reforms supported under the final operation
of the series (PRSC 10). PRSC 8 (Rep. No 53731-UG) responded to the impact of the global
economic downturn of 2009, which threatened the pace of poverty reduction, by focusing on
efficiency in public spending and value for money to create fiscal space. It included the
availability of additional resources under the Crisis Response Window to help Government of
Uganda (GoU) maintain investment and counteract the global crisis. Major achievements under
PRSC 8 were, among others, advancing performance management in public service delivery,
including performance contracts for head teachers, ensuring more equitable deployment and
retention of health and education sector staff to underserved areas, and strengthening compliance
with public financial management regulations through performance contracts for senior officials.
PRSC 9 will carry forward and build upon these reforms with an aim to further strengthen public
sector performance, focusing on service delivery and the creation of fiscal space for public
investments. PRSC 10, as the final operation of the series, will seek to maintain the momentum
in terms of improved service delivery but will focus especially on public financial management
in view of the oncoming stream of oil revenue.

3.       PRSC 9 focuses on two policy clusters: 1) Reforms in Public Expenditure
Management, Public Financial Management and Public Service Management that Improve
Service Delivery and 2) Value for Money in Public Service Delivery Sectors. Measures
supported by the operation include: improved budget credibility; more transparent and efficient
public financial and sector management, focusing on accountability and improved service
delivery systems at the local government level that should lead to better quality of education and
health services. Further, reform measures designed to raise the country‟s competitiveness and
facilitate economic activity through improved infrastructure are supported within water and
sanitation, especially within Water for Production (WfP), as well as the transport sector, focusing
on improving the condition of Uganda‟s road network. These reforms will predominantly benefit
the poor and lagging areas for which Government is the major provider of social services.

4.      The PRSC series is aligned to the National Development Plan (NDP) and supports
policy reforms within key areas identified by GoU as vital for the structural transformation
of Uganda‘s economy. The NDP represents GoU‟s new development strategy and seeks to
capitalize on previous gains in reducing poverty, achieved under the three preceding Poverty
Eradication Action Plans (PEAPs). This reorientation, which is consistent with the Bank‟s 2007
Country Economic Memorandum, recognizes that Uganda‟s growth record and poverty
reduction cannot be sustained without a transformation of the economy. The objective of the
NDP is therefore to enable a structural transformation of the economy through public
investments in growth-enhancing infrastructure, most notably within roads, electricity, railways
and water for production.

5.      However, undertaking such increased investment spending together with the need to
improve the quality of social service delivery requires an increase in fiscal space. To this
end, the PRSC series has, and will continue to support, GoU in promoting reforms to increase
expenditure efficiency. These reforms emphasize planning and accountability measures such as
output oriented budgeting as well as monitoring and tracking of data on misuse of public funds.
These prioritized reform areas address relative weaknesses in Uganda‟s performance as indicated
by its Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings relative to other IDA
countries1. The Africa Strategy emphasizes that governance is the foundation of development,
and the policies supported under the PRSC are in full alignment with the Africa Strategy by
strengthening governance and economic management. The proposed program aims at assisting
the GoU in achieving effective and accountable management of public investments in
infrastructure and of the projected oil revenue in the near future, which is critical in ensuring
inclusive growth and effective poverty reduction in Uganda.

                          POVERTY, INEQUALITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE INDICATORS

6.      Poverty in Uganda has declined over the last 20 years, although inequality persists. The
poverty headcount fell from 56 percent in 1992 to 24 percent by 2009/10 2, largely driven by the
diversification of household livelihood portfolios due to high growth in non-farm wage jobs and
household enterprises. Concurrently, the recent decline in poverty was also the result of the peace
dividend in the North, which accounted for half the poverty reduction between 2005/06 and 2009/10.
Nevertheless, inequality persists both within and across regions. The Gini coefficient rose from 0.37
in 1992/93 to 0.43 in 2009/10, even though it seems to have stabilized in recent years. At 49 percent,
the poverty headcount rate in the rural North is more than three times that of the rural Central region,
while the North and the East account for two thirds of the poor in 2009/10. The North and the East
also lag behind in access to electricity and secondary school enrollment while the average student –
teacher ratio is at least 70 percent higher in these regions than in the rural Central region. As a result,
the North and East lag behind in human capital endowments, local economic development, and
access to opportunities.

    This is based on the national poverty line of 21000 Uganda shillings per adult equivalent per month in 1997/98 prices. Based on
    the international poverty line of USD 1.25 per day, the poverty headcount rate declined from 70 percent in 1992/93 to 37.7 in
    2009/10.
                                                                  2
7.       The decline in poverty between 2005/06 and 2009/10 occurred during a period of
rising volatility in food prices, suggesting that households managed to cope, but the recent
food crisis in the Horn of Africa has raised their vulnerability. The regional drought has led
to a surge in food prices beyond the typical seasonal fluctuations. Such an event is likely to have
a negative welfare impact on households that depend on market food purchases, - mainly in
urban areas where coping mechanisms are not fully developed, and in the post conflict Northern
region. Households in the poorest and second poorest quintiles, who on average spend a greater
share of their expenditure on market staple food purchases, are the most vulnerable. Since the
negative welfare impact is greatest among those already living in poverty, the net effect of rising
food prices on the poverty headcount is likely to be low, but the depth of poverty could increase
sharply. A recent study indicates that an eventual doubling of food prices in Uganda could
increase the poverty headcount by up to 2.4 percentage points and the depth of poverty by more
than 25 percent, reflecting the high impact on the poorest (World Bank, 2009). Policy
interventions should target these poor and vulnerable households and aim to reduce price
volatility that affects urban workers.

8.    Uganda‘s demographic dynamics will make it more difficult for the local market to
absorb the growing labor force and poses a youth employment challenge for the country.
Uganda has a fertility rate of 6.7, the third highest in the world. The population has doubled since


                                                                       3
1986 and is further expected to double between 2008 and 20353 increasing the supply of labor.
Despite a 12 percent annual growth in the number of non-agriculture wage jobs during the later
part of the past decade, only 20 percent of new labor market entrants could find employment in
non-agriculture wage employment where earnings are on average higher. The other 80 percent
are self employed - the majority in subsistence agriculture where they are underemployed, have
lower income flows and are more likely to end up in poverty. Non-farm household enterprises in
the informal sector have expanded and offered better opportunities than subsistence agriculture,
and will continue to be a significant and valuable source of employment in the medium term.
However, they operate in a difficult environment - facing a regressive local government tax
structure whose reliance on user and licensing fees results in household enterprises paying a
disproportionate share of local taxes. Such environment raises the risk of failure and reduces the
quality of employment in the sector.

9.      Uganda‘s progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been
relatively good, except in the health sector. The country has achieved MDG 1, poverty
reduction and hunger eradication, and the MDG 7 target on access to safe water (at 70 percent
and 92 percent against MDG targets of 62 percent and 72 percent in rural and urban areas,
respectively) and sanitation (68 percent, compared with the MDG target of 72 percent4). The
whole of MDG 7, environmental sustainability, could still be met by 2015 if given sufficient
attention. Uganda is also likely to achieve MDG 2, universal primary education, MDG 3, gender
equality and empowerment of women, and MDG 6, combating HIV/AIDS and malaria.
However, with an under-five mortality of 137/1000 and maternal mortality of 435 per 100,000
births, MDGs 4 and 5 are unlikely to be met by 2015.

                                         PUBLIC SECTOR AND GOVERNANCE

10.     Governance challenges could potentially affect development outcomes and delay
gains in service delivery. Challenges include deficiencies in performance management as well
as the way public servants are recruited, deployed and rewarded,5 which have translated into high
vacancy ratios in public services, high absenteeism in public institutions and low quality of
public education and poor health outcomes. The proposed operation supports a wide range of
reforms6 to address and overcome these challenges. These reforms aim at strengthening
transparency and accountability in frontline service delivery, public sector management, public
financial management and public procurement, and thereby raising the effectiveness of public
spending and value for money in use of public funds.

11.    The rapid creation of new districts in Uganda7 has added to the problem as it has
raised administration and fixed overhead costs, reduced the share of Local Governments‘
(LGs‘) funding for frontline service delivery and stretched scarce human resources. To
compound the problem this has happened at the same time as the share of government

    The number of districts in Uganda has increased from 34 in 1990 to 111 in 2010.

expenditure at the local government level is falling. Average staffing level in local governments
is now at 56 percent as a result of the wage provisions, limiting LG capacity to monitor and
support effective service.

12.     A weak accountability framework together with a low risk of sanctions is a
challenge. The Inspector General of Government (IGG) report to Parliament (January-June
2011) indicates an investigation rate of only 15.2 percent of all cases (new or old) regarding
abuse of office, fraud, loss of public funds and those arising out of implementation of the
Leadership Code Act (LCA, 2002). The Uganda National Panel Survey (2010) reports teacher
absenteeism in one of every five classrooms in Uganda. The National Integrity Survey (2008)
found that 43 percent of households regard health workers as corrupt and that 51 percent do not
know how to report corruption. Furthermore, disciplinary systems are in need of updating so that
they allow for non-performance to be addressed.

13.    Citizen demand for good governance remains weak and appears to have created a
sense of apathy amongst common citizens. While efforts have been made previously to
introduce direct accountability mechanisms, such as citizen report cards and expenditure
tracking, those initiatives remain few and too local. While being more active, the civil society
remains disorganized. Strengthening direct accountability should therefore remain an important
element of the reform agenda.

14.     In order to improve the Government‘s credibility on governance and corruption
issues, the highest level of political authority has sent strong signals. Such commitment is
anchored on the continuous and better implementation of the Data Tracking Mechanism (DTM),
which is aimed at tracking corruption trends and providing evidence-based data to promote anti-
corruption reform and deepen the public dialogue about corruption across all stakeholders. The
DTM is managed by an independent research institution and has already published two annual
reports. Further, as identified in the NDP, the Government will provide space for Civil Society
Organizations (CSOs) and guarantee their independence by identifying a sustainable and credible
source of financing. The current Barazas will be strengthened as they provide a stakeholder
forum where community and CSOs voices on service delivery can be heard and addressed. The
Government has put in place a comprehensive legal framework and institutions to fight
corruption in Uganda. However, these have not yielded the desired results. For example, the
Anti-Corruption Division of High Court has not operated at full capacity with a few high level
sentences delivered due to the limited number of judges and magistrates compared to the high
volume of cases at the Court. The current 9th Parliament has also started to play a more important
role in the governance agenda. It has so far been active in demanding good governance and this
effort needs to be sustained.

                      RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK

15.    During the last two decades, Uganda‘s economy achieved strong growth, supported
by a prudent macroeconomic framework and propelled by consistent policy reforms.
Annual GDP growth averaged 7.4 percent in the 2000s, compared with 6.5 percent recorded in
the 1990s. This strong performance was achieved in spite of consecutive exogenous shocks
including: oil price shocks, prolonged drought conditions with adverse effects on energy
                                                5
generation and agricultural production, and volatile and increasing food prices. Private
investment, particularly in construction of commercial and residential property, and exports, led
by tourism and non-traditional exports of fish, flowers and maize, were the most important
drivers of growth. However, reflecting rapid population growth, real GDP per capita grew at a
more moderate 4.0 percent per year over the last decade.

16.     Since 2009, growth has remained below historical trends as exogenous shocks
weighed economic activity down. Real GDP growth had recovered in FY10/11 to 6.7 percent
from 5.9 percent in the previous year, but is expected to slow down to about 5 percent in
FY11/12. The share of export of goods and non-factor services in GDP is expected to continue
declining in FY11/12 to only 19.8 percent, a drop of 0.3 percent from FY10/11, in spite of
healthy growth in regional demand. Strong growth in domestic credit to the private sector
financed the faster growth in the construction and services sectors but agricultural growth has
remained subdued on account of the prolonged drought and structural rigidities constraining the
agricultural supply response to rising commodity prices.

17.     Fiscal policy was expansionary over the past two years, in particular in FY10/11, on
account of countercyclical and election-related spending. While domestic revenues increased
by one percentage point to 13.3 percent of GDP in FY10/11, overall spending increased by 3.2
percentage points to a total of 22.8 percent of GDP. This increase was 1.6 percentage points of
GDP above the budget originally approved by Parliament, and was used for security and
election-related expenditures and for subsidies directed to thermal power generation. The overall
fiscal deficit8 including grants was 7.2 percent of GDP compared to 4.9 percent in FY09/10. As
external financing declined (from 2.2 to 1.9 percent of GDP) between FY09/10 and FY10/11,
domestic financing rose from 2.1 to 5.9 percent of GDP, mainly through draw downs at the
Central Bank (table 1).

18.     The use of large supplementary budgets has affected budget credibility. During
FY10/11, supplementary security and election-related expenditures led to a 2.3 percent of GDP
increase in public spending and an unbudgeted reallocation of the government budget. 9 The
main priority sector affected was „water and environment‟ which received only 89 percent of its
original allocation. In FY11/12, the substantial expenditure changes between the draft original
budget presented to Parliament and the final budget approved by Parliament also raised questions
about budget planning. Post-budget speech corrigenda are part of the regular budget process to
correct errors and omissions and can also reflect the impact of political negotiations on
reallocations of budget funds and the total spending envelope. However, in FY11/12, they also
included expenditures that were known at the time of preparing the budget and budgeting errors.
The post-budget speech corrigenda included inter-sectoral reallocations from public debt to
classified military expenditure amounting to Ush 280 bn (0.6 percent of GDP) and an additional
Ush 325 bn for thermal power subsidies. The latter were omitted expenditures as they were
known at the time of preparing the budget. Seen against the purpose of the draft budget as
presented to Parliament, the developments described above both on the extent of supplementary

    The fiscal deficit excludes errors and omissions of up to 0.6 percentage points of GDP.

    Overall, the variance in GoU expenditure composition within sectors had reached 38 percent in FY10/11, a range that lowers
    Uganda‟s Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) rating from C to D.

                                                               6
budgets and the large post-budget speech corrigenda limit the usefulness of the draft budget
presented to Parliament as a statement of policy intent and on how much control the authorities
maintain over the budgeting and resource appropriation process.

19.     Inflation has risen fast during FY11/12. From an average of 6.5 percent during
FY10/11, overall inflation rose to a peak of 30.8 percent in October 2011 and eased to 27
percent by December. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food crops, fuel and utilities, also
peaked at 30.6 percent in November and was 29.2 percent by December, suggesting that
international energy and food prices are not anymore the main drivers but rather fiscal and
monetary accommodating policies as well as the fast depreciation of the local currency. Private
sector credit grew by 44 percent during FY10/11, compared to 25.3 percent in FY09/10, and
domestic borrowing by the public sector grew fast over the past two years.

20.     The authorities have acknowledged their recent slippages in fiscal policy and their
too accommodating monetary policy and have adopted a more restrictive stance for
FY11/12. The recent surge in public spending was partly the result of the political cycle and
exogenous factors (such as the regional drought and the global financial turmoil), that has been
corrected by recent measures, including a planned decline of about 1.9 percent of GDP in
security expenditures, better control of the wage bill, cuts in non-priority recurrent spending
(travel and allowances) and higher electricity tariffs (up by at least 35 percent with effect from
January 15, 2012). Cash management of the budget has also been closely monitored: thus overall
budget execution at mid-year was 49 percent. As a result, the fiscal deficit in FY11/12, including
grants, is expected to decline to 3.8 percent of GDP (and 6.3 percent, excluding grants), even as
revenues and grants remain unchanged, at about 15.7 percent of GDP.

21.     Monetary policy has been tightened significantly to control monetary expansion and
domestically generated inflation. The Central Bank‟s policy rate has been increased four times
since July 2011, from 13 percent per annum to 23 percent in November 2011. This line of action
has effectively raised lending rates, reduced private sector credit growth and supported some
appreciation of the Uganda shilling. Looking forward, the expected decline in food prices should
help support this disinflation effort.

22.     The growth of the external sector has been weak mainly on account of the fragile
global economy. The external current account deficit widened from 10.9 percent to 14.3 percent
of GDP between FY09/10 and FY10/11, largely funded by foreign direct investment, and other
public sector transfers (including capital gains tax from oil transactions). Recently, under the
weight of a persistent weak external current account and economic uncertainty related to events
surrounding the Presidential Elections and its aftermath, the Uganda shilling has depreciated
significantly Foreign exchange reserves slid from 4.2 months of import cover in FY09/10 to 3.3
months during FY10/11, and are expected to remain below 4.0 months of import cover through
FY11/12.

23.     Uganda‘s historically strong record of macroeconomic management until last fiscal
year, stands to bear that the ongoing adjustment process will successfully stabilize the
economy, but there are risks. First, with growth slowing down on account of recent fiscal and
monetary tightening and higher electricity tariffs, government revenues could be lower than
programmed, thereby making the deficit targets more difficult to reach. Second, while fiscal
policy has so far been maintained within programmed levels, a few budget items, in particular
under public administration, raise risk of potential supplementary expenditures (e.g., Parliament
had already in the first two quarters of the FY spent 66 percent of its annual budget and State
House 88 percent). The planned cuts in recurrent spending (in terms of percent of GDP) could
also prove ambitious although a significant curtailment is still expected to materialize. Third, the
current strong fiscal and monetary stance can be increasingly challenged by social resistance
(e.g. the recent strike by traders who complained about too high interest rates). In light of these
risks macroeconomic management will need to be monitored closely as part of the Bank and
IMF continued dialogue.

24.     The financial system continues to expand and remains reasonably sound, albeit the
emerging inflationary environment is a major concern. Uganda has made notable progress in
modernizing and expanding its financial sector and has achieved a positive balance between
managing risk and enabling growth and innovation in the financial system in recent years.
Financial depth has increased and the system is more effectively intermediating deposits and
financing investment. The banking system, which dominates the financial sector, has grown
while remaining relatively stable and is facing greater competitive pressure and contestability.
Given the incipient market for term deposits and the shortage of wholesale deposits, banks are
aggressively expanding their branch networks to mobilize retail deposits. Despite the growing
number of banks, efficiency gains associated with enhanced competition have yet to materialize.
Uganda‟s financial sector was relatively immune from direct contagion of the financial crisis,
and, prior to the increase in inflation, banks‟ portfolios grew without significant credit quality
deterioration and non-performing loans remained low. Accordingly, in FY10/11 nonperforming
                                                 8
loans, as share of total loans, fell to 2 percent, from 4.4 percent at the end of FY09/10. With the
heightened inflation and Bank of Uganda‟s (BoU) tightening of monetary policy, nominal
lending rates have risen above 30 percent in the past few months. Banks have curtailed lending
and altered terms of their existing installment loans. This has resulted in a slowed growth in
private sector credit, which is now expected to decline from 16.7 percent of GDP in FY10/11 to
14.9 percent of GDP by the end of FY11/12. While banks appear positioned to face the
immediate interest rate risk, sustained higher interest rate pass-through to customers pose major
credit quality issues.

                         MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

25.       The Government is committed to a consistent and sustainable macroeconomic
framework over the short and medium terms. This commitment is anchored on prudent fiscal
and monetary policies, as well as on the proper management of forthcoming oil revenues.
Building on the ongoing fiscal adjustment, the proposed medium-term expenditure framework to
FY15/16 features moderate fiscal deficits and maintains significant expenditures in infrastructure
to address key binding constraints to growth, consistent with NDP priorities (table 2). Banking
system financing of the deficit will be limited to drawing down deposits (including from
exceptional oil exploration tax earnings) to finance initiation of the Karuma hydropower
project10. The effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of GoU‟s policies will hinge on
the quality of public financial management (PFM) and procurement systems. The authorities are
committed to strengthen accountability and efficiency of these systems and are engaged with
Development Partners (DPs), including in the context of general budget support and its related
Joint Assessment Framework which details specific performance indicators.

26.      Uganda‘s growth is projected to return to robust historical trends, averaging
about 7 percent in the next few years, as long as external shocks remain limited. As public
investments peak at 11 percent of GDP in FY13/14, private sector investment is envisaged to
grow from 17.6 percent of GDP in FY11/12 to 18.2 percent by FY15/16. Growth is expected to
be driven by the rebound in agricultural production in the northern region (with overall sector
growth rising from 3 percent in FY11/12 to 7 percent by FY15/16) in response to the return to
peace and as regional demand for Uganda‟s exports grows. The services sector is expected to
maintain its strong growth through the medium term, while manufacturing is projected to grow at
about 7 percent per annum as infrastructure constraints abate.

27.       In the medium to long term, growth will to a large extent depend on the ability of
the authorities to effectively harness the anticipated resources from oil exploration. As was
discussed in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the previous program document for
PRSC 8, prudent macroeconomic management in the presence of oil revenue inflows, channeling
fiscal resources to the most productive public investments, and raising the pace of productivity
growth and skills development in the labor force will be the crucial areas for sustained growth.
As highlighted in Box 1, Government has recently made some progress in preparing for oil
production. It is in the process of strengthening the legal and institutional framework for

     Government investment spending in the Karuma hydroelectricity project will average 1.1 percent of GDP annually in the
     period FY11/12 – FY 14/15.

managing oil resources (as described in more detail in section V), and it has undertaken
feasibility studies, with donor support, for oil refinery to facilitate discussion and decision on
whether to refine domestically or export crude oil. Recently, the Uganda Parliament has called
for more transparency in the oil sector, both on contracts and fiscal management. In addition,
Uganda would need to harness the demographic dividend, address inefficiencies in public service
delivery, and tackle emerging skills gaps as the economy continues to transform.

28.       The outlook for the medium term will also highly depend on the external
environment, since Uganda is vulnerable to food and energy prices as well as exposed to
climatic shocks. Global and regional growth rates are not expected to return to their pre-crisis
levels in the near term as concerns for a possible recession grow. The Euro zone debt crisis is
likely to negatively affect Uganda‟s growth prospects through decreasing trade with Euro zone
countries, which consume about 1/3 of Uganda‟s exports, possibly slowdown in remittances and
aid flows, and lower commodity prices. 2/3 of Uganda‟s exports are commodities and hence
vulnerable to price declines.

                 Box 1: Uganda‘s Oil – Big Promise but Uncertainties and Risks Remain
                                                                                                                11


     Discovered reserves are estimated at 2 billion barrels. If extracted, at a peak production rate of 175,000 – 220,000
     barrels a day, these reserves could sustain the country for up to 20 years. Production is expected to start in 2013,
     but commercial amounts may only come around 2016, and peak production realized in 2018.
     Exercising caution. GoU is considering limiting daily extraction to 60,000 barrels and to build a refinery with the
     same capacity. Such an option has several advantages: (i) it is more cost effective compared to the 200,000 barrel
     option as it also does not require a pipeline for exporting the surplus beyond the region, (ii) the amounts refined
     can be competitively consumed within Uganda and the region, (iii) if implemented, revenue flows would be
     limited to about 3 percent of non-oil GDP, which would reduce considerably macroeconomic and institutional
     risks associated with the "resource curse". The disadvantage is that the limited revenue stream will not be
     sufficient to close Uganda's fiscal gap, currently covered by foreign aid, and the critically needed acceleration in
     infrastructure investments. As experience from other countries suggests, building and managing a local refinery
     will require a capacity to operate away from political interferences and effectively limiting extraction will call for
     an extreme level of discipline to ensure that Government sticks to the planned schedule.
  Large investments needed between now and 2018. Whichever scenario is adopted, large supportive investments in
 infrastructure will be needed to produce, transport, export and refine the oil. There is therefore considerable
 uncertainty regarding the time frame for reaching peak oil production and associated revenue generation.
     Legal and Regulatory framework. The Petroleum Act and the Public Finance and Accountability Act (PFAA,
     2003) have been identified as the key pieces of legislation for upstream and downstream oil management,
     respectively. The Petroleum Act and needed amendments to the PFAA incorporating mechanisms for transparency
     and accountability, including of oil revenues and expenditures, will be tabled before Parliament in 2012. The bills
     are supposed to be publically debated once they are in Parliament. Ensuring proper implementation and
     enforcement of these laws would have to be closely monitored given Uganda‟s past track record of a large
     implementation gap.
     Parliament calling for more transparency. In October 2011 the Parliament debated allegations of corruption in
     the oil sector which resulted in a number of decisions including, inter alia: (i) a moratorium on executing oil
     contracts until the necessary laws have been put in place, and requests that Government submits to Parliament the
     oil-related laws within 30 days; (ii) that Government reviews production-sharing agreements to ensure that all
     disputes are resolved in Uganda‟s courts of law; (iii) that Government accounts for all oil revenues and
     expenditures to date; that Government joins the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI); and (iv) that
     Government desists from executing oil contracts with confidentiality clauses. Overall these events are seen as
     developments which may increase transparency in the oil sector more than they increase uncertainty for the
     investors. Parliament needs to ensure that these decisions are indeed implemented.
     Institutional Framework. The amendments to the PFA Act will legally establish a petroleum fund into which all
     oil and gas revenues will be deposited, and will ensure that all spending is done through the budget. In the interim,
     a dedicated account for oil-revenues has been created at Bank of Uganda to deposit any oil related revenues like
     the capital gains tax, which amounted to US $ 450 million in FY10/11, but could reach US $ 900 million if tax
     disputes are resolved in favor of Uganda.
     Risks and uncertainties call for more dialogue and policy advice. Experiences from other countries suggest that
     in order to ensure the proper use of oil revenues, there is need for continuous dialogue and policy advice as well as
     close monitoring over time by all stakeholders, including the international community. The Bank will continue the
     policy dialogue with GoU not only on the oil sector but also to promote proper usage of all public resources and to
     ensure value for money through PRSC, project support, and our knowledge products. The focus on strengthening
     public sector management and value for money service delivery in the social sectors, on support to policy reforms
     to enhance results and accountability in service delivery, and on the public investment program by directing
     resources to those areas with the highest economic returns and improving processes for managing these resources,
     is appropriate as the country prepares for oil revenue flows.

29.       The Government will continue to require external financing to maintain its fiscal
policy for growth. Domestic revenue mobilization remains low (only 13 percent of GDP in
FY10/11) and realizing the projected increase to 14.5 percent of GDP in the medium term will
require substantial efforts but will remain insufficient to close the fiscal gap. Therefore, further
external capital will be required to sustain the large investments both for oil production and for
public infrastructure. Foreign direct investment, currently forecast to grow from 5.6 percent of
GDP in FY10/11 to 7.3 percent by FY14/15, will provide some of the funding as well as non-
concessionary financing. The authorities are projecting rely increasing use of non-concessional
funds to finance infrastructure projects as they build up debt management capacity. Such a move
will be consistent with the World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Framework and Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) that agreed to US $ 800 million in non-concessional borrowing during the next
three years, limited to infrastructure investments. Higher reliance on non-concessionary
financing will also compensate for lower aid inflows that are projected to decline from 4.8
percent of GDP in FY09/10 to 3.2 percent in FY14/15.

30.       Uganda‘s risk of debt distress will remain low as long as GDP growth remains on
historical levels and non-concessional financing remains under control. The 2011 Joint Debt
Sustainability Analysis update suggests that all parameters for sustainability are within the
prescribed thresholds and the risk of debt distress is low.12 Even as the limit on non-
concessional borrowing is increased to US$800 million over the next three years, the debt
service ratios remain robust under most of the standard stress tests. The sensitivity of Uganda‟s
debt indicators to a growth shock suggests that careful selection of public investment projects is
essential to maintaining debt sustainability over the near and medium term as use of non-
concessional borrowing increases. This will require continued attention from the Ugandan
authorities to improving investment planning processes and strengthening implementation and
absorption capacity.

31.    Overall, even if there are significant risks associated to the global economic situation
and to the implementation of the government‘s economic program, the macroeconomic
framework is considered appropriate for a Development Policy Operation. As discussed in
the risk section of this document, there are several elements that may affect program
implementation including some that may impact macroeconomic performance. Yet it must also
be recognized that the Government has been taking effective measures for more than half a year
to address the macroeconomic slippages of last year, and has designed a program that is being
supported by an IMF PSI (the Third Review of the PSI was completed by the Fund‟s Board on
January 13, 2012).
                                     POLITICAL CONTEXT

32.     Uganda has enjoyed relative political stability after the National Resistance
Movement (NRM), headed by Yoweri Museveni took power in 1986. In its first decade the
NRM began a sustained period of economic and political renewal by focusing on reconstructing
the economy and establishing legitimate Government by advancing pro-market reforms and
political liberalization. However, Northern Uganda has missed out on two decades of growth and

poverty reduction owing to the civil war waged by the Lord‟s Resistance Army, which was
pushed out of Uganda in 2005. Benefitting from the peace dividend and the interventions put in
place the region is making significant progress.

33. The February 2011 presidential and parliamentary elections saw a renewal of the
NRM mandate to govern Uganda. However, international observers noted that the political
playing field was skewed in favor of the incumbent. Following the elections, the opposition
launched a campaign of civil disobedience protests named “Walk to Work? to display
dissatisfaction with the election outcome and the increased cost of living caused by inflation. The
Government‟s response to the protests met some criticism domestically and internationally.

34. Uganda is a founding member of the East African Community (EAC) and has been
an active and vocal supporter of further regional integration. The EAC comprises Uganda,
Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi with a combined population of approximately 137
million people. The EAC seeks to integrate its member states politically and economically,
although to date economic cooperation has progressed furthest, with the latest step being the
creation of the EAC Common Market in 2010. The next phase of integration will be a Monetary
Union where member states must agree on 85 articles before its formation.

                                III. THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

35.     GoU approved a new five-year National Development Plan (FY2010/11-2014/15) in
March 2010. The NDP, endorsed by Parliament in November 2010, was formulated through a
country-driven process that recognized the importance of broad-based commitment to national
development objectives. Using a bottom-up top-down approach, the process allowed ideas from
the grass-root stakeholders while communicating the proposed policy re-orientation of the
development plan. Cabinet discussions provided for consensus building on the proposed reforms
and the overall strategic direction for government policy, but also helped to improve consistency
and greater ownership within government. Stakeholder consultations including at local
government level were held before presenting the final NDP to Uganda‟s Parliament. The NDP
therefore, generally reflects a consensus among main stakeholders on the country‟s broad goals
for growth, social equity, and governance to transform Uganda.

36.      The NDP is also broadly consistent with the ruling party‘s manifesto. It broadens
the focus from ‗poverty reduction‘ to ‗structural transformation‘ of the economy for the
purposes of economic growth and improved living standards. The comparison of the
allocation of the FY11/12 budget to NDP priorities suggest broad consistence as infrastructure
sectors have received a larger share of funds. The National Planning Authority will be producing
annual review reports highlighting how the NDP has been implemented. Medium term
priorities13 highlight the importance of maximizing benefits from oil and gas and increasing
agricultural productivity.

37.     The NDP has eight objectives of which the PRSC 9 directly addresses four: NDP
Objective 4: Economic Infrastructure. The NDP emphasizes that sustaining high growth and
transformation requires industrialization, value addition in agriculture, and larger markets both
internally and externally. These objectives all depend on infrastructure investments, particularly
in energy and transport, but also water for production facilities.

38.     NDP Objectives 3 and 5: Human Capital Development and Access to Social
Services. The NDP maintains a strong focus on improving and expanding social service
delivery. Key priorities are improving quality of education, expanding universal secondary
education, and implementing business, technical and vocational education and training. Health
sector priorities include improving management of health units, reducing waste, and
rehabilitating and equipping hospitals, while continuing to focus on immunization,
communicable disease control, reproductive health and nutrition and hygiene. These ambitious
programs for improved service delivery are feasible only in the context of improving efficiency
in public spending, a key pillar of Government‟s fiscal strategy.

39.     NDP Objective 7: Good Governance. The NDP identifies a weak public sector as a
major constraint to development and aims to address this by building performance-based
management systems and improving and strengthening the coordination of policy
implementation. Priorities include the introduction of institutional performance contracts at all
levels, improved human resource management of public servants, and increased transparency
and accountability by introducing value for money performance standards and performance
budgeting in all sectors.

              IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

40.     The new Uganda Country Assistance Strategy FY10/11-14/15 was discussed by the
Board in May 2010. The CAS aims to support GoU in reaching its medium-term goals of
accelerating economic growth, transforming the structure of the economy and raising
employment. Like the NDP, the CAS focuses on infrastructure development, agriculture, human
capital development, and improving efficiency and value for money in public spending through
better governance. The PRSC operations continue to be an important component of the Bank‟s
support to Uganda, constituting approximately one quarter of annual IDA lending.

                                         PARTNERSHIPS
Joint Budget Support Framework

41.     The proposed operation is the second in a series of three operations that draw on a
Joint Budget Support Framework (JBSF) prepared together with ten donors and the
Government. The JBSF is an aid delivery mechanism that provides financial assistance to the
national budget, financing about 8 percent of the budget in FY11/12 and channelizing about one
third of all donor support. The group of JBSF Development Partners (JBSF-DPs) consists of
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, European Union (EU), Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway,
Sweden, and the United Kingdom in addition to the Bank. This joint approach emphasizes
harmonization and alignment in line with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and
                                               15
subsequent Accra Agenda for Action with the objectives to reduce transaction costs, increase the
predictability of disbursements, and create mutual accountability.

42.    As part of the JBSF, the World Bank has worked closely with other budget support
donors in the preparation and implementation of the current PRSC series, including PRSC
9. A Taskforce for JBSF Development Partners regularly meets to advance preparation, appraisal
and supervision of the JBSF operations and works closely with the set of Development Partner
Sector Working Groups for those sectors and thematic areas that are covered in the JBSF (health,
education, water/sanitation and transport as well as PFM, Public Sector Management (PSM),
procurement, accountability and budget issues). JBSF development partners are also jointly
funding (through a World Bank executed Trust Fund) a DP Technical and Analytical Support
Unit (TASU). This unit provides assistance to all JBSF DPs on common JBSF tasks and
contributes to the preparation of the annual proposal for the multi-year Joint Assessment
Framework (JAF – the joint results framework agreed with Government), appraisals, internal
communications and coordination, and investing in new analytical work for continuing policy
dialogue to influence the policy content of future operations as the JAF evolves over time.

43.     JBSF development partners have also worked closely with Government in
developing – and on an annual basis updating - the JAF. The JAF is a subset of GoU‟s
broader and more comprehensive Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) framework.14 Hence, the set
of objectives, key constraints to address, priority actions and key performance indicators in the
JAF is fully consistent with Government‟s M&E framework. The policy framework used in the
PRSC8-10 series is again a subset of the JAF. The close dialogue between Government and
JBSF development partners in developing the JAF has taken on a problem-solving approach for
each of the service delivery sectors covered by the JAF/PRSC series. The key focus has been:
what should Government do to solve the major problems that hinder performance in public
service delivery in the education sector, in the health sector, etc.? The focus is on the individual
service delivery sector and on identifying and removing the binding constraints (or impediments)
to performance. In addition to sector-specific constraints the approach also addresses cross-
cutting impediments where tailor-made solutions are developed from a general cross-cutting
measure but adapted to the unique circumstances of the individual sector.15 It has been ensured
that both cross-cutting issues and sector-specific issues have been considered in conjunction by
including representatives from all relevant agencies – both on the cross-cutting side and sector
ministries – in extensive deliberations and workshops. This also ensured that appropriate
solutions with full buy-in emanate from that process and have been captured in the JAF. JBSF
DPs and Government go through this process updating the multi-year JAF on an annual basis
and also work closely together on the annual appraisal of performance measured against the JAF.

44.    While total JBSF financing has been substantial, its relative importance to the
national budget and in terms of GDP is on a declining trend. Total budget support has


14
     GoU‟s M&E framework covers its government-wide reform program spanning 16 ministries; hence, a considerably larger set
     than the JAF.
15
      One example of this approach would be in the health sector where problems in drug procurement are addressed with
     procurement measures that go beyond the general procurement reforms that apply to all sectors and with a tailor-made
     application for the health sector.

                                                             16
stagnated in nominal terms around US$ 300 million per year and is projected to decline
gradually over the medium term, especially in the light of forthcoming oil revenues. As a relative
share of the national budget, budget support fell from 15 percent in 2008/09 to 8 percent in
2011/12. Two development partners (with small shares in the total) are stopping budget support
and others have announced gradual reductions. The largest budget support contributions come
from the World Bank, the European Union, and Department for International Development
(DFID UK).

Collaboration with IMF

45.     The PRSC has been prepared and will be implemented in close collaboration with
the IMF that currently supports GoU with a second 3-year Policy Support Instrument
(PSI). The PSI is progressing well. The Second Review was completed in June 2011 and as
noted above the Third Review was completed by the IMF Board on January 13, 2012.
Collaboration between the Bank and the Fund remains strong, with the IMF concentrating on
macroeconomic issues while broader issues of public financial management, sectoral policies
and structural and governance reforms are supported by the Bank. Fiscal, debt management and
sustainability analysis, and financial sector issues are supported jointly.

                       RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

46.     The PRSC series complements a large World Bank portfolio of sectoral operations.
In line with Government‟s increased focus on growth enhancing infrastructure and human
capital, Bank support has a strong emphasis on transport and energy, complemented by
continued support to social sectors and public sector reform. The PRSC is aligned on the CAS
Strategic Objectives 2 and 3, Enhance Public Infrastructure and Strengthen Human Capital
Development, through its emphasis on improved service delivery in health, education, transport
and water and sanitation. The PRSC also forms an important component under CAS Cross-
Cutting Objective 4, Good Governance and Value for Money, with its emphasis on cross-cutting
reforms in PFM and PSM that will improve expenditure efficiency.

47.     PRSC‘s cross-cutting approach provides synergy with other Bank operations. It has
a two-way interface with sector investment operations. First, the PRSC cross-sectoral policy
dialogue effectively addresses binding constraints that affect the sectors but are difficult to
handle at the individual sector level or by sector investment lending operations. Second, the
objectives of the PRSC in many areas are supported by the implementation of Bank/DP sector
investment programs, ensuring that PRSC objectives in these areas are realistic and receive
appropriate technical support. Such synergy and complementarity are seen in operations in each
of the four sectors covered by the PRSC as well as for Bank operations in PFM (Financial
Management and Accountability Program (FINMAP)), PSM (Uganda Public Service
Performance Enhancement Program), accountability (DTM project), local government support,
and procurement.

                    ASSESSMENT OF ACHIEVEMENTS AND LESSONS UNDER PRSC 1 – 8

48.     There are several lessons emerging from previous PRSC operations. These are
discussed in detail in the Program Document of the PRSC 8 Operation (Rep. No 53731-UG)16
and include: (i) the PRSC focus must be narrow enough such that slower performing actions do
not waste resources and impede performance of faster paced actions; (ii) the Bank must be
selective and realistic in choosing PRSC indicators, and assist Government in strengthening
weak M&E frameworks supporting poverty reduction efforts; (iii) there must be a strong link
between the timeframe for the PRSC long term reform agenda and the implementation
framework; (iv) execution of PRSC operations must be aligned to the national budget cycle in
order to l ease integration of PRSC conditions into ministerial programs and preempt
government reallocation of resources; (v) the link has to be explicit between the cross-cutting
reform agenda in the PRSC and sectoral reforms; (vi) New legislation that involves multiple
stakeholder interests and possible rent seeking requires reasonable lead time and extensive time
for dialogue; (vii) consensus building can potentially slow the pace of reform as implementation
is increasingly subject to political calculation, indicating the need to lower ambitions with the
pace and scope of reform progress; (viii) the Bank should engage with partners at an early stage
as part of multi-donor Joint Budget Support Frameworks; and (ix) in a joint framework with
multiple partners facing differing political (and economic) realities and mandates, priorities and
emphasis on the choice of instrument and areas of focus can evolve over time.

49.     At the same time, previous PRSC operations have several achievements to show: (i)
the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) and PRSC processes helped link the development
challenges faced by Uganda to the public investments necessary to meet those challenges; (ii) the
PRSCs helped streamline, coordinate and increase donor support, shifting aid progressively into
direct budget support. The PRSC series also improved the predictability of concessional
resources; (iii) from the establishment of the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets
(PPDA) Act, over the creation of operational procurement units and tender committees in
ministries and local governments, to the amendment of the Act and finally the issuance of
revised implementation regulations, support to procurement reform has been a mainstay in the
PRSCs; and (iv) JBSF donors have harmonized their practices, procedures and policy and M&E
frameworks supporting their budget support operations as well as closely aligning them with
government systems. This has lightened the administrative burden on Government substantially
which has benefited from large savings in transaction cost.

                                         ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

50.     The analytical base of the new PRSC series focused on improving results and cost-
effectiveness on public spending on service delivery and increasing value for money. Key
findings, both cross-cutting and sector-specific, that have informed the PRSC series are
presented in summary form in table 3 below. Extensive descriptions are presented in the Program
Document for PRSC 8.

     Achievements and lessons are drawn from the 2009 IEG Country Assessment Evaluation and a series of Implementation
     Completion/Status Reports.

51.     Looking beyond PRSC 10, ongoing and future work will continue to inform and
refine the PRSC operations. The recently concluded inclusive growth studies (2009-201117)
informed Government on policies designed to facilitate the participation of a larger share of the
population in contributing to economic growth. The studies had a dual sectoral and spatial
perspective in focusing on raising agricultural productivity and human capital development,
whilst at the same time linking lagging with leading areas of the country. The coming Public
Expenditure Review (PER) (FY12/13) will focus on local government finances and service
delivery, and is expected to provide additional analytical basis and policy recommendations in
these areas for future JAFs and PRSCs. The ongoing study on regional integration and economic
geography18 provides policy recommendations on reducing disparities in education to promote
labor mobility, regionalizing connective infrastructure, establishing an economic integration
zone and fiscal pooling that could have a bearing on the policy content of future PRSCs or other
forms of policy based lending.

Memorandum, 2007                  consistent set of policy actions, investments, and interventions. This helped to focus the NDP on economic
                                  transformation and acceleration of growth, and set the stage for seeking increased fiscal space through
                                  enhanced cost-effectiveness on public spending (used in the JAF and PRSCs).

              V. THE NINTH POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT CREDIT
                                   OPERATION DESCRIPTION

52.    The objective of the current PRSC series (PRSC 8, 9 and 10) is to support the
Government‘s reforms to improved access to, and greater value for money in, public
services. The three operations are designed to improve expenditure efficiency and value for
money in the health, education, transport and water and sanitation sectors by addressing both
cross-cutting and sector-specific bottlenecks; each set in a separate Policy Cluster. In line with
the Government‟s strategy, these operations place a strong emphasis on performance-based
management through tools such as output-oriented budgeting and results oriented management.

53.     The PRSC and JAF permit flexibility in program coverage and design. If necessary,
the PRSC/JAF could be modified to address emerging policy issues or exogenous shocks. Future
operations could also allow for the incorporation of additional sectors once they have developed
adequate policy frameworks for reforms. Future operations may address growth (including in
agriculture), expand on governance of the oil sector, and crosscutting environmental
management issues. This will be determined as the changing policy framework becomes clearer.

54.    The PRSC uses a subset of the authorities‘ policy and outcomes matrices as its
results framework. This is also a subset of the assessment framework jointly developed and
agreed between Government and JBSF development partners.

55.     Prior actions and triggers. PRSC 9 has a total of 10 prior actions, which are based on
the triggers proposed in PRSC 8 (Table 4). The proposed 8 triggers for PRSC 10 reflect a greater
emphasis on fiscal transparency and accountability, partly driven by the importance of oil-related
issues, and the willingness to avoid duplication with the Bank‟s support through sector-based
investment lending. The initially planned triggers in the health and water/sanitation sectors were
dropped, reflecting a combination of the latter and the relative weight each action carries.

56.    PRSC 9 Financing. The proposed amount of PRSC 9 budget support is US$ 100 million.

                                     Box 2: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1 — Ownership
Uganda has been a pioneer in country ownership of its development strategy. The current government program is
contained in the first five year National Development Plan (NDP), which was launched in April 2010 and focuses on
structural transformation of the economy for future growth. It was developed in a participatory manner, following
extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders. In addition GoU is in the process of implementing a
Partnership Policy (PP) which establishes a division of labor amongst donors and directs development assistance
according to the priorities of Government. The PP is underscored by a Memorandum of Understanding to be signed
by all development partners, and is assessed on an annual basis according to a monitoring framework.
Principle 2 — Accountability
Donor harmonization and alignment with government priorities is advanced in Uganda. Government produces the
annual Government Annual Performance Report (GAPR) detailing FY performance. The budget support donors
have developed a Joint Assessment Framework (JAF) which assesses government performance as detailed in the
GAPR. The JAF responds to the GoU assessment of a clearly defined subset of actions, addressing key performance
impediments.
Principle 3 — Country circumstances
Policies supported by the PRSC represent actions that reflect country preferences. They are selected from the NDP,
the sector strategies, and annual budget framework papers. The 2009 Country Assistance Strategy completion review
concluded that the PRSC is the single best vehicle for helping Uganda advance its system-wide reform process, and
for making progress on service delivery and crosscutting issues. The government has said that it would like PRSC
operations structured such that financing is approved before the national budget is submitted to Parliament. The Bank
and other development partners have adjusted the JBSF and the PRSC timetable to further enhance funding
predictability for budgeting purposes.
Principle 4 — Choose only actions critical to achieve results as conditions for disbursement
Prior actions for PRSC9 are drawn from the JAF matrix, and represent a continuation of the foundation for the three-
year programmatic cycle of budget support, initiated by PRSC 8. The Prior Actions inherent in PRSC 9 both build
upon reforms initiated under PRSC 8, but also address emerging issues. Hence, the 9 th operation forms the basis for
support to future reforms, whilst at the same time linking to past reforms. Prior actions have been carefully aligned to
those in PRSC 10 to allow for a reasonable policy reform period. The PRSC 10 triggers represent actions and outputs
that government considers critical to the success of its reforms. They are also drawn from the JAF and aligned to the
NDP.
Principle 5 — Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance based
financial support
The PEAP policy matrix served as the basis for the first Annual PEAP Implementation Review, conducted in
February 2007, and guided policy analysis, budget prioritization, work planning, performance assessment, and
development partner dialogue. The development of the NDP benefitted from these assessments. Furthermore, the
Joint Assessment Framework under the JBSF is assessed on an annual basis drawing on GoU‟s GAPR, and the
assessment findings are discussed with government. The findings inform the design of government‟s budget
framework papers and future JAFs.
                                                               24
                                        POLICY AREAS

57.    The approach taken by the PSRC series is that sector measures have been defined to
address binding constraints to service delivery that are specific to the sector, while cross-
cutting measures address those constraints that derive from systemic governance issues.
Cross-cutting measures address six main performance impediments to efficient service delivery:
the credibility of the budget, funding (modalities and adequacy) at service delivery level,
compliance with PFM regulations, compliance with public procurement regulations,
performance of public servants, and accountability and anti-corruption. The cross-cutting
measures are presented in Policy Cluster 1 and the sector-specific ones in Policy Cluster 2.
Hence, each Policy Cluster contains a set of objectives where each objective is equivalent to
overcoming the corresponding performance impediment to service delivery. The presentation
below therefore focuses on the performance impediments and the set of policy measures to
overcome them. Background information on the underlying issues in each reform area was

58.     Table 4 presents the prior actions for PRSC 9 and the triggers for PRSC 10 whereas
Annex 2 presents the PRSC Policy Matrix and Results Framework. The PRSC series has
been developed as an integral part of the broader Joint Performance Assessment Framework
(JAF) under the JBSF. Therefore, all performance impediments identified in the PRSCs are also
covered in the JAF in addition to complementary actions and agreed target values for key
performance indicators. For more detailed background information on the sectors and thematic
areas in the Program Document for the first operation in this series, the PRSC 8.

Policy cluster 1. Reforms in Public Expenditure management, Public Financial
Management and Public Service Management that Improve Service Delivery

59.     This PRSC series addresses the two most critical performance impediments in
public expenditure management with a bearing on service delivery – (i) insufficient
credibility of the budget; and (ii) inadequate funding at the service delivery level and poor
reporting on the use of the funds.

Public expenditure management

(i) Component 1.1. Credibility of the Budget

60.     At the outset of the current PRSC (8-10) series, poor budget predictability was
identified as a key performance impediment that had been preventing civil service
managers from adhering to work plans. This weakness had been discouraging proper planning
and hindered smooth execution of Ministries, Departments and Agencies‟ (MDAs‟) / service
delivery units‟ work plans. Budget predictability and effectiveness of service delivery units had
been undermined by late release of funds from MoFPED to the spending agencies, and
unpredictable release amounts in the form of in-year cuts and reallocations within sectors. This
indicated that the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) allocations were not a good
indicator for future budget allocations.

                                               25
61.    Government has since the start of the PRSC series undertaken some measures that
have improved the situation but challenges remain to improve budget predictability. Under
PRSC 8 it changed from a monthly to a quarterly release schedule which has facilitated planning.
The previous problem of late releases has largely been overcome as funds are in general released
quite early in the new quarter. However, budget predictability and effectiveness of service
delivery units are still being undermined by in-year cuts and reallocations within sectors.

62.     There were also some setbacks related to last year‘s elections. During FY2010/11,
budget credibility deteriorated in some Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
dimensions and the associated JBSF precondition on budget credibility was not met. Driven by
emerging security and elections expenditure pressures, in-year supplementary expenditures rose
in the last two years to an average of 8.4 percent of the approved budget (from an average of 3.4
percent witnessed in the preceding three years). In light of limited fiscal space, much of the
supplementary expenditures, largely in favor of Public Administration (a large part for the
Executive) and Security sectors, were accommodated at the expense of other ministries and
budget allocations by means of in-year cuts and reallocations within and across sectors which led
to deteriorating budget composition variances.32

63.    During the election year, FY10/11, the previous achievement in PRSC 8 of
protecting funding for public service delivery in JBSF/PRSC sectors 33 was reversed in the
released budget. While the 5 percent variance threshold was maintained at an aggregate level
for 3 out of 4 sectors (except the Water sector, varying by 11 percent) even with the substantial
supplementary budgets, at a disaggregated budget component level most sectors had a variance
of over 5 percent of the approved budgets, reversing the PRSC 8 reforms.34 However, having
passed the elections and going forward with the new budget, Government has committed itself to
stay within the threshold level deviation by aligning work plans in these sectors with actual cash
flows.

64.     Improved budget credibility requires not only predictable access to funds, but also
credible planning so that funds are released by MoFPED according to sector work plans.
With a view to improving alignment between work plans and cash flow over time, the
Government has piloted the use of quarterly work plans and procurement plans in the
ministries/agencies corresponding to the four JBSF/PRSC sectors and has initiated a process of
alignment (prior action). This initiative will be rolled out to more ministries and also extended to
LGs in subsequent years (part of PRSC10 trigger). While the quality of work plans is improving,
spending agencies still need time to align their work plans, procurement plans and cash plans in a
meaningful way. Therefore, this PRSC series has supported efforts within the four PRSC sectors
to introduce a consultative planning process with a view to aligning work plans, procurement
plans and actual cash flow (part of PRSC10 trigger).


32
      In the last two years budget composition variance has averaged above 14 percent, implying deterioration on the PEFA score.
33
     The prior action ensured that the sector releases for conditional grants, wage, non-wage and development budget were
       protected at 95% of original budget allocation; hence, a maximum variance of 5% between approved and executed budgets in
       PRSC sectors (Education, Health, Works /Transport, and Water sectors).
34
     This applied to wage funding in the Works and Transport sector (20%), non-wage funding in Education (15%) and Water
     sectors (25%), and development budgets (6% and above) in all PRSC sectors.

                                                               26
Prior action for PRSC 9: GoU has piloted the use of quarterly work plans and procurement
plans in the ministries/agencies corresponding to the four JBSF sectors and has initiated a
process of alignment of such plans with actual cash flows. These line ministries and agencies
are: i) Education, ii) Health, iii) Water and Environment, and iv) Works and Transport plus
Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA). Status: Met.

Trigger for PRSC 10: Government expands the alignment of work plans, procurement plans
and actual cash flow in its ministries/agencies by: (i) Rolling-out the use of quarterly work plans
and procurement plans to all line ministries and piloting such roll-out for 4 (four) Local
Governments with operational Integrated Financial Management Information Systems (IFMIS);
(ii) Aligning work plans, procurement plans and cash flow for the line ministries and agencies
responsible for the four JBSF sectors on: (A) a quarterly basis to at least 85 percent at overall
sector level, and 85 percent at vote function compositional level; and (B) an annual basis to at
least 85 percent at overall sector level, and 85 percent at vote function compositional level; and
(iii) Eliminating wrong reporting of procurement start dates in the ministries responsible for the
four JBSF sectors in order to strengthen their procurement systems and controls.

(ii) Component 1.2. Funding at Service Delivery Level

65.    Basic service delivery by local governments is facing two critical issues under public
expenditure management: (a) inadequate funding; and (b) Central Government (CG) budgeting
for LG funding is impeded by poor expenditure reporting by LGs.

66.      (a) The Local Government Act, enacted in 1997 transferred the responsibility for
basic service delivery functions to local governments, 35 yet the share of the national budget
going to LGs have declined substantially over the last decade.36 Although the number of
districts has increased considerably from 56 in 2000 to 80 in 2006 and currently stands at 111,
with the argument of bringing services nearer to the people, fiscal decentralization has not
followed the same pace. Indeed, the majority of the national budget (currently over 80 percent) is
still centrally executed and most transfers have stagnated at nominal rates.37

67.    A number of important service delivery functions have been recentralized in recent
years, including secondary education provision, all drug procurement, and some road
maintenance functions. Furthermore, several policy shifts have reduced LGs control over
resources and are raising concerns about Government‟s broader commitment to fiscal
decentralization. These reforms include the abolition of a major source of local governments‟
own revenue, the graduated tax; payment of political leaders from the CG consolidated fund;


35
    Local government services are primary and secondary education, health care, district roads, water and sanitation, and
   agriculture extension.
36
   Budget excluding interest payments and defense expenditure, and including within-budget donor projects. Transfers for district
   services measured as conditional grants. LG shares of the national budget declined from 33% in 2000/01 to only 19% in
   2011/12.
37
   E.g., Local Government Management of Service Delivery Program block grants (un-earmarked funding to LGs), have been
   reduced to Ush 58 bn (0.11% of GDP) in the FY11/12 budget from Ush 64 bn (0.3% of GDP) in the FY06/07 budget when the
   number of LGs expanded by 40%. This has led to LGs using most of the un-earmarked grants to cater for wages, and service
   delivery is only funded by earmarked grants.

                                                              27
centralization of the Chief Administrative Officers and Town Clerks of municipalities; high
conditionality on the use of transfers from central government; and creation of more districts
which is raising LG overhead and transaction costs.

68.     Contrary to the JBSF precondition on political commitment to poverty alleviation
and economic growth, shares of the budget, releases and actual expenditure to poverty
alleviating sectors have been decreasing in FY10/11 and FY11/12. Such a policy shift also led
to decreasing resources for frontline service delivery, amidst politically motivated increase in the
number of LGs.

69.     While these policy shifts could reflect party politics to increase political patronage,
local government financing practices are increasingly at odds with the existing legislative
and policy framework for decentralization. This brings considerable opacity to service
delivery practices and undermines the ability of local governments and line ministries to set
longer-term goals and objectives. Today Uganda‟s fiscal decentralization architecture is
characterized by (i) an intergovernmental fiscal transfer system which is highly conditional thus
undermining the very discretion of LGs which hitherto was the core principle of Uganda‟s
decentralization policy; (ii) sub-national own source revenues (OSR) have either declined or
central government has made certain policy decisions which have undermined the efforts of LGs
to generate OSR; and (iii) the 2002 Fiscal Decentralization Strategy38 - considered to be very
robust and innovative but only partly implemented and has recently suffered pushback from CG
ministries. Through the JBSF, the Government has committed to undertaking a new
decentralization study that will take stock of current LG financing arrangements, address existing
weaknesses and lead to the development of a revised LG financing strategy. Such a commitment
is important in that (i) the findings and recommendations are owned by Government, (ii) it will
throw more light into the current challenges being faced by LGs - disconnect between
expenditure and revenue assignments leaving huge unfunded mandates, and (iii) subsequent
JBSF/PRSC prior actions will be drawn from the strategy to systematically start addressing the
problem in the LG fiscal architecture and reconcile practice and stated objectives. Background
research and development of the new strategy has been initiated under PRSC 9, and will be
subsequently completed and approved by Cabinet under PRSC 10. The implementation of the
strategy will be carefully sequenced and completed under subsequent JBSF / PRSC operations.

70.     (b) Another challenge is that CG budgeting for local government funding is
impeded by poor expenditure reporting by local governments. Reporting of spending has
been untimely and inconsistent across local governments; preventing monitoring, consolidation
and analysis of local government expenditure. Such failure weakens the information basis for
ensuring adequate and equitable funding for service delivery at the local level. PRSC 9 therefore
supports the development and implementation of a system to consolidate and analyze quarterly
local government spending using reporting Form B (prior action) and make the summary results



38
     The major focus of the 2002 Fiscal Decentralization Strategy was in four areas (i) Increase the level of discretion in LG
     financing by introducing flexibility within sector transfers; (ii) Harmonize reporting to address the proliferation of reporting
     requirements; (iii) Introduce transparent and poverty sensitive grants allocation formula; and (iv) Reduce the number of
     conditional grants by collapsing sector transfers to LGs into development and recurrent transfers.
                                                                  28
public. The related performance indicator “Percent of local governments publishing financial
transfers and budgets at local level? shows improvement in this area during PRSC8 and 9.

Prior action for PRSC 9: MoFPED has developed and implemented a system to consolidate
and analyze quarterly (Form B) reports in order to provide aggregate and in-year information
about actual LG expenditures and outputs, and has published the summary budget performance
report. Status: Met.

Trigger for PRSC 10: Cabinet approves a comprehensive revised strategy for Local
Government financing with actionable measures.39

Component 1.3. Public Financial Management (PFM)

71.    There are four key performance impediments in Public Financial Management that
are directly addressed in PRSC9:

(i) To strengthen compliance with PFM laws and regulations, more emphasis needs to be
placed on performance-based assessment of public servants, with an emphasis on both
rewards and sanctions. While Uganda has an elaborate system of PFM rules and regulations, a
major challenge has been weak compliance with these rules. A key to improved compliance is
holding senior officials accountable for PFM performance. Continuing the reform initiated in
PRSC 8, PRSC9 supports the signing of performance contracts that include compliance with
existing PFM regulations by permanent secretaries in CG ministries and by Chief Administrative
Officers in LGs (prior action). While these performance contracts build on existing regulations
which currently contain a weak enforcement and penalty system, efforts are underway to
introduce a new model for performance contracts with accounting officers, which explicitly lay
out compliance with rules and regulations on PFM as a criterion for assessing performance.
During the period of PRSC 10 Government will focus on updating the performance agreements,
rolling them out to second tier staff in government (Directors in ministries and Heads of
Departments) and ensuring their enforcement in case of breach of PFM regulations, including by
reporting to Public Expenditure Management Committee on actions taken against accounting
officers in violation of PFM regulations.

Prior action for PRSC 9: The Head of Public Service and the Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Local Government have signed annual performance agreements that include
compliance with PFM regulations, with all Permanent Secretaries in Central Government
Ministries and Chief Administrative Officers in Local Governments, respectively. The
agreements cover the period from July 1st 2010 to June 30th 2011, as stipulated by the
Government of Uganda Standing Circular No. 10 of June 2010. Status: Met.40

(ii) Strengthening internal and external audit capacity can also improve compliance. The
Internal Audit Department in MoFPED currently reports to the Accountant General, which

39
   Measures to be sequenced in subsequent PRSCs to bring LG fiscal decentralization architecture in line with the mandates of
   LGs for service delivery under decentralization.
40
   Except for one CAO that had not signed due to being on interdiction.

                                                            29
undermines its independence. In PRSC 9, MoFPED undertakes to achieve functional
independence for the internal audit department by ensuring that it reports directly to the
Permanent Secretary (PS-ST). PRSC 10 will support the internal audit department to achieve
independence under the amended Public Finance and Accountability Act (part of PRSC 10
trigger). Internal Audit Department is also supported to pilot risk-based auditing. Potential
follow-on operations would see the roll out of this system across the Central Government and
Local Governments. In parallel, during the PRSC 10 period the National Audit Office will shift
to risk-based auditing, initially on a pilot basis, and subsequently rolled out across Government.
The performance indicator “Percentage of clean audit reports? related to this area and (i) above
has improved since preparation of PRSC8 and is expected to increase further with
implementation of the above actions.

(iii) Persistent arrears build-up undermines budget credibility. The persistent build-up of
arrears has been a continuous weakness of the PFM system in Uganda. Domestic arrears during
2009/10 were estimated by the Auditor General to be of the order of Ush 176 billion or 3.2
percent of the budget. This is due to a number of reasons including inadequate allocations in the
budget for recurrent costs, inadequate provisions for catering to in-year emergency spending
needs, poor commitment controls, and spending units operating legacy systems in tandem with
the IFMIS system and building up arrears outside the IFMIS system. Furthermore, weak budget
controls have enabled spending units to exceed their annual allocations. In FY09/10, 33 spending
units incurred excess expenditures of Ush 23 billion. Government will continue its efforts to
control arrears in the period covered by PRSC 9 and 10. MoFPED has made good progress
through Straight-Through Payments for Pensions, which was a major source of arrears build-up.
It is also considering making Straight-Through Payments for utilities and rent which would bring
to light the large-scale under budgeting that happens in those areas.

(iv) Existing PFM legislation lacks provisions related to management of oil revenue and
also needs strengthening in other areas. The Public Finance and Accountability Act (PFAA)
is scheduled to be revised to: (a) ensure transparent and accountable management of oil and gas
revenues, (b) deal with the issue of supplementary budgets, (c) improve fund flows, (d) reduce
arrears, (e) improve budget formulation, budget execution and the sanction system, and (f)
ensure legal independence of internal audit.

72.     On oil revenue management, the draft Amendment Bill to the Public Finance and
Accountability Act should establish: (i) a Petroleum Fund, (ii) an Endowment (i.e., Petroleum
Investment) Fund, and (iii) a (Petroleum Revenue) Investment Advisory Committee. The
Petroleum Fund will serve as a dedicated collection account for all petroleum revenues, which
shall be collected by the Uganda Revenue Authority. The proposed Amendment specifies
procedures for ensuring accountability in the management of the Petroleum Fund, including
penalties for delayed remittances, treatment of Government‟s share of petroleum production
made in kind, and prohibits any encumbrance or earmarking of the Petroleum Fund. The
proposed Amendment also prescribes procedures for determining the annual budget funding
requirement to be financed by the Petroleum Fund which will have to laid before Parliament.

73.    Recognizing that petroleum is a finite resource, the proposed Amendment to the
Public Finance and Accountability Act also prescribes the establishment of a Petroleum
                                           30
Investment Fund (―Endowment Fund‖), as a part of the Petroleum Fund, whose purpose is
to finance investments for the benefit of current and future generations. An Investment
Advisory Committee, consisting of professionals with proven experience in finance, portfolio
and investment law, has been proposed, as part of the governance arrangement of the Petroleum
Fund to advise the Minister of Finance on petroleum fund investments.

74.     The proposed amendments will help secure the appropriate and transparent
monitoring and strict accountability of oil and gas revenues in line with international best
practice. They should ensure that reporting requirement on oil revenue management will be fully
consistent with the reporting standards and internal controls of the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) by requiring the Minister of Finance to submit timely reports of
volumes and values of petroleum produced to Parliament and the public, and also publish
comprehensive half-yearly and annual audited accounts of the Petroleum Fund.

75.    The process of developing the proposed Amendment Act has included wide public
consultation on the principles underlying these amendments. Submission to Parliament of the
Amendment Bill for the PFAA with the mentioned provisions related to oil revenue, system of
sanctions for breaches of PFM regulations, and legal independence of the Internal Audit
Department in MoFPED will be a PRSC 10 trigger.

76.    A major challenge, not just for oil revenue but also for all other revenues from the
Uganda Consolidated Fund, is the lack of a rigorous investment appraisal process for
capital investment projects. Under the JAF, GoU has committed to develop a set of transparent
methods / criteria of approval and management of Public Investment Projects to be approved by
Cabinet. MOFPED is taking steps to establish a well resourced unit for Public Investment
Appraisal within the Budget Department, and aims at having established the unit during the
period of PRSC 10.

Trigger for PRSC 10: In order to ensure transparency and strict accountability of oil and gas
revenues and prudent public financial management, Government submits to Parliament an
Amendment Bill for the Public Finance and Accountability Act that includes provisions in line
with international best practice on the establishment of a Petroleum Fund, an Endowment Fund
and a (Petroleum Revenue) Investment Advisory Committee, on the system of sanctions for
breach of PFM regulations, and on legal independence of the Internal Audit Department of
MOFPED.

Component 1.4. Compliance with Public Procurement Regulations

77.    Three key performance impediments in Public Procurement are addressed in PRSC 9:

(i) The current legal and regulatory framework for procurement is weak and needs
strengthening. Implementation of the 2003 Act exposed inadequate mechanisms for its
enforcement, and PRSC 7 and 8 have therefore supported the Government‟s efforts to amend the
Act to correct these deficiencies. The PRSC 8 prior action required that the Procurement
Amendment Bill as presented to Parliament should meet international best practice in promoting
transparency and value for money. One of the clauses in the amendments however introduced
                                              31
force account without any restriction on its application, possibly compromising value for money
in public works41 and the development of the local construction sector. As part of PRSC 8 the
Government prepared a draft regulation that restricts the application of force account to district
roads and to emergencies under which it is not possible to attract private sector firms to perform
works at reasonable prices. During Parliamentary discussion of the bill, Parliament restricted the
use of Force Account to emergencies and situations where it is not possible to attract private
contractors, therefore limiting further the possible negative impact of the initial Procurement
Amendment Bill.

78.    With the revised law now in place, PRSC 9 has supported the revision of all
implementing regulations to incorporate the changes made to the law. Under PRSC 10
Government will subsequently revise the standard bidding documents, including the specialized
bidding documents and issue these for use by the MDAs.

Prior action for PRSC 9: The prior action at concept stage required the Minister of Finance to
revise and issue procurement regulations in line with the revision to the PPDA Act as regulations
are usually issued by the Minister. However Parliament in the Amendment Act required the
Minister to issue the regulations only after Parliamentary approval. The action has hence been
amended as follows since GoU has no control over the parliamentary discussions: The Minister
of Finance has approved and submitted to Parliament the revised procurement implementation
regulations that are in line with the revised PPDA Act and which meet international best
practice. Status: Met.

Trigger for PRSC 10: PPDA reviews, revises and issues revised Standard Bidding Documents
and Requests for Proposals (including specialized bidding documents), based on the amended
PPDA Act and Regulations and meeting international best practice.

(ii) Weak monitoring has hampered enforcement of procurement law and sanctioning of
breaches. In order to address this deficiency the Government established and piloted a system
for measuring performance in public procurement. This system was initially limited to the 15
MDAs but it has allowed systematic monitoring of the (i) efficiency of the public procurement
system, (ii) extent to which value for money is being achieved, (iii) extent of compliance with
the procurement law, and (iv) transparency of public procurement. Government has recently
rolled out the system to 40 additional MDAs. The related performance indicator “Percentage of
contracts with complete procurement records in compliance with PPDA regulations? is expected
to increase over time and show better enforcement of procurement regulations.

(iii) The procurement capacity within spending entities is still weak. Capacity building is still
required to improve the capabilities of the procurement institutions. PPDA has recently
completed development of a Procurement Capacity Building Program with technical support
from the Bank. The draft program is currently under discussion with the development partners.

41
     This is due to the risks of (i) poor maintenance and misuse of force account resources such as equipment, spare parts and
      materials, (ii) conflict of interest problems as the government is both client and supplier, which commonly leads to
      inefficiencies and uncompetitive practices, and (iii) high equipment maintenance and operational costs eating into
      maintenance budgets and diverting resources from the actual works to be done.

                                                              32
The program is designed to ensure rapid scale-up of procurement training with outsourcing of
procurement training to training institutions as one of the main strategies. PRSC 10 will support
the implementation of this program with the first major step being that PPDA selects and
accredits at least 3 training institutions to conduct the procurement training under the new
program.

Component 1.5. Performance of Public Servants

79.   The PRSC prioritizes three public sector reform areas that can contribute to
improved human resources management and thereby improved service delivery efficiency
and equity.

(i) Addressing the inequitable distribution of public servants across the country, as well as
the significant variation in the level of their performance. While some central areas have
staffed up to 85 percent of available positions, in other places only 20 percent of positions are
filled – usually remote and underserved regions where civil servants are reluctant to be posted.
Overall performance in key sectors can improve only if public service positions are more evenly
staffed across the country. Thus, the adoption (in PRSC 8) and implementation of a policy to
address uneven service provision has been critical. Under PRSC 9, efforts have focused on
implementing the measures under the existing “Hard To Reach and Staff? (HTR/S) framework,
as well as on broadening and deepening the policy response, starting with the health and
education sectors. Implementation of the HTR/S strategy commenced in FY2010/11 with
payment of a 30 percent op up on salaries of all staff in the 24 HTR/S areas. Sector-specific
strategies to enhance staffing in education and health have been developed and will be
implemented under PRSC 10. Further, under PRSC 10 and in subsequent years, the Government
intends to allow greater management flexibility for accredited institutions in HTR/S areas which
will allow them to independently define incentives within budgetary limits. The related
performance indicator “Vacancy rates for education and health sector staff in “Hard To Reach
and Staff? locations is expected to decline over time.

(ii) Addressing weaknesses in the inspection and disciplinary system for public servants
that now lead to poor accountability and performance. At the highest level, the lack of action
against senior officials in the context of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
(CHOGM), National Agricultural Advisory Services and other corruption cases creates a sense
of impunity, regardless of the adoption of formal accountability mechanisms. At lower level
anomalies in the inspection and disciplinary system prevent effective recourse against abuse of
office and quiet corruption (absenteeism, „part timerism‟ etc). While at the onset of this PRSC
series technical measures (such as performance contracting, more effective inspection regimes
etc) were considered adequate to stem a deteriorating accountability environment, the further
decline in moral and ethical standards in the public service has called for the introduction of
more radical measures. Data from the first and second annual report on tracking corruption
trends (2010 and 2011, respectively42) indicate that bribery is increasing in key service delivery
sectors like the police and judiciary and the 2010 panel survey by UBOS indicates that


42
     Data taken from Global Corruption Barometer, 2009 and 2010.

                                                              33
absenteeism and „part timerism‟ remain prevalent in service delivery institutions. Under PRSC 9,
these issues have been addressed mainly by redefining inspection procedures, establishing
performance targets for inspectors, creating an organizational review of the disciplinary system
(in particular in health), and simplifying disciplinary procedures. Such effort has included the
institutionalization of joined-up inspections (harmonization of multiple inspections – sector-
based, PFM-related and HRM related).

80.     A more fundamental approach to instill a stronger sense of ethic and accountability
in the public service includes enhancing and coordinating performance management tools.
Until recently, the Government applied various disjointed performance management tools that
failed to establish linkage between resource utilization and results at service delivery level. As
part of the prior actions under PRSC 9, the Government has developed and adopted a results
oriented management and output oriented budget framework integrating the different
performance management tools, which would form the basis for a performance management
system based on the principle of „hierarchy of objectives‟. Initial priorities for application of the
framework include the elaboration and rollout of performance agreements to accounting officers,
managers of frontline service delivery units, starting with permanent secretaries, chief
administrative officers and a select number of regional referral hospitals and primary schools.
However, as noted above, the adoption of frameworks and model contracts will only be effective
if they are appropriately enforced. The Government‟s track record on enforcement of good
public management principles has been weak in recent years, hence a concretization of sanction
and reward mechanisms related to performance management is urgent and essential. As part of
the JAF actions a mechanism has been put in place to monitor chief administrative officers‟
reports on absenteeism for all staff at district level, and the guidelines for signing of performance
agreements include timelines for production of overall performance evaluation reports. As a
result of the actions in this area the related performance indicators that capture the percent of
supervisors in health and education facilities on performance agreements and the percent of those
supervisors who meet the terms of the performance agreements, are expected to increase over
time.

Prior action for PRSC 9: Single framework for Results Oriented Management (ROM), Output
Oriented Budgeting (OOB) and budget monitoring adopted by MoPS and MoFPED, including a
modality for attaching performance agreements to letters of appointment of civil servants
adopted. Status: Met.

(iii) Rolling out performance management tools and pay reforms and improving
management systems for personnel and payroll. The creation of an improved link between
performance and rewards will need to be complemented by a fundamental reform of the public
sector wage system. This could include measures such as modification of the existing system of
salary increments, and linking these to performance results, or the introduction of variation in
pay levels, based on performance. The Government is considering a departure from the rigid and
ineffective interpretation and implementation of the single spine system as it currently exists and
is developing options for a new and affordable salary structure that captures elements of job
complexity, equity and performance. Under PRSC 8 and 9, emphasis has been given to more
effective and transparent payroll management by making the Integrated Personnel and Payroll
management System (IPPS) fully operational in all MDAs and expanding it progressively to
                                                 34
districts. This is needed to effectively implement any new wage system, but has limited value in
its own right, unless the current wage system anomalies are removed. Considering the
deterioration in the quality of public service management as highlighted above, the measures
proposed under PRSC 10 will focus on adoption and implementation of a revised pay reform
strategy with a clear emphasis on sanctions and rewards.

Proposed trigger for PRSC 10: Cabinet adopts a revised fiscally sustainable pay reform
strategy, including an implementation timeline, plan for enhancing pay and transparency of
wage bill management and a framework of sanctions and rewards for performance of civil
servants, in accordance with the recommendations contained in the public service
transformation paper.

Component 1.6. Accountability and Anti-Corruption

81.    In order to complement the reforms in public financial management and public
service management that tackle systemic weaknesses, this operation incorporates measures
to improve the overall accountability link between citizens and the State. These measures
include specific efforts to draw the public‟s attention to corruption and other rent seeking
problems.

82.     Uganda has a strong legislative and policy framework for fighting corruption
embedded in the National Anti-Corruption Strategy, but continues to perform poorly in its
control of corruption. The first annual report on tracking corruption trends based on the Data
Tracking Mechanism (DTM) issued in November 2010 showed that in a study of 114 countries
Uganda had the largest implementation gap between the quality of the legal framework for
fighting corruption and its application in practice. This poor result is based on the Government‟s
weak record on tackling grand corruption, as evidenced by the limited administrative action
against all officers implicated by the audit findings related to the 2007 CHOGM, which
identified over US$44 million of inappropriate and irregular expenditure. The limited response to
corruption has been one of the weakest areas of Government performance under the JAF; also
reflected in limited progress on recovering lost CHOGM funds. The second annual report on
tracking corruption trends (November 2011) reveals increasing cases of bribery in the police and
judiciary and highlights further increases in absenteeism based on panel survey data. Similarly,
the response to other large corruption cases has remained disappointing so far, giving rise to an
increasing perception of impunity of Government‟s top officials and further lowering the bar on
corruption. These factors have led some DPs to reduce their budget support disbursements.

83.      PRSC 9 emphasizes the need to strengthen the tracking of corruption trends by the
Inspector General of Government and other key institutions. Such effort should provide
for a) the development of evidence-based data to promote anti-corruption reform and
facilitate the demand side of governance, and b) the deepening of the public dialogue about
corruption across all stakeholders. The Data Tracking Mechanism (DTM) and its indicators
were developed through a consultative process involving government representatives, oversight
institutions such as the OAG, and civil society representatives (prior action). It is managed by an
independent research institution (Economic Policy Research Center) to guarantee objectivity and
impartiality of the tracking and assessment process.
                                                35
84.     Looking forward, PRSC 10 will aim at supporting Government‘s effort to
disseminate key DTM findings, and reach out to and involve non-state actors in
monitoring. Such an effort is central in order to hold the Executive further accountable and
identify the proper remedies to increasing corruption trends (PRSC10 trigger). Recent
developments have confirmed that the Parliament and citizens‟ voices through the media are
stronger with evidence based data, leading to the stepping aside of three ministers and the
resignation of one minister, and paving the way for further investigation into high corruption
cases. The JAF will also focus on strengthening judiciary institutions for enforcement of anti-
corruption laws such as making the leadership court tribunal operational, fully constituting the
courts of law at all levels, and on monitoring the completion of criminal investigations,
prosecutions or administrative actions on high-profile cases. Lastly, the World Bank will provide
additional assistance to demand side governance initiatives, including: a) the IGG to develop
and pilot a framework to institutionalise citizen participation in monitoring corruption in
government programs; and b) conduct GAC diagnostics and political economy studies to identify
appropriate entry points for Bank interventions and monitoring implementation of existing
operations. Furthermore, the Bank through its Institutional Integrity Vice Presidency has
provided support for investigative capacity building to the IGG, the Office of the Auditor
General (OAG) and the Internal Audit Department under the MoFPED.

Prior action for PRSC 9: The Inspector General of Government has developed and agreed
upon a measurement framework (Data Tracking Mechanism) with the Inter-Agency Forum,
including indicators, for improved tracking of corruption trends and has published the first
annual report tracking corruption trends in Uganda using the Data Tracking Mechanism.
Status: Met.

Proposed Trigger for PRSC 10: Monitor implementation of recommendations from the annual
reports on corruption trends in Uganda using the Data Tracking Mechanism, and develop and
pilot a framework to institutionalize citizen participation in monitoring corruption in government
programs in one agreed service delivery sector.


Policy Cluster 2: Improving Value for Money in Public Service Delivery Sectors

Component 2.1. Health

85.   This operation addresses the two most important impediments to better
performance in providing public health services:

(i) Inadequate availability of essential medicines and health supplies in health centers.
There is a severe shortage of key health workers and drug stock outs in some districts. The
problem is not only a resource issue, but also one of management. Drug stock outs result from
weak delivery and deficient logistics management. Under PRSC 8, the Government established
the system to update the procurement plan for medicines and centralized the medicines budget
from LGs to the National Medical Stores (NMS). To strengthen drug distribution, GoU instituted
two-monthly drug delivery schedules by NMS, outsourced the “last mile distribution? from
districts to the health facilities and introduced drug kits for lower level health facilities. A
                                               36
memorandum of understanding between NMS, Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Local
Government (MoLG) has been made effective to govern drug procurement and distribution in
the country, and includes a performance matrix (PRSC 9 prior action). Subsequently, GoU will
use the new system to monitor and inspect health supplies and the drug logistics system on a
quarterly basis. On the funding side, GoU provides about 40 percent of the budget needed for
drugs and needs to significantly increase it to avoid recurrent drug shortages. The related
performance indicator “Proportion of health facilities without drug stock outs for 6 tracer drugs?
has improved since preparation of PRSC 8.

Prior Action for PRSC 9: Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Local Government (MoLG)
and the National Medical Stores (NMS) have signed and begun implementation of a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which includes a performance framework with key
performance indicators, for the distribution of essential medicines by the NMS. Status: Met.

86.     Looking ahead, the Government plans to give continuity to these activities by further
implementing the new system established in the MoU between MoH, MoLG and NMS for
quarterly monitoring and inspection of drugs and health supplies, including: (a) stock levels in
NMS; (b) drug stock outs in health facilities; and (c) distribution of essential medicines by NMS
against key performance indicators set out in the MoU. However, no trigger is being established
for PRSC 10 in this area.

87.     (ii) Insufficient availability of qualified health staff at task. Management of the human
resources for health is characterized by poor personnel management that manifests in high levels
of absenteeism, delayed recruitment, mal-distribution of staff and high staff turnover. Hard-to-
reach/staff areas are particularly constrained to recruit staff and several critical cadres remain in
short supply. Government has adopted several measures in response to these challenges. Firstly,
it has addressed the problems of attracting qualified health workers to hard-to-reach/staff areas.
During PRSC 8, Government prepared a motivation and retention strategy and a hard-to-reach
incentive scheme. During the period of PRSC 9, MoH is developing plans to roll out
implementation of the motivation strategy as part of the hard-to-reach incentive scheme in
agreement with MoPS and MoFPED and with the subsequent roll out supported during the
period of PRSC 10. Secondly, Government is also developing better information systems as tools
for better management of the sector. It set up a “human resources for health management?
information system to provide information on levels and distribution of the health workforce
(prior action in PRSC 8) which GoU is implementing further during the current and the next
fiscal year. Thirdly, GoU is establishing formal management functions (positions and structures)
for regional and general hospitals. It is actively supporting the professionalization and
strengthening of hospital management by formalizing the positions of hospital managers and
providing them with management training. It has established the position of director of regional
referral hospitals and has recruited directors. Progress in alleviating this performance
impediment will be measured through two performance indicators; “proportion of approved
posts filled by qualified health workers? and “absenteeism rate of health workers?.




                                                 37
Component 2.2. Education

88.    Uganda‘s primary school enrolment is high due to the ongoing Universal Primary
Education (UPE) program but education outcomes continue to be moderate. Over half of
the primary pupils in grades 3 and 6 perform below the desired minimum average (50 percent)
for numeracy and literacy. Uganda‟s scores in reading and mathematics have declined markedly
between 2000 and 2007. For example in 2007, Uganda scored 478.7 and 481.9 in reading and
mathematics compared to 482.4 and 506.3 in 2000, respectively. Both the low level of
performance and the declining scores can be attributed to the combination of binding constraints
which continue to affect performance in the education sector, resulting in poor service delivery.

89.   This operation addresses the four most important binding constraints or
impediments to better performance in public education delivery:

(i) Inequitable deployment of teachers causes an inequitable distribution of quality
manifest in uneven educational attainments. Pupil-to-Teacher Ratios (PTR) range from the
highs of 122:1 in Kabong district, to 33:1 in Kalangala district. To address such inequality the
World Bank has, under PRSC 9, supported MoES in instituting a new teacher allocation formula
that ensures a more equal distribution of teachers in both large and small schools.43
Implementation of this formula will be gradual and based on the wage bill provisions from the
MoPS and the teacher recruitment pace for the respective District Service Commissions (DSCs).
The first stage of implementation has already led to a significant improvement of the pupil-to-
teacher ratios in some of the remote districts in relation to the national average. With guidance
from the MoES, head teachers have continued to prioritize lower primary grades in the allocation
of teachers at the school level. The new teacher allocation formula is buttressed by the national
Hard-To-Reach-and-Staff (HTR/S) policy framework spearheaded by the Ministry of Public
Service and supported under the JBSF. The framework mainstreamed the payment of hardship
allowance to all public servants working in gazetted HTR/S duty stations as an incentive for
them to serve in these areas. The adoption of the revised pay reform strategy should improve the
allocation of additional teachers toward underserved areas, and so help improve their
performance in delivering more and better education services.

Prior action for PRSC9: Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) has, through the Education
Sector Consultative Committee (ESCC), approved a new teacher allocation formula to ensure a
more equitable distribution of teachers, and MoES has begun implementation of said allocation
formula by hiring additional teachers. Status: Met.

Proposed trigger for PRSC 10: Continue to implement the new teacher allocation formula, as
demonstrated by an increasing share of teachers deployed to HTR/S areas.

(ii) High teacher absenteeism. Teacher time–on-task continues to be low, with negative impact
on the quality of teaching through reduced instruction time, increased idle time for learners and
even learner drop out if absenteeism is too frequent. The high level of absenteeism is partly the

43
     The formula provides for a class teacher per grade as a minimum teacher threshold for all public schools, and also places the
     head teacher position over and above the required school specific teacher-to-pupil ratios.

                                                                38
consequence of weak inspection and inadequate school level management structures, together
with low teachers‟ motivation and weak enforcement of the disciplinary measures. The Quality
Enhancement Initiative monitoring studies conducted in 12 districts of Uganda indicate that
teacher attendance rates stagnated at about 72 percent in 2009 and 2010; while the proportion of
classes attended to by a teacher at the time of the survey declined from 62 percent in 2009 to 58
percent in 2010. To curb this practice, a number of initiatives were introduced in 2008 including
the Customized Performance Targets (CPTs) and the reinforcement of school inspection
(supported in PRSC 7 and 8 and also ongoing in the JBSF). The CPTs initiative is now integrated
in the newly launched national public service performance monitoring system. PRSC 9 further
supported efforts to bring down absenteeism with the introduction of public service wide
performance agreements. PRSC 10 will build upon these actions by implementing a monitoring
tool for performance contracts; covering the CPTs. School inspection has also been strengthened
through the provision of additional funds to district inspectorate divisions by the MoES. At least
75 percent of the schools in 61 districts were reported to have been inspected by March 2011.
Through the implementation of the teachers‟ Scheme of Service (career structure), about 12,000
teachers have been promoted to Senior Education Assistant position, while other non-cash
incentives have also been introduced including recognition of best teachers per district and
construction of teachers‟ houses. As a result the related performance indicator “Percent of
teachers at task in the 12 worst off districts? is expected to increase over time.

(iii) Inadequate provision of instructional materials. Low financing levels affect provision of
key inputs like instructional materials, resulting in ineffective implementation of the curriculum
reforms at the primary education levels. The PRSC 8 instituted a protected allocation of 8
percent of the non-wage budget for the primary education sub-sector towards the provision of
instructional materials for the lower primary grades 1-3. This was to facilitate the
implementation of the ongoing thematic curriculum reform. To enable effective targeting,
instructional materials have been decomposed into two groups, which are: non-textbook
materials for lower primary grades and textbook materials for upper primary levels. The former
will be provided in kits per school, where each kit includes a set of wall charts, English and local
language readers, mathematics work cards and work books. The latter will be composed by
textbooks for the four core subjects at the primary level – English, mathematics, social studies
and science. Government targets a ratio of 1 textbook to 3 pupils at this level. The 8 percent
allocation is upheld and protected as part of the JBSF and reservation of this proportion of funds
will continue up to a time when primary schools have adequate stocks of learning materials
across grades. Tracking of procured stocks and improving school level utilization and
transparency processes around textbooks is an emerging challenge.

(iv) Insufficient and ineffective community participation. School management structures
meant to improve social accountability with oversight from the local governments are also
ineffectual. These include the School Management Committees (SMCs) and the Parent-Teacher
Associations. A number of steps have been taken by the MoES in a bid to improve school
management structures including updating the Basic Requirements and Minimum Standards for
primary schools; while analytical work on the functionality of SMCs is also ongoing with World
Bank support. Capacity development programs for SMCs have been undertaken in the 12 worst
off districts targeting chairpersons and selected SMC members, and Government aims at
increasing the share of schools in the 12 worst off districts with functional SMCs over time.
                                                39
Component 2.3 Water and Sanitation

90.    This operation addresses the three most important performance impediments to
service delivery in the water and sanitation sector:

(i) Low functionality of rural water facilities and Water for Production (WfP) facilities.
Government‟s strategy for expanding supplies from rural water facilities focuses on supporting
more effective community participation in supervision and maintenance. At present, water users
are insufficiently involved in the maintenance of facilities (through Community-Based
Maintenance System (CBMS) Water User Committees), and further engagement and training of
water user and source committees is needed. Recognizing the centrality of community
involvement in water and sanitation provision, this PRSC series supports efforts by the
Government to build up the capacity of CBMS Water User Committees in order to make them
operational, aiming at increased coverage both within districts and in progressively more districts
(prior action in PRSC 8).

91.     Low functionality of Water-for-Production (WfP) is a major challenge. A survey
found that only 23 percent of facilities were functional because of weak CBMS, weak LG
capacity, non adherence to sector guidelines by LGs, weak private sector capacity, and poor
quality of construction. In response to this finding, the Government developed a new O&M
framework in 2008/09, which included new options for maintenance, including the possibility of
maintenance contracts with private operators. PRSC 9 has supported implementation of this
O&M framework with stronger engagement by the private sector and water users (prior action).
The continued implementation of the O&M framework for WfP facilities will be supported
under PRSC 10. Via its support to the JAF, PRSC 9 has additionally supported the involvement
of the private sector by developing and implementing new management and performance
contracts with water authorities and private sector operators for the urban subsector. Reflecting
the actions addressing (i), the related performance indicators “percent of improved water sources
that are functional? (rural and valley tanks/dams (WfP) are expected to increase over time.

Prior action for PRSC 9: GoU has piloted the country-wide establishment of water user bodies
for Water-for-Production Facilities (WfP), starting with at least 18 percent established and
functional bodies, and has initiated the contracting of private operators to handle day-to-day
maintenance for large WfP facilities (dams and valley tanks with capacity exceeding 40,000 m3),
starting with at least one large facility, in accordance with the Manual for Water for Production
Management Systems. Status: Met.

92.     Looking ahead, the Government will build upon the PRSC 9 prior action and continue the
implementation of the framework for Operations and Maintenance of WfP facilities to improve
functionality by at least 5 percentage points from 31 to 36 percent. However, no trigger has been
established for PRSC 10 in this area.

(ii) Increasing unit costs of service delivery accentuate the already very tight budgetary
constraint. Key factors behind the increasing unit costs are: (i) low capacity to plan and manage
contracts in LGs; (ii) exhaustion of cheap water sources, implying that new service delivery
depend on more expensive technology options; (iii) higher overhead costs due to set up costs of
                                                40
new districts; the breaking up of districts into micro-units which results in reduced planning and
contract management capacity; (iv) increasing difficulty in attracting qualified staff and reduced
economies of scale; and (v) delays and lengthy procurement processes. The remarkable increase
in production costs in urban areas is mainly attributed to high energy and treatment costs (due to
increasing water pollution). Finally, abuse of monitoring and supervision of funds at LG level
and poor contract management is also responsible for driving up unit costs. Lack of harmonised
planning and physical development plans is also a challenge in urban settings. Accordingly,
during the period of PRSC 8 a cost variation study was carried out, and subsequently the
Ministry has revised its Water and Sanitation subsector Good Governance Action plan that it will
implement over the coming year.

(iii) Low levels of sanitation and hygiene. Sanitation remains a core sector performance issue,
not only in the water sector, but also through its indirect impacts on the education and health
sectors. The key issue is the lack of prioritization of sanitation that is apparent through the very
low public spending allocated to sanitation and hygiene. Studies have established that for water
and sanitation grants, the estimated expenditure on sanitation and hygiene should reach about 4
percent of the Primary Health Care grants and the School Facilitation Grants (SFG), respectively,
while it is only 2 percent. Under the SFG, funds are used for the construction of new sanitation
facilities at schools, but do not cover promotion, operation and maintenance, or replacement of
existing toilets and latrines. Further, SFG grants are being phased out which will leave a funding
gap for school sanitation.

93.     There is broad consensus amongst sector stakeholders at the national and local
government levels that introducing a dedicated budget line for sanitation and hygiene is
needed to address the lack of prioritization and lack of allocation of funds to sanitation and
hygiene, within the conditional grant structure. Under PRSC 8, budget codes were created for
sanitation and hygiene grants in the GoU charter of accounts. Under PRSC 9, the focus has been
on MoFPED to actually allocate funds to the created budget lines but only the Ministry of Water
and Environment (MoWE) has received some funds this FY. The issue of dedicated budget lines
for grants and increased resource allocation for sanitation and hygiene is further supported under
the JAF, and under PRSC 10, where guidelines for the use of the dedicated grants will be
prepared. Further development of these guidelines will be supported under future JAFs.

94.     The water sector has taken decisive steps to address corruption and increase
transparency but further efforts are needed. The water sector began focusing attention on
governance and anti-corruption measures in 2005 and established a Good Governance Working
Group in 2006. Since then the sector has undertaken a number of studies and reports, including
water integrity studies. The 2009 Corruption risk mapping exercise, supported by the World
Bank, and subsequent baseline survey of corruption challenges in the water sector indicated that
although the water sector is perceived to be relatively well governed, it faces a number of
problem areas. Challenges include procurement irregularities, interference in the selection of
private operators, poor sector regulation, and petty corruption at the user level involving informal
user fees. These findings led to the development of a revised Good Governance Action Plan for
2009-2012. The action was again reviewed and updated by stakeholders in July 2011. In order to
capitalize on the good work done to date and the strong ministerial support for the good
governance agenda, PRSC 10 will support the implementation of this action plan.
                                                41
Component 2.4. Transport

95.      The road infrastructure in Uganda is a major contributor to economic growth and
transformation of the structure of the economy as it carries over 95% of freight and
passenger traffic. However, the road transport services are constrained by: (i) inadequate road
maintenance leading to high user costs, maintenance backlog and subsequent need for costly
rehabilitation; (ii) an inhibiting environment for private sector participation in the construction
and maintenance of roads; and (iii) axle overloading (a governance issue) that shortens the
lifespan of the roads. Each of these performance impediments is mitigated through policy
reforms supported under the PRSC series and/or the JAF.

96.     Inadequate and inconsistent funding for maintenance has had a detrimental effect
on the quality of Uganda‘s road network. Addressing this issue, PRSC 8 and 9 have supported
the establishment and operationalization of a Road Fund. Future JAFs and PRSCs should
accompany the Government in its effort to clearly define fuel levy and other road user charges in
the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) legal and administrative framework and to ensure quality
in road works through financial and technical audits. The authorities should also help ensure
stable funding for road maintenance and increased quality of the maintenance work by year-by-
year monitoring of road quality. To that effect an important first step has been to generate
national, district and sub-district data on the quality of roads, starting with the set of baseline
data, as well as to establish a monitoring and evaluation framework to systematically track
improvements in the sector. This effort has been supported under PRSC 9 (prior action). Progress
in improving road maintenance is measured through the related headline sector results “Length
in km of national/district/urban roads maintained to specified standards? (Annex 3).

97.     Obstacles to private sector participation in the roads subsector inhibit competition
on bidding on contracts and drive up unit costs for construction. Improving the conditions
under which private companies can transparently and successfully bid for contracts should
become a priority to reduce unit costs. Therefore, in order to improve transparency and
accountability in the roads subsector Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) will seek to
obtain procurement accreditation from PPDA and commence implementation of an independent
and parallel bid evaluation process (PRSC10 trigger). The related performance indicator “Percent
of expenditure for maintenance works executed by the private sector? is expected to increase
over time.

98.    Increased efforts are being made to control axle loads and to address road safety. A
very high share (54 percent) of the weighed trucks are overloaded and road accidents stand at
about 3,000 fatalities per annum, causing a loss of about 2% of the country‟s GDP per annum.
Overloaded trucks shorten the lifespan of infrastructure investments and of productive assets
such as trucks, resulting in increased costs to both the public and the private sector. A national
roads safety policy has been drafted and a national roads safety authority is being established to
address the endemic road safety situation. During the period of PRSC 9, Government is




                                                42
implementing the first stage of an action plan44 to combat axle overloading and will further
implement the second stage of the action plan in the period covered by PRSC10.

Prior action for PRSC9: GoU has collected data on the condition of national, district, urban
and community access roads and established a baseline, and has established and
operationalized a Monitoring & Evaluation framework to measure key road sector performance
indicators.
Status: Met.

Trigger for PRSC 10: In order to improve transparency and accountability in the road sector,
UNRA obtains procurement accreditation from PPDA and commences the implementation of an
independent and parallel bid evaluation process.


                                     VI. IMPLEMENTATION
                            IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

99.    Implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the PRSC are conducted through
the Joint Budget Support Framework, which is aligned with national processes. The Office
of the Prime Minister (OPM) leads implementation of the JBSF. The JBSF will be managed
through the existing government coordination framework, which has four levels: the Cabinet
level through the Policy Coordination Committee (PCC) under the Prime Minister; the
Implementation Coordination Steering Committee (ICSC) under the Head of Public
Service/Secretary to Cabinet; the Technical Implementation Coordination Committee (TICC)
under the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Prime Minister; and in Sector Working
Groups (SWGs). A JBSF development partner technical and policy dialogue taskforce meets
frequently to oversee the JBSF, and a JBSF development partner Policy Committee (Heads of
Mission) meets about monthly and also 3 times a year with the Government‟s PCC committee
and other high-level government committees.

100. Below the level of monitoring by OPM and MoFPED, sector performance is also
monitored through the SWGs, which coordinate closely with the JBSF technical and policy
dialogue taskforce. Government and DPs assess the performance of each sector annually,
discuss emerging issues, and agree on new undertakings and quantitative targets at Joint Sector
Reviews and subsequently confirm them in the annual JAF identification process. Following the
Joint Sector Reviews Government undertakes its annual performance review and prepares the
“Government Annual Performance Report?. JBS DPs undertake data and information gathering
for the annual JAF appraisal concurrently and jointly with the Government‟s own performance
review and DPs‟ JAF appraisal report is limited to a response to the “Government Annual
Performance Report?; hence, DPs are using government systems to a large extent.



44
     These include: launch an axle load control campaign, recruit an axle load advisor, put into operation 6 additional weigh
     bridges, begin measuring the percentage of vehicles complying with the Axle Load Regulations, and amend the Traffic and
     Road Safety Act, 1998 to strengthen the regulatory framework and harmonize it with regulations developed under the EAC.

                                                             43
101. Development partners in JBSF have provided funding for a Technical and
Administrative Support Unit (TASU), whose purpose is to support the JBSF Development
Partners Taskforce in technical and administrative JAF process activities as well as analytical
work relevant to the JBSF. TASU is funded out of a multi donor trust fund and became fully
operational in the last quarter of FY10/11. TASU has a dedicated staff member focusing on
communications who will ensure that the JBSF process and results are communicated to civil
society.

                                POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

102. There are no adverse distributional effects anticipated from the policies supported
by the PRSC series, but many reforms are expected to bring modest benefits to the poor
and lagging areas, especially in the delivery of social services in remote areas. A
comprehensive Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) was therefore not deemed
necessary. Other measures are related to institutional reforms to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of government spending to the benefit of all people. The reforms are designed to
improve the quality of services across the board but vulnerable groups who predominantly rely
on public social services will benefit the most without necessarily disadvantaging other groups.

103. The prior actions for budget predictability, funding at service delivery, performance
management and distribution of drugs are aimed at improving efficiency of public
spending on health, education and water. These reforms are aimed at ensuring timely release
of funds for service delivery, bringing scrutiny of the expenditure composition of local
governments to identify allocative inefficiencies, and reinforce effective performance
management of public servants. This will minimize disruptions of delivery of services, improve
the quality of services in general and strengthen value for money in service delivery. These
benefits will accrue to all people on the entire welfare distribution, but the poor who
predominantly rely on public social services will benefit more.

104. The reforms on PFM, procurement and accountability and anti-corruption lay the
foundation for transparency and accountability that will be crucial for Uganda to succeed
as an oil economy, ensuring that oil becomes a blessing rather that a curse in Uganda.
Success in managing oil will boost economic growth which will have indirect positive effects on
the poor. The implementation of the Data Tracking Mechanism will provide a publicly available
measure on the extent and evolution of corruption in the country, build an informed citizenry in
the process and raise demand for high accountability and good governance. The implementation
of recommendations from the Data Tracking Mechanism report is a major step towards holding
public officials accountable which will enhance public financial management. This is expected to
bring modest direct positive social benefits to the society but indirect effect through better and
transparent fiscal management is anticipated to lead to improved budget allocation and service
delivery to the most vulnerable segments of the population.

105. The policy reforms on education specifically target improvements on service
delivery in lagging regions, which also account for a high proportion of poverty. The
objective to equalize education attainments across regions will therefore lead to reduction in


                                               44
poverty. Projections from the analysis of regional inequality in Uganda show that equalizing
educational attainment across regions will reduce poverty by about 9 percent.

106. Policy reforms in health and water and sanitation sectors support improvements in
the delivery of services predominantly accessed by the poor. In the health sector, the poorest
quintile and the lagging regions (particularly the North) are more than twice likely to access
drugs from government health facilities than people in the richest quintile and the national
average. Similarly, reforms in the water and sanitation sector target improved access in rural
areas and the cattle corridor (the poorest area in the country) where most of the Water for
Production Facilities were constructed or rehabilitated. These reforms thus have a pro-poor
targeting focus.

107. The JBSF partners, through the TASU, will fund analytic work that will closely
monitor the eventual distributional impacts of the program supported by the PRSC series
and JAF. When possible, this work will be done jointly by both government and external
researchers. In preparation for future operations, further PSIA work might be needed.

                                             ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

108. The PRSC is not expected to result in major adverse, or irreversible, environmental
impacts. Potential environmental impacts are expected to be minor in education and health and
moderate in road and water/sanitation sectors, given the nature of sector activities which focus
on service delivery. Moreover, any potential unanticipated adverse effect will be addressed by
appropriate Ugandan institutions, whose capacity for environmental management is evolving.
Table 5 shows the investment projects that complement PRSC 9. These investment projects
incorporate Bank safeguards, management plans, and monitoring of environmental and social
performance indicators, and include sector-specific measures for enhancing environmental
management capacity.

109. While the direct impact on the environment of PRSC-supported reforms is expected
to be minimal, increased transparency and accountability will help implementation of
environmental management systems. The positive impacts stem from general emphasis on
good governance, improved procurement and financial management, and other aspects of civil
service reform, such as improved staffing in hard to reach/staff areas and focus on results
oriented management. Positive environmental impacts will also come from the PRSC focus on
improving the number and coverage of operational water user committees responsible for
improved management of water resources, including protection and management of immediate
surroundings of water points.

                                               FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

110. Financial Systems of Bank of Uganda (BoU): The Safeguards Assessment of the BoU,
completed by the IMF in 2003 and updated in 2007 identified strengths and vulnerabilities in
BoU‟s financial systems. IMF noted additional risks in external and internal audits that have
since been mitigated by the BoU through a mechanism to monitor and report on the
implementation of external audit recommendations. Audited financial accounts are put before the
legislature within the statutory period of three months after the end of the financial year; an
Audit and Governance Committee of the Board is in place to ensure that both internal and
external audit findings and recommendations, as well as follow up actions taken, are
appropriately communicated to the Governor and the Audit Committee of the Board for further
action. On a continuous basis, Internal Audit Function provides independent assurance to
Management and the Board through operational, financial and compliance audits of all BoU
departments.



                                                           46
111. During 2010/11, BoU implemented an off-the-shelf core banking system called BoU
Banking System to improve service delivery to its customers which will include internet
banking modules, since it manages most government projects including all Bank funded
programs.

112. In line with the IMF Safeguards Assessment guidelines, the BoU now reconciles
economic and financial data each quarter by reviewing the Monetary Authority Balance sheet
and the BoU Balance sheet. It has created an audit plan assessing the risks to its operations and
the related control environment. Since it instituted a risk management framework in 2005, BoU
conducts a risk management review on an annual basis.

113. GoU Budget Management, Internal Controls and Reporting: The 2008 PEFA
examined PFM reforms from 2006 to 2008. It noted improvements in budget classification and
comprehensiveness and oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public sector entities. It also
indicated improved stock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears, though some
commitments are not captured by the government IFMIS system in various MDAs. Transparency
of taxpayer obligations and liabilities, together with taxpayer registration and assessment, has
also improved, as has the availability of improved and timely annual financial reports attributed
to IFMIS. Progress was also noted on the use of the International Public Sector Accounting
Standards framework, and related training and capacity building for staff in central and local
governments has been conducted.

114. Oversight institutions are being strengthened. GoU passed the 2008 Audit Act, which
gives the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) full autonomy in terms of budgeting and
operations. The OAG was sufficiently funded by Government in 2009/10 and 2010/11 to
increase his audit scope, staffing and execution of audits to include Value For Money (VFM)
audits. In the current Parliament, the Public Accounts Committee and the Local Government
Public Accounts Committee have improved their follow up on irregularities identified in the
Auditor General‟s reports.

115. Procurement. The major country procurement risks are (i) limited compliance with the
Act as indicated in PPDA‟s Audit Reports, (ii) inadequate capacity and experience in the MDAs‟
procurement entities to conduct procurement, and (iii) weak procurement planning, which results
in delays in procurement.

116. The national legislation on public procurement as laid out in the Public
Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act (PPDA 2003) is generally consistent with
World Bank guidelines, except: (i) negotiation of contracts under competitive bidding; (ii) the
use of merit point evaluation for the procurement of goods; (iii) pre-qualifying bidders and then
inviting only a few on a rotational basis; and (iv) inadequate procedures to select consultants.
These provisions are being addressed under the proposed PRSC (see paragraphs 77-78).

117. The 2008 PEFA found deficiencies in procurement plans at MDAs. These include
emergency procurements, procurements of non required items, and procurement at higher prices
than necessary. Procurement is decentralized to over 200 procuring entities in central and local
government and reporting to the central regulatory body is poor. The report also highlights
                                                47
special audits and payroll cleaning exercises that have taken place, but follow up is not
sufficiently transparent. Internal controls exist, but audit reports show that they are violated or
ignored. Systemic controls in the IFMIS prevent any commitment that would take cumulative
expenditure above the cumulative quarterly limits, but the IFMIS is sometimes bypassed and
commitments are made outside the IFMIS, so some Government units continue to accumulate
arrears. Remedies to some of these risks were proposed in the recent review of FINMAP.

                                DISBURSEMENTS AND AUDITING

118. The credit will be disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness. The disbursement
will follow IDA‟s simplified procedures for development policy lending against satisfactory
implementation of the program. IDA will disburse the proceeds into an account designated by
the GoU that is part of the country's foreign exchange reserves accounts. If the proceeds of the
credit or any part thereof are used for excluded expenditures (for example, to finance goods or
services on the standard negative list) as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require
the Borrower to either: (i) return that amount to the foreign reserve account for use for eligible
purposes, or (ii) refund the amount directly to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request
shall be cancelled.

119. The administration of this credit will be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Finance. The following summarizes the fiduciary assurance requirements for the credit:

(a)    Foreign reserve account. The GoU will acknowledge receipt to IDA that the money has
been deposited in the foreign reserve account and the amount was credited in local currency to
the GoU Consolidated Fund Account. While no audit is required, it is expected that confirmation
of receipt will be signed off by both the Accountant General and the Auditor General. IDA
reserves the right to request an audit of the account as provided for in the financing agreement.

(b)     Public (government) accounts. The Auditor General is required by law to produce
his/her annual GOU audit report to Parliament on the public accounts within nine months of the
fiscal year end, and the report for the year ended June 2010 audit report was issued by March 31,
2011. IDA has always had access to those audited accounts.

120. Bank of Uganda Accounts. The annual entity financial statements of the Bank of
Uganda are publicly available. The latest report of June 30, 2011, has been published. The recent
report has a clean audit opinion with Matters of Emphasis regarding the capital reserves and was
issued in September 2011 in compliance with the law.

                                  RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
121. The proposed operation faces a series of risks that are linked to the country‘s
exposure to external shocks and to the recent slippage in fiscal and macroeconomic policy.
Those risks should be mitigated by appropriate measures, supported by the PRSC framework and
the recent PSI review. The close monitoring of fiscal and monetary indicators is warranted both
in the short and medium term. In the medium term, the main challenge will be associated to the
expected large revenues from oil revenues that will have to be managed appropriately so that the
country will be able to benefit rather than suffer from this natural blessing.
                                                  48
122. Overall Macroeconomic Policy Management. For over two decades, Uganda has
maintained a consistent program of prudent macroeconomic management and structural reform.
Over the past two years, fiscal slippage has occurred partially as the result of exogenous shocks
and the political cycle. In FY2011/12, the Government has reaffirmed its commitment to fiscal
sustainability as part of the IMF program and strong adjustment measures have been adopted
such as the recent increase in electricity tariffs, limited fiscal execution, and limited monetary
expansion. In the future, the risk of a deteriorating macroeconomic policy stance could be
compounded by the future availability of oil resources and possible frustration over the slow
pace of structural transformation, which could lead some policy makers to question pro-market
policies and advocate for more state intervention and policy reversals. Uganda is also vulnerable
to exogenous shocks, including weather conditions and international developments, including the
evolution of the Euro crisis that could severely affect trade, remittance and aid flows. To help
mitigate those economic risks, the Bank and the Fund will continue their close monitoring and
policy dialogue on economic policies, and the JBSF should provide some predictability on
current as well as future budget support commitment.

123. Fiscal and debt sustainability. The deterioration of fiscal policy over the past two years
has eroded Uganda‟s track record of sound macroeconomic management and led to a rapid
increase in debt stocks. Even as GOU commits to stringent fiscal adjustment in FY11/12, further
pressures could arise from supplementary public expenditure related to non-prioritized
implementation of the presidential manifesto and increased public administration costs resulting
from the continuing creation of new districts. In addition, debt distress can increase as the result
of higher interest rates on government securities, increased quasi-fiscal risks associated with
contingent liabilities, and lower than expected growth dividend from public investments. One
source of quasi-fiscal risks could be potentially higher electricity subsidies for expensive thermal
generation if the Bujagali hydropower project is delayed. Furthermore, as the GOU explores
possibilities of non-traditional sources of funding, including non-concessional borrowing, the
likelihood of guarantees and other similar contingent liabilities will rise. To mitigate these risks
the PRSC series has focused on policies designed to improve expenditure efficiency and Value
for Money. The Bank is also continuing its technical support so that the Government can
improve its investment planning processes and strengthen implementation and absorption
capacity. Recently, the Bank provided support to the energy sector by collaborating in an update
of the Energy Sector Strategy.

124. Political and governance risk. Over several decades, Uganda has enjoyed political
stability and progress towards multi-party democracy. The sitting president has been in power
since 1986 and has had his mandate renewed through multi-party elections since 2006. To
mitigate political risks to the implementation of the country‟s development strategy, GoU
prepared Uganda's five-year National Development Plan in a broad based consultative process.
GoU has reiterated its commitment to adhere to the key priority areas and policy directions
spelled out in the NDP. Third party monitoring arrangements are being designed and political
economy assessments are underway to inform and guide Bank interventions. While the NDP and
the President's new Manifesto both commit to better governance, implementation remains a


                                                49
challenge and the governance environment has slightly deteriorated over the past few years45. On
the other hand, prosecution of select senior level officials on corruption cases is progressing. To
mitigate governance risk, the Bank is working with GoU to strengthen institutions and
accountability systems. Under this operation support has been rendered to develop and
implement the Data Tracking Mechanism (aimed at tracking corruption trends) as well as to
implement performance agreements for Government officials. As part of the JAF the Bank
continues to work with GoU to ensure implementation of the CHOGM action plan, including
recovery of funds and prosecution.

125. Exogenous risks can adversely affect Uganda. Large fluctuations in world commodity
prices, such as coffee (a major export crop), are a risk. The Bank is working with GoU to provide
agri-business advisory services as well as to promote agricultural diversification and increased
usage of storage facilities. Extreme weather conditions such as prolonged drought or heavy
rainfall also pose risks to the country. The Bank is providing mitigation assistance through
support to agricultural advisory services, strengthening environmental and natural resource
management, assisting with disaster risk preparedness, and supporting the preparation of a
national climate change policy to encourage the mainstreaming of climate change considerations
into public infrastructure investments. Disruption of access to the sea port in Kenya could affect
exports and imports. To provide an alternative route, the Bank is rehabilitating a rail wagon ferry
for use on Lake Victoria, to connect to the sea via Tanzania, where the Bank is also providing
assistance to improve the efficiency of the Dar-es-Salaam port. The risk of conflict or political
instability in one of Uganda‟s neighbors still exists, with possible negative spillover effects on
Uganda.

126. Donor coordination around budget support, while useful could pose a dual risk.
First, increasing transaction costs linked to close monitoring can lead to “fatigue? from the
donors‟ and Government‟s sides. Second, the use of common policy and monitoring frameworks
can produce rigidities and prevent adjusting to ever-changing conditions. To manage this risk,
the Bank has worked with its partners to increase the flexibility of the joint program during its
implementation. Partners have also worked out a coordination structure and dispute resolution
mechanism under the JBSF that are expected to be formalized in a Memorandum of
Understanding between the Government and JBSF Partners in the course of 2012.

      These targets are over ambitious and have been reviewed based on the past performance in JAF I-III. The Education and Sports sector will
      establish the causes of poor performance in literacy at P3 and P6 and together with EDPs agree appropriate interventions. These
      interventions will be incorporated into the sector work plan for FY 2012/13.

IMF EXECUTIVE BOARD COMPLETES THIRD REVIEW UNDER POLICY SUPPORT INSTRUMENT FOR
UGANDA
Press Release No. 12/8
January 13, 2012
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third review under the
Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Uganda. In completing the review, the Board approved a waiver of
nonobservance of the ceiling on net credit to government and the modification of quantitative assessment
criteria.
The PSI for Uganda was approved on May 12, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/195) and aims at maintaining
macroeconomic stability and alleviating constraints to growth. The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for
low-income countries that may not need, or want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice,
monitoring and endorsement of their policies. PSIs are voluntary and demand driven (see Public Information
Notice No. 05/145).
Following the Executive Board‟s discussion on Uganda, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Ugandan authorities have appropriately tightened monetary policy to help reverse the acceleration in
inflation over the past nine months, in light of increasing evidence that external events have spilled over into
underlying domestic inflation. Restrained fiscal policy will support disinflation efforts. The tighter policy
stance should facilitate a rebuilding of international reserves and reduce exchange rate volatility. Given
higher interest rates and inflation, the Bank of Uganda will also reinforce financial sector supervision.
“Growth is likely to slow in 2012 in light of tighter policies combined with a weaker global growth outlook.
However, rapid disinflation is critical to restore the stable macroeconomic environment that has been a
necessary foundation for Uganda‟s strong and inclusive growth over the past decade.
“Subsidies to the power sector have grown quite large and consume resources urgently needed to implement
Uganda‟s National Development Plan. The authorities have announced a significant increase in tariffs, which
will contain subsidy costs this fiscal year. For the future, they are committed to establishing a system to
adjust tariffs automatically in line with changes in underlying costs.
“Over the medium term, the authorities plan to bring their revenue effort in line with other East African
countries, mainly by eliminating tax exemptions and incentives. They are also taking steps to put in place a
more robust budget management system, including a prudent petroleum revenue management framework?,
Mr. Shinohara added.
