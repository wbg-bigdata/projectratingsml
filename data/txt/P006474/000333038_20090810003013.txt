F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the project were to increase and sustain agricultural production,
productivity and farm incomes and assist in the conservation of natural resources



                                              ii

through: (a) promoting the adoption of sustainable, modern forms of land management
and soil, water and forest conservation planned and implemented at the microcatchment
level and with full involvement of the farming community; (b) developing community
environmental awareness and participation in environmental protection efforts; (c)
increasing the extent and duration of vegetative soil cover, thus better protecting the soil
against sealing under intense summer rainfall; and (d) improving internal soil structure
and drainage, thus increasing water infiltration, and safely disposing of any remaining
runoff.

  This is to be achieved through six components:
  (i) technology and institutional development to increase awareness of natural resource
management issues and facilitate participatory management of land resources;
  (ii) adaptive agricultural research to provide technical solutions for soil conservation,
integrated pest management, disposal of residual inputs and crop diversification;
  (iii) incentive program for sustainable natural resource management and conservation
through community awareness building, the provision of grants for demonstration plots
and greater enforcement of land legislation;
  (iv) erosion control along rural roads;
  (v) training of extension agents and beneficiaries and;
  (vi) monitoring and evaluation.

  The above interventions are to be enacted on a microwatershed level in order to take
advantage of: (a) geographical unit, of a more manageable size, linked by hydrological
processes; (b) stronger social cohesion within micro-watersheds; (c) ease of monitoring
and measuring results; and (d) ease of scaling micro-watershed management projects to
other areas such as downstream communities.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1    Country and Sector Background: The São Paulo Land Management III Project was first
appraised in 1992 and negotiated in 1994 but the State's fiscal difficulties prevented Board
presentation. Conclusion of debt restructuring with the Federal Government and a request from
the State for the Bank to re-initiate project processing, prompted re-appraisal and re-negotiation
of the project/loan in 1997. In the early 1990s, macroeconomic stabilization concerns dominated
the Federal Government's policy agenda but increasingly, the focus was shifting towards
agriculture, rural poverty and the environment. Government withdrew certain incentives fostering
agricultural expansion into less agro-ecologically suitable areas. Opportunities created by
MERCOSUL prompted farmers to seek more cost-effective and environmentally benign
technologies and to increase productivity through more intensive use of existing farm lands and
rural infrastructure, especially in major agricultural areas of the South and Southeast. Irrigation,
soil conservation, environmental protection, livestock disease control, efficient marketing and
storage and wider application of research results became core concerns of the sector.

1.1.2    Bank Support for the Sector: Bank support for government's reforms was twofold: (a)
through the development of more efficient, modern systems of agricultural services with greater
beneficiary and private sector participation, enhanced by privatization and decentralization
efforts; and (b) maintaining dialogue with policy-makers, academics and the private sector to
extend sector reforms and prevent their reversal. The Bank had already financed two innovative
natural resources management (NRM) and micro-catchment development projects: the Paraná
Land Management I Project (Loan 3018-BR, US$63.0 million, 1989) and the Santa Catarina
Land Management II Project (Loan 3160-BR, US$33.0 million, 1991).1 These projects, with the
participation of farmers organized around micro-catchments, the private sector and municipal
governments, were seen as models validating the micro-watershed approach to NRM, both in
Brazil and in other parts of Latin America. Other, similar projects were approved in 1996 and
1997 in the States of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul respectively, drawing directly on lessons
learned from the two initial operations.

1.1.3    State of São Paulo: São Paulo was at appraisal (and remains) Brazil's richest and most
populous state, with a massive industrial sector and an important agriculture sector contributing
about 15% of national agricultural output. Land ownership showed medium levels of
concentration relative to the Brazilian context and farms of <100 ha represented 88% of the total.
The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR, Report No.17074-BR) details the state's dominance in the
production of many key food and industrial crops. The state had well-developed sector
institutions, a well-organized private sector and producer cooperatives handling most input
supply, output storage and marketing facilities/services, and technical assistance was widely
available to farmers through field extension professionals and private agricultural planning
companies. However, pressure was mounting on the natural resource base: deforestation, land
degeneration, rising production costs, declining growth in yields of key crops and consequent

declining profitability were of urgent concern both to farmers ­ commercial and smaller-scale -
and authorities.

1.1.4    State Government Actions: Government had already taken important steps: (a) mapped
the erosion risk and evaluated erosion damage and its regional impact in the Peixe-Paranapanema
River ­ a system covering one-third of the state; (b) created the Water Resources Council with
conditions for a decentralized State Water Resource Management System; and (c) initiated a pilot
State Micro-catchment Program (P-PEMH), managed/coordinated by the Secretariat of
Agriculture (SAA), to promote soil conservation. The State had also promulgated in 1988 the
Land Use and Conservation Law. Micro-watersheds were supported through incentive programs
to promote mechanical soil conservation practices such as terracing. However, works under the P-
PEMH were undertaken largely on an individual basis with little community participation, and
the pilot was too small to have demonstration effects at the state level. Of critical importance, the
Land Use Law was not yet regulated and thus could not be enforced. While farmers demanded
expansion of the P-PEMH, the lessons indicated certain changes were needed, which were
designed into the Bank-supported, re-designed São Paulo operation appraised in 1997 (2.1
below).

1.1.5    Rationale for Bank Involvement: Poverty reduction and equitable growth were core
objectives of the Brazil Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 1997) reflected in Bank support for:
(a) structural reforms to consolidate stabilization and foster private sector-led growth; (b) poverty
alleviation through broad-based growth and socially-targeted programs including rural; (c)
infrastructure expansion; and (d) promotion of environmentally sustainable development. The
Bank and Government saw that soil erosion in the country's most productive farmlands of the
mechanized South, Southeast and Center-West threatened to undermine efficiency gains and
affect local eco-systems through water pollution and the sedimentation of rivers. Further, zones
with the highest susceptibility to erosion harbored a significant number of small farmers. Bank
support was expected to help the State of São Paulo develop economically viable investments in
soil conservation, water pollution control, and overall land management and, to implement a
decentralized, transparent and integrated approach to NRM at the grass roots level directed
mainly to more vulnerable areas and populations.

1.1.6    Origins of Bank Support: Two key factors prompted Government to seek Bank support:
the sobering conclusions of the 1986 Peixe-Paranapanema study and farmers' rising concern
about widespread siltation of river beds and reservoirs and sheet/gully erosion; and, emerging
evidence that the micro-watershed strategy being tested by the State - and more extensively by
other neighboring states - was effective. However, as described in 1.1.1 above, the State's
financial difficulties prevented Board presentation of the project until 1997.

1.1.7    Adjustments were made to project design in 1997 to reflect: (a) institutional, economic
and political changes at the State level since 1994; (b) lessons learned from similar projects in
Paraná and Santa Catarina; (c) the State's experience with implementing the P-PEMH in a limited
number of micro-catchments, in this same period; and (d) the need for greater transparency and
decentralization of project activities in line with broad and evolving trends in Bank lending for
smaller-scale rural producers and family farmers, consistent with the new Brazilian Constitution
of 1988 which decentralized key responsibilities/functions from the Federal level to the States
and municipalities.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

1.2.1     As stated in the SAR, the project sought to "increase and sustain agricultural production,
productivity and farm incomes and assist in the conservation of natural resources by: (a)
promoting the adoption of sustainable, modern forms of land management and soil, water and
forest conservation, planned and implemented at the micro-catchment level and with full
involvement of the farming community; (b) developing community environmental awareness and
participation in environmental protection efforts; (c) increasing the extent and duration of
vegetative soil cover, thus better protecting the soil against sealing under intense summer rainfall;
and (d) improving internal soil structure and drainage, thus increasing water infiltration, and
safely disposing of any remaining runoff."2 The Project also sought to strengthen the capacity of
the State of São Paulo to more efficiently implement an expanded natural resource management
and conservation program. A Project Monitoring Letter (September 11, 1997) listed PDO
indicators (see Datasheet).      3



1.3        Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

1.3.1     The PDO was not revised but following the Mid-term Review (section 2.2), several PDO
indicators (and output indicators) were adjusted to reflect slower than expected implementation
(Annex 2, Tables 2.1 and 2.2).4

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1     The project was part of the Bank's Program of Targeted Interventions. The primary target
group comprised 90,000 farm families representing 30% of the State's total farms; 85% of these
families had holdings of less than 100 ha. Project efforts were to concentrate on highly eroded
areas or those susceptible to erosion, and also showing the highest concentration of poverty.5
Based on the erosion and poverty coefficients, areas of intervention were ranked as high, medium
and low priority. The intention was to concentrate 70% of project resources in areas of high
priority, 27% in areas with medium and about 3% in areas with low priority. Nevertheless, as       6

stated in the SAR, because the project's main objective was improved NRM, highest priority was
to be given to the soil erosion coefficient rather than to poverty concentration. The project was
designed to include about 1,500 micro-watersheds covering 4.5 million ha, to be selected from
among the State's 40 Regional Rural Development Divisions (EDR).

1.5 Original Components


2 The ICR follows the ICR Guidelines that the PAD (in this case SAR) statement of objectives prevails. The statement
of PDO in the Loan Agreement differs from the SAR in some respects, without affecting intended meaning.
3  The results were expected to be increased farm profitability and reduced loss of topsoil, silting of reservoirs and
stream beds, floods, destruction of rural roads, falling water tables, pollution of water sources and depletion of natural
resources.
4 The Loan Agreement was not amended to reflect changes to PDO indicators.
5  EDRs were ranked by: (i) susceptibility to soil erosion, a coefficient incorporating potential for erosion, soil
degradation expected, existing erosion, and regional concentration of small and medium farmers, and level of farmers'
response to the pilot program; and (ii) concentration of poverty, a coefficient measuring the concentration of farmers
with less than two minimum salaries per month. One minimum salary is R$415/month, about US$236 at current rate of
exchange. Each of the 40 EDRs was ranked on three levels depending on poverty concentration, with poverty defined
as families with earnings of <two minimum salaries/month. Poverty ranking was based on the Institute of Applied
Research (IPEA) "Mapa de Fome", and on the "Conjuntura Alimentária" of the State Secretariat of Agriculture and
Supply (SAA).
6 Area 1: 310 municipalities, 1,050 micro-watersheds (70% of total); Area 2: 234 municipalities, 405 micro-watersheds
(27%); and Area 3: 102 municipalities, 45 micro-watersheds (3%).

1.5.1     The project had six components and eight sub-components (SAR, Section 2D) designed
to be executed at a micro-watershed level to take advantage of: (a) geographical units of a more
manageable size for intervention planning purposes, linked by hydrological processes; (b)
stronger social cohesion within micro-watersheds; (c) ease of monitoring and measuring results;
and (d) ease of scaling micro-watershed management projects to other areas such as downstream
communities. Components and subcomponents are summarized below with details in Annex 2.7

1.5.2     Component 1: Technology and Institutional Development (US$32.90 million, 26.40%
of total cost) to support the project's technical strategy and provide farmers with technical
assistance to foster their adoption of recommended natural resources management practices.
Three subcomponents would develop micro-catchment land users' awareness and technical
knowledge to improve NRM and farm families' participation in the process: (a) Rural Extension;
(b) Rural Organization; and (c) Agro-ecological Mapping.

1.5.3     Component 2:            Adaptive Agricultural Research (US$3.00 million, 2.40% of total
cost) supporting the project's technical strategy by testing and demonstrating the effectiveness of
existing technology in soil conservation, land management and pollution control, and generating
and disseminating new applied technology for different soil and agronomic conditions.

1.5.4     Component 3: Incentive Program for Natural Resource Management and
Conservation (US$31.40 million, 25.18% of total costs) to induce and accelerate the adoption of
improved NRM and conservation techniques by micro-watershed communities, with five sub-
components: (a) Environmental Education; (b) Incentive Fund for Soil Management and
Conservation, and Pollution Control;8 (c) Incentive for Recovery of Degraded Lands; (d) Forestry
Development; and (e) State Environmental Law Enforcement.

1.5.5     Component 4:            Erosion Control Works along Rural Roads (US$27.40 million,
21.97% of total cost) to improve year-round access and reduce maintenance costs on about 6,000
km of rural roads by overcoming localized erosion and preventing water run-off along benefiting
micro-catchments.

1.5.6     Component 5: Training and Communication (US$11.50 million, 9.22% of total cost)
financed training for CATI technicians in modern NRM and soil conservation practices,
environmental awareness and communication, technical strategy and operational procedures, and
Bank fiduciary requirements. Regional and state level workshops would promote/disseminate
project activities, experiences and results.

1.5.7     Component 6:             Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$6.30
million, 5.05% of total costs). The Project Management Unit (PMU) created in 1997 within
CATI but reporting directly to the SAA, was responsible for the coordination, management and


7  Total cost of the six components listed above is US$112.50 million. This does not include another US$12.20 million
in physical and price contingencies, giving an estimated total project cost of US$124.70 million.
8  The IP financed five types of subprojects. For farmer groups: (i) collective purchase of farm implements for reduced
tillage and improved land management; (ii) water supply systems for agro-chemical mixing points to avoid pollution;
and for individual farmers: (iii) land management practices; (iv) protective fencing along water courses; and (v) seeds
for adubo verde (green fertilizer) crops.

execution of the Adaptive Research, Incentive Program for NRM and Conservation, and Rural
Roads components, and the Agro-ecological Mapping subcomponent. Also financed were mid-
term and ex-post evaluations of the project's socio-economic impact to be contracted to a state
university, and monitoring case studies within 12 micro-watersheds to measure project impact
(see 2.3).

1.6 Revised Components

1.6.1   The project Mid-term Review resulted in quantitative and qualitative changes, of which
key elements were consolidated in amendments to the Loan Agreement in 2006 and changes to
the Operational Manual. Changes in components/subcomponents are noted below and described
more fully in Annex 2. Other changes are summarized in Section 1.7.

    (a) Adaptive Agricultural Research Component: This was eliminated due to lack of interest
         from research institutions, and implementation period too short to permit meaningful
         research results.   Limited adaptive research was reinstated under the agricultural
         extension rubric.
    (b) Environmental Education Subcomponent: This was eliminated as a discrete activity in
         favor of distributing its activities within the Training and Dissemination Component and
         the Rural Extension Subcomponent.
    (c) Mapping Subcomponent: Technical/other reasons prevented contracting of private firms
         to execute this subcomponent. CATI resolved the situation by successfully developing its
         own methodology and in-house, technical expertise.
    (d) Soil Management and Conservation Incentive Subcomponent: The Soil Conservation
         Law governing the menu of soil management and conservation activities which could be
         supported by the project was already obsolete and restrictive, impeded the functioning of
         the Incentives Fund and was formally amended (i.e., liberalized).
    (e) Rural Organization Subcomponent: The planned technical approach of forming and
         strengthening one association per micro-catchment was made more flexible to include
         pre-existing associations of micro-catchment farmers at/linked to, the municipal level.
    (f) Enforcement of the Soil Use Law and Incentives Subcomponent: This contemplated
         inspection of 20% of approved incentives, reduced after the Mid-term Review to 10%.
    (g) Rural Roads Rehabilitation Component:               The technical/implementation strategy
         involving specialized private road contracting firms proved unworkable. Solutions were
         found via CATI/public sector involvement and changes in the procurement modality.
    (h) Training and Dissemination Component: The name was changed to Capacity-building
         and Dissemination, absorbing the capacity-building activities envisaged at appraisal
         under the Environmental Education Sub-component.
    (i) Administration, Evaluation and Supervision/Monitoring Component: Lack of interest
         from academic institutions saw planned monitoring of 12 micro-watersheds reduced to
         four (with a fifth added in 2007 as part of the associated GEF Ecosystem Restoration of
         Riparian Forests Project).

1.7 Other significant changes9
1.7.1   Extensions of the Closing date:




9  The PEMBH was subject to many changes during implementation. Changes are listed/described by type, not in
chronological order.



                                                   5

     (a) December 31, 2005 to June 30, 2007: to recoup delays, permit full disbursement of the
           Loan and implementation of planned activities under steadily improving implementation
           conditions.10

     (b) June 30, 2007 to November 30, 2007: to permit full disbursement of the Loan under
           continuing good implementation conditions; and

     (c) November 30, 2007 to November 30, 2008: partial extension only for Component 3
           (Incentives Program for Natural Resources Management and Conservation) to: (i) enable
           the Government to continue supporting GEF Ecosystem Restoration of Riparian Forests
           activities (see 1.7.8); (ii) ensure that the Incentives Program/Fund could meet all its
           objectives under the PEMBH and associated GEF project for numbers of farmers
           adopting conservation practices and total State area benefiting from project activities;
           and, (iii) allow the State to fulfill its counterpart commitment by spending the US$10.3
           million budgeted but not yet spent.11

1.7.2      Reallocation of Loan funds:                In 2004, US$5,891,000 was reallocated, comprising
US$5.0 million from Category 6 Unallocated and US$891,000 from Category 3 Consultants'
Services, to Category 1 Civil Works. The Bank expenditure percentage increased from 55% to
75%. A second reallocation in 2006 in conjunction with the first extension of the closing date
(see 1.7.1) reduced Categories 1-4 by US$11.3 million of which US$10.0 million were cancelled
(see 1.7.4) and the remaining US$1.3 million reallocated to Category 5 Grants.

1.7.3      Increase in Disbursement Percentage: The Bank's contribution to Category 1 Civil
Works was increased from 55% to 75% in mid-2003 due to tight restrictions on counterpart funds
in Brazil, the number of rural road sections going to bid at that time and the protracted delays in
implementing the Rural Roads Rehabilitation component.

1.7.4      Cancellation of Loan funds: US$10.0 million of Loan funds unlikely to be disbursed in
the time available were cancelled in March 2006 (with a reduction in Borrower counterpart
funding), at the Borrower's request.12

1.7.5      Procurement: The aggregate allowable value of contracts for works under the "Small-
scale Works" rubric was increased from US$7.3 million to US$19.0 million; and, aggregate
allowable value of acquisitions under "Shopping" increased from US$2.4 million to US$3.4
million. Further, with Bank agreement, the procurement modality for rural roads renovation was
decentralized from National Competitive Bidding (NCB) to solicitation of three quotes/bids,
which accelerated and streamlined roads contracting and execution.

1.7.6      Changes in Incentives Fund: The limit on assistance to individual farmers under the
Incentives Fund was increased in 2006 from US$3,000 to US$3,750/beneficiary and types of
incentives eligible were expanded.

1.7.7      Elimination of Project Units: The Internal Audit and Control Unit (IACU) in CATI and
the PEMBH Consultative Council (CC) were disbanded.13

10  Improved conditions included completion of training programs for CATI and farmers, signature of amendments to
the Soil Conservation Law permitting farmers to access the Incentives Fund, and renewed political commitment.
11  This extension was considered essential given that the Incentives Fund financing natural resource conservation
activities would have ceased to exist once the Project closed at end-November 2007, since it was created by law as an
integral part of the project and could not be easily replaced and/or extended independently from the project.
12The initial agreed amount between the State Governor and Secretary of Finance was US$20.0 million.



                                                             6

1.7.8     GEF Operation: The Project co-financed in 2005 a US$7.75 million GEF operation, the
Ecosystem Restoration of Riparian Forests in São Paulo. Technical and operational interventions
proposed by the GEF operation and the PEMBH were inter-dependent and complementary, and
areas of action and beneficiaries the same. Conscious efforts were made to foster integration of
the two operations; joint teams were used for planning, implementation, monitoring, supervision
and technical and operational aspects, and training was jointly-organized. Extension of the
PEMBH Closing date to end-November 2008 was to permit further progress under the GEF
operation via its linkage to the project's Incentives Fund (see 1.7.1(c)).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Soundness of the background analysis:

2.1.1     Poverty reduction and equitable growth through targeted rural programs and
environmentally-sustainable development were benchmarks of the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy for Brazil (CAS, June 1997). The analytical basis and justification for extending
coverage of this successful methodology to São Paulo included: (a) the Bank's prior experience
with other, similar projects and demonstrated need for similar interventions in São Paulo; (b)
experiences pre-Project under the State-funded P-PEMH; (c) knowledge of the State's
agricultural potential and land management issues; (d) availability of research-based and tested
technologies; and, (e) several decades of accumulated extension experience.

2.1.2     Strong demand from farming communities and local authorities at the time to expand the
P-PEMH was tempered by lessons which prompted the introduction of explicit poverty objectives
and decentralized, participatory approaches (see below).14 The Project made a series of strategic
choices through participatory project preparation, careful targeting and capacity-building. The
short, intense period of project revision in 1997 was driven by the lessons on the benefits of
community and wider stakeholder participation from the successful Paraná and Santa Catarina
operations - representatives of which participated in reviews of the revised São Paulo project
proposal - and a sound sense of where the Brazilian political and social economy was headed on
the environment and inclusion of disadvantaged populations.

Assessment of project design:

2.1.3     Objectives: Project objectives were relevant to conditions on the ground but quite far-
reaching for an untried setting, seeking to achieve multiple goals at a level of decentralization and


13 (a) The IACU, intended to do financial, physical and procedural internal auditing of the project, proved unworkable
and was abolished. Its responsibilities were assumed by the Secretariat of Finance via technical audits; and (b) The
representative CC was to have overall advisory responsibility for project policy, budgets, institutional coordination and
integration of the PEMBH with other state programs. It played an important role in the initial implementation phase
but had no subsequent impact on the program.
14  These lessons highlighted the need to: (a) intensify community environmental awareness and participation in
environmental protection at the micro-catchment level; (b) re-orient traditional agricultural extension programs to
natural resources management and sustainable rural development, emphasizing participation; (c) boost research to
adapt soil and moisture conservation techniques to local conditions (despite the SAR stating that the availability of
tested technologies was a justification for the project, see 2.1.1); (d) improve targeting, transparency and effectiveness
of state incentive programs to promote improved on-farm land management; (e) enhance enforcement of the recently-
regulated Soil Conservation Law.



                                                             7

via an innovative methodology unfamiliar to the implementing institutions/entities and the
targeted farmers. The lessons from similar operations in other states could only partially mitigate
this situation. Complexity was increased by the introduction of poverty/social objectives which
created new challenges at the institutional and field levels and foreshadowed a lengthy learning
period. The PDO indicators were prepared without a strong sense of their operational
demands/consequences and were focused primarily on natural resource issues.

2.1.4     Components: The number, diverse nature and innovative nature of project
components/subcomponents - road renovation, agro-ecological mapping, new forms of
agricultural extension, farmer organization and participatory planning, adaptive research, re-
forestation, incentives-based behavioral change and environmental education - required strong
management, technical and administrative skills at all levels, an appropriate, operationally ready
institutional structure/arrangements, and consistent commitment to the project idea.

2.1.5     Components (as with indicators) generally reflected the project's NRM focus. No direct
financing was included for organized, income-generating productive facilities (e.g., agro-
processing units) supporting the social objectives. The project was clearly designed to prepare
and position small-scale, poor farmers for a second-stage operation with explicit productive
goals/activities. Social goals were reflected in: (a) project resource targeting by priority areas
based on poverty and degree of land degradation; (b) financing of farmer organization and
training, essential for any form of viable productive activity; and (c) investments designed to
improve the management and sustainability ­ and thus longer-term productivity - of lands
harboring concentrations of poor farm families.

2.1.6     Institutional arrangements and capacity:              CATI's pre-project restructuring did not
match the project's actual technical, operational and administrative demands. Its understanding of
Bank rules - especially procurement and contracting - was shaky (Sections 2 and 6),15 and,
initially at least, most of its in-house technicians neither grasped the new technical strategy nor
supported the need to change their traditional modus operandi. The organizational framework
entailed multi-level linkages reflecting the move to decentralized planning and implementation of
programs. Municipal government support was crucial to project success but not assured, as was
the level of inter-institutional efficiency expected from training programs (see 2.1.12). The
planned project implementation timetable and sequencing were linear, binding the inexperienced
PMU/stakeholders to performance benchmarks inconsistent with the actual project trajectory.

2.1.7     Appraisal Analysis: The Bank and Borrower, sensing a brief window of opportunity
(about six months), were understandably anxious to revive the project, update key design
elements and seek Board approval. The project justification/rationale remained valid and there
was strong, joint support for project objectives and methodology from the Secretary of
Agriculture and the head of CATI. However, pressured appraisal affected quality.16 Scope and
scale estimates were based on an unduly positive vision of implementation speed and learning.
Appraisal targets/indicators might have been feasible with greater up-front, established
institutional capacity but experiences in other states with similar projects demonstrated the time
and investment needed in training and institutional adaptation, and should have prompted more
modest estimates.17

15 The Borrower Completion Report (CATI, 2009) asserts that these elements received little discussion at appraisal.
16 The same report is candid about the stresses of preparing an innovative, revised operation with a six-year time
horizon, in just six months. A change of government was expected with potential to de-rail the Project again, which
actually happened via the new government's weak support for project implementation.
17 Pressured appraisal is also evident in the PDO. The overriding objective is to "increase and sustain agricultural
production, productivity and farm incomes and assist in the conservation of natural resources", appearing to give



                                                       8

2.1.8    The project encountered the kinds of surprises which better, more prescient analysis
might have avoided. Experience on the ground with launching key activities suggests that
stakeholder consultation at appraisal was not sufficiently thorough, and technical aspects not fully
understood. The technical strategy was impressive but operationally complex in the existing
institutional setting. Key, mostly private sector, players notionally earmarked to execute
important activities variously lacked the technical capacity, interest and/or motivation to engage
with the project. The procurement modality for roads renovation activities ­ National
Competitive Bidding (NCB) ­ did not fit the project's decentralized approach and smaller-scale,
localized road activities in rural areas with special environmental characteristics.18

2.1.9    Downstream difficulties associated with the rigidity of the Soil Conservation Law
however, while predictable, were unable to be resolved. It was known at re-appraisal that this law
was likely to restrict the types of activities eligible for financing under the incentives fund.
However, given the contentiousness of environmental issues/legislation in Brazil and relative
newness of the existing law, the Government had no political appetite for trying to change such
law at that time.

2.1.10 Safeguards: The Project's raison d'être was sound, sustainable land management based
on advanced, tested natural resources management and conservation techniques/practices and the
project was - to an important degree and along with its peer projects - ahead of its time.
Safeguards provisions were not a formal Bank project requirement at the time of appraisal but the
project team included an environmental specialist to supervise possible environmental
implications of project activities.

2.1.11 Social factors: The Project's innovative social features reflected the poverty focus of the
Brazil CAS at the time, acknowledgment that zones of highest erosion and degradation tended to
also house concentrations of small, poor farmers, and that a sustainable rural development
approach blending conservationist and social elements, was more appropriate and timely.
Targeting was carefully analyzed, based on reliable data, and the allocation of project resources
was differentiated based on priority areas defined by relative poverty levels. Consistent with
most projects of the period, there was no explicit focus on gender or ethnic/indigenous
populations, aspects which evolved during implementation.

Adequacy of Government's commitment:

2.1.12 The State Government in power at the time of appraisal/negotiations was firmly
committed to the project, demonstrated by its creation and financing of the P-PEMH prior to
appraisal/approval of the Bank-supported PEMBH, institutional restructuring of CATI, and
prompt request to the Bank to re-negotiate the loan once its fiscal difficulties with the Federal
Government were resolved. Further, the social democratization of the 1990s, decentralization of
many public functions/services from the Federal to the State and municipal/local levels, and
opening up of political space for the participation of the poorest segments of rural society were
reflected in, and indeed a major rationale for, revisions to project design in 1997, fully supported
by the State Government at the time.


poverty precedence.17 However, the SAR also states that the project's main objective was improved natural resources
management and thus highest priority would be given to the soil erosion coefficient rather than to poverty
concentration in project resource allocation.
18 NCB conformed to the Bank's preference at the time for large procurement "packages". The Project Team felt
obliged to use NCB.

Risk assessment:

2.1.13 Risks were correctly projected by the SAR based on experiences in other states, but
suggested mitigation measures lacked depth/realism and no individual or overall risk ratings were
suggested. They were actually substantial. For example, the capacity of participatory
methodologies, information dissemination and even incentives to overcome farmer resistance to
new practices was unpredictable, and these three elements were, in themselves, "new practices".
Further, P-PEMH and PEMBH farmers first had to invest their own resources then be reimbursed
by the Incentives Fund, an arrangement likely to create resistance given small farmers' traditional
mistrust of the State. Also, small farmers' ability and/or willingness to signal support for project
innovations from the grassroots level upstream to higher political levels with budgetary/policy
influence was an unknown, even in the liberalizing political context of the time. Sequencing of
project activities in the Project Operational Manual could not govern or "ensure" timely
implementation given the many obstacles innovative projects tend to face, and which provoke
cascading delays impervious to timetables. Risk associated with the duration/difficulty of
institutional learning was not foreseen for CATI/SAA or the agricultural extension workers, who,
like the farmers, were required to change their operational philosophy and approach, and develop
skills, for which the quite limited initial, State-funded P-PEMH experience did not prepare them.

2.1.14 Not foreseeable at appraisal, and a far more serious risk than delayed or inadequate
counterpart funding, was the risk to budgets represented by the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL)
enacted in 2002. While the proposed annual operating plans, budget reviews and reporting
procedures mentioned in the SAR risk assessment as mitigation elements might have provided
"early warning" of funding shortfalls and perhaps opportunities to preempt, there was little room
to move under the impact/weight of this new law (see Section 2.2).

2.2 Implementation

2.2.1     Implementation started slowly, illustrating that each state is a unique geo-political entity
which, despite lessons built into project design, must go through the learning-by-doing process
itself. Heavy investments in the initial years in essential capacity building and behavior change of
both farmers and rural extension workers, financed mostly by counterpart funds, resulted in low
disbursement. The readiness of a critical mass of small farmers to make use of project incentives
coincided with the removal in 2005 of legal obstacles in the Soil Law impeding the Incentives
Fund from providing resources for a variety of new productive technologies suitable to small
farmers. Training of CATI staff, seeking a fundamental realignment of their business model, was
also not completed until mid-2005. Meanwhile, the training of extension workers ­ the most
important formative instrument for Project success ­ was challenging, particularly so for those
contracted by the municipalities to boost the total cohort supporting the Project and who often
had to initiate field activities with little or no preparation (Navarro, 2008).

2.2.2    Political commitment fluctuated. A change in administration happened soon after project
Effectiveness and some incoming staff did not have the same commitment to and understanding
of project objectives, failing to provide adequate political, financial and operational support to the
project. The Project struggled with budget shortages due to the impact of the FRL and weak
commitment, and experienced persistent procurement difficulties. Disbursements were still under
US$12.0 million by mid-2005 when the first extension of the Closing date was requested. The
many changes made to facilitate and accelerate implementation following the Mid-term Review
(2004) constituted a quasi-restructuring of the project implemented through amendments to the
Loan Agreement and changes in the Operational Manual. Project objectives did not change.



                                                     10

Breakthrough was finally achieved in late 2005 following decisive encounters between Bank
management and state authorities, combined with a two-year extension of the closing date
governed by a rigorous action plan, revised targets and close supervision. The late but successful
rejuvenation of what was in danger of becoming a moribund operation generated considerable
benefits and inter alia, demonstrated the practical, developmental value of a substantial closing
date extension under the right conditions. The reduced Loan of US$45.0 million disbursed fully
by end-November 2007.

2.2.3    The project exceeded/met most of its revised targets. Bearing the cancellation of US$10.0
million and loan reallocations in mind, final component costs were significantly lower than
projected at appraisal in all cases except Erosion Control Works along Rural Roads which closed
at 132% of the appraisal estimate despite physical achievements of about one-quarter of appraisal.
The objective of the roads component was to control erosion through point interventions at
critical stretches showing the worst erosion, thereby making a much longer road passable/viable,
improving the quality of life of communities, and their ability to reach urban centers and transport
product to markets. Implementation revealed that costs were markedly under-estimated at
appraisal. See final costs and details on performance and achievements in Annexes 1 and 2.

Major factors affecting implementation and their resolution/outcome

2.2.4     Bank management intervention and extension of the closing date:                              Two related
interventions made a marked difference to project results: (a) high-level intervention by Bank
management following the Mid-term Review when continuing weak, overall performance raised
the possibility of cancellation, established disciplined, realistic conditions for a sharp
improvement in performance and full disbursement of the (reduced) Loan; and (b) the two year
extension of the closing date. Bank managers met with senior state leaders/authorities to explain
the project, review and resolve critical obstacles affecting performance - especially procurement -
and establish an action plan and timetable for project completion. The productivity and success of
the two-year extension underscored the potential inherent in correctly assessing the situation on
the ground, gauging the minimum conditions for making an extension work, promoting Borrower
support for a well-designed Action Plan and rigorously supervising its implementation.

2.2.5    High quality Mid-term Review:              As described in 2.2.12, the Mid-term Review and
especially the candid, analytical diagnostic study were especially effective in pinpointing critical
bottlenecks affecting project implementation and providing a roadmap for a range of important
interventions which set the project on a more positive course.

2.2.6    Institutional Capacity and Growth: CATI's structure and capacity at the outset were
inconsistent with its complex responsibilities. Lack of familiarity with the Bank and the project
cycle, and need to re-orient its business model to accommodate decentralized, participatory
mechanisms       applied      to    a   physical/geographic         area,   and     to    adapt     a     traditional
agronomic/environmental approach to integrate poverty and social concerns, caused delays.                             19

Options debated included contracting a private company to manage the PEMBH, or contracting
the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture (IICA) to establish a parallel structure
to support CATI. However, neither served the underlying goal of strengthening and modernizing
CATI itself as the State's lead institution for sustainable rural development. The agreed option of


19 The Borrower Completion Report is critical of the unrealistic timetable which created problems with both the SAA
and the Bank due to CATI's inability to comply, and generated exhaustion and disillusionment in CATI's over-
burdened team. Further, the Project design meant CATI could no longer maintain the traditional activities/clients it had
developed over time.



                                                        11

contracting specialized consultants to work with CATI/UGP ­ urged repeatedly by Bank
supervision missions - met procurement delays and only occurred in the final year. Diverse
solutions were found in the interim to maintain momentum.20

2.2.7     The project's many challenges were undoubtedly a catalyst to CATI's strong institutional
growth. CATI developed sophisticated in-house technologies and external partnerships for rural
roads rehabilitation, agro-environmental mapping, production and distribution of native species
for reforestation, small farm productive packages, and methodologies for reaching micro-
catchment communities and fostering their engagement. The commitment, dedication and
creative drive of its technical managers and staff had a direct, positive effect on improving project
performance. Another factor was the new, collaborative relationship between the technical teams
in CATI/SAA, the Secretariat of Environment, Secretariat of Water Resources, Works and
Sanitation, and Secretariat of Planning. Joint, operational routines and practices were developed
to speed up authorizations for approved ventures, including water supply systems, with the PIP
becoming the roadmap for diverse on-farm interventions.

2.2.8      Political commitment: The project demonstrated the negative effects of weak
understanding and support at high levels and the impact on projects of changing leadership. The
Project virtually came to a halt in 2004. The higher management who supported project
preparation was not the same who oversaw its implementation. The latter had difficulty grasping
the relevance of micro-catchments to the State economy, to poverty reduction and social
development, and to the protection and conservation of a deteriorating rural environment. The
Project gained momentum only after some changes at high level government staff and more
intensive efforts by the Bank to explain the project rationale and objectives to those incoming
government managers, complemented by visits to PEMBH micro-catchments by state authorities.
The Project needed more politically-savvy, systematic information dissemination and proactive
efforts to promote understanding of and identification with project objectives and methodology
within the political hierarchy and beyond the rural space. As noted by Navarro (2008), "the elite
need to understand the project logic".

2.2.9      Fiscal Responsibility Law of 2002: An outgrowth of the Brazilian fiscal crisis of the
late 1990s, the FRL negatively affected agency budgets including that of the Secretariat of
Agriculture and CATI, and project activities. Not only were annual budgets tight and budget
funds released erratically, but the practice of contingenciamento ­ Government's right under the
Law to withhold a portion of an approved budget which might/might not be released at a later
time - affected timely project execution. Combined with shortages of counterpart funds, the
Project struggled for resources throughout, only resolved in the final two years via the Bank's
tougher approach to resolving chronic issues. The FRL also affected the municipal contracting of
technicians responsible for executing the micro-catchment plans by vetoing the transfer of State
funds to the municipalities to contract and pay technicians directly. This essentially shut down
such contracting after just one year, leaving the Project in limbo on its commitment to work with
farmers at the field level. The municipalities were obliged to assume responsibility for contracting
and paying extension and technical assistance workers. In summary, post-FRL and under


20 Actions taken included: (a) institutional linkages/partnerships between SAA and Secretariats of Planning, Finance
and Environment, Water Resources, and linking of the PEMBH to the GEF operation; (b) decentralization of processes
and contracting to 40 CATI Regional Offices, expanding the program's execution capacity; (c) accelerated execution in
municipalities where Mayors provided technical personnel to the PEMBH, principally in municipalities participating in
the Integrated State System of Agriculture and Supply ("municipalization"); (d) changes to the Soil Use Law; (e)
introduction of Environmental Education Groups; (f) preparation of a Procurement Manual for decentralized usage; and
(g) upgraded information dissemination to the municipalities. See Annex 2.

"municipalization", the State Government and CATI lost influence in hiring extension workers, to
the detriment of project implementation. See Annex 2.

2.2.10 Soil Conservation Law and the Incentives Fund: Limited types of incentives permitted
under the Law versus the real demands of farmers, and the inflexible percentages of financing
permitted versus a more individual approach by micro-catchment, hindered use of the Fund.
These issues were apparent as early as 1998 and efforts were launched to amend the Law, an
uphill battle given that it had only just been regulated in 1997. While amendment efforts went on,
the all-important Incentives Fund designed to attract farmers to change their land management
practices operated at reduced capacity and thus with reduced influence on farmers' attitudes and
behavior. The State Assembly finally approved a revised version in 2005, signed by the Governor
in 2006, and use of the Incentives Fund accelerated appreciably with about 72% of all activities
financed by the Fund occurring in the last two years. See Annex 2.

2.2.11    Procurement arrangements: Project procurement was troubled due to unsuitable design
and persistent obstruction of Bank-approved procurement proposals by SAA legal authorities.
The rural roads component was especially affected by the requirement for procurement under
NCB, implying the involvement of large road contracting firms who lacked the technical
experience/knowledge to handle small-scale rural roads in a challenging environmental setting.
This was resolved by amending the Loan Agreement to decentralize the procurement modality
from NCB to Local Shopping with three quotes. Other procurement-related activities including
the proposed contracting of specialist consultants to support CATI were repeatedly blocked by
SAA authorities who insisted on the primacy of State and national procurement rules over Bank
rules and provisions of the Loan Agreement. The intervention of Bank management in this
impasse was effective for a time, but difficulties emerged again in the closing period (see 2.4.2).

Mid-term Review (MTR)

2.2.12 The Project financed an effective Mid-term Review, conducted in two stages and
supported by a strong, survey-based analysis covering 120 producers in 20 municipalities and
representing 383 micro-catchment plans approved at least one year earlier (DELGITEC, 2004).21
The low level of project execution limited tangible results at the time. While the MTR praised
many specific aspects of CATI's performance, especially technical, numerous factors were found
to be impeding the PEMBH, resulting in important actions/changes (see below and 1.6).

(a) Strategic: CATI's planning capacity was improved to better support project
implementation/results; a new, multi-media Communications Strategy was launched for the
Project/CATI, targeting the general population, beneficiaries and key stakeholders; and, proactive
project dissemination was initiated in urban areas and among the political hierarchy to leverage
political support and create awareness of natural resource preservation and rural living conditions.

(b) Tactical: Personnel shortcomings in CATI/project team were overcome by training and
greater efficiency, improved contracting procedures, and having producer associations locate
additional technicians; CATI/UGP developed an annual planning routine taking into account
possible budget limitations and/or contingencies (under the FRL); and, initiatives were devised to
foster the creation of micro-catchment associations in lagging regions, offering if needed,
standardized documents and model forms of internal organization to facilitate this.

(c) Operational: Training programs were launched, with priority for the EDRs, in project
administrative procedures including use of management software and for beneficiary producers in
the use of agro-chemicals; adaptive research was conducted to evaluate technical performance of
practices utilized for the Roads Rehabilitation Component, using renovated stretches of these
roads for demonstration purposes; and, funding availability was reviewed for road renovation
activities and reallocation and/or cancellation actions taken.

2.2.13 Following the MTR and based on findings of the DELGITEC (2004) study, senior Bank
managers and the project team launched a concerted effort to discuss and agree with the Borrower
on measures to improve overall project implementation, and ensure State coordination and
support for the new GEF operation and its integration with the PEMBH.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1     The planned monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework was straightforward and the
SAR's presentation is brief. Financing was included for mid-term and ex-post evaluations of the
project's socio-economic impact to be contracted to a state university under Bank-approved terms
of reference. Detailed resource monitoring of 12 micro-catchments was planned to measure
project impact.22 The SAR does not describe the methodology or scope of planned M&E, or
criteria for selecting the micro-catchments.

 2.3.2    In aggregate, project-financed analytical products were of good to high quality, and
operationally and technically useful. CATI managers demonstrated that the management
information system had been institutionalized within CATI/UGP by project closing. This system
was continuously improved to include segments not originally contemplated and which are now
instrumental in the real time management of a range of CATI's activities/programs.23 End-project
physical and other data were readily available by component/sub-component (Annexes 2 and 5).
However, no formal baseline and follow-up evaluation program were conducted. Also, several,
mostly technical PDO impact indicators shown in the Project Monitoring Letter were not
measured mainly because the planned micro-catchment monitoring studies expected to yield such
data were not conducted.24 CATI operations managers felt that the project had too many
indicators and that fewer, better-analyzed and more meaningful indicators should govern the
follow-on operation. The strengthening of M&E capacity and execution is a focus of the new
operation.

2.3.3     Achievements were as follows: (a) MIS-type Physical and Financial Monitoring System
(SAFF) was established and refined; (b) Seven case studies were completed, and resulting
data/findings were utilized by the ICR and by FAO for the economic analysis in Annex 3 and are
summarized in Annex 5; (c) Mid-term Review (DELGITEC, 2004) presented an influential
analysis of the Project resulting in key changes to targets, activities and financing; (d) Borrower
Completion Report (CATI, 2009) provided an analytical, candid assessment of the project
experience, utilized by the ICR; and (e) Final evaluation study (Navarro, 2008) based on



22 CATI was to contact all State Universities to explain the project strategy and objectives of the micro-catchment
monitoring exercise, soliciting proposals for monitoring to start no later than nine months after Loan signature.
23Including: (i) CATI's projects with FEHIDRO; and (ii) CATI's activities under the LUPA Project (Survey of Agro-
livestock Production Units in the State of São Paulo); and (iii) control of seed stocks in the DSMM.
24 This was due, variously, to research bodies' lack of interest and in some cases their unreasonable payment demands,
CATI's lack of understanding of what was required for such monitoring, inadequate dialogue with academia, and
certain design weaknesses. Features were based on the Santa Catarina model where project institutions had in-house
soil and water quality monitoring capability/instruments, not available in São Paulo.



                                                           14

interviews with stakeholders/beneficiaries, yielded an important qualitative analysis of project
successes, challenges and lessons, incorporated in the ICR text and Annex 5.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1      Safeguards: As noted earlier, Safeguards documents/plans were not a formal Bank
requirement at the time the PEMBH was appraised and are not referred to in the SAR.
Nevertheless, the project team included an environmental specialist to supervise possible
environmental implications of project activities, aiming to avoid and minimize any potential
negative effects and enhance planned positive impacts. In general, supervision missions found
that: (a) the identification and implementation of activities on the ground followed recommended
environmental practices; and (b) the project fostered and implemented agricultural practices that
reduced the need for pesticides and fertilizers.25 The working relationship between the technical
teams in SAA and the Secretariat of Environment improved sharply over the course of the project
with each agency acquiring greater understanding of the other's role and importance in rural
areas. Further, project technological practices required and obtained authorizations/licenses from
the Secretariats of Environment, Energy and Water Resources26 and the PIPs were adjusted to
become the base document for obtaining those authorizations.

2.4.2      Indigenous Peoples. Pre-MTR, the government team considered extending project
benefits to indigenous people in an indigenous area within a micro-catchment. However, a Bank
supervision mission to the area, including a Bank indigenous specialist, found that CATI lacked
the capacity and strategy to include indigenous peoples in the project at that time, especially
given the implementation difficulties being experienced by the project. The Bank and government
agreed that indigenous peoples should be included as beneficiaries in any future, follow-up
operation.

2.4.3      Procurement: Procurement was troubled.27 CATI's understanding of Bank procurement
rules/methods was deficient in the initial years. The NCB procurement modality for rural roads
renovation was unsuitable, and was changed. Another issue was the persistent obstruction of
procurement processing by the Consultoria Juridica within SAA, who withheld approval for
procurement activities involving documents already prepared by CATI and approved by the
Bank, delaying project activities such as roads and mapping. The reason was resistance to the
primacy of Bank procurement rules over São Paulo/Brazilian law, despite the terms of the Loan
Agreement. Intensive post-MTR efforts to harmonize Bank procurement procedures with those of
São Paulo and accelerate procurement processing led, inter alia, to the decentralization of the
procurement modality for the rural roads component. However, the State Attorney (SA)




25  In the Municipality of Botucatu, the proliferation of discarded pesticide containers led to a successful campaign to
collect and properly dispose of them, later extended to other municipalities. In Pardinho Municipality, the collection
and disposal of over 14,000 such containers over four years, of which 95% were from just two micro-catchments,
illustrate the dimensions of the problem.
26   The BCR (2009) notes that this burgeoning linkage revealed the need to simplify and accelerate procedures for
environmental licensing and, that adjustments in environmental law might be needed.
27  As explained by the Project Team, the situation was complex. Procurement was satisfactory in regard to the
preparation of documents by CATI procurement staff, which followed Bank Guidelines. However, it was unsatisfactory
because the process was prolonged by SAA legal staff repeatedly sending these documents back due to alleged
improper preparation. The Bank team was concerned that declaring procurement unsatisfactory would provide SAA
leadership with reason to dismiss CATI procurement staff and replace them with others more supportive of the
obstructionist position. The project was authorized under the Brazilian National Procurement Law No. 8666 to follow
Bank Procurement Guidelines.

responsible for reviewing and approving larger contracts reneged upon agreed procedures,
renewing the pattern of delays, questioning and interference along the procurement chain.28

2.4.4     A Procurement Review in mid-2007 rated the project Moderately Unsatisfactory due to
excessive paperwork and bureaucracy, the delays in Consultoria Jurídica approvals, delayed
submission of the Procurement Plan to the Bank and inadequate storage of procurement
documents. An agreed fiduciary action plan including procurement showed strong performance
and the ISR rating of November 2007 was upgraded to MS. There are no pending procurement
issues. Procurement design/facilitation will be a priority under the new project. The BCR (2009)
suggests that a repetition of what occurred might be avoided if implementing agency legal
personnel, especially those responsible for procurement, participated in project negotiations to
gain a direct understanding of why/how Bank procurement rules prevail over national and state
laws. This view is endorsed by the Bank Legal Specialist responsible for the project.

2.4.5     Financial Management: Project financial management (FM) ratings fluctuated between
Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory over the full course of implementation. Factors downgrading FM
ratings at various times were: (a) inadequate financial management systems in CATI and use of
manual, spreadsheet-based methods for monitoring and reconciling project accounts and balances
while the planned FM system was developed and launched; and (b) failure to update the project's
financial management system (SAFF) on a real time basis, and insufficient staff in the project FM
group. The most recent FM supervision in February 2008 sustained the earlier MS rating, finding
that CATI staff was trained and professional, internal controls were sufficient to take timely
actions when required, institutional organization arrangements permitted timely decisions on the
use of loan resources, and that suggestions made by prior FM missions had been observed by
CATI. Main caveats related to non-presentation of consolidated FMR data and delayed delivery
of the 2006 audit report. CATI complied with the Bank's related Action Plan and deadlines.

2.4.6     Audit: Auditors' opinions were consistently Unqualified for Special Opinions and
Qualified Exception for Financial Statements, the latter due to a recurrent issue not resolved by
the Project, i.e., the State Finance Secretariat's maintenance of a single treasury account rather
than the separate project account required by the Bank. Delivery of audit reports was without
exception delayed, even with formal extensions of the due date, but audit Management Letters
generally found the project's internal control systems satisfactory for project activities. The Bank
team followed up closely with the Borrower on auditors' recommendations and there were no
audit issues pending at closing.

2.4.7     Disbursement: Disbursements were delayed until the post-MTR period when steps were
taken by the project team and senior Bank management to resolve obstacles affecting the Project.
At the time of the MTR in August 2004, disbursements were about US$7.8 million, 14% of the
Loan in 50 months or 75% of the planned execution period (based on the original planned closing
date of end-December 2005). Taking into account the US$10.0 million cancellation of Loan
funds, the balance of US$37.2 million of Loan funds was disbursed in the remaining 39 months,
i.e., by the extended closing date of end-November 2007. As noted, the technical extension to
end-November 2008 involved only remaining counterpart funds.


28  In the case of procurement for the roads component, the SA approved documents and processes and the first three
contracts, after which all further related activities were delegated.




                                                             16

2.4.8    Legal: At Closing, the project was in compliance with all legal covenants.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1    Follow-on operation: Evidence that environmentally sound land management practices
adopted at the micro-catchment level by organized small farmers can boost productivity, increase
incomes and restore degraded rural lands has resonated with the State Government which has
completed with the Bank the preparation of a new operation of US$130.0 million, with a Bank
loan of about US$78.0 million to increase the competitiveness of family agriculture in priority
areas of the State of São Paulo, while improving its environmental sustainability.

2.5.2    The new operation is consistent with the Brazil CPS (2008-2011) in stressing
competitiveness, equity and sustainability. It builds on PEMBH achievements by focusing on
linking small farmers to markets through the formation or strengthening of agricultural business
groups and networks.29 Greater attention would be given to production processes, quality, supply
and marketing, while continuing to stress the conservation of soils, water and other natural
resources as a sine qua non of sustainable rural production. Since small farmers are not a
homogeneous bloc, differentiated approaches would be used to improve productivity and
competitiveness based on relative infrastructure endowments, soil and water conditions and
ethnic/cultural considerations. The Bank would also support Government's interest in territorial
development by testing, evaluating and mainstreaming mechanisms using organized micro-
catchments as building blocks in larger geographic areas with linked development goals.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High overall relevance

3.1.1    The PDO continues to have high overall relevance for sound land management,
agricultural productivity growth and rural poverty reduction in the State of São Paulo. In design
terms, decentralized approaches which improve the organization, productive and environmental
capacity, assets and competitiveness of more vulnerable rural populations remain a primary
development tool in the Bank with an established track record in many regions. Evidence
suggests that the methodology developed in São Paulo has positive impact, is replicable, can be
scaled up, can host/catalyze further innovation and remains consistent with the Brazil Country
Partnership Strategy, 2008-2011.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

3.2.1    The over-riding PDO - increasing and sustaining agricultural production, productivity
and farm incomes and assisting in the conservation of natural resources ­ made important strides
and has strong potential to be achieved.30 The broader impact and sustainability of many financed
activities is longer-term and beyond the control of the project. Natural resource conservation-


29 The new project would support: improved production techniques; standardization, storage and marketing of
dairy/other products; strengthening supply agreements with agri-business; branding/marketing and processing of local
products; certification of quality (green labeling); agricultural and non-agricultural diversification; and, support to the
formation of new organizations for joint activity (purchase of inputs, equipment sharing, marketing).
30  Based on the FAO economic analysis (Annex 3); Micro-catchment Case Studies (Annex 5 and IRIS); findings of
the final evaluation (Navarro, 2008, Annex 5); Borrower Completion Report, Annexes 2 and 7; and the final
supervision and ICR missions.

related and other assistance financed by the project and contributing to project outcomes is
summarized under individual sub-objectives below and in Annex 2.

3.2.2    With the caveat that the following numbers are preliminary and the result of barely two
years of productive activity ­ more an indication of where farmers are potentially heading ­ it can
be said that agricultural production on assisted properties registered solid gains in all farm models
studied by FAO (2008) with especially strong increases on the 22,000 farms benefited directly by
the adoption of new technology. Productivity gains were equally strong with increases in crop
and livestock yields ranging from 24% (Cotton) to a high of 100% (Milk Cows) (see Annex 3).
While the incremental, average productivity gain across all micro-catchments assisted was 13%,
productivity rose an average 36% in areas directly supported by the Incentives Program (adoption
of new practices), and levels of direct investment in these areas rose an average 44.5% per year.
As noted in 3.3.3, increases in farm income of adopting farmers ranged from 16% to about 157%
per year, equivalent to values of some US$1,400 to US$6,600 per year, per farmer (see Annex 3).

3.2.3    Achievements under the five sub-objectives are detailed below:

Objective 1: Promoting the adoption of sustainable, modern forms of land management and soil,
water and forest conservation planned and implemented at the micro-catchment level and with
full involvement of the farming community.

         This objective was achieved. Integrated practices for the management and conservation
of soil, water and forests were promoted and planned on-site in a direct, participatory manner in
970 micro-catchments involving close to 70,000 producers over an area exceeding 3.3 million ha,
using diagnostic instruments, e.g., micro-catchment mapping, community investments (PEC) and
individual farm plans (PIP) based on consultative, farm-level diagnoses. Of this group, some
22,000 producers physically adopted the technologies on-farm through project investments in
terracing, soil retention structures, gully control, Plantio Direto na Palha (minimum tillage), re-
forestation, fencing, machinery and equipment, and other conservationist techniques.31 By end-
project 514 municipalities had signed agreements with SAA to participate in the PEMBH. 32

         Of fundamental importance to this outcome was the integration and synergy between
project activities: (a) extension and technical assistance messages and training; (b) environmental
education in schools and the training of environmental agents and groups to support project
technicians; (c) the Incentives Fund which mitigated farmers' sense of loss as a result of
rehabilitation activities and radical changes in farm management practices; (d) CATI's
Environmental Mapping activities supporting the PIPs and PECs, and demonstrating graphically
to producers the relationship between land use and environmental conservation; and (e) the
organization and mobilization of farmers through a tiered, inter-dependent structure of
associations, CMDRs and CRDRs, supported by CATI's regional technicians and contracted
extension workers. Farmers interviewed for the Mid-term Review study (DELGITEC 2004)
believed that the project had already improved the focus and organization of their farm activities.



31 While everyone is technically eligible within a micro-catchment, not everyone was eligible for investment support
which depended on property size and income, i.e.,the smaller and poorer were prioritized. Further, lack of time
affected coverage including due to the time required for initial capacity-building, and time available to launch
productive activities.
32 Given the 100-plus micro-catchment plans still unattended at end-Project, the PMU on Bank advice has organized
for display on the CATI website a listing of all financing lines available ­ Federal, State and Municipal ­ and
accessible by the regions, municipalities, micro-catchment associations and technicians to promote continued
implementation of these micro-catchment plans after project closing.



                                                        18

Project targeting parameters were observed throughout, as detailed in 3.5.5 and the Borrower
Completion Report (CATI, 2009).

         Participatory methodologies were seen as critical to PEMBH sustainability beyond the
project. Of key importance, the Case Study on PEMBH participation found that the principal
motivation (for 80% of respondents) for producers entering the program in the first place was the
influence of social actors (extension workers, technical assistance providers) followed by the
availability of incentives and belief in the program. Case studies and other project documents also
refer frequently to the demonstration effects as well as influence of the successful environmental
education elements of the PEMBH as decisive elements promoting adhesion, adoption and
expansion of the PEMBH methodology.33 The DELGITEC (2004) study surveyed the motives of
producers for adopting conservationist practices promoted by the PEMBH. Strongest results
were registered for erosion control and avoidance (78%), improved production (47%) and
improved water supply (31%). Lack of financial resources to tide farmers through the adoption
period, partial understanding of the advantages, and inadequate technical knowledge were cited as
the strongest reasons for non-adoption.

Objective 2:        Developing community environmental awareness and participation in
environmental protection efforts.

         This objective was achieved. As noted above, the PEMBH financed an environmental
education program "Learning with Nature" benefiting teachers, primary school students and their
families, and coordinated by a partnership of agricultural and educational technicians. This was
supported and complemented by Environmental Agents (EA) and Environmental Education
Groups (EEG), volunteers identified and trained to partner with CATI in their communities.
Initially a pilot, the school and field-based instruction reached about 384,000 school children
(106% of target) in 489 municipalities and 40 regions of the state, covering diverse environmental
issues presented in modern, challenging ways designed to build an understanding of technical
aspects, critical attitudes and personal responsibility. Field events included students' visits to
participating watersheds and farms, and their planting of native species in micro-catchments.

         The project-financed Case Study, "Impact of Environmental Education on the Perception
and Behavior of Beneficiaries and General Society" (Ramos de Freitas, 2008) verifies, based on
interviews with teachers, students, family members and rural producers: (a) strong contribution to
understanding environmental issues, specifically water, litter/garbage disposal, deforestation and
treatment of animals, and to changes in behavior and habits with multiplier effects on
beneficiaries' extended families; (b) visits to micro-catchments and PEMBH subprojects played a
key role in putting the classroom instruction in context; (c) the methodology was found to be
effective and attractive to students/teachers, building awareness of and sensitivity to
environmental problems with potential for beneficiaries to act as agents of change; (d)
participants came to see themselves as "guardians" of environmental sustainability, able to
change the opinions and attitudes of others; and (e) rural producers interviewed had collaborated
with the program, especially in micro-catchment and farm visits, and presentations, and expressed
strong approval of the program methodology, demonstration effects and longer-term potential
impacts. The same Case Study also found that the EAs and supporting EEGs achieved excellent
results but in dispersed, discrete areas, i.e., actions and impacts were not generalized. The study
stressed the need for greater dissemination of results, closer identification of EAs with their

communities/areas, and stronger inter-institutional and regional linkages between program
facilitators. See Annex 5.

Objective 3: Increasing the extent and duration of vegetative soil cover, thus better protecting
the soil against sealing under intense summer rainfall.

         This objective showed significant achievement, with an average increase of 18.5% (vs.
PDO target of 20%) in vegetative soil coverage, comprising the following two indicators. First,
vegetative soil coverage increased by 12% in 772 micro-catchments over an area of 2.6 million ha
as a result of the following practices fostered by the Incentives Fund: (a) 90,000 ha benefited with
1,264 community water storage/supply facilities; (b) 3,783 ha re-forested with Riparian Forest
plantings in 438 micro-catchments; (c) 1,267 km of critical riverbanks re-forested in 438 micro-
catchments; (d) 1,886 km of fences protecting 5,658 ha of land bordering springs; and (e) 50,900
ha improved through the application of lime (calcario) financed by the Incentives Fund and
another 136,000 ha improved without Incentives Fund financing. The project also financed the
acquisition of 705 lime applicators for producer groups. CATI's direct involvement in
guaranteeing the supply, type and quality of tree seedlings (mudas) available to PEMBH farmers
for re-forestation activities was another example of a technical intervention of great value to the
project's conservationist outcomes.

         Second, there was a 25% increase in vegetative cover of soils used for annual crops via a
sharp acceleration of Plantio Direto which went from some 100,000 ha in 1998 to about 1.0
million ha by end-2007 as both the direct and indirect (i.e., demonstration) outcome of the
PEMBH. Adaptive research units in various regions of the state, a line of financing for Plantio
Direto in FEAP created by SAA as a direct result of PEMBH activities/successes, CATI's
training and diffusion activities for extension workers, and the PEMBH's provision of specialized
seeding equipment to 212 participating producers associations, contributed to this result. No data
are available on the durational aspects of vegetative cover.

Objective 4: Improving internal soil structure and drainage, thus increasing water infiltration
and safely disposing of any remaining run-off.

         This objective was achieved. The PEMBH financed the adoption of soil conservation
technologies within some 970 micro-catchments covering 3.3 million ha, which decades of
research by EMBRAPA and globally have shown improves internal soil structure and drainage,
increases water filtration and effectively captures and disposes of run-off. Technologies
implemented by beneficiaries included crop rotation, Plantio Direto (see above), re-forestation of
the mata ciliar (Riparian Forest), and installation of terracing and green fertilizer techniques
(adubo verde). Soil structure was also improved in 258 micro-catchments over an area of
867,000 ha. by stabilizing some 2,138 eroded gullies on 1,494 properties. Rehabilitation of
critical stretches of rural roads totaling 1,643 km improved the surface run-off of rainwater and
reduced erosion on farm properties bordering those roads, in 415 micro-catchments. Road works
also resulted in improved transit conditions for economic and social purposes and saw the
maintenance costs of repaired roads decrease by about 85%.

         Case Studies (Rabello and Baptistella, 2007, and Bassi, 2007) identified declines ranging
from 10-50% in the turbidity of rivers and streams in areas benefited by the PEMBH, as
measured at points monitored by CETESP and UGRH (at the catchment and micro-catchment
levels). These results suggest an important decline in erosion and transport of sediments from
PEMBH-supported, integrated work on soil conservation and management. Conversely, increased



                                                 20

turbidity was observed (ranging from 10-25%) at various points monitored in one URGH not
participating in PEMBH incentives. The cost of water treatment for human consumption declined
15% due to reduced turbidity in areas monitored (see Case Studies,34 Annex 2 and Annex 5).

           Bassi (2007), also includes results and estimates for the impacts of road works and
erosion control on levels of run-off, soil loss and water quality. Given the PEMBH's 1,630 km of
road rehabilitation works and control of 2,087 on-farm erosion gullies, it is estimated that
120,000 tons of soil (enough to fill 12,000 trucks) were stopped annually from being carried into
springs and rivers, a saving of 50% in annual soil losses.

           Finally, while Rabello/Baptistella (2007) imply that even addressing the most critical
stretches of road and adopting practices to control rain run-off cannot be 100% effective in
reducing losses, farmers surveyed reported economic returns averaging R$4,950 per property
from new investments prompted directly by PEMBH road works. They also reported an average
incremental R$240 per year/per property with the incorporation into production of formerly
eroded gully areas. The study calculated an economic rate of return of some 109 % on the two
combined activities. See Annex 5, Case Study 2.

Objective 5: Strengthen the capacity of the State of São Paulo to implement more efficiently an
expanded natural resource management and conservation program.

           This objective was achieved to an important degree but the process is ongoing. CATI,
more mature, with an experienced and qualified technical staff, and a more rational, decentralized
structure and methodology is today, within the State Government, the institution most closely
identified with the PEMBH and sustainable rural development, and capable of coordinating rural
policies and programs. CATI's pursuit of partnerships with municipal, state and federal
environmental, water resources and other authorities, and with civil society, to leverage
specialized forms of support, is boosting state capacity to manage an expanded program. The
Project-sponsored planning strategy was internalized by CATI which is adopting this model for
other programs and actions.35 A Case Study on the institutional evolution of CATI found that its
work teams clearly understood their institutional mission, and that the PEMBH provided CATI
with the resources to achieve its goals and to consolidate its strategic role in rural development
state-wide. Surveyed groups correlated successful PEMBH outcomes closely with the
institutional evolution of CATI.        36



The PEMBH advanced this process by adopting the mechanism of a defined geographic unit with
a comprehensive development plan, vetted by the CMDR. Armed with these plans, which
incorporate socio-economic elements in addition to environmental, PEMBH beneficiaries have
been able to demand the benefits of other programs beyond those initially contemplated by the
Project. These plans have also facilitated the State's capacity to implement/integrate its rural
social and economic policies with positive impact on their effectiveness and transparency. A

do PEMBH na Qualidade da Água Superficial", Bassi, 2007.
35   CATI is leveraging the PEMBH experience by: (a) providing technical supervision, through its trained UTEs, for
the R$22.0 million rehabilitation of 650 km of rural roads financed by FEHIDRO (State Water Resources Fund)
utilizing the PEMBH methodology via a Manual prepared by CATI for prioritizing critical stretches and integrating
road repair with soil management and conservation in micro-catchments; (b) through the Forestry Savings scheme
(Poupanca Florestal), in partnership with Votorantin Paper and Celulose on environmental recovery activities; and (c)
partnering with the São Paulo Wheat Quality Program to ensure the best certified wheat seedlings.

further direct outcome of this synergy has been greater capacity for horizontal replication of the
PEMBH methodology at very low cost, viewed by the formerly skeptical State Secretariats of
Planning and Finance as a highly positive outcome of the Project. Further, the PEMBH's
innovative and successful micro-catchment mapping activities have provided the State of São
Paulo with a modern database which is in the process of conversion to an online corporate
geographic portal for multiple stakeholders (see Annex 2).37

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1    Analysis shows that the Project has been economically and financially viable.                             An
independent economic analysis conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO,
2008) used the FARMOD structure utilized in 1997, i.e., the same price data, production and farm
models, with specific modifications reflecting project inputs and phasing. The ICR stresses that
this analysis is preliminary given the relatively recent land management improvements on many
micro-catchments/farms and the need for their consolidation and maturation. Nevertheless, the
outlook is promising. See below and Annex 3.

3.3.2    Financial results for farm models: (a) Based on the six farm models studied, income
increases (in 1997 Reais) range from 16% to 156.7%, or values ranging from US$1,400 to
US$6,600 per year; (b) Net present value of incremental income of the six models ranges from
US$1,300 to US$24,000 per year; (c) 13.4% average increase in incremental production by about
70,000 farmers total in 968 micro-catchments, for the four groups of products at full
development;38 (d) 36.4% average increase in incremental production by the 22,000 farmers (of
the 70,000) benefited directly, i.e., adopted technological changes sponsored by the project, for
the four products groups at full development; and (e) Net annual financial income rose 14.7% for
the overall cohort and 44.5% for direct beneficiaries.

3.3.3    Economic analysis: (a) Net Present Value for the 22,000 direct beneficiaries (adopting
farmers) is US$91,580,000 and project Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is 27%; and (b) Sensitivity
analysis shows minimum IRRs of 12.0% with either a 27.6% increase in costs or 21.6% fall in
economic income, showing that the Project can confront major challenges without significant
economic and financial impact.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

3.4.1    This rating is based on the following considerations: (a) project objectives were relevant
to the needs of farmers in the micro-catchment areas and components were consistent with project
objectives, although the ICR considers the appraisal targets and timetable to have been
inconsistent with institutional capacity and the technical strategy; (b) the development priority
remains relevant, especially so given ongoing, problematic conditions of small farmers in the
State of São Paulo; (c) project objectives were largely achieved but certain outcomes require
more formal study and/or considerably more time to mature;39 (d) there was a sharp, albeit late,
structural break in the Project's performance and trajectory resulting from important post-MTR

37 CATI has also as a direct outcome of the PEMBH, launched an online Newsletter reporting on a wide range of rural
programs, activities and events, and providing direct technical advice to farmers on natural resources management and
productive issues. See http://www.cati.sp.gov.br/Cati/_produtos/index_CATI_OnLine.php
38 Product groupings used were: Grains (corn and soybean); Vegetables (beans); Industrial Crops (cotton and coffee);
and Animal Products (meat and milk).
39This is not seen as diminishing project achievements given the late start of critical activities and the immense
amount of on-the-job learning required to reach this stage.



                                                           22

actions (detailed in text); (e) training, awareness-building and more appropriate incentives
prompted farmers to demand and internalize natural resources management messages and
practices with socio-economic goals, seeing them as appropriate to their development; (f) the
project was eventually fully disbursed with good results including positive rates of return on all
farm models analyzed at end-Project; and; (g) important lessons were learned for future, related
operations.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1    Poverty impact: The actual/potential impact on poverty reduction is suggested by the
economic and financial results of the FAO (2008) analysis outlined in section 3.3 and detailed in
Annex 3. Broader poverty impacts including specific measures of family wellbeing improvement
were not studied by the PEMBH. As shown in 3.5.5, poverty targeting of project resources
worked generally according to plan. Further, the management and sustainability of beneficiary
farmers' primary productive asset - land - was improved along with the overall level of small
farmer organization and collective action. Beneficiary farm families are, as a direct result (and
consistent with the project team's vision of the project from the outset), better-prepared to take on
more complex activities including productive, contemplated under the follow-on project, and to
demand access to Federal and State programs. Those programs, in turn, see that better organized
farmers with micro-catchment plans have greater potential to receive and benefit from the
services offered.


3.5.2    Gender: The project had no overt gender focus. There were few women in the
"producer" track and the Incentives Fund did not include resources for the types of productive
activities commonly performed by women. However, the organizational and participatory
methodology created space for women to form their own, parallel associations and cooperatives
and the project financed training for women by specialist organizations in crafts and small-scale
agro-processing. The CATI website refers to such activities. Also, while not quantified through
evaluation, it is likely that women benefited from increased family income, improved rural roads
and environmental improvements, especially improved garbage removal and clean water supply.
The Case Studies suggest positive developments, though still incipient, in women's involvement.
Antuniassi (2007) cites a CATI technician saying "The advance under the PEMBH was that we
started to work with gender, we introduced works which recognized women's value and through
them, their families and children, so that we could succeed in changing the family as a whole."
Further, Lima and Barbosa (2008) surveyed levels of participation by family members in project
activities and found modest levels of participation of women and youth. In 8% of cases the
"producer" participated with female partner, and in 9.5% of cases the entire family participated.
The "producer" per se (male) was the primary participant in 62% of cases. It is not known to what
extent women were active in the associations and CMDRs, i.e. in local and municipal planning
and decision-making forums. The follow-on project provides explicitly for the participation of
women and the monitoring and evaluation of their role and participation.

3.5.3    Social capital: It is likely, given the positive social capital impacts reported by many
evaluations of participatory, decentralized rural projects, and the nature of the learning events and
processes to which PEMBH beneficiaries were exposed, that there was significant social capital
formation ­ both bonding and bridging. Lima and Barbosa (2008) found for example, that in
about 67% of cases, decision-making was interactive and that especially in priority Areas 1 and 2



                                                 23

where the PEMBH was a strong presence, levels of farmer participation in micro-catchments
reached 100% in some cases. The BCR (2009) notes that decisions concerning which stretches of
rural road were top priority were discussed and agreed by farmer associations who also helped
prepare the relevant proposals.

3.5.4   The BCR provides examples of advances and social capital formation prompted by the
PEMBH's organization of farmers: collective purchase of agro-livestock inputs; collective
planting and maintenance of Riparian Forest areas and construction of fences in partnership with
the GEF operation; creation of the Federation of Rural Producers' Associations in Micro-
catchments of São Paulo (FAMHESP) which inter alia, obtained a seat on the FEAP Council to
participate in State Government decisions concerning agricultural credit lines; associations
obtaining certification of properties within PEMBH micro-catchments for the production and
export of fruits; and, PEMBH associations formalizing agreements with service entities such as
health plans, on behalf of their associates.

3.5.5   Targeting: The BCR (2009) demonstrates that targeting by priority Areas 1-3 generally
adhered to the original plan. Results are detailed in Annex 2, Table 2.1. Some 100 micro-
catchments with plans were not attended by any form of incentive, chiefly in Areas 2 and 3. As
explained by CATI, many of these were in sugarcane-growing areas where dispersed
communities were difficult to organize. Such communities commonly sought employment in the
sugarcane-processing plants and participation/engagement of the mayors and extension
technicians were weaker, resulting in lack of understanding of the PEMBH and hence, low
adherence. Further, a tendency to simplify the diagnoses in such areas compromised what
happened subsequently. When the project was able to deliver basic needs, e.g., septic
tanks/systems, adherence and interest increased. Another factor is that micro-catchments with
plans prepared only in the later stages of project implementation had inadequate time to access
project incentives and services. CATI is conducting an evaluation of all micro-catchments with a
Plan to determine readiness to participate in more complex aspects of the new project, i.e.,
productive.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

3.5.6   As noted elsewhere in the BCR (2009), CATI successfully made the difficult transition to
an agency inseparable in the public mind from the PEMBH itself, and a major force in rural
development. The management structure for the PEMBH was somewhat unusual since it did not
create the typical project implementation unit which becomes an "island of excellence",
unsustainable and without political allies, and leaving the project to close without having
achieved institutional growth. The PEMBH was inserted into the structure of the institution
designated to implement it (SAA) and became the dominant element, opening a new vision of
rural technical assistance. However, CATI's internal structure at the outset was inconsistent with
the PEMBH model which integrated environmental with social objectives. Its headquarters
managers    were    dispersed    state-wide, complicating   communications       and   information
dissemination/exchange. The heavy burden on CATI professionals eroded their efficiency and
effectiveness, further exacerbated by low salaries. Their commitment to delivering every aspect
demanded by the PEMBH created a level of exhaustion counter-productive for the institution.
Activities were highly compartmentalized and real managerial power was concentrated in a few
hands. Solutions offered in the initial years to support CATI's operations and administration
were rejected because they undercut the objective of developing its in-house institutional
capacity. Important alternative steps were taken to support CATI (see 2.2.6-2.2.7 and footnotes)
and the project's many challenges were undoubtedly a catalyst to its strong institutional growth.



                                               24

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative):

3.5.7     Among a series of important developments not originally contemplated or expected were
the following: (a) proven utility of PEMBH micro-catchment plans and individual farm plans to
state and municipal efforts to integrate the provision of public services in rural areas; (b) as noted,
creation of FAMHESP to gain greater representation and traction within the PEMBH, and longer-
term in the rural sector;40 (c) evolution and effectiveness of CATI's Engineering Technical Units
under the PEMBH, endowing CATI with arguably the strongest public technical team in the state;
(d) on-farm testing and demonstration of several highly productive small farm technologies (e.g.,
intensive dairying) with potential for widespread replication, including under a follow-on project;
(e) upgrading of SAA/DSMM laboratories and nurseries for developing appropriate species for
state-wide re-forestation, now being used by private firms seeking to evaluate new seed stock and
as a technical input into Federal Ministry of Agriculture official guidelines under its National
Seeds and Seedlings System; and, (f) new environmentally sustainable technologies for
renovating critical stretches of rural roads, internalized by CATI and now adopted by local firms
and municipalities/mayors operating outside the PEMBH.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1     Final evaluation (Navarro, 2008): The study by Navarro ­ a noted rural development
research specialist in Brazil - is a qualitative, comparative analysis of the PEMBH and its peer
project in Santa Catarina. The methodology entailed numerous visits to state regions to interview
beneficiaries, technicians, local authorities and private stakeholders, field visits, and desk reviews
of existing studies. No formal surveys were applied, or control groups utilized and no data is
presented. The intention was to create a roadmap for future projects ­ based on a wide-ranging
consultative process ­ not to try and measure responses to particular questions.

3.6.2     The study concludes that the PEMBH stimulated the formation of autonomous
associations of farm families organized in a way which best represented their immediate interests,
with increasing access to information and growing influence on municipal decision-making,
policies and resource allocation. The sustainability of this organizational framework depends to a
considerable extent on maintaining the micro-catchment as the basic planning, training and
extension services delivery unit.41 The report sets out paradigmatic factors of success: strong,
committed regional and local management, municipalities/mayors responsive to the potential
benefits, families willing to assume leadership, and overall, a convergence of interests and
willingness to take risks associated with innovation. Associations have launched new productive
activities, are collectively purchasing inputs, machinery/equipment, and health insurance, and
seeking sanitary certification for marketing promising crops. Intensive initial training for CATI
extension workers and technicians is cited as critical. See Annex 5 for details including lessons.

3.6.3     Case Studies: As mentioned, the project financed seven case studies of very good
quality, four of which used beneficiary/other stakeholder surveys, while others report more
technical findings. Those with survey results are summarized individually in Annex 5. Important



40  FAMHESP associations were pivotal in pressing for changes to the Soil Law (demonstrating the legitimacy and
importance of the Incentives Fund to their participation in the PEMBH), in seeking extension of the Closing Date, and
pressing authorities for a follow-on project.
41 The report cites the Botacatu Region, formerly dominated by coffee monoculture and now transitioning into more
diversified agricultural activities due to opportunities offered by the PEMBH; and the Dracena Region, formerly
economically and socially depressed and losing population, and now showing the best results of the PEMBH state-
wide.

aspects of the technical studies are mentioned in Section 3.2 and throughout this ICR. The seven
studies are listed in Annex 9 and filed in the project archive/IRIS4.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

4.0.1    Sustainability: The following developments under the PEMBH are expected to have
promoted sustainability: (a) CATI's maturation as the primary rural development agency with
appropriate structure, experience and skills to expand the PEMBH methodology, focusing more
intensively on small farm productivity and marketing within a sound NRM framework;42 (b)
greater collaboration, mutual recognition of each agency's role and functions, and operational
"routines" between technical teams of the Secretariats of Agriculture, Environment and Water
Resources; (c) integration function of the Micro-catchment Plans, PECs and PIPs as a transparent,
legitimate guide for Federal, State and Municipal governments to target resources in rural areas;43
(d) CATI's contracting of 200 additional technical staff to be stationed in its Regional Offices to
maintain continuity of the program, and prepare for the proposed new operation; (e) the over
400,000 primary school children and teachers now better-aware of socio-environmental
conservation and sustainability; (f) increased social capital stemming from the consultative,
participatory methodology for diagnosing micro-catchment needs and preparing and executing
micro-catchment plans, as well as the extensive network of farmer organizations and the
political/economic goals of FAMHESP.44

4.0.2    Environmental management: Project actions were designed explicitly to improve
environmental management in rural areas and based on the project's physical, technical and
learning achievements, and events supporting sustainability, the ICR believes that the risk to
development outcome is modest.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.1    This Project had an unusual trajectory including the hiatus from initial negotiation in
1993 to re-negotiation/Board presentation in 1997, followed by another three-year delay awaiting


42  Much depends on joint action by federal, state and municipal authorities/players acting both vertically and
horizontally, based on more coherent rural development policies (BCR, 2009).
43  More efficient use of public resources via: (i) application of FEHIDRO (State Water Resources Fund) funds for the
recovery and conservation of water resources; (ii) adoption by FEHIDRO of the PEMBH's rural roads methodology,
and use of CATI as a technical agent to evaluate projects and supervise works financed by FEHIDRO, using CATI's
trained manpower.
44  Also important: CATI's website now lists all financing lines available (Federal and State) and accessible by the
regions, municipalities, micro-catchment associations and technicians to serve the 100 micro-catchment plans still
unattended at closing; and, CATI's PEMBH-based rural roads planning pilot in the Municipality of Alvinlândia,
defining key conservation and maintenance areas to improve use of public resources and scale up rural road works
state-wide.




                                                            26

signature and Effectiveness. The Bank project team sought to ensure that the revived project
reflected the lessons of similar operations in other states and the evolving political and social
economy. The Bank was willing to move ahead with a less than perfect project to give the
Borrower an opportunity to move forward with its own rural development objectives. Equally
however, it was the Bank's decision to expand the focus beyond traditional land management,
something the Borrower/CATI was ill-prepared to tackle in such a short time period. In general,
time/other constraints affected the analysis of technical and operational complexity and
feasibility, institutional capacity, procurement design, costs, performance targets and execution
timetable. São Paulo was essentially launching the methodology from scratch despite the lessons
of other states and had to learn by doing just as they had done. The implications emerged rapidly
once implementation started.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

5.1.2    Bank supervision was proactive throughout. The 164 staff weeks expended overall
reflects the implementation effort required for the first stage of an innovative operation of this
type. Some performance ratings in the initial years were unduly optimistic. The project team
focused heavily on the difficult preliminary activities designed to position an innovative project
for successful take-off, assigning a high value to what was going well while downplaying slower
progress of other key activities. Bank supervision of elements such as fiduciary performance and
M&E merited more attention than they received. By the Mid-term Review, changes in the
country, the client and the Bank, and influential conclusions of the MTR evaluation resulted in
greater realism and willingness to address certain issues head-on. The Bank team sought broad
input to resolve problems, promoted direct engagement between Bank management and senior
State authorities, and maintained pressure for the Borrower's timely fulfillment of agreed Action
Plans used to justify extension of the closing date. The quasi restructuring inter alia, established
more realistic and achievable physical targets. This galvanized project execution and garnered
renewed political and financial commitment from the Borrower in the project's later years.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.3    The project was innovative and sought to capitalize on Government's burgeoning interest
in decentralized, sustainable rural poverty reduction based on modern land management
technologies, as well as the lessons of other similar operations. While events arose which would
have derailed even the best-designed project and were beyond the Bank's control, the impact on
implementation of project design deficiencies was significant, even taking into account the vision
and effort involved in adjusting the project to new realities in Brazil at the time of re-appraisal,
and under a tight timeframe. Bank supervision, reporting and even commitment to this operation
were uneven at times. However, this is balanced by the project's many successes and multiplier
effects which are attributed, to an important degree, to the project team's sustained, underlying
belief that the project on the ground - a new confluence of social, environmental and productive
goals - represented much more than the framework expressed in the SAR.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory




                                                27

5.2.1    Project design was consistent with Government's strategy for the environment and rural
poverty reduction and its commitment was firm throughout the protracted, interrupted preparation
period. However, SAA leadership for much of the project execution period was lukewarm
towards this strategy. Damaging project budget and counterpart funding shortages, even taking
into account the impact of the FRL, could have been eased if higher-level official commitment
and advocacy had been stronger. Reducing the level of budget contingencies and releasing
withheld budget in greater amounts and sooner, were within government's control, as was
decisive action to support the procurement provisions of the Loan Agreement. Both would have
promoted faster implementation at greater scale. Even so, as the project was adjusted,
consolidated and began to show results, perceptions evolved within government, and political and
financial commitment strengthened. Planning and operational alliances were established between
the secretariats of planning, finance, water resources, environment and agriculture. These events
enabled the project to progress rapidly in its final years and paved the way for the planned new
operation.

(b) Implementing Agency Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.2    In general, technical performance, once consolidated, was superior to that at the
managerial and political levels. CATI's technical staff kept the project going at times when SAA
leadership neither understood nor supported the project.         Burdened with complex project
demands and struggling to find adequate support at decentralized levels, the technical cohort
proved unequivocally that it is the continuity, skills, organization and dedication of such teams
which ultimately make the difference in project outcomes. Coping with multiple handicaps
including strong initial resistance to the project in its own ranks, design issues and lack of
experience with the Bank, CATI directly involved itself in core project activities, resolved
complex problems, and managed to steer the project to meet or exceed most of its (revised)
targets. CATI's continued institutional and technical growth during the Project's new phase was
also a determinant of the project's final results.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.2.3    It is important to distinguish between the Borrower and CATI in making a balanced
judgment about overall Borrower performance. Lack of SAA support for the project over at least
a four year period took its toll, rating a Moderately Unsatisfactory. However, factoring in CATI's
strong performance, on balance, overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2.4    The Borrower's Letter (see Annex 7) commenting on the Bank's ICR agrees that the
latter reflects Government's general view of the Project's history. However, the ICR notes the
letter's disagreement with the apparent severity of the Moderately Satisfactory rating for the
performance of the Government of São Paulo/CATI (and the Bank). The letter summarizes key
characteristics of the project in defense of a more favorable rating: its atypical beginnings and
protracted delays in signature and effectiveness, some of which beyond the control of the State or
the Bank; and, broadly innovative nature of the project requiring beneficiary participation and
major changes in institutional behavior. The difficulties and challenges of implementing certain
activities and achieving tangible results, and the many sustainable successes stemming from the
Bank-Borrower collaboration, as well as lessons learned ­ political, operational and technical -
are also noted. However, the ICR maintains the existing rating based on the balanced assessment
required of overall Borrower performance.

6. Lessons Learned

(a)      The micro-catchment approach to planning and implementing targeted, participatory
land management programs with social and productive goals remains valid. Organized
beneficiary farmers, having witnessed the impact of technological change and better land
management practices on their lands, are now poised to exploit the productive benefits they were
promised as a result. Further, the micro-catchment is an effective forum for rural organization and
planning - important for more complex productive and other activities - and a building block for
exploring and facilitating territorial and/or regional development approaches.

(b)      Innovative projects require a longer-term vision tolerant of evolving, repeater
operations which consolidate/build on initial gains, scale up coverage, adjust methodology and
host further innovation. First-cycle micro-catchment projects need to build installed capacity to
more rapidly and successfully execute follow-up operations. The inevitable result is the short time
available under the initial project to capitalize on and consolidate acquired knowledge and
experience. Scaling-up should be balanced with further innovation under follow-on operations.

(c)      Preparation needs to reduce the potential for "surprises", build flexibility into
technical and operational design and foresee diverse development scenarios. Errors in initial
project formulation are difficult to correct as a project gains momentum, divert human resources
and cause delay. Prescient preparation is consultative, understands the operational mechanics of
the technical/other strategies and builds in flexibility to confront the unforeseen challenges
typical of rural realities. Project authorities and technicians accordingly require real decision-
making authority, and regional teams should be decentralized.

(e)      Communications and advocacy need the same attention as other elements, especially in
innovative operations. There is a need to continuously "sell" the project rationale, objectives and
results to senior authorities, budget officials and policy makers across the political spectrum, in
all related agencies, and beyond the rural sector. Visits by authorities to the project area/micro-
catchments to demonstrate project activities and impact, and meet beneficiaries and local
collaborators, are recommended.

(f)      The cost-effectiveness and logic of formally evaluating this type of project in its initial
stage is questionable, especially in regard to poverty impact, agricultural production and
productivity trends, as well as the sustainability of new technologies/practices. Innovative rural
projects typically have about two years of normal implementation at closing. Simpler but
methodologically valid techniques may be more appropriate to assess initial outcomes and trends,
and to educate institutions on the rationale and methodology for deeper evaluation.

(h)      The capillarity and decentralized managerial structure of an executive extension
agency is critical. PEMBH-type projects require an extremely strong presence in the countryside.
They are essentially a local-level capacity builder and organizer, a clearing-house for demand,
and a catalyst to more effective and efficient rural public policy instruments. Their regional
offices/representatives also have an important liaison role in explaining the project to local
politicians/stakeholders to win their attention and commitment.

(i)      Complex tasks assigned to extension workers under the integrated micro-catchment
approach require clear criteria for selecting technicians and attention to training, especially
important when responsibility for extension services is assigned to municipal governments. The
organization/timing of this training is challenging when extension workers need to start work



                                                  29

immediately. Navarro (2008) recommends the formation of regional, multi-disciplinary teams
with appropriate skills and a strong focus on training.

(j)     Project incentives must be appropriate, mitigating farmers' concerns about negative
impacts on livelihoods while changes are being implemented and representing the real demands
of poorer farmers, attractive enough to mobilize families and gain their adhesion, and to attract
even indirect stakeholders/beneficiaries such as municipal governments.

(k)     Institutional coordination and cross-support ­ both vertical and horizontal ­ are
essential ingredients for rural development projects and should be leveraged from public and
private entities with specialized skills and experience. Municipal authorities are essential players
but securing their adhesion can be challenging given local party politics and interests, and
capacity issues need to be addressed. Municipal authorities can facilitate and sustain project
actions in micro-catchments, their support is essential for regional and territorial approaches, and
support for municipal environmental agendas can deepen a project's environmental focus.

(l)     Project design should avoid key project activities being "captive" to national or state
laws and/or decrees and to seeking legislative change to support ongoing project
implementation. Today, the preferred route would be for project activities to be governed by the
Operational Manual approved by the project executing agency, and which can be changed by
mutual agreement at any time.

(m)     Projects of this type need to generate a substantial portion of the knowledge required
for their success and therefore, research activities should preferably be simple, adaptive trials
demonstrated on farmers' land and designed to support productive potential and growth. They
are also more appropriately included and financed under a next generation of projects when
farmer organization, capacity-building and other foundational work has been done. Separate
research components tend to be distant from a project's on-the-ground dynamic and their track
record in projects of this type is generally weak.

(n)     Remote sensing tools, now widely available, can play a critical role in the preparation,
implementation and evaluation of such projects. This is especially relevant given the
acknowledged high cost of traditional monitoring of micro-catchments and the opportunity to
obtain precise/measurable before and after project comparisons. The use of digital images and
GPS, and the elaboration of digital maps using that information was an important project
innovation with multiplier and demonstration effects reaching well beyond the project.

(o)     Extension of the closing date can have a high payoff when based on a realistic
assessment of the minimum conditions on the ground for leveraging rapid gains. Extensions
should be examined case by case, be carefully justified and quantified, and be governed by
milestone-based action plans. Rigorous supervision by the Bank and full commitment of the
Borrower are essential for deriving maximum benefit from an extension.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Drawing on the candid and comprehensive Borrower Completion Report (CATI, July 2008), the
following summarizes the highlights under individual components and subcomponents. Table 2.2
shows main targets by component/sub-component, post-MTR adjustments and end-project results
and Table 2.3 shows expenditures at closing versus appraisal by component and subcomponent.

Component 1: Technology and Institutional Development Component:

(a) Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Subcomponent financed: (i) vehicles, computer
and field equipment for CATI's (Technical Assistance Coordinating Unit) staff assigned to the
project; (ii) incremental operating costs for 150 CATI professionals; and (iii) services contracted
out to about 150 extension professionals to be recruited by selected municipalities with the
participation of farmers' associations.

The Project envisaged a new form of rural extension involving major methodological changes,
shifting the focus from the product per se, to the production system within micro-catchments,
where families and communities were actively engaged and using the micro-catchment as the
work unit. The overriding goals were greater efficiency, lower costs and decentralization of the
public system. Longer-term sustainability would be promoted by mobilizing and organizing
communities, convincing them of the PEMBH's technical rationale and potential
benefits/impacts.

Project extension workers were central to the successful implementation of the project's technical
and operational strategies and had diverse and complex responsibilities which included:
promoting the participation and organization of farmers into micro-watershed-based associations;
providing leadership training for a cadre of program facilitators; providing technical assistance
(TA) to producers, acting as executive secretaries to the CMDRs (Municipal Rural Development
Councils)45 and promoting their formation in municipalities still lacking such councils. They also
tested and disseminated adaptive research, organized environment-related activities, prepared
individual farm land use plans (PIPs) and farmers' applications for project incentives, and
supported the planning and implementation of road improvement activities.46




45CMDRs were created, with the Regional Rural Development Councils (CRDRs), in 1995 (and modified 1997) as
part of the Federal Government's Integrated Agricultural and Supply System seeking to decentralize government
services with full beneficiary participation, under the new Federal Constitution of 1988.

46 CATI extension workers, with municipal extension workers, supported training in conservation techniques for
farmers' associations in each new micro-watershed area for a three year period as well as follow-up assistance and
monitoring for another two years. They also provided individual assistance to small-scale farmers, as available.
Complementary assistance was also provided, mainly to medium and large-scale farmers at the individual farm level,
by private extension workers/firms.




                                                           32

CATI had overall responsibility for technical assistance and extension in partnership with the
municipalities. Municipalities seeking to participate signed an agreement with SAA. The
Regional Rural Development Councils (CRDR) decided the priority of municipalities which in
turn, through their CMDRs, determined which micro-catchments had priority based on criteria in
the Operational Manual. Using diagnostic tools ­ maps, community surveys, socio-economic and
environmental surveys ­ the extension technician, with beneficiaries, identified the main
problems and designed solutions which could be implemented collectively using improved
natural resources management techniques. Implementation was based on Individual Property
Plans (PIP) and Community Development Projects (PEC), and other specific types of projects
when deemed necessary.

Project design called for the transfer of state financial resources to municipal governments to hire
extension workers, with CATI evaluating the quality of candidates proposed by the
municipalities. Post FRL (2002), inter-governmental transfers for the hiring of staff were no
longer permitted and municipalities had to bear these costs out of their budgets.             Some
municipalities lacked such resources, others were unconvinced of the value of the project and
resisted such allocations, while others used the opportunity to hire people nominated by the
mayor but not necessarily well-qualified. In some cases where the extension worker showed
excellent performance, he/she was reassigned to other government tasks. In summary, post-FRL
and under "municipalization", the State Government and CATI lost influence in hiring rural
extension workers to the detriment of project implementation.

Post-MTR, the technology adaptation units planned under the Adaptive Research component, and
rural extension activities planned under the Environmental Education sub-component, were
transferred to this sub-component.

Implementation and Outputs:

     The generally successful execution of this subcomponent - in which the role of the
         technical executors and their teams was fundamental - was a determining factor in project
         outcomes and in re-fashioning the rural technical assistance and extension model.

     CATI was strengthened institutionally, including through its operational infrastructure
         and human resources, and the adoption of a results-based management model.

     The project contributed decisively to building and strengthening TA and extension
         capacity in participating municipalities, promoting awareness of sustainable rural
         development, the objectives of the micro-catchment-based methodology, and the
         importance of supportive public policies. Municipalities with rural extension and TA
         agreements with the SAA rose from 350 in 2000 to 514 in 2007.

     Municipal interest in the program was demonstrated by mayors' willingness to finance
         project-related extension technicians once the FRL restriction on transferring project
         funds went into effect. This service model has strong potential; training and recurrent
         budget are critical.

     Municipalization however, is strongly criticized in various project documents/studies
         inter alia, because of the frequent turnover of contracted extension workers (which had at
         times serious effects on the continuity of their work with associations at the micro-




                                                  33

         catchment level), very low salaries paid to them (about one-third of the salary paid to a
         CATI technician) and the lack of adequate training to launch their activities in the field.

     Civil society gained a strong foothold and decisive influence in the selection,
         prioritization and monitoring of municipalities under the project. Some 530 Municipal
         Councils (CMDR) and 40 Regional Councils (CRDR) were organized and strengthened;
         participation in these Councils boosted local producers' political capital. Further, some
         968 participatory micro-catchment plans were prepared covering 514 municipalities.

     An unanticipated outcome critical for the PEMBH's longer-term sustainability, the
         participatory planning exercises for the micro-catchments, communities and individual
         properties increased their legitimacy have become multi-sector, demand-based roadmaps
         extending well beyond the PEMBH itself and requiring integrated service provision by
         the state and municipalities. Legitimate demands in a single, unified format have already
         proved valuable to agencies and service entities responsible for health, security,
         transportation (especially to schools), communications, garbage collection, literacy
         training, rural electrification, and in some communities are responsible for a marked
         reduction in the rural exodus.

     The PEMBH adhered closely to its original targeting framework, concentrating benefits
         in three areas of relative priority, as shown below:

(b) Rural Organization Subcomponent: financed provision of >US$3,500 per association to
purchase selective administrative and managerial equipment (office equipment, micro-computers)
and consultants to strengthen the capacity of farmers' associations. Strong farmers' associations
within each micro-watershed were strategically important to the project concept, longer-term
sustainability, and the component's decentralization and efficiency objectives. Associations had
to qualify for this incentive.47

Implementation and outputs: This subcomponent envisaged the formation and strengthening of
one association per micro-watershed.              As the project evolved, the importance of the local
dynamic between the micro-watershed and the municipality also had to be acknowledged. Many
associations were already represented at the municipal level and did not support environmental


47 Associations had to: (i) be formally constituted; (ii) have a min. 70% of members within the micro-watershed
benefiting from the project; (iii) have been in the program and implementing activities called for in the PGM, for
minimum of one year; and (iv) have prepared a project justifying the requested service and approved by minimum 70%
of members.

reasons for creating new associations for each micro-watershed because it was seen as weakening
the existing association to which they belonged.

The sub-component established and/or reorganized some 491 associations (vs. MTR-revised
target 400), and was a catalyst to the creation of the Federation of Rural Producers of Micro-
catchment Associations of Sao Paulo (FAMHESP) to achieve greater representation within both
the PEMBH and the state rural sector. This was a significant event demonstrating more mature
attitudes towards the benefits of organization. FAMHESP also played a critical role in seeking
changes to the Soil Use Law, demonstrating that legitimate needs would be served by changing
the Law; and, induced greater local participation of farmers through its representation and
influence in the CMDRs, inter alia, an important boost for project sustainability.

The BCR (2008) provides notable examples of advances/social capital prompted by the
PEMBH's organization of farmers: collective purchase of agro-livestock inputs; collective
planting and maintenance of Riparian Forest areas and construction of fences under the GEF
operation; FAMHESP obtained a seat on the FEAP Council to participate in State Government
decisions concerning agricultural credit lines; associations obtained certification of properties
within PEMBH micro-catchments for the production and export of fruits; and, PEMBH
associations formalized agreements with other entities such as health plans, on behalf of their
associates.

(c) Agro-ecological Mapping Subcomponent: The component financed a series of five maps for
each project micro-catchment: (i) land use (e.g., annual and perennial crops, roads, houses, farm
infrastructure, villages); (ii) topographical map; (iii) soils map; (iv) map of land tenure structure
(e.g., property limits); and (v) analytical map of environmental variables/risk (e.g., location of
gullies, forest remnants, APPs, garbage dumps). Maps were seen as key technical instruments for
field extension workers in soils classification, land use planning, and up-to-date resource
information for state technicians and the farming communities. It was also intended that they be
used for environmental education, enforcement of land use laws, identification of road
rehabilitation needs, and selection of degraded areas for special attention.

Implementation and outputs: This was an exceptionally successful subcomponent even though
it did not meet its original or revised targets. A set of critical maps was developed for each of
970 micro-catchments (revised target 950) as well as 37,642 Land Use Capacity maps (revised
target 45,000). This subcomponent envisaged contracting specialized firms to prepare maps in the
first two years, and that CATI technical staff would be trained to assume this mapping function
by Year 3. The experience of trying to contract such firms showed: (a) mapping needed fieldwork
and farmer participation; (b) maps needed timely preparation to support micro-watershed plans;
(c) the process was expensive and time-consuming; and, (d) few firms existed capable of making
maps for multiple micro-watersheds simultaneously.

Given these circumstances, CATI developed its own methodology, using its effective Technical
Engineering Units, intensively trained and bringing in information systems, GPS equipment and
purchasing aerial photos and satellite images from which to prepare maps which in turn,
permitted preparation of the Micro-watershed Plans. The satellite images were ortho-corrected,
digitized, and stored in a digital database. A large number of personal GPS instruments were also
acquired and project extension technicians were trained to use them for determining the location
of major features to be highlighted in the maps, and later, of land use improvements implemented
by the beneficiaries (e.g., wells, water wheels, pasture pickets, road improvements, minimum
tillage agriculture, home sewage treatment systems and re-forested river margins).



                                                 35

The use of digital images and GPS, and the elaboration of digital maps using that information,
was an important innovation brought into CATI by the project that continues to be applied to a
roster of other activities in CATI's work program. The successful experience internalized within
CATI a sophisticated technical knowledge of agro-environmental mapping.48 Farmers involved in
developing diagnoses and micro-catchment plans could see first-hand from these maps, how
environmental features were integrated with productive. The rural roads repairs and erosion
control works were also facilitated by these maps, as were activities to enforce the Soil Use Law
and activities under the GEF Matas Ciliares operation. CATI has since taken the important step of
ensuring that they are accessible to/utilized by a wide audience including farmer organizations,
private industry and public institutions via a new online Geographic Data Portal. See BCR
(2008) for details.

Component 2: Adaptive Agricultural Research:

This component was intended to develop or adapt technical solutions for problems identified by
farming communities at the micro-watershed level, thus endorsing the project's technical
strategy. The effectiveness of existing technology in soil conservation, land management and
pollution control would be tested and demonstrated, and new applied technology generated for
different soil and agronomic conditions. Research trials would be executed on the property of
small-scale farmers - to amplify the demonstration effect and promote demand-driven and
participatory methodologies - and under direct supervision of CATI, SAA and/or contracted
researchers. Results would be disseminated via seminars, field days and workshops.

Implementation and outputs: This component faced daunting obstacles and was eliminated.
Research institutions were not interested in participating in research projects stemming from
micro-watershed-level diagnoses, asserting that they were incompatible with their established
research programs.49 Further, the planned project implementation period was believed too short
to permit the generation of even minimally satisfactory research results. Adaptive research
activities were seen as tools of rural extension and were shifted to the Rural Extension
Subcomponent via its use of demonstration plots. While performance was below expectations and
this remains an important area for further efforts under a new, follow-on operation, important
activities were financed, working mainly on the properties of small farmers ­ known as
Technology Adaptation Units - supervised by a research worker.

These units successfully enabled the following: (a) Plantio Direto na Palha (minimum tillage
technique) developed in partnership with EMBRAPA Agro-livestock West, and training for
technicians in promoting its adoption; (b) small farm milk production technologies and training of
a large number of technicians to promote adoption. This activity led to the state-wide CATI-Leite
program, launched in 2008; (c) bio-digestive septic tank technology, installed on demonstration
farms and subsequently promoted via the Incentives Fund to reduce soil and water pollution and
improve family wellbeing; (d) new technologies for intervening in critical stretches of rural roads,
which have since been adopted by private roads firms and municipal authorities.

Component 3: Incentive Program for Natural Resource Management and Conservation


48Ironically, it was felt in 1998 that the technical demands of the mapping activities were beyond CATI's capacity and
needed to be contracted to specialized firms.

49Research institutions in São Paulo are also commonly linked to large agro-industrial concerns and programs willing
to pay higher fees.




                                                           36

This component was intended to induce and accelerate adoption by farm families of sound
techniques for managing and conserving natural resources within micro-catchments. The
component comprised five subcomponents intended to be implemented in an integrated manner:

(a) Environmental Education Subcomponent: Sought to induce behavior changes, promote
environmental awareness in the micro-catchment communities and wider public (through the
schools and local leaders), and foster the sustainability of project interventions. It financed: (i)
purchasing of and/or contracting of private entities to prepare environmental education programs
and teaching materials; (ii) audio-visual equipment; (iii) technical assistance; and (iv) incremental
operating costs.

Implementation and outputs: This subcomponent was designed to signal an explicit teaching
goal and was in practice, highly successful. The MTR evaluation recommended that its activities
be distributed within the Training and Dissemination Component and the Rural Extension
Subcomponent, thereby highlighting the premise that the entire program contributed to and was a
form of environmental education. The subcomponent achieved its goal of building awareness in
farm families, rural communities and municipal urban populations of the need to protect natural
resources and contributed decisively to the achievement of project objectives. It was also highly
successful in building the adherence of CATI technicians and involved municipalities to the idea
of sustainable agriculture. Activities financed transformed farming routines/practices and changed
personal habits.

The subcomponent financed: (a) identification and training of 790 environmental agents to
support CATI's technicians in the field and the formation of environmental groups; (b) formation
of 80 environmental education groups within the municipalities who promoted numerous local
activities, e.g., garbage and litter collection, tree planting, recycling of cooking oil cans, and
education campaigns. The highlight of this subcomponent was the "Learning with Nature"
program in schools ­ not included in the original project design - which reached over 383,000
grade-school students, working through the municipal Casas de Agricultura (CA) and comprising
typically, visits to micro-catchments and individual farms, tree-planting events, seminars and
workshops, all designed to build a life-long interest in and awareness of the environment and
sound protection/conservation practices. CATI's 40 Regional Offices received equipment to
establish multi-media rooms supporting the Learning with Nature classes. See also description of
this subcomponent and outputs in Main Text, section 3.2.4.

(b)   Incentive Fund for Soil Management and Conservation and Pollution Control (IP)
Subcomponent: The IP, created by Law 8421 of November 1993, financed limited financial
support through grants (up to max. US$3,000) to eligible small- and medium-scale farmers for
activities supporting the project's technical strategy (as recommended in the Micro-catchment
Development Plans (PGM)) and which required collective investments generating long-term
returns or yield benefits to wider society. Such investments were often avoided by small farmers
due to their high cost, lack of an economic return, and lack of understanding of their beneficial
effects. IP payments were to be temporary and terminate with the PEMBH's closing; and were
intended to consolidate previous state subsidies granted under the PEMBH, improve targeting to
small farmers and promote greater transparency and decentralization. Farmers would use their
own funds initially and be reimbursed by the incentive payment.

Implementation and outputs: This subcomponent was underpinned by the Soil Usage Law which
provided the legal basis to make incentive payments to producers in micro-watersheds with
approved plans, but the original law actually restricted project-supported practices and resulted in


                                                  37

decreasing payments as implementation proceeded.50 Types of incentives permitted by the Law
were also too limited (based strictly on agronomic/environmental objectives and not adaptable to
the PEMBH's poverty/social aspects). There was also the need to gain the confidence of farmers
who were required, under this new instrument, to share the costs of new practices adopted ­ the
incentives reimbursed a portion of the total expenditure. Project incentives ceased to be effective
in promoting the adoption of good practices.

The Law was finally changed in 2006 to encompass a wider set of practices supported by the
project and to attend to producers' demands presented in Micro-watershed Plans and a more
flexible approach to incentive payment percentages (as defined by the Secretary of Agriculture).
Changes were made to accommodate the subcomponent operationally to the new law: (a) number
of members needed to access Type III community supply reduced from 15 to 5 producers; (b)
types of practices supported by the program were expanded and percentages for program support
were revised; (c) maximum support per beneficiary rose from US$3,000 to US$3,750; (d) criteria
for classification as "small producer" were revised by reducing the required share of income from
agro-livestock activities from 80% to 70% and omitting the permanent contracting of labor as a
criterion, thereby bringing IP criteria overall into line with those of the Federal Government's
PRONAF (National Family Agriculture Support Program).

The subcomponent achieved its goals of stimulating via demonstration, the adoption of modern
practices/technologies for the management and conservation of soils and control of pollution as
follows:

(a) Well over 36,911 farmers (appraisal target 21,840) and 3,930 groups (appraisal target 3,410)
benefited from Fund-financed investments in water supply systems, machinery and equipment,
fencing, seeds, terracing, and septic tank construction.

(b) Farmers invested about R$78.19 million in the execution of recommended practices of which
R$54.17 million were reimbursed via the Incentives Fund and the remaining R$24.02 million
represented farmer counterpart contribution.

(c) There was a sharp upswing in IP funding in 2006 and 2007 due to changes in the Soil Use
Law which expanded the types of investments eligible and increased the percentage of the total
investment supported as well as the overall number of micro-catchments eligible to access the
incentives.

(d) Certain key activities such as terracing for soil conservation fell short of their original and
revised (post-MTR) targets due to extensive sugar-cane cultivation and introduction of terracing
and use of green fertilizer by those producers. Projects financed by FEHIDRO and some
municipalities also promoted terracing and other conservationist practices independent of the
PEMH.

(e) The State Government is preparing legislation to make such incentive schemes a permanent
feature of rural development policy.



50Weaknesses in the Law as it applied to the Incentives Fund were discovered during initial implementation of the P-
PEMH by the State Government in advance of project effectiveness. The first incentives under the PEMBH were not
paid until 2002 and at low levels. Gathering enough field evidence to present to legislators showing that the Fund as it
existed did not serve project needs, took time. Once proposed changes were finally ready, the legislature acted rapidly.




                                                         38

(f) The IP had a direct influence on the diversification of farm activities, for example: (i) short
cycle poultry production made more viable by better roads for marketing purposes and better
quality/quantity of water supply; (ii) community water storage permitting "hothouse" cropping
under plastic using drip irrigation enabled by better quality water not prone to clogging; and (iii)
milk production on small farms, tested by PEMBH adaptive research units and widely
disseminated.

(g) This latter activity (now known as CATI-Leite) resulted in an increase of 100% in milk
production, 15% in herd numbers, and a decrease in pasture area utilized for production of 57%.
This resulted in a productivity increase of milk per ha/per year of about 367% meaning improved
income for producers and the release of land for other uses. It also demonstrated unequivocally
the positive impact of the Incentives Fund as a determinant of improved, integrated practices
linked directly to better incomes and quality of life.

(c) Incentive for Recovery of Degraded Lands Subcomponent: This subcomponent sought to
induce adoption of modern techniques to recover degraded lands, as per PGM recommendations.
Participatory, socio-economic, agro-ecological surveys would help micro-watershed communities
identify critical areas for recovery/stabilization. Areas covered by the PEMBH presented different
levels of degradation: some showing accelerated erosion and ravines/gullies requiring
stabilization and/or areas with only moderate or no erosion but with soils affected by poor
practices reducing productivity and vegetative coverage. Two types of subprojects would be
financed for small and medium farmers: (i) individual, to control sheet and gully erosion; and (ii)
collective, for group purchase of equipment to reduce tillage and improve land management
practices. Eligibility and classification criteria were the same as for the IP, but this incentive
would be provided to farmers in kind.

Implementation and outputs: Targets were achieved. This subcomponent benefited over 1500
producer groups and 212 associations via some 1,826 specific activities to control sheet and gully
erosion and investment in 217 sets of equipment supporting these activities. Some 2,138 gullies
on 1,495 properties were controlled. Motorized recuperation of gullies was supported, limited to
a maximum ceiling, with the producer responsible for paying hourly rental costs which exceeded
the limit. The practice of cost-sharing promoted stronger farmer commitment to the process.
Further, the original strategy for this subcomponent was to promote adoption of planting on the
line without disturbing the surrounding ground/vegetative cover (Plantio Direto na Palha) to
reduce tillage. Provision of a kit to producer associations was envisaged (seed machine for direct
planting, and threshing/grinding (triturador) machine). Following producers' acquisition of 21
such kits, the project began to supply only the seeding equipment due to its good performance
even without the threshing equipment. This permitted an expanded number of associations to
receive seeding machinery (see Table 2.1 below). The area utilizing Plantio Direto expanded
from 100,000 ha in 1998 to over 1.0 million ha by 2007.

The Case Study "Adequacao de Estradas Rurais e Controle de Vocorocas" (Rabello and
Baptistella, 2007) demonstrates the social, economic and environmental impact of these practices
from the viewpoint of 39 PEMBH producers in diverse regions of the State. Highly positive
responses ranged from 90-100% for all questions ­ economic gains, property values, stimulus to
new investments, environmental gains and self-esteem.

(d) Re-forestation Subcomponent: This subcomponent financed provision of up to 2,600
seedlings (for up to 2 ha) per farmer free of charge ­ social benefits were judged to far outweigh
private gain - following recommendations of the PGMs and PIPs. Overall, the plan was to
provide over 13 million seedlings of native species to beneficiary farmers to plant an estimated


                                                   39

11,000 ha for conservation purposes at the micro-watershed level. The community, guided by the
extension worker and using the micro-watershed's analytical map of environmental risk, would
identify areas for reforestation. Given the strong externalities of reforestation in a state rapidly
losing its forest cover, micro-watershed or farmers with permanent forest cover would receive
higher ratings to qualify for other project incentives.

Implementation and outputs: This subcomponent showed very satisfactory results even though
quantitative achievements were lower than expected at appraisal. It showed that an organized,
State-coordinated effort with effective support from the Mayors and communities, and involving
farmers, their associations/cooperatives and private firms in rural areas, and accompanied by
multi-level environmental education, could promote a substantial increase in area planted with
native forest. Most participating farmers were not initially prepared to assume responsibility for
re-forestation due to lack of interest/motivation. Seedlings were available but scattered in sites
around the state. Sustainability of this effort required: effective action under the Environmental
Education subcomponent; production and free distribution of seedlings to beneficiaries, and
technical assistance; involvement of the Mayors in transporting the seedlings to beneficiaries'
properties, facilitating their access; and linking the Incentives Fund to reforestation.

This subcomponent envisaged the purchase of seedlings from certain private nurseries and their
donation by the project to participating producers, in addition to the production of seedlings by
CATI nurseries which had control over the type of seedlings produced. The main nurseries
producing native forest species participated by providing plants in embryo to CATI which
guaranteed sufficient supply of native forest plants to serve the demands of the Plans, including
micro-catchment, and including demands of the GEF operation. The project guaranteed private
sector participation in the production of native species, generated income, stimulated the regional
production of seeds and increased the diversity of species available as well as the genetic quality
of seedlings supplied to the micro-catchments. Quantitative achievements were about on par with
post-MTR reduced targets.

Producers adopted reforestation with enthusiasm ­ especially planting along waterways - once
they understood the implications/benefits. Riparian Forests planted were some 3,784 ha
protecting some 1,267 km of waterways. This subcomponent also isolated 1,493 km of waterway
margins using project incentives to install protective fencing around springs. A new market was
created for forest products and production efficiencies and new practices were introduced,
including: (i) requests for seedlings by individual beneficiary based on farm conditions, water
availability etc; (ii) creation of a financial incentive to maintain planted trees; and (iii) giving
priority to farmers with a planting plan ready and transporting seedlings directly to those farms.
CATI's nurseries (DSMM) guaranteed the supply of plants including for the GEF operation,
working in collaboration with private plant providers. Some 4.5 million seedlings were produced.
Other important advances and benefits are noted by the BCR (2008). See also Table 2.2 below.

(e) State Environmental Law Enforcement Subcomponent: This was designed to improve
enforcement of environmental legislation on land use, soil conservation, and rural pollution in
PEMBH areas, i.e., the 1,500 micro-catchments to be benefited by the project. The subcomponent
would finance additional vehicles and computer equipment, and incremental recurrent costs to
strengthen 24 of CATI's Department of Agricultural Protection/Sanitation (DDA) regional
offices, responsible for enforcing the law.

Implementation and outputs: The subcomponent achieved its goal of improving enforcement of
the Law. It originally contemplated physical inspection of 20% of approved incentives but this
was reduced to 10% by the Mid-term Review. Also, inspection was handled on-site at the time of


                                                   40

demand. It was a determining factor in making the Soil Law operational whether through support
for training of supervision teams or application of the Law in the countryside. Some 9,295
inspections were conducted on properties and 281 inspections of incentives-supported activities.
It also alerted roads authorities to the importance of using better standards/criteria for water-run-
off structures along rural roads.

Component 4: Erosion Control Works along Rural Roads

This component was intended to improve year-round access and reduce maintenance costs on
about 6,000 km of roads by overcoming localized erosion problems and preventing problems
caused by water run-off along/into benefiting micro-catchments. Road sections requiring
rehabilitation would be identified then prioritized for inclusion in the PGM. Criteria for selection
would include number of beneficiaries, degree of degradation and adoption of improved NRM
practices by beneficiaries. The component financed: (i) civil works for road rehabilitation; (ii)
technical assistance and contracted services; and (iii) incremental operating costs.

Implementation and outputs: This component financed the improvement of some 1,630 km of
rural roads and 411 km within micro-catchments, well below appraisal targets in both cases
(6,000 km and 1,500 km respectively) but well above reduced post-MTR targets. The component
envisaged the contracting of technical proposals followed by contracting of the works themselves
but execution was difficult.

First, the initial such technical contract showed that firms involved in preparing such projects
were highly-specialized in highway engineering but technically unprepared for rural roads
rehabilitation at micro-watershed scale which required integration of the road with surrounding
areas, and demanded specific knowledge of soil and water conservation and of agro-livestock
production systems. The 44 projects initially prepared were technically advanced but without any
sense of integration with surrounding areas/margins. Second, contracting of the works was
envisaged under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) at a centralized level, which created major
procurement and contracting difficulties due to incompatibility with the decentralized and
smaller-scale nature of project works and official resistance based on an assertion of preeminence
for national procurement law over Bank procurement rules. Only 16 proposals were contracted
and not until 2004; the remaining 28 never went ahead due to lack of interest of existing firms,
mainly in the Project's priority region and far from the state capital.              51



Given the success of the mapping sub-component and technical projects for control of ravine
erosion by the Engineering Technical Units under the Degraded Areas Recovery subcomponent,
and considering the difficulties of implementing the roads component, several changes were
made to the latter: (a) training of CATI's Engineering Technical Units (ETU) to prepare roads
rehabilitation subprojects with technical support from the São Paulo Agricultural Development
Company (CODASP); (b) preparation/publication of the Rural Roads Rehabilitation Manual
(Manual CATI 77); and (c) with Bank agreement, decentralizing the procurement modality from



51The issue of the procurement modality is confused. An Aide Memoire of June 1998 (post-Board, pre-Effectiveness)
indicates that it was understood that the roads would be handled by local engineering contractors, not municipal or
state. However, the Borrower Completion Report and key Bank supervision documents state that a major impediment
to roads activities was lack of technical expertise and understanding of small-scale rural roads with environmental
issues, by large, state-level firms. As noted in the Main Text, the Project Team felt that NCB had been imposed since it
was the Bank norm at the time.

NCB to solicitation of three quotes ­ a process managed by CATI's Regional Offices - which
accelerated and streamlined the contracting and execution of these works.

The demonstration effects of conservation-based roads repair were highly positive and
satisfaction with the repairs per se, equally high. Many municipalities have since taken the
initiative, using their own resources or shared with other resources/programs, to implement
similar repair works in the worst-affected areas using the PEMBH technology. Formation of the
24 ETUs was of fundamental importance for this component and for the Mapping and Incentives
for Degraded Areas subcomponents. ETU technicians are now acting as advisors for catchment
committees seeking funding from FEHIDRO and as supervisors for FEHIDRO road projects.
CATI has become an institution with the best technical cohort in the State due to PEMBH
training and experience. CATI also prepared and distributed a brochure for municipal roads
technicians using simple language. An important element in the success of this component was
the participation of beneficiary farmers in prioritizing critical road portions requiring
rehabilitation and in preparing the actual proposals.

It was understood from appraisal that the Mayors/Municipal Governments would handle the
operation and maintenance of the project-renovated roads. The BCR (2008) concludes that
economic benefits from roads rehabilitation are not only from maintenance savings. Higher
property values and agricultural production in micro-catchments occurred almost immediately
after the conclusion of works. Some 80% of farmers interviewed by Rabello and Baptistella
(2007) - who had benefited directly from PEMBH road works ­ reported being motivated to
make new investments in their activities, and 94% confirmed that their property values had
increased.

Component 5: Training and Communication

This component financed an extensive program to ensure that CATI technicians were trained in
modern NRM and soil conservation practices, to build environmental awareness and
communicate the project concept, technical strategy and operational procedures to diverse
stakeholders including the general public. Introductory, advanced and specialized skills
courses/training, including on Bank fiduciary requirements, were specified. Regional and state
level workshops would promote/disseminate project activities, experiences and results. The
subcomponent financed: (i) consultants and specialized services; (ii) study tours within and
outside Brazil; (iii) computer, audio-visual and office equipment; (iv) audio-visual productions;
and (v) incremental recurrent costs.

Implementation and outputs: The Project financed a massive amount of training at all levels
throughout the implementation period and was fundamental for stakeholders' understanding of its
core logic and rationale and for building CATI's "social capital". (The name of this component
was changed to Capacity-building and Dissemination and absorbed the capacity-building
activities envisaged at appraisal under the Environmental Education Sub-component). Training
encompassed a highly diverse range of subjects including sustainable rural development,
environmental management and legislation, sustainable production systems, natural resources
management, rural roads rehabilitation, mapping, rural administration, value added, agricultural
diversification, management of the CMDRs and CRDRs, farmer organization and others. The
decentralization of training was a key factor, especially for bringing technical personnel
contracted by the Mayors under the "municipalization" program, into the project and for training
some 85,000 farmers in diverse aspects of the PEMBH. The project financed the production of
numerous dissemination materials, and project attributes and successes were publicized via
national media (television, newspapers and journals) to large audiences, and through specialized


                                                42

symposia both national and international. Notwithstanding these outputs, the BCR (2008) calls
for even greater attention under a follow-on operation to more efficient and effective
communication to reach a diverse public. See Table 2.2.

Component 6: Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation

As a condition of loan renegotiation, a Project Administration Unit (UGP) was created in 1997
within CATI but reporting directly to the SAA, and directly responsible for three components -
Adaptive Research, Incentive Program for NRM and Conservation, and Rural Roads - and the
Agro-ecological Mapping subcomponent. The SAR details institutional arrangements for project
coordination, management and execution. This component was also to finance, inter alia, mid-
term and ex-post evaluations of the project's socio-economic impact under contract to a state
university and with terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. Complementing day to day
project monitoring and detailed resource monitoring, case studies were also planned in 12 micro-
watersheds to measure project impact

Implementation and outputs: Given the difficulties of defining indicators and the methodologies
for measurement, as well as deficiencies in institutions with the capacity or interest to execute
these activities in the field, plus their high cost (incompatible with available resources/budget),
the number of micro-catchments monitored was reduced to four with a fifth added in 2007 (part
of the GEF Matas Ciliares operation). The original idea was that monthly reports on each micro-
watershed would capture progress and data, be consolidated and constitute the project report.
From 2002 an automated system was developed to monitor the project's physical and financial
progress and which enabled the preparation of Annual Operating Plans (POA) and facilitated the
monitoring of actions executed at the micro-watershed, municipal, regional and state levels.

The component financed development of the Physical and Financial Monitoring System (SAFF-
PEMH), permitting the planning and structuring of activities in each participating micro-
catchment and consolidation of results/data at the regional and state levels. Computerization of all
management processes enabled CATI to adopt a management by results framework. However,
the automated system was affected by lack of retroactive input of data pre-2002 (when SAFF was
established) and the system underwent numerous alterations to improve performance (BCR,
2008).   Even     so,  the    SAFF    permitted    CATI   to   detect   differences  in   PEMBH
execution/performance by region, important for determining compliance with appraisal
requirements for differentiated focus by Priority Areas 1-3. These regional differences are
analyzed in the Case Study "Estudo da Influencia das Diferentes Caracteristicas Regionais na
Implementacao do Programa" (Tinoco, 2008).

It was envisaged that the Mid-term and Final Evaluations would be executed under contract
between the Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply and internationally-known external entities.
However, with Bank agreement, the MTR evaluation was contracted to a consulting firm,
DELGITEC and the Final Evaluation (Navarro, 2008) was managed by CATI which also
prepared the Borrower Completion Report (2008). The latter was supported by the seven quality
case studies listed in Annex 9 and cited throughout this ICR.

3.1.1   The ex post economic and financial analysis of the Project was carried out by applying
the method commonly known as "cost-benefit analysis of the flow of discounted funds" and
utilizing the FARMOD program developed by the World Bank and FAO. The discount rate
adopted was 12% annual, taking into consideration that this reflects the opportunity cost of
capital in Brazil. The time sequence taken into account for projecting the flow of funds was 20
years.

3.1.2   The ex post economic and financial analysis of the Project was done utilizing the basic
FARMOD structure prepared in 1997 to conduct the ex ante economic and financial analysis,
detailed in Annex C of the original Staff Appraisal Report. This present analysis is based on the
same price data, production models and farm models. However, despite this, it is important to
note that modifications have been made to the yields considered for purposes of the production
models, as well as in the number and rhythm/timing of the incorporation by assisted adopting
farmers of the technological changes promoted by the Project. In addition, changes have been
introduced in the amounts of on-farm investments made by farmers, with and without Project
subsidies (incentives) and also, in the total cost of the rest of Project investments.

3.1.3   Changes introduced were based on data from the following sources: (a) the LUPA system
(Project for the Census Survey of Agro-Livestock Units in the State of Sao Paulo); (b) database of
the IEA (Agricultural Economics Institute of the Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply of the
State of Sao Paulo); and, (c) studies and special information prepared by the project's
Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.

3.1.4   The financial analysis was done to evaluate whether beneficiary farmers ­ those who
farmed according to models whose results were projected in the original study ­ obtained
financial benefits which justified their adhesion to and participation in the Project. The economic
analysis was done to determine the profitability of the project as a whole and is thus focused on
the general interest in and relevance to the national economy.

3.2 Basic Guidelines Adopted to Evaluate the Project Ex Post


3.2.1   Producers and Areas Benefited:          The Project, from its start in 2001 through end-
December 2007, directly benefited 20,000 farmers out of a total of 69,903 located in the 968
micro-catchments assisted by the Project (see details in Table 1 below). Direct beneficiaries of
the project are the 22,000 farmers who adopted the technological changes proposed by the
project.   Approximately 14,500 of the 22,000 received, in addition to technical assistance
services, the monetary incentives provided under the Project sub-component Incentives for the
Management and Conservation of Soils and Control of Pollution. The rest received, in addition to
technical assistance, some of the Project incentives destined for the recovery of degraded areas
and/or conservation re-forestation.
3.2.2   The land area cultivated by the 69,903 farmers in the 968 micro-catchments assisted, in
the without and with-project situation, was 1,898,000 hectares ­ without taking into account the




                                                   47

area dedicated to pasture ­ while the land area of the 22,000 farmers assisted directly by the
Project totaled 692,000 hectares.


3.2.3   Benefits: The only benefits considered for the purposes of this analysis are those which
resulted from the technological changes promoted by the Project. That is to say, the benefits
quantified and calculated by FARMOD are those derived from increased yields per hectare and
per animal achieved by the 22,000 farmers representing the group directly benefited by the
project.

3.2.4   For the remaining 47,903 farmers who work in the 968 micro-catchments assisted by the
Project, indirect benefits have not been taken into account, for two fundamental reasons: (a)
because they were not estimated in the ex ante analysis; and (b) because there is no reliable
information which would permit a calculation of indirect benefits and positive externalities and
which is known to have been produced as a consequence of the introduction of measures leading
to better management of natural resources and mitigation of negative effects produced by defects
existing in rural roads.

3.2.5   In general terms, the incremental benefits projected were based on the following
parameters:

                                                                                    Cultivated

3.2.6   Phasing of Farmers' Entry into the Project: The actual rhythm/timing of the
incorporation of beneficiaries ­ direct and indirect ­ was as follows:


         Type of Beneficiary              Year    Year     Year    Year    Year     Year    Year
                                            1        2       3        4      5        6       7

3.2.7   Prices: The financial and economic prices of operational inputs, services and labor are
derived from studies generated in 1997 by the Project preparation team and reflect values of that
period, in the markets of the Project area. All market prices are expressed in constant 1997 Reais
(R$) and the exchange rate quoted in local currency is R$1.05 to US$1.




                                                 48

3.2.8    The economic prices used in this analysis, for the traded products and inputs (corn, soy,
cotton, coffee and chemical fertilizers) take into account international prices of the same and the
cost structure of transport, insurance and handling in existence in 1997. The international prices
used are those calculated and projected by the World Bank Division of International Markets and
Commodities. The economic cost of labor, according to 1997 estimates, is equivalent to 40% of
its financial price. The economic price of the rest of the inputs, services and investments has been
adjusted by an index of 0.9 to reflect the influence of taxes included in the financial prices.

3.2.9    Project Investment Costs considered by the Analysis: In the analysis of financial results
of farm models - for the with-project situation - only the costs of on-farm investments which were
not subsidized via the sub-component "Incentives for the Management and Conservation of Soils
and Control of Pollution" of the Project, were taken into consideration. The total value of on-
farm investments rose to US$32.2 million and beneficiary cost-sharing (counterpart) covered the
remaining US$10.3 million.

3.2.10 For the economic evaluation of the Project, all the economic costs, Project investments
and also recurrent operational costs incurred, stemming from the finalization of the period of
Project disbursements, have been imputed. These total economic costs rose to US$82.4 million as
seen in Tables 2 and 3 below.

3.3 Production Models:

3.3.1    This exercise has taken, as representative of the with- and without-project situation, the
10 models of agricultural crops and the three models of livestock activity presented in Table 1. It
is important to reiterate that these 13 production models are the same as those prepared in 1997 to
perform the ex ante economic and financial evaluation of the Project. It should also be
highlighted that the production models selected are the most important, but not the only
production activities existing, in the Project area. In other words, the models selected are seen as
representative of each group of crops and farm endeavors practiced by small and medium farmers
located in the Project area.

3.3.2    Changes in yields by hectare and by animal, presented in Table 1 below, have been
established utilizing actual production data information for the period 1997-2007, from the
following sources: (a) the LUPA system (Project for the Census Survey of Agro-Livestock Units
in the State of Sao Paulo); (b) database of the IEA (Agricultural Economics Institute of the
Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply of the State of Sao Paulo); and, (c) studies and special
information prepared by the project's Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation Unit.

3.4 Farm Models:


3.4.1   Six family farm models have been defined as representative of the 69,903 farms benefited
by the Project. It is important to reiterate that these six farm models are the same as those
prepared in 1997 to conduct the ex-ante economic and financial evaluation of the project.

3.4.2   Obviously these six models are not intended to represent the multiple combinations of
socio-productive activities which occur in the Project area, but the purpose is to cover the
majority of cases and utilize them as examples of the most common typologies adopted by the
family farms analyzed. Table 1 shows a resume of the cropping patterns of each one of the six
farm models used for the analysis.


3.5 Results Obtained:


3.5.1   Financial Profitability of Farm Models: It is important to highlight that in the financial
budgets of the farm models family labor utilized was not taken into account as a component of
the cost of production. Costs of on-farm investments undertaken with farmer counterpart were
included in costs.

3.5.2   In the tables attached to this section, the results of family farms simulated in the with-
project situation, at full development, were compared with those obtained from the same models
in the same time period of the without-project situation. Through this comparison, one can
observe the impact they produced on net incomes of the economic units analyzed, as a
consequence of the productive changes derived from Project activities and investments.

* Net incomes before taking into account the value of family labor.

3.5.3   As can be seen, the Project created important increases in the incomes of the 22,000
farmers benefited by it. Annual income increases have been growing, year by year, and reached at
full development of the project, values ranging from R$1,500 to R$7,000 per year.

3.5.4   The Net Present Value of incremental incomes of the six family farm models simulated in
the evaluation ranges from R$1,400 to R$36,760.

3.5.5   Physical Aggregation of the Project: Aggregated data provided by the FARMOD
program for the total 69,903 farms located in the 968 micro-catchments assisted by the Project,
permit determination of the quantitative increases at full development of the Project for each one
of the groups of products which comprise family production:

3.5.6   As can be seen, the percentage increases in production of the distinct groups range
between 8.1% and 33.3%. Products with the greater increase in production are: meat, milk, corn,
beans, and soybean, due to the fact that they are the ones with higher potential and productive
response to the introduction of the new technologies promoted by the project.
3.5.7   In this way, aggregated data, produced by the FARMOD program, for the 22,000 farmers
benefited directly by the Project permits an understanding of what are the quantitative increases at
full development of the Project for each one of the groups of products which comprise the
production of these families:

3.5.8   Monetary Aggregate of the Project: In the tables which follow this paragraph, we
compare the financial results of the Project in its entirety, at full development, with those
obtained from the without-project situation. Through this comparison, the total impact on gross
value and costs of production (without considering the costs of family labor) and on net income
from the Project, as a consequence of the productive changes derived from works and activities
executed by the project, can be observed.

3.6 Economic Analysis of the Project:


3.6.1   Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR): As can be
seen, the NPV of the flow of annual incremental economic income of the project and the IERR
are as follows:
Table 7
  Project Total (22,000 Direct Project Beneficiaries)                 NPV                 IERR %
                         NPV                                  96,160,000 1997 R$
                         NPV                                   91,580,000 US$
                         IERR                                                               27.0


3.6.2   Sensitivity Analysis: The sensitivity analysis consisted of a determination of the increase
in incremental costs, reduction of incremental incomes and delays in obtaining the benefits which
could be supported by the Project without it becoming unprofitable.
Table 8
                           Simulated Situation                                          IERR
Increase of 27.6 % in incremental economic costs                                       12.0 %
Drop of 21.6 % in incremental economic income                                          12.0 %
Delay of 1 year in obtaining incremental economic incomes                              16.2 %


3.6.3   The sensitivity of the Project to these three situations is quite small. An increase of 27.6%
in incremental costs (estimated) would reduce the IERR to 12%. Similarly, a reduction of 21.6%
in projected incremental incomes reduced the IERR to 12% and if the achievement of projected
incremental benefits is delayed one year, the IERR only falls to 16.2% (see Table 3.2 below).
below).


3.7 Conclusion:




                                                 52

3.7.1   As can be seen, the Project is economically and financially viable. In addition, the
sensitivity analysis indicates that the Project could confront greater challenges without
significantly diminishing its financial and economic impact.


3.7.2   The 22,000 producers benefited directly by the project have had notable incentives to
enter the project. The project has not only produced an average increase of 44.5% in their total
net incomes per year, but about 14,500 of them also received subsidies/incentives to conduct soil
conservation and pollution control investments on their farms.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1     Beneficiary/stakeholder surveys using varying methodologies were conducted for the
Mid-term Review, the Final Evaluation (Navarro, 2008) and for four of the seven Case Studies.
The following summarizes main findings of Navarro (2008) and the relevant Case Studies. All
documents are held in Project files (IRIS4).

A. Conclusions and Recommendations of the Final Evaluation (Navarro, 2008)

The Navarro study is an important qualitative analysis of two similar projects implemented in the
States of São Paulo (the PEMBH) and Santa Catarina in recent years. The methodology entailed
numerous visits to regions of each state, conducting interviews with beneficiaries, technicians,
local authorities and private stakeholders, field visits, some data collection, and desk reviews of
existing studies. No formal surveys per se were applied, there were no sampled or control groups
and no data is presented in the report. The intention was to create a roadmap for future projects -
based on a wide-ranging consultative process - not to try and measure responses to particular
questions. This summary focuses only on the State of São Paulo.

Conclusions:

     The project stimulated the formation of autonomous associations of farm families
organized in a way which best represented their immediate interests, with increasing access to
information and growing influence on municipal decision-making, policies and resource
allocation. The sustainability of this situation depends to a considerable extent on maintaining
the micro-catchment as the basic planning and training/extension unit.

     There is much evidence that the PEMBH, by bringing diverse elements together, evolved
rapidly into a classic rural development project, avoiding becoming a social assistance operation
which might have happened once social objectives were included in design.

     Navarro cites the example of the Botacatu region, formerly dominated economically by
coffee monoculture and now transitioning into more diversified agricultural activities, showing
enthusiasm and creativity in exploiting opportunities offered by the PEMBH, especially under the
Learning with Nature program. As a farmer beneficiary noted: "The micro-catchment helped the
farmer to see that his neighbor is a fellow traveler, not a competitor".

     Examples are provided of farmer leaders motivating their neighbors to recognize what the
PEMH could deliver, forming associations and contacting state agricultural/rural authorities on a
range of issues affecting their micro-catchments, production and communities.

     Also cited is the Dracena region, formerly economically and socially depressed and
losing population, and now showing the best results of the PEMBH state-wide.

     Navarro sees such examples as paradigmatic of what fosters success: strong, committed
regional and local management, mayors responsive to the potential benefits, families willing to
assume leadership, and overall, a convergence of interests and willingness to take risks associated
with innovation. Associations have launched new productive activities: commercial cultivation of
herbs and environmentally appropriate coffee; passion-fruit plantations; collective purchase of
inputs and of different types of equipment and machinery, and of health insurance plans for
members. Sanitary certification is being sought for the herbs and coffee to improve marketing



                                                 59

and incomes. Massive initial training for CATI extension workers and technicians has been
critical.

Challenges:

5.2      Navarro reviews a series of challenges which such projects tend to face and which the
study asserts are in many cases avoidable:

      Importance of flexibility in technical and operational design, given that important
potential challenges cannot be foreseen and "controlled/limited" during preparation, and that such
flexibility is a more realistic reflection of rural realities. This implies that project authorities and
technicians need greater decision-making power and that regional teams be adequately
decentralized.

      Complex tasks assigned to extension workers mandate care and attention to training,
especially urgent when major responsibilities are assigned to municipal governments.                The
organization of this training represents a huge challenge, with the risk that municipal extension
workers enter the project without adequate training or preparation. Extension workers need
multiple skills including specialized technical and organizational capacities.       The formation of
multi-disciplinary teams is recommended but challenging.

      Such projects need to produce the knowledge required for their success. The solution is
not to maintain a research service linked to the project, or separate research components which
tend to be distant from the project's on the ground dynamic, but to contract out for such services
based on a clear prima facie picture of what research products are needed.

      Project preparation needs to reduce the potential for "surprises", foreseeing diverse
development scenarios including technical, social and institutional. Errors in the initial
formulation of the project are difficult to correct once implementation is underway and require
substantial lead times and human resources. First-cycle micro-catchment projects need to build
installed capacity to more rapidly and successfully execute second-stage operations.

      Project incentives must be appropriate, well-chosen and represent real social demands
including the basic needs of very poor families, be attractive enough to mobilize families and
secure their adhesion/commitment and bring in even indirect stakeholders, e.g., local government.
Incentives should be segmented so that they do not become merely forms of social assistance.

      Need to ensure that the environmental "focus" is in practice, the fundamental project
thrust designed to change productive systems and promote their sustainability.

      Such projects inevitably entail political actions and involvement. Extension workers
need to remain above party politics and local disputes yet, micro-catchments are politically linked
and navigating this requires superior analytical and communications capacity.

Four Pillars of Success:

      Clear understanding of the project on the part of its principal operators starting at the
top with the state secretariats of agriculture and environment. The São Paulo project was a
paradigmatic example of the negative effects of a lack of understanding of the economic, social




                                                   60

and environmental relevance of the micro-catchment approach on the part of senior government
authorities and major stakeholders.

     Importance of multi-disciplinary teams well-versed technically, and knowledgeable about
how government works, for supervising and managing project micro-catchments as a totality.
Equally critical are government project operators who can articulate policies both top down and
bottom up, separating out the merely political influences and articulating the various components
of a complex project and able to create synergies which result in correct and successful project
execution.

     Municipal mayors and local government authorities are crucial players and this aspect of
project execution is extremely challenging and complex, given the diversity of local party
politics, interests and disputes. Also critical is the engagement of private stakeholders in the
attempt to create a "language of convergence". Without the support of municipal government,
the project will "not succeed in getting off the ground".

     Projects involving farmer organizations with a tradition of associative action are likely to
do better, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient to secure the mobilization of farm families
involved in a micro-catchment. Analysis of diverse situations in São Paulo in municipalities with
distinct cultural, economic and social differences demonstrates that the most salient mechanism
for motivating participation is the quality of extension services, sufficiently prepared for the
complexity of micro-catchment operations.

B. Main Findings of Case Studies involving Beneficiary Surveys.

Case Study 1: Impact of Environmental Education on the Perception and Behavior of
Beneficiaries and General Society (Ramos de Freitas, 2008)

Methodology: Selection of one region in each of the three Priority Areas; one municipality per
region; preparation of questionnaires with open and closed questions; training of interviewers and
preparation of visits; application of questionnaires to PEMBH Monitors, Technical Executors,
teachers, students, parents and farmers. Results were scored and charted.

Results:

     PEMH Monitors and Technical Executors: Scored interviews showed that the program
         contributed to the dissemination of PEMBH activities, showed good performance, its
         monitors and technical promoters were strongly involved with the program and for the
         most part were able to facilitate the PEMBH's work with farmers. However, various
         challenges remained including lack of transportation for students to demonstration areas.

     Teachers: Some 19 teachers interviewed were highly positive about the project's
         contribution to the comprehension of the PEMBH itself, water and soil issues, food,
         hygiene, vegetation cover and pollutants. Teachers were equally positive about the
         project's influence in changing behaviors on these same issues. They testified to many
         important outcomes, commenting favorably on materials used, types of new behaviors,
         influence of students on their parents, more critical observation of the environment, and
         more careful selection of healthy foods.




                                                 61

     Students: Interviews with 48 students revealed equally high positive results for the items
         mentioned in (b). They also testified to their new understanding of the environment and
         prudent usage of sols, water and vegetation, and changes induced in their families'
         behavior.      Visits to micro-catchments were clearly influential in putting classroom
         instruction in context.

     Parents: Interviews with 14 parents of students showed that the majority did not know of
         the PEMH per se but that the project was able to involve students to the point where they
         saw themselves as "environmental sentinels", willingly taking conservationist messages
         to their parents and influencing their behavior.

     Farmers:         Interviews with four farmers showed that they also, saw themselves as
         environmental agents and were gratified to have been involved in working with students
         on-farm. Use of agro-chemicals, conservation of soils and water, and re-forestation are
         mentioned as focus issues. Overall, the project was seen to have high potential to raise
         awareness on environmental issues. Table 5.1 summarizes the broad themes emerging
         from interviews.

Case Study 2: Rehabilitation of Rural Roads and Control of Gullies (Rabello and Baptistella,
2007)

Methodology: Semi-structured questionnaires applied in various regions to 85 farmers benefiting
from the rural roads activities, 39 farmers benefiting from erosion control works, 20 municipal
mayors, 20 Technical Executors and 18 firms providing services to these activities. This case
study is of exceptional quality and utility, presenting important lessons, challenges, and including
a rate of return calculation for road and erosion control works.

Results:

     Rural roads rehabilitation:            Some 85% of farmers expressed satisfaction with the
         environmental effects of road works; close to 80% praised the social impacts of better
         roads, 70% commented on improved self-esteem, 60% asserted their property values had



                                                    62

         increased, 50% said they had gained economically and 45% said road works had
         prompted them to make new investments in their activities.

     Erosion control works: satisfaction levels were uniformly high following these works.
         Some 90% of farmers interviewed said they had gained economically, close to 100% said
         their property values had increased, 95% felt prompted to make new investments on-
         farm, 100% said environmental gains were positive and 95% felt stronger self-esteem.

This case study also includes results and estimates stemming from the complementary case study
"Impact of the PEMBH on Surface Water Quality" (Bassi, 2007) given the impacts of road works
and erosion control on levels of run-off, soil loss and water quality. Given 1,630 km of road
works and control of 1,826 on-farm erosion gullies, it is estimated that 120,000 tons of soil
(enough to fill 12,000 trucks) were stopped annually from being carried into springs/rivers, a
saving of 50% in annual soil loss.

However, Rabello/Baptistella (2007) implies that even addressing the most critical stretches of
road and adopting practices to control rain run-off, the efforts to reduce losses cannot be
considered 100% effective. Nevertheless, farmers reported economic returns averaging R$4,950
per property from new investments prompted directly by road works and an average incremental
R$240 per year/per property with the incorporation into production of formerly eroded gully
areas. The study calculated an economic rate of return of some 109.17% on the two combined
activities.

In terms of ongoing maintenance of these road works, interviews with farmers and mayors
revealed some mutual antagonism and discontent. Some 32% of the 85 farmers were unsatisfied
to some extent with the mayors' handling of road maintenance, while the mayors expressed
dissatisfaction with the fact that farmers had collaborated in the process of road repairs. About
31% of the road stretches repaired by the PEMBH showed some evidence of inadequate
subsequent maintenance.

Lessons:

     Better results for road works are evident when mayors participate actively, including
         providing services or monitoring works.

     Farmers benefiting from erosion control works show greater commitment when they
         contribute in some form, including provision of materials and/or sharing equipment rental
         costs.

     Municipalities which already have a roads management system tend to look after the
         repaired roads better and participate more actively in all stages of works implementation.

     Decentralized contracting of road works was more effective and efficient than centralized
         contracting.

     Longevity of roads repairs is promoted by the use of certain materials but this increases
         costs.




                                                63

     Municipal workers who received training and had opportunity to operate roads
         machinery, internalized conservation concepts better, as well as the road repair
         technologies used.

Case Study 3: The PEMH and Rural Associations of Small Farmers (Antuniassi, 2007)

Methodology: Quantitative information derived from primary (register of rural producers in
micro-catchments, covering 372 associations) and secondary sources (association work plans
etc); a sample of 200 associations - taking into account the project's Areas 1-3 - to which eight
groups of questions were applied of which six closed and two open. Qualitative research methods
were also used to collect and analyze information in order to validate quantitative methods.
Selected topics are summarized here. The full study, of excellent quality, is available in IRIS4.

Results:

     About 70% of the associations surveyed were located in Area 1 (poorest municipalities)
        housing 80% of all micro-catchment farmers. Area 1 associations tended to be smaller
        averaging 31 members (Area 2, 71 and Area 3, 64). Some 60% of all associations
        surveyed were established after 2001, i.e. as a function of the Bank-financed PEMBH.
        Most associations, regardless of area, lacked infrastructure (e.g., phone, fax, computer,
        agricultural equipment, television and/or video).

     About 43% of associations had more than one partnership (mostly CATI, SEBRAE and
        municipal mayors), permitting the leveraging of additional resources. Older associations
        tended to have more partners.

     The most successful PEMBH associations (based on data provided by the case study)
        tended to be characterized by: provision of diverse services within/outside their
        communities (collective purchase of inputs, hosting of seminars/workshops, marketing
        services, health plans etc); partnerships with other agencies; joint marketing activities;
        location in municipalities with comparatively high IDH-M; comparatively larger property
        size; comparatively greater availability of resources (monthly dues, sale of services,
        equipment rental etc) and good management of those.

     Interviews with PEMBH technicians showed very high levels of job satisfaction. Of
        particular note are several statements:

     "An advance under the PEMBH is that we started to work with gender, we introduced work
    which gave more value to women and through her, her family and children, so that we could
    achieve change with the entire family. .... I am convinced by this model"; and,

    "It's very gratifying (...the other day, a woman, a farm woman, said to me, doctor) I never
    thought I would be invited to something ... after all these workshops and training I am
    another person. Now I enter the bank, the mayor's office, the Casa de Agricultura with my
    head held up ... I feel emotional saying these things".

     However, an issue noted by all technicians interviewed was the lack of time to focus on
        promoting an associative culture. Technicians felt the associations were dynamic entities
        but lack of time to visit and do the promotion required, and lack of resources, hindered
        this work.



                                                  64

     Technicians also commented critically on the "municipalization" system for contracting
       technical personnel to support the project, citing frequent turnover and exceptionally low
       salaries paid by the municipal governments - about one-third of CATI salaries for the
       same work - which negatively affected extension work in the project areas and the
       dynamism (and even existence in some cases) of participating associations. Bureaucratic
       complexity was also cited as a factor consuming technicians' time.

     Technicians interviewed showed a comprehensive understanding of the associations with
       whom they worked and it was clear that the problems of associations were tightly
       connected to the region in which they were located and in large part, to the amount of
       time available to technicians to dedicate to their development.

     Interviews with farmers revealed a strong, positive attitude to PEMBH goals and
       achievements. Special praise is given to the incentives program, the Learning with
       Nature program, and to the rural roads rehabilitation activities. Frequent reference is
       made to the positive effects of roads on productive activities and to farmers' expectations
       for longer-term benefits from the PEMBH, especially productive, reversing the process of
       "properties with no future" and the rural exodus.

Case Study 4: Participation of Society in the PEMBH (Lima and Barbosa, 2008)

Methodology: Document review; semi-structured interviews (using questionnaires and a form of
multiple choice approach with scoring for optimal, good, regular and deficient) with four
Technical Executors, Four Technical Regional Directors (of CATI), four representatives of
Mayors' offices, four representatives of CMDRs, four representatives of farmer associations and
86 farmers, 20% of the total of the four selected micro-catchments. Only interview based results
are summarized selectively below. The full document is in IRIS 4.

Results:

     The study measured perceptions of the level of participation of Regional Management
       offices (of CATI), Technical Executors, representatives of the Mayors and of the
       CMDRs, and of the farmer organizations, and of individual farmers, and in virtually all
       cases, scores were significantly higher for priority Area 1 and 2.

     Issues affecting the participation of Regional Managers and Technical Executors were
       most commonly cited as human resources availability, burden of work, and bureaucracy.
       In the case of the Mayors, the main inhibiting factors were lack of infrastructure, training
       and problems with planning and management. In the case of the CMDRs, main issues
       were human resources, management and planning, along with lack of training, financial
       resources and representativity.

     Farmer participation (average of four areas) was highest for the issue of adoption of new
       practices (80%), participation in the institutional strengthening plan was lower (35.6%),
       and average participation in training activities was about 51%. The primary motivation
       for farmers' participation was the influence of social actors (e.g., CATI technicians),
       followed by the incentives fund, and belief in the program. The primary inhibiting factor
       was lack of information.




                                                65

 As noted in the Main Text, the participation of the entire family was low. Participation
 was far more likely to be the (male) head of household. Participation was generally
 interactive.


 Principal advances under the PEMBH noted by interviewees as a result of their
participation were: (a) for Regional Managers and Technicians ­ working in the
countryside, understanding communities' problems and aspects of public policy for
agriculture; and (b) Mayors, CMDRs and Producer Associations ­ understanding
problems in the countryside and learning to respect diversity, putting common objectives
above personal interests, bringing all farmers together without distinction, and
relationship with public institutions and rural extension services.

          A. Borrower Completion Report (CATI 2009): Executive Summary

Introduction

1.      The recognition that problems of erosion occurring nationwide were threatening the
efficiency gains achieved since the 1960s as a result of agricultural modernization, and seriously
affecting the equilibrium of local ecosystems through the pollution of water sources and silting of
rivers, negatively affecting principally small farmers exploiting the most susceptible areas,
prompted Brazil to institute in 1987 the National Hydrographic Micro-catchment Program, with
the hydrographic micro-catchment as the unit for planning and intervention due to its efficiency
for the management and conservation of natural resources.           In the same year, due to the
importance of this theme and the gravity of the erosion problem and its consequences, the State of
São Paulo instituted the State Hydrographic Micro-catchment Program designed to control the
process of soil degradation. The States of Paraná and Santa Catarina also took similar initiatives
and sought financing from the World Bank to implement their soil conservation programs.

2.      In 1988, the State of São Paulo approved Law 6.721 concerning the use, conservation and
preservation of agricultural soils, recognizing the importance of and strengthening actions under
the State micro-catchment program. The experience accumulated under this program and interest
in expanding its reach, which until that time had covered a small number of micro-catchments,
along with the success of projects developed in Paraná and Santa Catarina with World Bank
financing, led the Government of Sao Paulo to present to the Bank in 1992 a project to finance
expansion of the State's Micro-catchment Program. This project was negotiated in
February/March 1994 but, due to the State's financial difficulties with the Federal Government of
the period, the project could not be presented to the World Bank Board. In the period from 1987
to 1997, the Sao Paulo State Government continued to execute the State Micro-catchment
Program in a limited number of micro-catchments with its own resources and with activities
principally designed to control erosion on properties through terracing and the adoption of liming
of soils, along with the recuperation of rural roads, and even early, incipient efforts at rural
organization.

3.      In 1997, the State reorganized the State Micro-catchment Program and reaffirmed its
interest in a partnership with the World Bank. Due to the time which had passed, the proposal
negotiated in 1994 was revised to incorporate the experiences of 10 years of implementation of
the State's program as well as lessons learned from the micro-catchment programs in Paraná and
Santa Catarina, resulting in a major advance in relation to the original proposal in incorporating
as an objective the goal of sustainable rural development. This new proposal, which was
consistent with the State's policy of decentralization, participation and transparency, was
characterized by strong action to conserve natural resources and seek improvement in the quality
of life of the persons involved, having as a strategy the participation of the community in the
diagnosis, planning and execution of activities. The proposal was also aligned with the Bank's
policy for Brazil: promoting environmentally sustainable development and poverty reduction.

4.      The Loan was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on October 28, 1997 following
negotiation from 8-12 September, 1997 and was signed December 1999. Its objectives still
remain relevant at the global level because its activities are effective for reducing emissions due



                                                 68

to carbon fixation in the soil and reforestation, for the rational use of water resources and for food
production. The general objective of the Project was to increase, and make more sustainable,
agricultural production, productivity and income, and to guarantee technical assistance to farmers
for the conservation of natural resources by: (i) promoting modern practices for the management
and conservation of soil, water and forests planned and implemented at the micro-catchment level
with full involvement of farmer communities; (ii) developing awareness of environmental
protection in those communities and their involvement in implementing such actions; (iii)
expanding the coverage and the period of vegetative coverage of soils, protecting them from sun
and intense summer rains; (iv) improving the physical structure of soils, increasing water
filtration and minimizing surface rainwater run-off; (v) expanding the State's capacity to
implement, with greater efficiency, a full-scale program for the management and conservation of
natural resources.

Objectives and Components

5.       To achieve its objectives, the Project had five Components and eight Subcomponents.
The Technology and Institutional Development component represented the motor of the Program
due to the importance of technical assistance and rural extension to mobilize and involve
communities through the participatory preparation of micro-catchment action plans and their
implementation. Activities under the Technical Assistance and Rural Extension subcomponent
were decisive for achieving Project objectives in the sense that, by means of innovative extension
actions, incentives were provided to farmers to adopt recommended natural resource management
practices. This also developed in beneficiaries of those micro-catchments a greater sensitivity
and technical understanding of how to improve natural resources management, and promoted the
active participation of farmers and their families in planning and executing activities for
promoting soil conservation.

Implementation and Achievements

6.       The Project permitted CATI to put into operation its mission to "promote sustainable
rural development with participatory programs and activities, with the involvement of the
community, partner entities and all segments of agricultural commerce", defined at the time of
CATI's restructuring in 1997. It contributed decisively to constructing a new model of rural
extension in the State focused on the participation of farmers and their families.             It also
strengthened farmer organizations and the decentralization and transparency of their actions with
the participation of society through their leaders represented by the Councils, strengthening the
State's technical assistance and rural extension. As a result of the Program, CATI, as the official
state rural extension entity, was strengthened institutionally in terms of its operational
infrastructure (vehicles, facilities, computer equipment, and information technology and
communications) and principally, in its human capital, factors which facilitated the successful
implementation, execution and supervision of the Project. CATI adopted a new, results-based
management model, modifying its management profile.

7.       The Project also contributed decisively to building and strengthening municipal technical
assistance and rural extension services (municipal secretariats of agriculture and agricultural
departments), expanding and boosting municipal capacity to integrate and develop local public
policies for sustainable rural development and to better attend to beneficiaries' needs. Activities
under the Rural Organization subcomponent resulted in stronger organization and provided
incentives to participation and empowerment of rural producers in associations, most notably for
the formation and strengthening of 491 farmer associations and the creation of the State of São
Paulo Federation of Rural Producers Micro-catchment Associations. Producer associations played


                                                  69

an important role on the occasion of the alteration and approval of the Soil Use Law, in
demonstrating the legitimacy and importance of this change which permitted expansion of the
practices supported by the Project, in the extension of the Project Closing Date, and in the
decision by the State Government to expand and improve the Project under a follow-on operation
Micro-catchment II ­ State Sustainable Rural Development Project, under preparation. This level
of organization promoted the more active participation of farmers at the local level through their
representation in the Municipal Councils. The results obtained demonstrate that the consolidation
and sustainability of actions under projects of this type depend on strengthening producer
organizations and it is fundamental that greater effort is made on this issue.

8.       The Agro-environmental Mapping subcomponent provided the stimulus for farmers to
participate in the micro-catchment diagnoses and planning exercises and contributed to
integrating the environmental issues dealt with by the Project, consisting of an important
instrument for improving policies intended to conserve natural resources. This subcomponent also
allowed the development of and internalization by CATI (Engineering Technical Units - ETU) of
valuable technical knowledge in the area of mapping, resulting in the training of the ETUs and
improving their structure (information technology and engineering software).

9.       The objective of the Adaptive Research component in regard to the adaptation of
technologies was accomplished in a satisfactory manner and developed on farmers' properties
under the supervision of a researcher as planned. Technology Adaptation Units installed were
successful and permitted the efficient dissemination of tested technologies, most notably the
Sistema Plantio Direta na Palha (minimum tillage), feasibility of small-scale dairy farming,
diffusion of bio-digestive septic tanks as a viable basic sanitation technology for rural areas, and
the development and adaptation of technologies for repairing rural roads for different situations
occurring in the state. In regard to the generation of research, targets were not achieved. The
partial implementation of this component did not fulfill expectations and there remain
technological obstacles which require responses to better guarantee advances for sustainable
development.

10.      The Incentives for the Management and Conservation of Natural Resources component
was organized in five subcomponents and implemented in an integrated manner: (i) initiated via
motivational activities through the Environmental Education subcomponent which built
awareness in farm families, rural communities and the municipal urban populations, concerning
the need and importance of natural resources conservation; (ii) facilitating activities via incentives
for farmers to adopt integrated practices for natural resources conservation as foreseen under the
Incentives for Management and Conservation of Soil and Control of Pollution, Incentives for the
Recovery and Reforestation of Degraded Areas subcomponents; and (iii) enforcement actions, via
utilization of incentives, and by application of the Soil Use Law, the objective being the correct
use of resources and accelerated adoption of practices recommended by the Project, as foreseen in
the Enforcement of the Soil Use Law and Incentives subcomponent.

11.      The Environmental Education subcomponent had great success in building awareness in
CATI's own teams and in the municipalities involved in Project execution, of the need to develop
sustainable agriculture. It can be confirmed that through this subcomponent the debate about the
importance of natural resources management and the need for local action was brought to all
municipalities participating in the Project, involving farmers and their families, leaders, students,
teachers and other public groups. The debates resulted in the transformation of routine on-farm
activities and contributed to changing habits.      The adoption of integrated practices for the
management and conservation of soil and control of pollution by rural producers was stimulated,
in a demonstration form, by Project incentives and were determining factors for demonstrating


                                                 70

the Project's rationale and the importance of planning to integrated natural resource conservation
practices. It is worth highlighting practices supported under the Incentives for the Management
and Conservation of Soil and Control of Pollution subcomponent, supported via economic
subventions where the Project reimbursed part of the expenses incurred by farmers. Farmers
invested a total R$78.57 million to execute practices supported by the Project, of which R$54.29
million were supported by the Project and R$24.28 million was represented by beneficiary
counterpart contribution.      Evaluating the evolution of investments for the execution of
conservation practices, an increase can be seen in values invested in the final years of the Project,
especially from 2006 onwards. This occurred due to changes in the Soil Use Law which
permitted the expansion of Project-supported practices, as well as an increase in the percentages
of support, besides the number of micro-catchments eligible to access the incentives.

12.     As a consequence of the Incentives for the Management and Conservation of Soil and for
Pollution Control, it was possible to strengthen and diversify agricultural activities developed in
the search for sustainability of rural properties. The success of the economic subventions as a
way of providing incentives for the adoption of conservationist practices was demonstrated by the
Project. This fact led the State Government to request a partial extension of the Loan Agreement
to November 30, 2008 to ensure the mobilization of producers and the continuity of responses to
demands identified in micro-catchment plans, utilizing just State counterpart resources, bearing in
mind that the legal basis for the economic subventions was restricted to the Loan Agreement for
the Project (Loan 4238-BR). Further, with the objective of turning the concession of economic
subventions into a permanent policy instrument of incentives for building rural development, the
State Government, through the Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply (SAS) prepared a separate,
preliminary project for making this mechanism feasible through the Paulista Agribusiness
Expansion Fund (FEAP) ­ the Family Agri-business Bank. A working group was created to
evaluate the results of this instrument and propose improvements. The project was evaluated
legally by SAS and is ready to be sent to the Governor for transmittal to the State Legislature.

13.     Through the Incentives for Recovery of Degraded Areas subcomponent, critical areas
showing accelerated erosion (ravines and gullies) were recuperated. The subcomponent also
fostered changed management systems by promoting the adoption of plantio direto, guaranteeing
that areas with initial signs of degradation would be incorporated into the productive process in a
sustainable manner. The Project contributed significantly to expanding the area of plantio direto
in the State (which went from 100,000 ha to 1.0 million from 1998 to 2008), making feasible the
development of combined activities that: (i) permitted diffusion of this methodology to producers;
(ii) adapted this technology for different State regions; (iii) trained CATI's technical team to
provide support to producers who adopted this technology; and (iv) attended 212 farmer
associations through the provision of seeding equipment for plantio direto with the objective of
having farmers experiment with the system on their properties, because the lack of this equipment
represented an obstacle to adoption. FEAP opened a line of financing, created by SAS, and
induced by the Project, to finance the acquisition of seeding equipment by producers. Plantio
direto has come to be adopted successfully for perennial crops such as Eucalyptus, citrus, coffee
and rubber, where preparation of the soil has been done only on the planting line, maintaining
vegetative cover between plantings, resulting in the effective control of erosion, besides
guaranteeing the benefits generated by the system.

14.     The Reforestation subcomponent presented highly satisfactory results, reaching its goal
of providing farmers in micro-catchments with incentives to reforest, especially, the margins of
waterways/rivers.    This was only possible due to integrated micro-catchment activities, the
intensive environmental education efforts performed by extension workers every day, supported
by environmental agents, and aligned to the availability of quality seedlings produced by DSMM.


                                                71

It can be affirmed that the awareness-building work and the provision/availability of seedlings to
producers were the principal factors which stimulated the adoption of reforestation practices. All
seedlings produced conformed to standards established by the subcomponent itself, so as to
guarantee quality and ensure higher success rates of plants. These results demonstrate the
efficiency of the strategy of adopting the micro-catchment as the planning and execution unit for
environmental activities, because, besides being technically correct, it allows activities executed
by a farmer to stimulate other farmers to also adopt due to the integration of natural resources,
which is very clear within a micro-catchment. The work of reconstituting matas ciliares was
improved throughout the Project period due to the monitoring and evaluation of reforested areas.
The effects of measures taken can be observed in the improved performance of subcomponent
activities, but stronger efforts are still needed to guarantee greater success in establishing and
consolidating the forests planted and in reducing the costs of planting. In this respect, it is worth
noting the work developed in conjunction with the Project for the Recuperation of Matas Ciliares
(Project supported by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the World Bank (Agreement
TF 055091 ­ value US$7.75 million) under the State Secretary of Environment, which is working
in 15 micro-catchments seeking new models for recovery of matas ciliares, reduced costs of
installation and maintenance, as well as constructing mechanisms for payment for environmental
services.

15.      The Enforcement of the Soil Use Law and Incentives subcomponent reached its goal of
improving the application of environmental legislation to the use, management and conservation
of soil and the control of pollution within and outside the Project area. The Project was a
determining factor in putting the Soil Use Law into operation, whether through support to training
enforcement teams, or application of the law in the countryside. Application of the law was
important also to gain the attention of authorities/agencies involved in managing rural roads, to
use the law as a major criterion for the destination of water run-off along roadways. The same
can be confirmed in relation to municipal authorities and the destination of waters on earthen
roadways and in peri-urban areas. Even though much still needs to be done, the Project played a
fundamental role both in building awareness among farmers, and in rural and urban communities,
and in supporting the adoption of good practices and enforcing the law. In regard to oversight of
the application of incentives resources, all supervisions found that funds had been correctly
utilized. This was already expected, bearing in mind the monitoring of this process by extension
workers and the Regional Offices of CATI, as well as the social control over the incentives
represented by the Municipal Councils and producer associations in accompanying the execution
of the practices supported by the Project.

16.      In respect to activities under the Rural Roads Recuperation component, works developed
by the Project made important contributions to guiding activities for the repair of rural roads in
municipalities state-wide.     The State Government has actively supported road improvement
programs since 1987. Evaluation of these works permitted a re-orientation of such actions,
validating new intervention technologies which could be tested and expanded on a demonstration
basis. These new technologies were additional to successful technologies already in use and
being used by State municipalities and road service companies in activities involving road
renovation. The road repair model developed under this component and improved by CATI's
ETUs was adopted by the Basin Committees as a standard model to be used when applying for
resources from FEHIDRO. CATI, represented by technicians of the ETUs, started to perform the
function of technical agents for FEHIDRO responsible for approving technical projects and
supervising the road repair and soil conservation works. CATI, through its 24 ETUs and with the
training and experience of the Project, became an institution with one of the best technical teams
in the State for the execution and supervision of technical road repair projects with environmental
features, and also taking into account the social impacts of such works.

17.     Through this component, some 1,643 km of critical stretches of rural roads in 415 micro-
catchments were restored, resolving erosion caused by un-controlled surface rainwater run-off,
making it possible for farmers/others to enter/exit properties year-round and reducing the cost of
road maintenance to the municipalities. These works had demonstration effects and made
important contributions to guiding the State's rural roads restoration policies. Also worth
highlighting is a pilot effort for updating the road network in the Municipality of Alvinlândia,
looking to construct a proposal for a management system for the municipal road network
designed to help municipalities make decisions regarding investments in the maintenance and
restoration of rural roads. The success of the rural roads effort was partly due to the participation
of farmers and their families in prioritizing road repairs and the critical stretches needing action,
and in preparing specific subprojects to get the work done, due to the importance of integrating
the road works with the soil and water conservation systems being established on properties
bordering these roads.

18.     This component was initially delayed due to difficulties encountered with implementing a
contracting model which reconciled the norms of the World Bank with State laws. Advances
under the component were only possible following the definition and adoption of three price
quotations, an arrangement agreed with the World Bank's procurement specialists and which
became the modality for contracting road repair works, substituting for national bidding. Further,
execution of this component was only possible due to the decentralization to CATI's Regional
Offices, of road repair contracting processes. Given that the participation and commitment of the
municipal mayors, working with rural roads teams (operators, engineers, and others in charge), is
fundamental for the success of such works, decentralization needs to be effected via the transfer
to the municipalities of responsibility for these services. This would be under the coordination
and supervision of the Project, with existing municipal road repairs systems leading the way and
guiding this process, a pre-requisite for municipalities to receive project investments.

19.     The Training and Diffusion component was fundamental for ensuring an understanding
of the Project logic and technical rationale, ensuring the training events needed for its
implementation, as well as disseminating Project results and lessons learned by all actors
involved in its execution, namely operational, strategic and beneficiary publics. CATI was
restructured in 1997 and it was necessary to prepare the institution for its new mission; the Project
represented an instrument for making that happen. A huge effort was needed however, under this
component, to ensure diffusion to and understanding of the project logic and technical rationale
by the different groups involved, especially the operational cohort, in the initial stages of the
Project, because there was resistance to changing the mode of action adopted in the 1990s when
rural extension focused primarily on the diffusion and adaptation of technology and technical
assistance based on product lines.

20.      This component was a determining factor in building CATI's most important asset, its
social capital. People understood that the Project represented an instrument for making CATI's
mission operational, i.e. building in a participatory and planned manner, the process of
sustainable rural development. With this component, the Project built a base for sustainable rural
development in the State. The component achieved its goals, contributing to the changes sought
by the Project. However, greater dissemination of results is needed to the Project's stakeholders,
especially of the successful experiences which are important for building people's awareness. It
will be necessary to establish more efficient communication to reach the Project's diverse
audience, but the Project achieved real success and its dissemination is important so results can be
publicized, multiplied and valued.



                                                73

21.      Under the Project Management component, the evolution of Project performance, the
responsibility of the Project's Management Unit, was analyzed through three operational
mechanisms: (i) physical and financial monitoring; (ii) socio-economic and environmental
monitoring of pilot micro-catchments; and (iii) global evaluation in the third and the final years of
the Project. The Physical and Financial Monitoring System (SAFF-PEMH), developed especially
for project management, permitted the planning and structuring of activities in each micro-
catchment selected and consolidation of the results at the regional and state levels.
Computerization of the management process promoted a culture of management by projects,
guaranteeing the standardization of activities, targets and objectives, making sure that all actions
headed in the direction of the proposed results. Limitations occurred in utilizing the system for
management when the system was not updated retroactively with physical results from project
execution, since the Project was initiated in 2002 and went through innumerable
changes/alterations to improve its performance through the creation of new functions not initially
foreseen.    Meanwhile, the SAFF-PEMH system was essential for financial management,
principally of resources for operational capital, since all activities carried out at the regional level
and in the micro-catchments were planned and sanctioned under the Annual Operating Plan
(POA) and Micro-catchment Plan, ensuring that the full force of execution was concentrated on
Project targets.

22.      The physical and financial monitoring system permitted the identification of regional
performance differences in Project execution, demonstrating that the resources were applied as
originally envisaged in the area of greatest priority and attended principally the small farmers.
Development of the SAFF-PEMH and the information generated represented a big advance for
CATI and were internalized in the institutional management process, and will be further
improved under the new, follow-on project. The contracting of a consulting firm to support
Project management afforded the opportunity to install a system of results-based management and
the training of managers in technical areas and financial administration. These activities ensured
the decentralization of activities, such as approval of Micro-catchment Plans (Portaría CATI,
September 2005) and of the incentives (Portaría CATI ­ 7, July 2005) which accelerated the
implementation of activities in the countryside and decentralization of the contracting of works
which promoted an acceleration of disbursements.

23.      In regard to socio-economic and environmental monitoring in pilot micro-catchments, the
baseline studies were done in four pilot micro-catchments, being three in Priority 1 areas and one
in Priority 2. The baseline studies on water quality, soils, fauna and flora were conducted by
contracted consultants and the studies of socio-economic indicators were done by CATI itself.
The baseline studies in pilot micro-catchments were a determining factor in the alterations done
during Project implementation; an example of great relevance was the inclusion of support to the
installation of bio-digestive septic tanks as an activity eligible for project incentives. Also
conducted were final reports of studies of socio-economic indicators in the same four micro-
catchments as part of the studies for the final evaluation of the Project.

24.      The Mid-term Review was conducted in three stages: (i) first, contracting of a consulting
firm which presented an evaluation report which indicated the strong and weak aspects of Project
implementation up to that moment, as well as opportunities and threats for the continuity and
success of the Project; (ii) the second stage sought to establish a strong position for the State
Government (Secretariats of Finance and Planning and the Governor) guaranteeing the necessary
political support for the Project to reach its objectives and which had as its principal results the
insertion of the PEMBH within the Government's strategic programs and approval by the State
Legislature of the Soil Use Law; (iii) as the third stage, preparation of an action plan agreed



                                                 74

between the State and the World Bank to ensure acceleration of disbursements and a review of
Project targets bearing in mind the cancellation of US$10.0 million if financing.

25.      The final evaluation of the Project, as agreed with the World Bank, comprised the
contracting and carrying out of the following case studies: (i) evaluation of project impact on
institutional evolution of CATI and as a catalyst of local public policies; (ii) case study of social
participation in the Project; (iii) impact of project actions on quality of surface water; (iv) study
on the influence of different regional characteristics on Project implementation; (v) State Micro-
catchment Program and associations of small farmers; (vi) rural roads recuperation and control of
gullies; and (vii) impact of environmental education on the perception and behavior of
beneficiaries and general society. Besides the case studies, to supplement this report and the
preparation of a new project, a final report was done based on the monitoring of socio-economic
and environmental indicators in four pilot micro-catchments.

26.      Also under this component, six-monthly reports and annual external audits were prepared
based on conditions in the Loan Agreement, in addition to the preparation and monitoring of
Annual Operating Plans (POA) and Procurement Plans.              Following signature of the Loan
Agreement in December 1999, the State Micro-catchment Program (the Project) suffered certain
alterations of which the most significant were formalized in changes to the Loan Agreement in
June 30, 2006. Among these was the cancellation of US$10.0 million of financing in 2004 with a
proportional reduction in State counterpart. There were also three extensions of the closing date
which went from 12/31/2005 to 11/30/2008, and the changes to the Soil Use Law which
established the legal basis for allowing the incentives program to concede incentives to Project
beneficiaries.

Achievement of Project Objectives

27.      Project objectives were achieved in a satisfactory manner, as demonstrated in Table 6 (of
CATI's main completion document), which contains Project objectives, indicators projected in
the SAR and results achieved by the end of the Project. The planning strategy of the Project was
internalized by CATI which came to adopt this model for other programs and actions. There was
less concern about measuring efforts and much more emphasis on results, in relation to its
targeted public and its impact on rural development. The Project allowed CATI to demonstrate
its potential, to the extent that it demonstrated competence in implementing the Project, and
became an institution which had historically implemented about R$6.0 million and reaching the
mark of R$55.8 million in the year 2007.

28.      The Project demonstrated effectiveness as an instrument to increase the self-esteem of
small farm families, through the respect it showed towards them in regard to Project instruments
such as participatory diagnoses, participatory preparation of micro-catchment plans, responding
to their demands, and seeking joint solutions ­ between the State and civil society ­ of problems
affecting rural areas and also: (i) established the basis for sustainable rural development in the
State of Sao Paulo; (ii) trained and strengthened CATI to be a central agent in promoting this
process, in partnership with civil society, mainly in the most deprived parts of the State; (iii)
supported the institutional strengthening of the State for the efficient and effective application of
resources, including financial, in rural areas; (iv) trained farmers, Municipal and Regional Rural
Development Councils to be the protagonists of sustainable rural development in the State; and
(v) demonstrated itself as a strong catalyst of public and private resources so that they could be
applied in a more efficient form for sustainable rural development in the State.




                                                  75

29.      Due to the success of the strategy of conceding economic subventions to farmers, a
policy instrument implemented by the Project to stimulate the adoption of good management
practices, the State took the initiative of proposing a preliminary law to make the concession of
economic subventions a permanent instrument of the State in supporting of its rural development
policy. The proposal was evaluated by the legal arm of the SAS and is ready to be sent to the
Governor for transmittal to the State Legislature. The decentralization of Project actions
permitted an acceleration of its implementation and at the same time showed the need to improve
the management system developed to accompany/monitor activities and support decision-making
at various levels. It also signaled the need to strengthen the supervision/monitoring, evaluation
and guidance of the Regional Offices to further improve management. The Project provided
major lessons which need to be well-understood to guide the implementation of new projects,
programs and activities, in this way permitting a constant moving forward, realizing the potential
of correct actions and avoiding a repetition of past errors. They are lessons which need to be
divulged and disseminated, but for the most part they can serve to guide the development of
activities in other areas of the SAS, as well as other initiatives, whether they are within or outside
the Government,

30.      The adoption of the micro-catchment as the unit for planning and intervention was
decisive for: (i) increasing the awareness of farmers and their families about environmental
issues; (ii) better management of natural resources on farm properties; (iii) expanding the
participation and organization of farmers; (iv) ensuring important gains in productivity, assigning
greater value to planning and at the same time greater confidence in rural extension services. The
work permitted an exercise in integrating public policies, where many demands identified in plans
can be resolved within the municipal space/by the municipality. However, there is a need to
increase the incomes of farmers and their families because investments in natural resources
conservation, while necessary and fundamental for the development of sustainable agriculture,
depend on the producer perceiving the possibility of having success in agricultural activities as a
result.
