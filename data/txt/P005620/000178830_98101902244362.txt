INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF TIlE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Tunisia for the equivalent of US$8.9 million to help fi-
nance a third education project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, in-
cluding 5 years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economic Development of Tunisia - A Basic
Report" was distributed to the Executive Directors in January 1975. An up-
dating economic mission visited Tunisia in November, 1974; its report, "Memo-
randum on the Economic position of Tunisia," was circulated on May 23, 1975.
The main conclusions of the basic economic report and the updating mission
are reflected below. Country data sheets are attached (Annex I).
3.        Tunisia's development has been hampered by scarcity of natural
resources. Much of the country is arid or semi-arid, and agriculture is
highly dependent on rainfall. Minerals are mostly of low quality and, apart
from phosphates, limited in quantity. In the mid-1960's, petroleum was dis-
covered and has since become an increasingly valuable source of revenue and
export earnings. Industrial development has been handicapped by the small
size of the domestic market, as well as a lack of skills and experience.
Tourism has developed rapidly and workers' remittances have become a signifi-
cant item in the balance of payments. Per capita income increased by 4.4 per-
cent annually from 1961 to 1972, when it reached a level of $380. Tunisia
has enjoyed a large amount of external aid and used it to expand economic and
social infrastructure, broaden the industrial base, increase the rate of
growth, and make available a wide range of social and welfare services to a
large part of the population. Like most developing countries, however, it
has not yet found adequate ways to cope with unemployment and poverty and to
achieve a balanced distribution of consumption among income groups, between
urban and rural areas, and among regions.
4.        Government strategy in the 1960's relied heavily on central planning
of investment and resource allocation, with the public sector playing a major
role in production as well as providing infrastructure and services. Foreign
exchange shortages and concern with inflation led to recourse to a pervasive
system of price determination and controls. An unusually long series of poor
crop years due to shortage of rainfall slowed down growth of output. Many
of the investments in public enterprises proved to be uneconomic and private
initiative in most sectors except tourism and petroleum was limited.



5.        The Goverument's present development strategy was introduced after
1969. Its principal objectives are: (a) accelerating growth based on export-
oriented industries, by encouraging private initiative, reducing direct
Government involvement in production and relaxing administrative regulations;
(b) creating jobs, primarily in the expanding industrial sector, encouraging
worker emigration, reducing population growth and improving education and
training; and (c) maintaining internal and external f:inancial stability.
The 1973-76 Plan set a target rate of GDP growth of 7.1 percent, providing
for a 5.4 percent growth rate in per capita private consumption. Investment
was projected to increase by 80 percent above the level of the 1969-72 Plan.
National savings were to finance three-quarters of investment. Exports of
goods and services were projected to grow at 8.8 percent per year at constant
prices and imports at 12.2 percent. The Plan foresaw an increase in net ex-
ternal capital inflows of 55 percent over 1969-1972 average levels with external
capital providing 23.5 percent of total investment; the debt service ratio was
to be held to below 20 percent. The original Plan targets were conservative
in terms of both growth and savings potential, and have been significantly
affected by the impact of the changed petroleum and phosphate prices on the
Tunisian economy (paras. 9 and 10).
6.        The real growth of GDP has accelerated since 1970 compared to the
previous decade, averaging 8.6 percent per annum during 1970-1973 and an es-
timated 11 percernt in 1974. It can be attributed in part to fortuitous fac-
tors such as good weather, leading to record cereal and olive crops, in part
to important growth in tourism, petroleum revenues and workers' remittances
as well as to the general re-orientation of Government policy since 1969,
which renewed self-confidence and initiative in the private sector. Expansion
of manufacturing and phosphate production has been significant. By 1974, GNP
per capita had reached $490 at current prices. The investment rate, which
averaged 23 percent of GDP at current prices in the 1960's, slowed down to
21.3 percent in the early 1970's lbut regained its previous level in 1974.
Hlowever, the increase of investment in real terms is 'below Plan projections.
National savings, on the other hand, rose sharply, from an average of 13.5
percent of GDP at current prices during the 1960's to 18 percent in 1973 and
an estimated 22 percent iln 1974. Consequently, the share of external borrow-
ing irL financing investmient dropped from 44 percent in the 1960's to 17 per-
cent in 1973 and an estimated 9 percent in 1974.
7.       7The balance of payments has improved steadily since 1967, with the
current account defilcit declining from an average of $115 million per year
in 1961-1967 to $96 million in 1973 and an estiTmated $57 million in 1974.
Tlle effects of imyproved terms of trade on the 1974 balance of payments have
be,n significant. Commodity export prices (mainly petroleum, olive oil and
phosphates) rose on average by 66 percent over 1973, but were accompanied by
a rise in inport prices of ab3out 30 percent.  In acldition, receipts from
scrvices were affected by the decline of tourist activity and the slow-down
in the migration of workers tc, Europe. Iith estimated gross disbursements
on external borrowing totallineg $155 million (instead of $203 million as
foreseen in the Plan), net reserves stood at $400 million at the end of 1974,
equivalent to 4.5 months of imports.



8.        Because of price controls and Government subsidization of basic
consumer goods, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, Tunisia has main-
tained relative price stability. Domestic price increases averaged 4.2 per-
cent between 1969 and 1973. In 1974 consumer prices increased by 4.5 percent
only; however, the official GDP deflator rose to an estimated 12 percent and
average investment costs increased by about 17 percent.
9.        In the medium-term, Tunisia is likely to be on balance a benefi-
ciary of the change world economic situation. Petroleum and phosphate
prices increased about threefold since 1973; olive oil prices also increased
substantially in 1973 and 1974. As a result, export earnings are expected
to rise from $675 million in 1973 to about $1,336 million in 1976. On the
other hand, increases in import prices in 1974 and further increases in
coming years, combined with higher domestic demand, will cause payments on
imports to grow rapidly from $743 million in 1973 to a projected $1,397 mil-
lion in 1976. Thus Tunisia's gains in terms of trade are expected to dis-
appear by 1979. Tourism earnings and workers' remittances may continue to be
adversely affected by the depressed economic situation of Western Europe.
The level of net reserves is expected to represent about 5.2 months of imports
in 1976 and subsequently decrease slightly to about 4.7 months of imports in
1980. At that time, the balance of payments may re-emerge as a more serious
constraint on Tunisia's development.
10.       The temporary increase in foreign exchange reserves and Government
savings, resulting from higher export prices and consequent increases in tax
revenue, does not call for a substantial revision in development strategy.
It suggests rather that Tunisia should step up its efforts to achieve the
investment rate projected in the original Fourth Plan, and to realize higher
growth rates and greater employment creation by better capacity utilization.
Since worker emigration to Europe is now limited, an effort to increase invest-
ment, particularly in labor-intensive industry iand agriculture, should be made.
With an adequate savings level, the Tunisian economy has the financial resources
that should enable it to attain growth rates ranging from 8 to 9.5 percent per
annum until 1977 and thereafter from 7 to 8.5 percent. However, in the longer
term, higher rates of growth would require substantially higher external aid
than in the past. The level of future growth would also depend on Tunisia's
ability to continue to stimulate private investment, to increase competitivity
of industry, and to plan and implement public investments.
11.       Tunisia has made impressive social gains.    By 1974, primary school
enrollment had reached 88.3 percent and secondary enrollment 19.2 percent of
the relevant age-groups. Public health services have been greatly expanded
with many provided free, and a family planning program introduced. Social
expenditures, both current and capital, have increased by over 9 percent per
annum; in 1974 they accounted for 11 percent of GDP and for 40 percent of total
public expenditures. Nonetheless, major social issues remain. Further pro-
gress is needed in land reform. The unemployment rate was estimated at 18
percent in the non-agricultural sectors in 1973, and underemployment in the
rural sector is high. There has been a growing concentration of productive
activities in a few urban areas, especially Tunis.



- 4 -
12.       So far as can be judged from available data, real incomes in-
creased in all sectors during the 1960's, yet by a higher percentage in the
modern sector than in the rural sector, due partly to the series of poor
harvests. In rural areas substantial income disparities remain, in part as
a result of the structure of land tenure. In the moderrn sector, especially
in industry, increases in real income in the 1960's were greater than the
rise in productivity; the income distribution trend has favored industrial
workers. Thanks especially to the income redistribution effects of free
social services, the proportion of the total population living in poverty, as
defined by the Tunisians (earninig less than D 70 annually at 1970 prices), was
substantially reduced during the decade. About 90 percent of this group con-
tinues to live in rural areas, but, since 1970, increased agricultural output,
a recent rise in minimum agricultural wages, the inflow of workers' remittances
from abroad and the stabilization of basic commodity prices through Government
subsidies have improved the absolute, and possibly a:Lso the relative, position
of the poorest groups.
13.       Agriculture, the dominant sector in the economy, provides nearly
half of total employment, 32 percent of merchandise exports and 19 percent
of GDP (1972-74). Food processing induistries account for another 4 percent
of GDP and over a third of value added in manufacturing. Agricultural pro-
duction jumped in recent years, largely as a result of favorable weather, and
the potential for further growth is clear. While large infrastructure invest-
ments were made during the last decade, current policy emphasizes projects
that make a rapid and direct contribution to production and recognizes various
constraints on agricultural development: absentee ownership and insecurity
of tenure, inadequate access to agricultural credit, the need to devote more
resources to extension services and agricultural education, and underutiliza-
tion of irrigation investments.   Under the Fourth Plan, more than $100 million
has been allocated to a rural development program to be executed by the pro-
vincial administrations.
14.       During the 1960's, manufacturing production in Tunisia increased by
8 percent annually. There was a remarkable acceleration of growth in the early
1970's due in part to record years for the olive oil processing industry and
to the development of textile and chemical industries. The early tihrust of
industrialization was supplied by large import substitution projects in the
state sector. These suffered, however, from the limited domestic market and
shortages of experienced staff and management. Under the Fourth Plan, private
manufacturing investment, particularly in textiles, fertilizers and metals
transformation, is expected to average D 25 million per year between 1973
and 1976, compared with D 12 million in 1972, and to account for two-thirds
of total investment in manufacturing; these targets are likely to be exceeded.
Foreign and domestic private investment is now stimulated by a comprehensive
incentive framework, and facilitated by the sw-,e2mlined approval procedures of
the investment promotion agency.   Foreign inwestors are expected to contribute
know-how and overseas marketing.   Tunisia's vreferential trade agreement with
the EEC also gives it some trade advantages.    Preinvestment work, and prepara-
tion of programs for re-equipment and modernization in priority subsectors
have been started.   Tunisia aims to develop petroleum-based industries and
production of phosphoric aci(d and other phosphate derivatives for export,



-5-
while possibilities in metal manufacturing for export are being explored.
The Government has recently established a special fund to encourage growth
of small industries and industrial decentralization, and has started a pro-
gram to establish industrial estates.
15.       The development of tourism in Tunisia is relatively recent.     Foreign-
visitor arrivals in Tunisia reached a record level of 780,000 in 1972, with
an annual rate of growth over the period 1961-1972 of 30 percent -- higher than
any other Mediterranean country. Since 1970, earnings from tourism have been
a major source of foreign exchange, having reached US$154 million in 1973.
While 1973 saw a drop in the number of visitor nights, and 1974 registered
another overall drop, increased activity in more recent months provides some
basis for optimism in the medium-term. The decline in tourist inflow resulted
from both external and domestic factors, the former being mainly the effect
of the energy crisis on the European tourist flow and adverse currency move-
ments, the latter inadequate development of infrastructure (particularly
recreational facilities), shortages of trained manpower and the inadequacy
of services. The government is aware of these shortcomings and is endeavor-
ing to alleviate their effects through a variety of measures including the
issuance of revised investment incentives, increased efforts in marketing,
and the preparation of codes to enforce quality standards and more stringent
zoning laws.
16.       Since the early 1960's Tunisia has received relatively large amounts
of external capital. During 1965-1973, loan commitments from Governments and
multilateral organizations averaged $100 million per annum, while disburse-
ments were some $76 million per annum, or $20 and $15 respectively per capita
per annum. Since 1965, the major bilateral lenders, on a commitment basis,
have been the United States (22 percent of official loans), France (14 percent),
and Germany (13 percent), with further important contributions from Canada,
Italy, Kuwait and Sweden. Loans from the Bank Group have constituted the main
source of total official lending, accounting for 25 percent of commitments
during 1965-1973. There has been a steady shift away from program lending into
projects. Most aid has been obtained on concessionary terms: from 1969-1973,
the average terms of borrowing from bilateral sources were 3.6 percent inter-
est and 24 years to maturity, including 6 years of grace; from multilateral
sources 5.4 percent interest and 28 years to maturity, including 6 years of
grace. Tunisia received annually some $30 million in grants during 1965-1973,
as well as capital inflows from private sources amounting to some $40 million
annually. Direct foreign private investment has been fairly limited. How-
ever, mainly as a result of increasing outlays on petroleum exploration and
development and, recently, foreign investment in manufacturing, it has shown
a rising trend, from $17 million in 1965 to $32 million net in 1972, and
$54 million in 1973.
17.       Tunisia's total external public debt was $1,271 million (of which
$824 million were disbursed) at the end of 1973. Debt service is estimated
to have fallen from 16.2 percent in 1972 to 9.4 percent in 1974 of exports



- 6 -
of goods, non-factor services and workers' remittances. The debt service
ratio is projected to fall to 3 percent by 1976, following recent increases
in commodity export earnings, but may rise after 1980 when external capital
requirements are likely to increase substantially. While Tunisia is capable
of servicing substantial additional debt on less concessionary terms than in
the past, it should continue to seek part of its external resources on con-
cessionary terms so as to prevent the debt service ratio from rising unduly
in the long-term.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUNISIA
18.       Starting in 1962, Tunisia has received a total of twenty one Bank
loans and ten IDA credits amounting respectively to $258.7 million and $65.7
million, net of cancellations and refundings. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank Loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of April 30, 1975,
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
19.       While there have been some problems in project execution, as in
the railways, agricultural credit and family planning projects, on the whole
project implementation has been satisfactory. Important institutional im-
provements have been achieved. In both the transport and public utilities
sectors, independent agencies have been created or strengthened.
20.       In accordance with TIunisian priorities, past Bank Group lending
has emphasized support for long-term investments in social development and
infrastructure. Lending for urban and social development, including water
supply, education, family planning and the Tunis urban planning and public
transport project, accounts for 40 percent of Bank/IDA. commitments in
Tunisia. Lending for transport, power and tourism infrastructure accounts
for a further 27 percent. Industrial and hotel financing through Banque de
Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) comes third with 17 percent. Agri-
culture and fisheries have received 9 percent of total commitments, and the
Gafsa phosphate development project accounts for 7 percent of total commit-
ments.
21.       Two previous Bank Group projects have contributed to the development
of the Tuniisian education system. The first education project (Credit 29-TUN)
approved in 1963, was designed to increase the number of qualified teachers
for primary and first cycle secondary schools and to support the introduction
of technical subjects into secondary schools. The project was completed
satisfactorily in 1968. The second education project (Credit 94-TUN), approved
in 1966, supported further secondary level expansion to meet skilled manpower
needs in commerce and industry. The project, as modified in 1968 following
a change in Government policy, provided for 20,000 student places (about 42
percent of the planned government expansion program for 1966-1970) by financing
the construction and equipment of nine new multilateral secondary schools. It
also provided technical assistance to the Planning Unit of the Education
MIinistry to study the education system and to determine possible reform meas-
ures. Delays in the timely appointment of UNESCO experts and their counter-
pasts in the Planning Unit of the Education Ministry resulted in long delays
in the technical assistance program. The project is expected, however, to be
satisfactorily completed in June 1975.



- 7 -
22.       Future Bank lending to Tunisia is expected to support changes in
policies and institutions, in particular agricultural policies and agencies
and the planning and implementation machinery; it would also support measures
to create employment and to introduce institutional reform. The proposed
lending program emphasizes investment in agriculture; this will require sub-
stantial Government inputs of manpower and technical assistance to support
increased production and the creation of new institutions which can reach the
rural poor. Over the next several years, it is expected that several projects
will be presented to the Executive Directors which address the problems of
land reform, organization for agricultural and rural development, and integra-
tion of agricultural with other aspects of rural development.
23.       Lending for industry has so far been through the main Tunisian
development finance company, BDET, and has mostly benefited medium-size com-
panies. Such lending is expected to continue, but at a declining rate as BDET
diversifies its sources of funds. It has recently been supplemented by direct
industrial lending for the Gafsa phosphate mining project, and further loans
are planned for industrial estates and priority industrial subsectors, now
being studied with Bank assistance, in which Tunisia has a comparative
advantage.
24.       The Bank Group accounted for almost 20 percent of disbursements of
official aid to Tunisia between 1969 and 1972 and is expected to maintain its
share, with that of the US declining and that of other, particularly Arab,
sources of funds rising. The Bank Group's shares in total debt outstanding
and disbursed at the end of 1972 (including loans from private sources.) and
in debt service during 1972 were 11 percent and 7 percent respectively. Over
the rest of the decade, the Bank Group's share in disbursed external debt is
expected to rise to about 20 percent; its share in debt service will probably
rise to the same level.
25.       IFC has invested in a fertilizer plant, in BDET, in COFITOUR (a
company to promote and invest in tourism projects), in RYM (a large hotel
development) and in Industries Chimiques de Fluor, which will produce alumi-
nium fluoride from local fluorspar for export. IFC's most recent investment,
in May 1975, was in the Sousse-Nord project, an integrated tourism development
project. Including the Sousse-Nord project, IFC's net commitments in Tunisia
total $17 million.
PART III - EDUCATION IN TUNISIA
26.       Education in Tunisia is largely patterned on the French system.     In
1973-74 primary education, which consists of six years of schooling, was
provided, free of charge, for 866,000 students, representing about 88.3 per-
cent of the relevant age group. Secondary education, which consists of a
lower common cycle (tronc commun) of three grades, and an upper cycle of four



to five grades divided into optional programs, enrolled 179,000 students,
rep.esenting about 19.2 percent of the relevant age group. 50 percent of
secondary enrollment was in the common cycle and 16 percent in vocational
schools. Only about 2.5 percent of the relevant age group are enrolled in
higher education institutions. Enrollments in institutions of higher
learning, which include the University of Tunis and a number of specialized
institutes, were 11,916 in 1973/1974. Recent trends in higher education show
a decrease of enrollments in liberal arts subjects in favor of science and
medicine. Less than 2 percent of enrollment is in private schools.
27.       The formal education system (pre-school education excepted) is
managed by the Ministry of Education, but higher education institutions enjoy
some degree of autonomy. Other Government ministries and agencies administer
various non-formal programs in basic education, agricultural and industrial
skill-training and social education. Overall, the existing organization and
structure can meet a variety of learning needs; efforts are required however
to coordinate, expand and improve existing programs and to promote new ones,
so that they can correspond adequately to actual learning needs.
28.       Government policy in the 1960's, to provide free education to as many
students as possible, rapidly expanded enrollments at the primary and secondary
school levels. The emphasis on quantity at the expense of quality resulted
in high repeater and drop-out rates throughout the system. In 1973/1974
promotion rates still averaged 70 percent at the primary, 74 percent at thle
lower secondary and 70 percent at the upper secondary levels.   Primary school
drop-outs, who usually fail to achieve literacy and numeracy, are largely
unsuitable for employment in the modern urban labor market; furthermore, they
often develop unfavorable attiLudes to practical work and frustration from
unfulfilled expectations. Recently, the Government has successfully intro-
duced measures to reduce student wastage. Partly due to the decline in
repeater rates, primary school enrollments have decreased in the last two
years. Yet much remains to be done to integrate the country's education and
training programs into a system tailored to the needs of the internal and
external job markets, and to imnprove, in general, the qualitative output of
the primary system.
29.       Present education policy aims at improving the efficiency of the
education system. At present, 10.2 pupil-years of primary schooling are
required to produce a sixth grade leaver, five pupil-years to produce a
graduate from the three year tronc conmiun, and 9.7 pupil years to produce a
graduate of the upper four-year cycle. The high wastage rates may partly be
attributed to the relatively underqualified teaching staff, and partly to the
bilingual requirements of the school system. Efforts are now being made to
retrain and upgrade the primary school teacher force and to adjust primary
teacher training enrollments to the slower pace of growth of primary school
enrollments, stressing qualitative improvement rather than continued expan-
sion. The Education Ministry wishes to maintain a teacher/pupil ratio of



-9-
1:40 at the primary level and to upgrade the existing teaching staff of about
20,000, 45 percent of whom are underqualified. At secondary level, teachers
are mainly trained in the Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS) and the Ecole Normale
Superieure pour l'Enseignement Technique (ENSET); the National Center for
Continuous Education at Korba implements a primary teacher and administrator
upgrading and training program. The Government intends gradually to replace
the expatriate secondary school teachers, who represent 32 percent of the
7,200 secondary level teachers, and studies are under way to determine ways
of achieving this objective.
30.       Tunisia's recurrent expenditures on education represent about 30
percent of its recurrent budget. The possibilities for additional allocations
to education are therefore limited. Costs per student at the primary level
are relatively low (about 74 dollars per student per year) compared with
secondary and higher education; they are equivalent to 20 percent of per
student costs at the secondary level and 3 percent at the higher education
level.
31.       The ITM program.   As an experiment in educational reform, the
"Initiation aux Travaux Manuels" (ITM) program was introduced in Tunisia three
years ago with the support of ILO and UNICEF, on an experimental basis, to
provide exposure to manual work at a pre-vocational level in primary schools
and a foundation for employment-oriented education in agriculture (ITMA) and
industry (ITMI). In addition to this, the program aims at adapting primary
education to the local environment, and helping to change the unfavorable
attitudes of many primary school pupils towards manual work. The program
represents therefore an important departure from the previous academic con-
ception of primary education. Following the initial successful experimental
phase, the Government has decided to generalize the ITM program while still
continuing to innovate. It is now to be extended to approximately 95 per-
cent of all fifth and sixth graders by 1981.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       After project reconnaissance discussions, the project was identified
by a Bank mission in September 1974. It was prepared by a mission from the
UNESCO/IBRD Cooperative Program in October/November 1974, and appraised by
the Bank in November/December 1974. Negotiations were held in May 1975. The
Tunisian delegation was led by Mr. Abdelwaheb Jemal, the Acting Director of
the Planning Unit in the Education Ministry. A loan and project summary is
attached as Annex III. The Appraisal report (No. 777-TUN) is being circu-
lated separately to the Executive Directors.
Purposes of the project
33.       The project would help to expand, and continue innovation in, the ITM
program. It would help to introduce a more relevant curriculum and increase
the efficiency of the primary school system including reorienting teacher
training and upgrading and retraining of primary teachers. The project



- 10 -
would provide support for ongoing education reform studies initiated under
the second education project through assistance to the Planning Unit in the
Ministry of Education and a new study relating education and training to labor
market requirements to help the government elaborate a sound employment policy
for the Fifth Plan (1977-81). In addition, it would provide, on an experi-
mental basis, out-of-school training directly related to employment oppor-
tunities for primary school leavers. Finally, the project would finance
US$300,000 in consultant architect fees for technical studies and design de-
velopment for a possible follow-up education project, suitable for external
financing, to help reduce the lag between commitment ;and disbursement.
The ITM component
34.       ITMA (agriculture oriented) curriculum consists of theory and practi-
cal work related to local farming and animal husbandry; ITMI (industry oriented)
curriculum consists of metalwork, woodwork, masonry, basic construction and
simple electrical repairs. The project would support the first stage of ITM
expansion in primary schools by extending ITM to about 422 primary schools in
operation in 1974. To facilitate this expansion the project would finance
the conversion and equipment of 312 classrooms located in poor urban areas
into 156 ITMI workshops and the construction of 55 primary schools in the same
areas to replace the student places lost through conversion of the classrooms
into ITMI workshops; the project would also finance the equipment for 22 new
ITMI and 210 new ITMA facilities in the Kairouan and Medenine governorates,
and for 18 ITM polyvalent centers throughout Tunisia. The latter are new
experimental facilities which would combine agricultural and industrial
training.
The Teacher-Training Component
35.       The success of the ITM program largely depends on the availability
of a teaching force capable of teaching ITM subjects and smoothly orienting
primary school curricula towards technical subjects. The teacher-training
component is designed to meet this requirement by providing retraining and
upgrading facilities for the existing primary school teaching force so that,
by 1985, almost all primary teachers would have been exposed to ITM subjects
and how they should be taught. To this end, additions to, and equipment for,
five teacher training schools at Tunis, La Marsa, Kairouan, Gafsa and Sfax
would be financed under the project, to provide training facilities in each
school in woodwork, metalwork, construction, electricity and home economics/
nutrition; the National Center for Continuous Education at Korba would be
expanded to increase its enrollment capacity from 175 to 250, and five model
workshops would be built for training in woodwork, electricity, construction,
metalwork and home economics/nutrition. The Government would make satisfac-
tory arrangements for the recruitment of a sufficient number of qualified
teacher-trainers within one year of the date of the Loan Agreement, to begin
immediately the upgrading and retraining program (draft Loan Agreement, Sec-
tion 3.06 d).   The Government has provided assurances that sufficient impor-
tance would be given to ITM subjects in evaluating the work of ITM teacher-
trainees (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.06 (e)).

Experimental Post-Primary Program Component
36.       To help the large number of primary school leavers who cannot secure
jobs in the labor market, the project would finance an experimental post-
primary program which would provide non-formal education and training related
to the local environment of the school leavers and to local employment oppor-
tunities. To achieve this goal, two regional centers and related satellite
centers would be established in Kairouan and Medenine, two of the poorer
governorates in Tunisia. The regional centers would coordinate the activities
of satellite centers, develop and administer a tracer system to maintain re-
cords of the subsequent employment of the trainees, and constantly seek to
analyze field experience so that appropriate corrective measures may be taken.
The satellite centers, which would reach out to the poorest elements of so-
ciety in the small villages, would provide training from six months to two
years in various craft skills, as well as basic skills in literacy and
numeracy. The Government would make adequate arrangements to ensure coordina-
tion of all national and local training centers concerned with the program;
it would also assign the necessary authority to the regional education in-
spector to monitor and coordinate the post-primary program. Finally, two
Tunisian non-formal education specialists would immediately be trained over-
seas and assigned to the centers (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.06 (a), (b),
and (c)). When fully operational, the Medenine post-primary centers would
produce annually 1,040 trainees and the Kairouan centers 530 trainees.
Technical Assistance Component
37.       Experts would be financed to assist the Planning Unit of the Educa-
tion Ministry, set up under the second education project, to continue its
studies on the reform of Tunisia's education system, and to undertake a new
study on education/training and employment requirements, which would serve as
the basis for defining the Government's employment and education policy for
the Fifth Plan (1977-81). The project would also include 18 man/months of
short-term consultancies for the Project Implementation Unit, the Planning
Unit and the Evaluation Unit, and seventy man/months of fellowships for the
overseas training of the Tunisian staff who will help implement the project.
Project Execution
38.       A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be set up in the Direc-
torate of Primary Education of the Education Ministry to coordinate and su-
pervise physical execution of the project with the assistance of the "Direction
des Batiments et du Materiel" in the Education Ministry and the Ministry of
Public Works, and to provide technical services for project administration
including recruitment of specialists, contract administration, and procurement
(Draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.01 (b) and Schedule 5). The Director of
Primary Education would also be the Director of the PIU; he would be assisted
by two qualified full-time professional staff, one responsible for physical
works and the other for administration of the technical assistance component.
An Evaluation Unit, to be suitably staffed, would be set up in the Directorate
of Primary Education to monitor the development and expansion of the ITM
program, in cooperation with the regional inspectorates of primary education.
It would also prepare studies, in collaboration with the National Institute



- 12 -
for Educational Sciences, the National Center for Continuous Education, and
thle teacher-training institutes, on new programs and teaching methods for
primary schools (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
39.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$27.6 million, net
of taxes, of which about one third, or some US$8.9 million, would be in for-
eign exchange. The proposed Bank loan would finance the foreign exchange
costs; the Government would finance all local costs.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.        Civil works contracts would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.
Because of the large number of small and widely dispersed civil works items,
few foreign firms are expected to submit bids on civil works. Items for
furniture and equipment would be grouped to the extent practicable to permit
bulk procurement. Subject to an aggregate maximum of $330,000, contracts for
furniture and equipment costing less than $3,000 may be awarded through com-
petitive local bidding or price quotations solicited from at least three
suppliers. In the evaluation of bids under international competitive bidding,
local manufacturers of furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of
preference equal to the existing rate of custom duty applicable to competing
imports, or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price, whichever is lower.
41.       The loan would be disbursed against (i) 100 percent of the c.i.f.
cost for imported furniture and equipment, or 95 percent of the ex-factory
price of locally procured furniture and equipment; (ii) 100 percent of for-
eign expenditures for technical assistance; (iii) 50 percent of the total
expenditure for the preparation of architectural designs for a possible
follow-up education project suitable for external financing, and (iv) 14 per-
cent of total expenditures for civil works. As a condition of disbursement
of funds for technical assistance to the Planning UJnit, the Government would
fill all budgeted posts in the Planning Unit and agree with the Bank on the
detailed outline for each study to be carried out by the Planning Unit with
Bank assistance (Draft Loan Agreement, schedule 1, para. 4(b)). As a condi-
tion of disbursement of funds for consultant architect fees to design a follow-
up education project suitable for external financing, the Government and the
Bank would agree on the components of the project (Draft Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1, para. 4(c).
Project Benefits
42.       The project would assist the Governme-'nt in strengthening current
primary education reform programs and in extending reform to new education
activities and target groups. Primary education would be improved through the
expansion of a program that would introduce instruction in practical subjects
and relate the primary scllool curriculum to the local environment; teacher
training and restructuring of the teacher training curriculum would be provided



- 13 -
to facilitate efficient introduction of the new subjects into primary schools;
a post-primary program would address the problems of integrating primary
school leavers into productive society. Finally, education planning would be
enhanced through studies to evaluate the effectiveness of changes introduced
into the primary school program, to determine new reform measures, and to
examine the interrelation of the labor market and the education and training
system.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Tunisia and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Additional conditions of effectiveness include the establishment of the
Project Implementation Unit under the authority of the Director of Primary
Education and the appointment of two qualified full-time professional staff
to assist the PIU Director    (Draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.01).  Features
of the loan of particular interest are referred to in paragraphs 35 - 41 of
this report. The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for
education projects.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. 94: Second Education Project; US$13 million credit of September 16, 1966;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1970; (current) December 31,
1975.
Physical execution of the project is expected to be completed in
June 1975. All project schools have been accepted by the government from
the contractors, virtually all equipment and furniture have been purchased,
and most of it has been delivered and installed. Despite early delays in
the appointment of UNESCO experts and their counterparts in the Education
Ministry Planning Unit, a report on primary and general secondary education,
with a preliminary analysis of higher education, has been prepared. However,
the report does not cover vocational and technical training, education fi-
nances and management, and administration of the education system. To allow
for the completion of the technical assistance program, the Closing Date was
extended to December 31, 1975.
Ln. 581: First Water Supply Project; US$15 million loan of January 16, 1968;
Closing Date: (original) December 31, 1973; (current) December 31,
1975.
Cr. 209: Second Water Supply Project; US$10.5 million credit of June 30, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974; (current) December 31, 1975.
Ln. 989: Third Water Supply Project; US$23 million loan of May 29, 1974;
Closing Date (original): June 30, 1979.
Because of problems with locally manufactured asbestos-cement pipe
completion of the First Project has been delayed. Constraints resulting from
lack of capacity in the local construction industry required that the Closing
Date be further set back until the end of 1975. Final project costs are
expected to be about 6% below appraisal estimates (but 7% higher in dollar
terms because of devaluation). The Second Project is 12 to 18 months behind
schedule for the same reasons as well as because of initial delays in final
design. Final costs may be about 5% higher than original estimates because
of current inflation rates, but they will be 20%-25% higher in dollar terms.
Because of delays in execution, the Closing Date has also been extended to
the end of 1975. The loan for the Third Project became effective before
the initial deadline; procurement has begun and is on schedule.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, arl in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in thts sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. 606: Railwavs Project: 1SSS.5 million loan and US$8.5 million credit,.
Cr. 150: both of June 4, 1969; Closing Date of loan: (original) December
31, 1973; (current) December 31, 1975.
The project has been delayed both by floods (one year) and by fi-
nancial difficulties (one year). The financial problems were caused by non-
payment of freight charges by the railway's largest customer, the state-
controlled Gafsa Phosphate Company: operational deficits, due to low rates
and fares: and higher than estimated prices of rolling stock. A new cost-
based tariff was introduced in January 1974; traffic continues to rise but
operating results have not improved as much as expected, and continuing Gov-
ernment contributions to the railways and further tariff increases will be
required. A reallocation of the proceeds of the loan and credit permitted
the placing of all outstanding orders: cost increases of about $6 million
for items in the original list of goods are being financed by utilizing a
Spanish line of credit. The credit has been fully disbursed: the Closing
Date of the loan was extended to permit completion of disbursements.
Cr. 238:  Population Project; US$4.8 million credit_of April 5, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
After a slow start:, resulting in a 24-month delay, there has re-
cently been considerable progress in project execution and in the family
planning program, but several problems remain. A new Director General was
appointed to the National Office for Family Planning and Population in 1974.
Program performance shows important signs of improvement An Association
sector report incorporating a Four Year Plan of Action was recently com-
pleted and forwarded to the Government. The total cost of the project is
now estimated at least three times the $7.7 million estimated at appraisal.
Intensified supervision of the project is being maintained.
Ln. 746: Highways Project; US$24 million loan of June 9, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project execution, which fell behind schedule initially due to
lengthy Government procedures and changes in key personnel, is now proceeding
satisfactorily. Progress in reconstruction and rehabilitation of roads and
bridges is good. The estimated cost of the project has increased significantly,
mainly as a result of dollar devaluation. One major road section may be elim-
inated from the project. The Government has been requested to provide supple-
mentarv funds to permit completion of the other project components.
Ln. 779:  Agricultural Credit Project; USS5 million loan and US83 million
Cr. 263:  credit, both of July 12, 1971: Closing Dates:    July 31, 1975.
Disbursements are behind schedule1 especially for dairy farms, since
the cost of imported cows has risen and there is competition between Bank/IDA
and other cheaper funds. This competition has resulted in financing of live-
stock operations by BNT to farmers who should only borrow at the higher in-
terest rates foreseen under the Bank loan and IDA credit, but the Government
has recently chan-ed its policy to elininate the competition.    A severe flood



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6
in March 1973 also affected project progress. The IDA credit has been fully
disbursed. The Bank and IDA have agreed slightly to broaden the scope of the
project to permit financing of a dairy processing plant.
Cr. 270: Fisheries Project; US$2 million credit of September 24, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The project is now being actively implemented after earlier diffi-
culties and delays experienced in design of an economic project vessel suit-
able for operation by traditional fishermen. Problems were also encountered
in selecting the marine engine to equip the project boat. Increases in the
cost of hulls and engines led to a reduction of the number of boats to be
constructed under the project from 335 to 180; despite price increases, the
project boat is still economic because of the sharp increases in fish prices
since appraisal. The demand for the project vessel is also strong as it rep-
resents a significant improvement over traditional vessels of the same caliber
and costs about 23% less than these vessels.
Ln 815:  Power Project; US$12 million of April 20, 1972:
Closing Date: July 31, 1975.
The project is nearing completion. Both gas turbines, as well as
all transmission lines and substations are in operation. Costs of the project
are not expected to exceed the original estimate. A recent tariff increase
will raise STEG's overall electricity revenues by 12 percent so that the rate
of return is expected to reach 9.2 percent in 1979 (8.5 percent in the Loan
Agreement).
Ln. 858: Tourism Infrastructure Project; US$14 million loan and US$10 million
Cr. 329: credit, both of September 28, 1972; Closing Dates: December 31,. 1977.
The project experienced initial delays because of the time required
to adopt legislation establishing the public land corporation which is to ac-
quire land in the project zones for resale to investors. The development
studies for the six project zones, being executed by consultants, are almost
on schedule. Invitations for bids for some project works have been issued;
contracts are now being concluded and some works are underway. A study of
Governmenti incentives for investment in tourism has been completed.
Ln. 798:  Fourth Development Finance Company Project; US$10-million loan of
February 9, 1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
Ln. 881: Fifth Development Finance Company Project; US$14 million loan of
February 20, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
Disbursements under Ln. 798 are slightly behind schedule, while
disburserments urder Ln. 881 are ahead of schedule.   Business greatly exceeded
projectiois in 1973 and is continuing at an accelerated rate. Persistent
problems include the adequacy of provisions against possible losses, the sub-
stantial amount of arrears of hotel borrowers and the lack of valid mortgage

security for certain sub-loans; these are being closely watched.   The depend-
ence of BDET (ex-SNI) on the Government and the IBRD is expected to be re-
duced by BDET's raising considerable funds from local and other foreign
sources. A sixth loan is currently being processed.
L,n. 937:  Tunis District Urban Planning and Public Transport Project; US$11
Cr. 432:  million loan and US$7 million credit, both of October 5, 1973;
Closing Dates: December 31, 1976.
Due to delays in appointment of consultants and completion of the
necessary legal actions and opinions, the loan and credit for this project
only became effective in September, 1974. As the offer of the Tunisian sup-
plier fell within 15 percent of the international reference price agreed with
the Bank/IDA, the public transport company (SNT) has decided to award him the
contract for supply of project buses.- The District has faced difficulty in
recruiting the staff foreseen under the project, and in establishing itself
as an effective interlocutor of national agencies. Steps to deal with these
problems are now being taken. Major price increases are expected in the
equipment for the suburban railway component, and ways of financing the
resulting cost overrun are umder consideration.
Ln. 1029: Hotel Training Project; US$5.6 million loan of July 17, 1974;
Closing Date: October 31, 1978.
Due largely to delays in the acquisition of sites for project hotel
training centers by the National Tourist Office (ONTT), effectiveness of the
loan for this project has been delayed. Consulting architects have been
selected from official lists provided by the Ministry of Equipment. The
project unit initially created for the tourism infrastructure project has been
enlarged by addition of the staff necessary for the construction of the hotel
training centers. Recruitment of technical assistance personnel is nearly
complete.
Ln. 1042: Gafsa Phosphate Project; US$23.3 million loan of October 1, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Prequalification of equipment suppliers :is underway. Terms of
reference for a study of development possibilities in the mining region are
under discussion.
Ln. 1068: Irrigation Rehabilitation Project; $12.2 million loan of December
31, 1974; Closing Date:  June 30, 1982
Execution of the project has begun, but the loan has not yet become
effective because recruitment of the senior advisor for the Nebhana develop-
ment authority has not been completed.

Consultants have begun work on certain aspects of the project, but
the loan has not yet become effective.
