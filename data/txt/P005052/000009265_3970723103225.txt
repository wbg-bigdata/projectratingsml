DRAINAGE V PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  Government of Arab Republic of Egypt.
Amount:                    US$ 68 million equivalent.
Terms:                     Twenty years, including five years grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Implementing Agency:       Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects.
Project Obiectives:        The project's objectives would be to reverse the
and Description:           deteriorating salt and water balance in project
areas, thereby increasing agricultural production,
and to strengthen the Egyptian Public Authority for
Drainage Projects to improve standards of
implementation, quality control, maintenance and
monitoring. The project, to be implemented over 5
years, beginning in FY86, would provide continuing
support to the Government's ongoing drainage
program. Based on experience gained from previous
drainage projects and on the detailed preparatory
work performed over the last two years, the project
would include improvements over current practices in
selection of areas, design criteria, technical
specifications and implementation methods. Open
drain remodelling in about 280,000 feddans, and
installation of tile drainage in 465,000 feddans
wou,d be provided for drainage. Designs of tile
drainage would be location specific, with the design
capacity of open drains dependent on conditions of
drainage basins. Maintenance centers and subcenters
would be established and equipped to ensure adequate
maintenance of project facilities. The Drainage
Authority's monitoring cell would be strengthened to
improve the quality and timeliness of its reporting.



-ii-
Benefits and Risks:        The project would benefit some 120,000 farm
families, and increase the value of agricultural
production by about LE55 million/year at full
development. Project's risks are minimal. The
costs and benefits have been conservatively
estimated on the basis of past experience, and
implementation pace is based on current levels of
performance.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPr
DRAINAGE V PROJECT
SrAFF APPRAkSAL REPORT
L ll!TRODUCTION
1.01     Egypt has a total area of one million (M) square kilometers (km2)
or 238 N feddans (fed), of which only about 3% is agriculturally productive.
This arable area of some 6.4 M fed amounts to only 0.14 fed per capita--
amongst the lowest levels of availability in the world.
1.02     The productivity of this limited land resource depends upon
irrigation. Following completion of the High Aswan Dam (HAD) and the
introduction of perennial supplies to all irrigated areas, cropping
intensities and water use per unit of area have increased sharply. A
consequence of intensified irrigation has been a rising groundwater table, and
increased problems of waterlogging and salinity. In response to this
challenge, the Goverment of Egypt (GOE) has attached high priority to
preventing groundwater to rise to harmful levels on existing lands by
installing tile drainage (subsurface drainage) systems. This work began in
1960, and has been supported by the Bank Group since 1970 through four
projects (with Credits/Loans totalling US$178 M), for tile drainage in
1.350,000 fed in the Nile Delta, and 800,000 fed in Upper Egypt. The total
area tile-drained by the end of 1986 will amount to 3.1 M fed, representing
about half of the irrigated area, and two-thirds of the area requiring
drainage.
1.03     The GOE has requested further Bank support for the ongoing programs
in both Upper Egypt and the Delta. The proposed Fifth Drainage Project was
initially conceived during the preparation of the Nile Delta Drainage II
Project (Credit 719-EGT and Loan 1439/40-EGT) that provided for remodelling of
open drains on 810,000 fed and installation of tile drains on only 400,000
fed. When that project was appraised in 1977, it was expected that another
project would be needed to complete the subsurface drainage works in the
project area.
1.04     Project Preparation was initiated in 1983 with the help of a Food and
Agricultural Organization/World Bank Cooperative Program (FAO/CP) mission. In
1984, preparatory work for a 10-Year Investment Program was conducted by the
Project Preparation Department (PPD) of the Ministry of Irrigation (MOI),
financed under Technical Assistance Credit 1162-EGT, and by the Egyptian
Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPADP). In August 1984, the FAO/CP



-2-
-isited Egypt to finalize a project preparation report, issued in September,
covering the first time-slice of a 10-Year Program.
I. SECTOR
A. General
2.01     Egypt has a population estimated at about 45 M in 1984, increasing at
an annual rate of over 2.6%. Arid desert land accounts for about 96.5S of the
one M Km2 surface area, leaving only 35,500 km2 of urban and
agriculturally productive land with a population density of about
1,400/km1. Almost 50S of the population is rural, its proportion having
steadily declined from 62X in 1960. Average per capita annual income is
US$640.
2.02     The land base for agricultural production consists of 5.5 M fed of
"old" lands and 0.9 M fed of reclaimed lands-the so called "old-new" lands.
The per capita cultivated area, which was 0.19 fed in 1960, is now only about
0.14 fed. The old-lands include all of the more fertile areas in the valley
of the Nile and the Delta where about 971 of the nation's total agricultural
production is generated. The old-new lands were developed from the late 1950s
through the early 1970s, primarily on the marginal soils along the western
edge of the Delta. Nearly all Egyptian agriculture is irrigated, and since
completion of the HAD (1968), all irrigation is perennial.
B. AMriculture
Ageiculture inthe Economy
2.03     The importance of agriculture in the Egyptian economy changed
significantly during the 1970s. Historically, agriculture was the dominant
sector, providing the bulk of employment and output, and crucial to foreign
exchange earnings and receiving substantial budgetary support. The sector's
vital role was reinforced by its strong performance during the 1952-70
period. During the 1960s, agricultural production grew at over 31
annually-an exceptional performance. given the relatively high base level.
2.04     In the 1970s, the pace of growth declined to around 21.  Given that
the high growth rates of the previous decade included the impact of controlled
releases of water from Aswan, this does not reflect a significant change in
the underlying growth trend and is still an impressive performance. However,
other factors accentuated the slowdown in agricultural growth: first,
population continued to grow at over 2.51; second, per capita income grew very
rapidly, and third, consumer prices for foodstuffs held to extremely low
levels compounded the demand increases generated by the first two factors.
2.05     The net effect of these trends is summarized in Table 2.1:

Aricultural Constraints
2.06     Three primary constraints to agricuitural growth are: (i) the very
limited availability of agricultural land; (ii) the difficult situation with
respect to the water table and soil salinity, and (iii) weaknesses in the
institutions responsible for providing agricultural support services. In
addition, outmigration of agricultural labor-both to cities and abroad--has
resulted in labor shortages at times of peak demand. Further, the Government
intervenes significantly to affect cropping patterns and procurement prices,
causing distortions in the relative prices of products, and generally
depressing the level of farm incomes. However, in the last two years,
Government has increased the prices of some agricultural commodities, with a
view to providing improved incentives to producers.
2.07     The land constraint is exacerbated by rapid urban encroachment into
farm land estimated at 20,000-40,000 fed/year, and by falling productivity,
and eventual loss of land, due to waterlogging and salinity. Institutional
constraints are important because the prime source of agricultural growth will
continue to be the old lands, where productivity is already relatively high,
requiring sophisticated, well-organized, and high quality supporting services,
particularly extension. Constraints of a general nature include overlapping
responsibilities among Ministries, low public sector pay scales, and excessive
governmental intervention into pricing and marketing arrangements; more
specific issues are the limited availability of high quality seeds, the lack
of coomunications between researcher and farmer, and the inadequate operation,
and poor maintenance of the irrigation system.
2.08     The labor constraint is difficult to quantify.  Undoubtedly. there
are labor shortages at times of peak agricultural demand. manifested by high
and rapidly rising wage rates. The main contributory factors appear to be the
migration of rural labor to urban areas and other countries in the Middle
East, and the impact of remittances on work incentives for agricultural labor.



-4-
Goverment Policies
2.09     These constraints, and the growing gap between agricultural
production and consumption, are only partially addressed in the current plan
(1982183-1986/87) allocations 1/. The gross allocation to the sector shows an
increase (from 8Z to 131) in the proportion of total investment provided to
agriculture as compared to the late 1970s. However, more than half of this
amount is for new lands development-an activity which directly addresses the
primary constraint of land scarcity, but which has been markedly unsuccessful
in the past, and does not seem to be justified in most instances, on technical
or economic criteria. Further, if a large program of this nature is
undertaken without a careful assessment of viability in each instance, it will
compete with existing irrigation for the limited water resources. Of the
residual investment in the sector, drainage -s appropriately the largest
single item (about 301).
2.10     Agricultural Supporting Services, which include research, extension
and input supply, account for only a small percentage of the investment plan,
although increases in yield and cropping intensity represent a direct
alternative to new land development. In January 1983, research and extension
services were integrated under the overall direction of the Agricultural
Research Center (ARC) The objective was to ensure better coordination of the
two activities, improve quality of advice to farmers, and improve relevance of
research work. However, in practice, this reorganization did not yield the
expected improvements in inter-service relationships and, in early 1985, a
Ministerial Decree returned the extension service to central MOA control under
an Undersecretary. MOA proposes to maintain and strengthen the
interrelationships between extension and research by regular interaction
between extension and research officials at all levels. Furthermore, MOA has,
by Decree, established the extension function as separate but coordinated with
agricultural regulatory affairs at governorate level and below. By placing
the extension service under an Undersecretary having specific responsibility
for extension affairs, the extension service will be in a much stronger
position to develop effectively, unencumbered by regulatory functions, and yet
maintaining close relationships with the research service at all levels. In
addition, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has taken action through two
International Fund for Agricultural Developement (IFAD) projects-Minya and
Fayoum Agricultural Development Projects (appraised and supervised by the
Bank)-to divide the current agricultural service activities into
regulatory/administrative functions on the one hand, and purely advisory
(i.e., extension) functions on the other. MOA also plans to extend this
principle to six governorates in the Delta under the Second Agricultural
Development Project proposed for Bank financing (para. 3.22). The effects of
these recent changes remain to be demonstrated but the Egyptian Major Cereals
Improvement Project (EMCIP) and the Rice Research and Training Project (para.
3.24), supported by the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID), have shown that very large gains in productivity can be attained.
Under both these projects, substantial yield increases have been achieved over
large areas, and it is now clear that Egyptian agro-climatic conditions are
suitable for even higher yield levels.
2.11    Agricultural credit and inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and

pesticides are currently supplied to the farmer through the Governorate level
Banks for Development and Agricultural Credit (BDACs). Inputs are often
provided on credit and their costs are deducted from the amount due to the
farmer from sale of compulsory quota crops, such as, cotton and wheat. While
highly developed and widely available, the current structure of these services
does not provide the farmer with much choice among alternative channels and
often leads to parallel markets for inputs which are, at official prices, in
short supply. Inpuas. supply services were provided by the village cooperatives
up to 1977, and there are currently plans to reactivate that system in
addition to allowing increased private sector participation in input
marketing.
Bank Involvement in the Sector
2.12     Past Bank Group operations in the sector have sought to address major
elements in the development strategy. The Bank serves as the executing agency
for a UNDP-financed project (EGY/84/007) for drawing up a master plan for
water development and use. The major component of Bank lending, in terms of
number of projects and resources committed, has been a series of four drainage
projects (see para. 2.25 for details) covering 2.2 million fed of irrigated
area. The ongoing Irrigation Pumping Stations Rehabilitation Project (Loan
2270-EGT) is the first phase of a national program to prevent crop losses due
to drainage/irrigation pump failures and to strengthen the institution
responsible for pumping stations. In this context, the Bank has also drawn
attention to the important problem of inadequate maintenance in the drainage
and irrigation projects and, as a result, the Government is now engaged in the
preparation of a detailed plan, which is proposed to be partly financed by a
future Bank operation (para. 2.24). The New Lands Development Project - West
Nubariya (Credit 1083-ECT) became effective in October 1981, and involves the
reclamation of 24,0CC fed desert land and settlement of 4,000 smallholders,
with provision of infrastructure, social services and production facilities.
2.13     In the two IFAD Projects 1/, for which the Bank acts as supervisory
agency, emphasis is given to research and extension services. The
IDA-financed first Agricultural Development Project (Credit 830-EGT) sought,
as a pilot project, tc raise productivity in two governorates, by improving
the standard of farm mechanization and strengthening agricultural credit,
cooperatives and extension services. Despite initial difficulties, progress
has been made with the project, leading to a proposed second project. The
Fruit and Vegetables Project (Loan 1276-EGT) includes a variety of
components-credit to fruit and vegetable processors and exporters,
construction of the West Nubariya Drain, and a seed farm. This project has
also been satisfactorily completed, except for the development of the seed
farm.
2.14     Other agricultural projects financed by IDA/Bank include the
Agroindustries I and II Projects (Credit 988-EGT and Loan 2243-EGT), and the
Fish Farming Project (Credit llll-EGT). The Technical Assistance Project
(Credit 1162-ECT) was designed to help government develop an institutional
capacity to undertake planning, feasibility and engineering studies for
agricultural projects; as a result, suitably equipped project preparation
units have now been established in the Ministries of Irrigation and Lanc
Reclamation.

2.15    The main elements of Bank Group involvement in the sector have
focused directly on the principal problem of maintaining and improving
productivity in the old lands. In turn, this has improved the efficiency of
the major organization involved, the EPADP. For the future, this emphasis
should be broadened to improve supporting services in these areas, namely,
improved research and extension, higher quality inputs, and better water
management.
Aspects of the possible involvement of the Bank in the sector are being
discussed by the Bank from time to time, with the Egyptian authorities, in the
context of broader issues relating to the country's agricultural development
strategy and with reference to the role of other sources of external financing.
C. Irigation and Drainage Subsector
Irrigation and Drainage Facilities
2.16    Nile Irrigation Sytem:  The system which exists today in Egypt has
evolved since 1861 and generates most of the nation's agricultural output.
Extending to some 1,200 km below Aswan to the Mediterranean Sea, the system
consists of two storage dams at Aswan, seven major barrages on the Nile that
divert water into canals. and 31,000 km of canals encompassing 6.4 M fed in 50
command areas.  The system is expanding.  Some 0.9 M fed of irrigated land
(mostly old-new lands) are at higher elevations, served by 178 main and 282
minor pump stations.
2.17     The canal system is operated and maintained by the Irrigation Sector
of the MOI, and its Mechanical and Electrical Department (MED) maintains all
pumping facilities (see Annex 2, Chart 3, World Bank - 26976 for MOI General
Organization). The canals deliver water into meskas which are channels
serving 100 to 300 fed. Meskas, in turn, feed marwas, which are farm ditches
serving 10 to 100 fed. The iaeska and marwa systems are owned, operated and
maintained by farmers.
2.18     The overall irrigation system iD Egypt is unique.  The water comes
from a single source, the Upper Nile, and its availability to the system is
controlled at a single point, the HAD. Amounts of water delivered into canals
are controlled by channel levels rather than by flow measurements. The water
distribution and use by farmers takes place within a complex framework of
rotation based on a canal system, coupled with rotation among farmers at the
meska level. Most farmers in old lands receive water in the meskas typically
one-half meter (m) below the elevation of the fields, and pump it from there
to the marwas using animal driven sakias (water wheels) or engine powered
pumps.
2.19    The operation of the system by MOI is a vast undertaking involving
the storage, release, diversion and conveyance of some 56,000 M cubic meters
(m3) of water/year. The MOI regulates water supply to each canal command,
normally based on monthly water indents prepared jointly by the regional
offices of M0I and MOA. For irrigation, the peak demand at diversion point
varies from 25 to 40 m3/day/fed, depending on climatic conditions, soil
characteristics, crops and acreages in the area and efficiency of the
irrigation system. In general, the water allocation rules are equitable.
Since the HAD was commissioned, the supply of water has generally been
sufficient to enable the farmers to achieve close to 200Z cropping intensity.



2.20     Drainage System.  The drainage system for removing excess water from
cultivated lands consists of open drains, tile drains and pump stations. The
open drain system, built mostly between early 1900s-1965, serves almost 5.5 M
fed (mostly old lands) and consists of 16,200 km of open channels.  Since the
late 1960s, GOE has initiated a series of tile drainage projects to relieve
Egypt's waterlogging and salinity problems. In accordance with an agreement
reached with IDA, a Presidential Decree, issued in 1973, established EPADP as
a single unit, centrally controlled enterprise under the jurisdiction of MOI,
with responsibility for executing all drainage works in Egypt (para. 7.01).
With continuing support from the Bank to the drainage program and the EPADP,
the rate of development has increased, and EPADP has become one of the
strongest institution in the agriculture sector.   As of June 1984, some 2.6 M
fed have been provided with subsurface drainage and improved open drain
systems. This figure is increasing annually at about 170,000 to 200,000 fed.
The drainage operation requires pump stations at various locations. There are
currently 73 main and 23 minor pump stations devoted to pumping drainage
effluent.
2.21     In areas where tile drains have been installed, EPADP is responsible
for maintaining both surface (excepting main drains) and subsurface drains
(para. 7.01). Open drains in other areas and all main drains are maintained
by the Irrigation Sector on the same basis as irrigation canals. As in the
case of irrigation, all drainage pump stations operate under the
responsibility of MED.
Problems Associated with Irlgation and Drainame
2.22     Irrigation.  The most pressing problems confronting Egypt's canal
system are limited control provided by structures, many of which are only
partially functional, and inadequate system operation. The MOI, with
assistance from USAID, has undertaken a major effort to address these
problems. The main elements of USAID's Irrigation Management Systems Project
(IMSP) 1/ include rehabilitation or replacement of deteriorated structures
throughout the canal system and a telemetry network to provide water level
data from about 200 locations. The structures improvement program began in
1982, and is scheduled for completion by 1988. The data provided by the
telemetry system will be compared with requirements and then fed as input into
the Lake Nasser 2/ Simulation Model and the Operating Distribution Model to
calculate future operating strategies for the system.
2.23     Drainage.  In non-tiled areas, open drains still operate in their
original form to maintain the water level 1.5 m below the ground surface.
This restrictive design and the absence of field drains limit their capability
to have a significant effect on the water table. Therefore, the continuous
and expanding use of Nile water for irrigation has resulted in a gradual rise
in the groundwater table, bringing with it critical problems of waterlogging
and salinity in most areas which do not have subsurface drainage to control
depth of water table. A predrainage survey carried out in 1984 (para. 3.09)
showed that waterlogging is widespread throughout the northern parts of the
Delta and is a problem in some scattered areas in Upper Egypt. Thus, GOE is
continuing to give high priority to its drainage program (para. 2.09).
2.24     Maintenance of Canals and Open Drains.  The problem relates both to

the size of the system and also to the agro-climatic conditions which
encourage profuse weed growth in open channels. Maintenance standards and
techniques are to be improved under a separate, coordinated program of the
MOI. The PPD in the MOI is preparing a comprehensive Channel Maintenance Plan
(CMP), as agreed with the Bank in March 1984. In preparing the Plan, the PPD
has taken expert advice on the usefulness and safety of applying chemical
controls and methods. CMP would include an assessment of current maintenance
needs. This work has benefitted from an evaluation of Operation and
Maintenance (O&M) for the Gharbia Directorate performed in 1983 by PPD as part
of IMSP. CMP would also include: (a) a schedule of channel maintenance work;
(b) capability of equipment available with mechanized companies of MOI; (c)
equipment and supplies needed to carry out the plan; (d) cost estimates for 5
to 10 years, and (e) design of a program for monitoring the maintenance
operations. A supporting Irrigation and Drain Maintenance Project is expected
to be prepared, with assistance from FAO/CP, by the end of 1985, and is to be
considered for Bank financing in FY87.
PreviLous Bank Involvement in Dmainage
2.25     The Bank Group's involvement with drainage in Egypt was initiated in
December 1970 under the Nile Delta Drainage I Project(credit 181-UAR for
US$26 M). That project, the first IDA operation in the agriculture sector,
covered the improvement of drainage on 950,000 fed. Subsequently, three more
projects were approved for drainage improvement: the Upper Egypt I (Credit
393-UAR for US$36 M), the Upper Egypt II (Credit/Loan 637/1285-EGT for
US$50 M), and the Nile Delta II (Credit/Loan 719/1439-40-EGT for US$66 M). In
total, IDA has allocated US$129 M for the drainage program and. the Bank
US$49 M. The total area covered by the Bank Group supported projects is 2.56
M fed (47Z of old lands) for open drains, and 2.15 M fed (40Z of old lands)
for tile drains. In addition, these projects provided for the construction of
22 new pump stations and rehabilitation of 2 existing stations.
2.26     The IDA/Bank participation in the drainage program has helped attract
the support of other donors, such as, USAID (US$30 M for the Upper Egypt II
Project) and the Federal Republic of Germany (US$24 M for the Nile Delta II
Project). The Dutch bilateral program has contributed over US$4 M for
technical assistance (para. 7.05) and for establishing a tile drainage project
on 40,000 fed.
2.27     Implementation delays of three to four years have been common to all
of the Bank Group-supported drainage projects. The earlier projects were
affected by the 1973 war and its aftermath. Additionally, start-up delays,
management problems and overly optimistic appraisal assumptions were the
underlying factors in all four projects. The weakness of public sector
contractors and delays in installing tile drainage have been particular
problems with the later projects. Table 2.1 shows the current status and
schedule for completing field drainage in ongoing projects:

2.28     Closing dates for both projects have been extended by two years
(Upper Egypt Drainage II, June 1985; Nile Delta Drainage II, December 1985).
Despite delays in implementation, the estimated rates of return are not
expected to be much lower than anticipated because for each drainage catchment
an operationally independent subproject can be built, and benefits normally
become available immediately upon completion of each subproject rather than on
completion of the total project. Post evaluation 1/ of the Nile Delta I
Project indicated an Economic Rate of Return (ERR) of 17-25% compared to
appraisaL estimate of 18%. For the Upper Egypt I Project 2/, though no
precise estimate of ERR was made, it was concluded that only a 5Z incremental
yield was Lcquired to assure a satisfactory rate of return. EPADP's
time-series data for about 35% of the project area reported yield increases,
after drainage, of 9% for both wheat and cotton, and 15% for maize.
2.29     The proposed Project would be the fifth in the series of drainage
projects. The principal lessons derived from past experience in drainage
projects in Egypt-the need for selectivity, realistic planning, site-specific
designs, and maintainance of the system and monitoring performance-have been
brought out in the Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs) 31 of the first
two projects. These factors, together with supervision experience in ongoing
projects, have been taken into account in formulating the design for the
proposed project. The more significant of such features are: (a) introduction
of technical criteria for selection of areas most in need of drainage; (b)
spacing of field drains on site-specific conditions; (c) improvements in
technical designs, including modified layout for rice areas; (d) agreement on
more realistic implementation goals, based on recent experience; (e) increased
attention to construction management and quality control; (f) effective
monitoring of the effects of drainage on water table, soil salinity and crop
yield, and (g) more effective maintenance of project facilities.

agreement with GOE to finance an Integrated Soil and Water Improvement Project
(ISAWIP) covering 80,000 fed in Gharbia Governorate (see Map, IBRD 18733).
Total project cost for the five-year implementation period is estimated at
US$57 M equivalent, of which CIDA's contribution would be about US$31 M
equivalent. The project, as planned, consists of an integrated package of
eight components, including remodelling of open drains and installation of
field drains in 50,000 fed, and the construction of a polyethelene pipe
factory for producing drainage collector pipes. For the drainage component,
the ERR is estimated at about 21Z. Three test areas would be established
under the project for monitoring of results and evaluating the project impact.
2.31     The Hamoul Drainage and Soil Improvement Project, approved by the
European Economic Community, covcrs 65,000 fed reclaimed from Lake Burullus in
the early sixties. The project area is located in Kafr el Sheikh Governorate,
north of the proposed program areas (see para. 4.02 and Map, IBRD 18733). The
five-year project includes ditching and land improvement works in 30,000 fed,
installation of pipe drains in 35,000 fed and improvement of irrigation
infrastructure. Total project cost in 1981 prices amounts to US$40 M
equivalent. The ERR of the pipe drainage program is estimated at 25%.
ILL PROGRAM AND PROJECT AREA
Physical Features
3.01     Location.  The proposed project would form a part of EPADP's 10-Year
Program of drainage works (para. 1.04) which covers a gross (total physical)
area of 1.33 M fed. The areas encompassed by both the Program and the project
are located in four Governorates in the Delta, namely, Sharkiya, Daqahliya,
Kafr el Sheikh and Beheira, and four Governorates in Upper Egypt: Giza, Beni
Suef, Fayoum and Minya. Details of drainage catchment areas for both the
Program and the project are given in Annex 3 (Table 3) and their boundaries
are shown on two Maps, IBRD 18733 and 18734.
3.02     The project area comprises 465,000 gross fed, of which the major
part, 381,000 fed (82%), is located in 11 drainage basirs in the east, west
and central parts of the Delta. The remaining 84,000 fed is distributed in 9
catchment areas in Upper Egypt, extending from Giza near Cairo to Minya, about
200 km south. The project area has been selected on grounds of both drainage
need, and the logistical requirements which would lend to a cost effective
construction program (para. 4.09).
3.03     Climate.  The climate in the area is warm and dry, with a mild winter
extending from November to March, and a hot sulnier from May to September. It
supports a continuous growing season for irrigated crops. The mean monthly
temperature in the Delta area ranges between 11.9°C and 26.6°C, while in Upper
Egypt the range is 12.3°C to 28.5°C. Annual rainfall tends to decrease inland
from approximately 120 millimeters (mm) along the northern coastal area, to
about 78 mm at Kafr el Sheikh, located at the center of the Delta area, to
around 26 mm at Giza. South of Giza, precipitation is negligible. Relative
humidity is surprisingly high for an arid region, ranging from 52% to 75% in
the Delta area and 36% to 58% in Upper Egypt.
3.04     Topography and Soils.  The topography of the valley of che Nile and
its delta is generally very flat from south to north, and somewhat more
pronounced from both east and west towards the river. From Aswan to the

Mediterranean Sea, average slope is 1 in 13,000 or about 8 centimeters
(cm)/km. Natural drainage under the best of circumstances is very slow, even
though the soils have a thick base of permeable sands and gravel.
3.05     Most of the soils are of recent alluvial origin and, when adequately
drained and managed, are highly productive. In the Delta areas, the alluvium
veries from light to heavy clay, with the heavier clay occurring toward the
north. Exceptions to the dominance of clay can be found along the Damietta
Branch of the Nile and scattered throughout the middle Delta where silty clay
and sandy clay loams occur. Other exceptions are along the desert fringes
where fine sandy layers occur in small patches in the Western Delta and
scattered subdeltaic deposits of sandy soils underlie silty sand and silty
clay in the Eastern Delta. The soils in the north and northwest part of the
Delta are composed of marine alluvium. There are heavy clays in the Lake Idku
region, and clays to silty clays to a depth of 50 to 120 cm, above marine
shells mixed with sand and clay near Lake Maryut. In Upper Egypt areas, the
recent alluvium is mostly clay to clay loam.
3.06     Canal System and Irrigation Water Supplies.  The areas in need of
drainage in Upper Egypt are in the command of Assiut Barrage, which is 360 km
south of Cairo (see Map, IBRD 18734). Each sub-area is served by a network of
irrigation canals and open drains. The areas located in Lower Egypt are
commanded by Delta, Zifta and Edfina Barrages, which are located respectively
25, 78 and 198 km north of Cairo (see Map, IBRD 18733). A complex network of
main and feeder canals, irrigation channels, and main and branch drains serves
these areas. Table 3.1 summarizes the data on canals and open drains in the
Delta, broken down by Governorates.

3.07     Irrigation supplies in the Delta area range between 6,800 to 8,900
m3/year/fed (for cropping intensity close to 200%) in lafr el Sheikh and
Beheira respectively. Irrigation supplies higher than the Delta are generally
used in Upper Egypt with the exception of Fayoum Governorate where it averages
about 6,400 m3/year/fed. The peak demand during summer varies from 25 to 40
m /day/fed.
3.08     The considerable land slope enables water to be distributed by
gravity in the Fayoum Basin, and water supply is continuous, 24 hours, seven



- 12 -
days/week operation. This feature is unique in Egypt (para. 2.18).
Elsewhere, water is distributed by irrigation channels on a rotation basis.
Rotations vary with crop and soil, but generally are: 7 days on/7 days off in
summer, 7 days on/14 days off, in winter, and 4 days on/4 days off for rice.
Despite some shortcomings of the canal system (para. 2.22) in effectively
controlling water supply, its performance is manifest in achieving 190-200%
cropping intensities and generally high yields at reasonable conveyance
efficiencies (over 60%).
3.09     Groundwater Conditions and Soil Salinity.  In order to select areas
to be drained on a more methodical basis than in earlier projects, the Field
Investigation and Design Division (FIDD) of EPADP carried out reconnaissance
investigations in 1984 to identify areas which had high water tables; at the
same time, the soil salinity status was established and hydraulic permeability
measurements were made. A total of 2,800 groundwater depth determinations
were made in the Delta and Nile Valley, according to a plan designed to avoid
bias due to fluctuations in the water table. This work also benefitted from,
and was improved by, some detailed investigations carried out for field
drainage designs in a few selected areas. The results of the investigations
were plotted on 1:100,000 and 1:150,000 scale plans by EPADP/PPD and are given
in Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2. The plots showed that in the Delta area a
generally high water table of 100 cm or less below the ground level occurred
in all the drainage catchment areas being included for the program. In the
Nile Valley, the situation is less severe, but some areas in the Governorates
of Giza, Beni Suef, Fayoum and Minya do suffer from a high water table
problem.  In other areas, an acceptable depth to water table was found,
particularly in the Governorates south of Minya.
3.10     The Delta showed large areas of moderate soil salinity (below 6
m.mhoslcm) with some areas, particularly in the more northern catchments,
having soil salinity levels which could seriously affect crop yields (see
Annex 3, Table 1). The soil salinity status in the Nile Valley could not be
established clearly during appraisal since determinations of soil salinity
were not available for many of the areas considered at that time.
Nevertheless, some indication was given from the groundwater salinity
determinations. In view of the known relation between raised soil salinity
levels and groundwater salinity, it appears that salinity is presently not a
great hazard in the Nile Valley. On the basis of these data, areas where the
water table and soil salinity status did not impede crop production were
excluded from the program.
3.11     Hydraulic Permeability of the Soils.  The hydrauLic permeability of
the soils varies from less than 10 cm/day in heavy soils to 50 cm/day, or
sometimes considerably more, in lighter soils. Soils having a low to very low
permeability predominate, especially in the east and middle parts of the
Delta. The results of permeability measurements by drainage catchment are
presented in Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2.
3.12     Drainage PumPing Stations.  Of the 31 pumping stations in the Delta
devoted to pumping drainage water from the areas included in the 10-Year



- 13 -
Program, only 11 evacuate drainage water from the project area (see Annex 3,
Table 3, for catchments served by pumping stations). These pumping stations
are in the northern part of the Delta and generally discharge the drainage
effluent into the sea or into coastal lakes. They, vary in age from some built
in 1954 to those that are just being completed. The effective operation and
maintenance (O&M) of these pumping stations would be crucial to the success of
subsurface drainage in the Delta.
Demographic Features, Farm Size and Land Tenure
3.13     Rural Population.  About 530,000 farms are planned to be covered by
the 10-Year Program. Of these, about 139,000 farms would derive benefit
during the project period (Annex 6, Table 8). The total farm population
involved in the whole Program is estimated to be 2.6 M, and about 828,000 of
the rural population would directly benefit from the project.
3.14     Land Tenure and Farm Size.  Under the Agrarian Reform Laws which
followed the 1952 revolution, some 1 M fed were redistributed to those having
little or no land, and farm size was limited to 50 fed for an individual and
100 fed for a family of three. In practice, holdings are much smaller (90%
are less than 5 fed, 40% less than 1 fed). In the proposed project areas, the
average net farm size is 3.1 fed in the Delta and 2.1 fed in Upper Egypt
(Annex 5, Table 8). Fragmentation of holdings has become an important
characteristic of agriculture in Egypt: in the last three decades in the
project area in the Delta, the number of owners has increased from 78,000 to
218,000. Similarly, in Upper Egypt, the average number of owners increased
from 45,000 to 143,000 during the same period.
3.15     Land leasing is common and is the major factor in land
consolidation. Whereas there is no formal land consolidation program, a
benefit of Government's annual crop consolidation plan is that it allows large
contiguous areas of the major crops to be grown by individual farmer (para.
3.17). The average ownership holding is less than 2 fed but the average farm
size, including land leased in, is 3 fed. Approximately 50% of all land under
cultivation is farmed under some type of leasehold arrangement.
Agricultural Production
3.16     Cropping Patterns and Cropping Intensities.  The cropping pattern in
Egypt is affected by a number of factors including Government quotas, farmer's
food needs and degree of commercialization, as well as soil and climate
limitations. The most common practice followed in the Delta and Upper Egypt
is the three-year rotation based on three major crops-cotton, full-term
berseem (Egyotian clover) and wheat--each of which occupies the land for about
5 to 7 months. These three crops are planted in the same plot once every
three years, interspersed with broad beans, rice and maize. The dominant
cropping rotation is thus as shown in Table 3.2:

6                             Maize/Rice
3.17     Cotton, wheat and rice are usually farmed in large contiguous blocks
arranged at the village level by the cooperatives, thereby making farm
operations more efficient. Farmers often own land in each of the major crop
blocks. All farms also grow other cash crops, especially vegetables, and most
farms also have some perennial crops, mainly sugarcane in Upp"'r Egypt and
citrus in the Delta (grapes are also important in West Delta). There is some
regional specialization governed mainly by climate, soil conditions and water
availability. In Upper Egypt, berseem may be replaced by beans and lentils as
the winter crop and, during the summer, sorghum may be planted instead of
maize in the hotter areas.  In the northern part of the Delta, where the
required amount of water is available and incidence of waterlogging is high,
rice replaces maize in the crop rotation.
3.18     The cropping pattern in the project area varies within and between
districts in the Delta as well as from that in Upper Egypt. A representative
cropping pattern, followed in the project areas, is presented in Table 3.3:

3.19     Agricultural Inputs and Services.  Agricultural inputs (seeds,
fertilizers, pesticides) are supplied to the farmer through the local BDAC
which also provides credit (para. 2.11). The network of supply points is well
developed throughout the area.
3.220    The extension service has recently been placed under an
Undersecretary in MOA (para. 2.10), and the regulatory and extension services
have been bifurcated whilst retaining close working level interrelationships.
Similarly, close interrelationships between extension and research will be
fostered at all levels. In the Governorates of Minya and Fayoum, the
extension services are being improved under IFAD-financed projects (para.
3.22).



- 15 -
3.21     Yields and Production.  Average yields in Egypt generally exceed the
world averages.   Some crops such as rice and sugarcane have average yields
that are the highest in the developing world. Soils have a high potential,
water is of good quality and the climate is highly favorable for all crops
that are grown; indeed, if Egyptian yields are compared to regions in other
countries with similar climate and irrigation supplies, it is clear that very
substantial increases in yield are possible with known technology. The
average yields and production for each area are presented in Annex 5 Table 1.
Projects Impacting on Drainage V Project
3.22     Three IFAD and Bank supported projects that will have a strong
influence on agricultural developement in the project area are the Minya
Agricultural Development Project (IFAD Loan 114-EG), the Fayoum Agricultural
Development Project (IFAD Loan 157-EG) and the proposed Second Agricultural
Development Project, being processed for Bank financing (para. 2.10). The
first two projects have, as their main focus, the promotion of governorate
level agricultural development, especially through improved extension,
research and credit services. Research would be strengthened and extension
service reorganized using the Training and Visit (T & V) system. The Second
Agricultural Development Project would be carried out in seven governorates
(Sharkiya, Daqahliya, Kafr el Sheikh, Beheira, Fayoum, Damietta and Gharbiya
of which the first five are involved in the Drainage V Project), concentrating
on the introduction of improved technological packages, including farm
mechanization, and their timely application. Since the drainage program is
principally concerned with the alleviation of a physical soil constraint,
projects aimed at removing constraints related to lack of knowledge and inputs
as well as adoption of technology by farmers are complementary and reinforcing.
3.23     Aside from the above projects, there are several MOA/USAID programs
that are also complementary to, and supportive of, the proposed Drainage V
Project. These projects are mentioned briefly below; details may be found in
the project file.
3.24     Under crop production, perhaps the most significant programs in the
country are the Rice Research and Training Project, the EMCIP and the
Agricultural Development Systems Project. The first project which began in
1978 has provided new information on rice production, seed processing and
storage. A National Rice Institute at Sakha (near Kafr el Sheikh) is being
established under that project. The field demonstrations and techniques
employed there have proven to be highly effective in terms of farmers'
adoption of technical packages. The EMCIP program is expected to improve
production yields for cereal grains (wheat, maize, sorghum and barley), food
legumes and forage crops. Progress so far has been good, based on procedures
shown to be effective in the rice project (para. 2.10). The Agricultural
Development Systems Project is providing technical assistance for a range of
agricultural activities, alongside field demonstration of horticultural crops.
IV. THE 10-YEAR DRAINAGE PROGRAM AND ITS PHASING
4.01     Egypt's investments in drainage have, until now, been on a project by
project basis, and long-term planning of staffing and equipment have



- 16 -
consequently been hampered.  To overcome this problem, MOI has drawn up a
10-Year Investment Program (para. 1.04) based on pre-drainage surveys (para.
3.09). The proposed project comprises the first pk.se of this Program.
Hence, the qbjectives, criteria for selection of areas, initial phasing, and
technical alternatives are generally common to the Program and the proposed
project.
Objectives and SeoPe
4.02     The main objectives of the Drainage Program at full development would
be: (a) to increase agricultural productivity on 1.12 M fed net area (1.33 M
fed gross area-see Annex 3, Table 3, for area by catchment, and Maps, IBRD
18733 and 18734, for location of catchments) by providing adequate drainage
infrastructure for the area to improve its drainability, and (b) to transport
excess water and salt out of the area, thus reversing deterio.ation of the
land resource base. Of the total net area, about 1 M fed are located in the
northern parts of the Delta and 120,000 fed in Upper Egypt. These objectives
would be achieved by: (a) lowering the water table through the installation of
subsurface field and collector drains; (b) improving the open drains disposal
system for removal of drainage effluent, and (c) ensuring that the drainage
pumping stations (para. 3.12) are of adequate capacity and are efficiently
operated and maintained. Concurrently, the Program provides for the
strengthening of EPADP to improve design, supervision, and management
activities, with particular emphasis on improvement of monitoring and
evaluation (MLE) and maintenance.
SL.-eeties of Areas
4.03     The primary guide for selecting areas for subsurface drainage is a
consideration of the closeness of the water table to the ground surface.
Where it is less than 1 m, its effect is to depress crop yields. This is
caused by saturation of a part of the root zone and, in most cases, by an
increase in soil salinity.
4.04     During the 1984 investigations for depth to water table and soil
salinity (paras. 3.09 and 3.10), EPADP surveyed some 1.2 M fed in the Delta
and 0.5 M fed in Upper Egypt. The mean sampling density was one
observation/2,600 fed. Based on these investigations, and on the criteria for
selection of areas suggested by FAO/CP, EPADP proposed to include in the
10-year program 1.2 N fed in the Delta and 0.3 M fed in Upper Egypt. Whilst
the area surveyed in the Delta is characterized by waterlogging and salinity
in varying degrees, the area requiring drainage in Upper Egypt was further
reduced to 144,000 fed by applying more appropriate technical criteria (para.
4.05). Details of the 1.33 M fed, now forming part of the Program, are shown
in Annex 3, Table 3.
4.05     The technical criteria for final selection of areas include the
following: (a) at least 75Z of an area to be tile drained shall be shown by
site investigation (uniform sampling density for both water table and soil
salinity at one observation/1,000 fed) to have a water table closer to the
ground surface than 100 cm, and (b) high priority to be given in such cases
where the soil salinity is shown by field sampling and laboratory
determination to be above 4 m. mhos/cm at 25-C saturated soil extract, using
composite samples over depth of 0 to 50 cm. It will generally be desirable to
assess the depth to water table in rice areas during the winter, and to take



- 17 -
repeated measurements in areas where significant seasonal fluctuations of
water table may be expected.
Phasing of Prorm
4.06     A study of depth to water table plans (para. 3.09) identified 40
drainage catchments totalling 1.33 M fed with a generally high water table.
Following this, the catchments which needed priority drainage were ranked
according to their soil salinity status. The establishment of a work site is
a considerable undertaking, and it is thus not realistic to implement drainage
works in small, scattered patches. These practical considerations have also
been taken into account in the phasing of the Program (para. 4.09).
4.07     Drain spacing and the need for envelope material, as hydraulic
conductivity of the soils varies, are the prime determinants of cost/fed.
Based on the measurements of hydraulic permeability, drainable surplus (1.0 to
1.2 mm/day) and an average 1.4 m required depth of tile drains, the computed
drain spacings range from 20 to 80 m in most drainage catchments. The
weighted average drain spacing for the program areas is about 50 m for both
Upper Egypt and the Delta. Within the Delta, the average spacings are about
60. 45 and 40 m for East, Middle and West Delta sub-areas respectively. In
Egyptian soils, gravel envelope of required grading, dependent upon soil type,
is used generally around field drains for spacings of 60 m or more, or where
unstable soils are encountered at drain depth. This practice is based upon
the criteria laid down in 1978 by the Dutch-Egyptian Panel on Land Drainage
(;:ara. 7.05) that in soils where the clay content exceeds 401, field drains
may be laid without any cwvolopc material.  In 1984, the Panel confirmed
technical acceptability of this criteria based on review of: (a) results in
experimental areas; (b) reports made by various experts on the use of envelope
material in Egyptian soils; (c) aggregate stability of clayey soils in the
Nile Valley, and {d) performance of systems installed without envelope
material.
4.08     The cost of installing field drains at 50 m spacing is about
LE 250/fed. Table 4.1 illustrates the cost variations attributable to
variation in drain spacing:
Table 4.1: Comparison of Subsurface Draie Co6t
---  Without Envelope-    ---With Envelope---
Drain Spacing (m)         20     30     40     50      60     70     80
Cost LE/fed              310    276    259    250    258    250    246
Z variation (compared
to 50 m spacing)         +24.0  +10.4   +3.6    -      +3.2    -     -1.6
The above figures show that the cost of installing tile drains in the various
parts of the Delta and in Upper Egypt would rarely exceed LE 275/fed.
4.09     The Program has been formulated within the limitations imposed by the
feasible rate of implementation. The main consideration in scheduling the



- 18 -
amount of development to take place annually was EPADP's current
implementation capability of about 200,000 fed/year. Allowance for the demand
from other projects (paras. 2.30 and 2.31) reduced the expected implementation
rate for the Program in its early years to about 170,000 gross fed/year. Most
areas selected for development during the initial years are those which had
already been provided with remodelled open drains. This approach would ensure
that benefits from investments already made would not be delayed. Further, a
suitable combination of drainage contracts was planned (see Annex 3, Charts 1
and 2, World Bank - 26974 and 26978) to ensure that the letting of contracts
would be consistent with the provision of construction equipment
economically. Other main considerations were that: (a) completion of ongoing
projects (para. 2.27) should not conflict with the program objectives; (b) the
existing pumping stations (para. 3.12) should be fully operational; (c) under
the ongoing programs, construction of new and rehabilitation of existing
pumping stations should take place, and (d) where necessary, prior remodelling
of open drains should be carried out in a cost effective manner. Furthermore,
the proposed Program takes into account the time required for planning and
design, and a realistic assessment of administrative and financing needs.
Evaluation of Teehnical Alternatives
4.10     There are two alternative methods which could be used to alleviate
the rising water table in the Program areas. These are closely-spaced open
drains, and drainage by deep wells (vertical drainage).
4.11     Closely-spaced open drains, although a technically feasible
alternative, cannot be used in the Program area because farmers would lose 10
to 15% of land from their already very small holdings (para. 3.14). Such a
system would cost about US$250/fed for land acquisition alone and would thus
be a costlier alternative. In addition, it would take about 150,000 fed out
of production and increase the problem of open drain maintenance which is
currently not being handled efficiently. This alternative, therefore, is not
acceptable.
4.12     Vertical drainage, where practicable, would involve annualized
cost/fed which would be comparable to that for tile drainage. With fully
integrated use of groundwater and surface water in the zones with usable deep
groundwater, vertical drainage might ultimately prove to be a better solution
than tile drainage. Its feasibility, however, would depend on evaluation of
additional data to be collected, and on the possibility of using the pumped
effluent.
4.13     Vertical drainage cannot be considered as an alternative to tile
drainage in 1.2 M fed in the Northern Delta because of high groundwater
salinity and thickness of clay cap, and hence low economic and technical
viability. Furthermore, groundwater pumping in some of the areas would induce
sea water intrusion into the aquifer. In the Valley, about 840,000 fed have
already been provided with subsurface drains and a further 260,000 fed are
scheduled to be completed by June 1987, as part of the ongoing projects. This
leaves about 144,000 fed (para. 4.04) with high water table problems, of which
only 62,000 fed overlie aquifer containing usable groundwater. The scope of
vertical drainage is thus limited.



- 19 -
4.14     There are also practical problems in implementing vertical drainage
in Egypt-the most important being the lack of experience in installing and
operating deep well projects for agriculture. At present, the Groundwater
Research Institute (GRI) of MOI is establishing two vertical drainage test
areas, each of 4,000 fed, at Mallawi (close to the Program area in Upper
Egypt) and Deir Mawas (outside the Program area in the South Delta). The
installation of wells, investigations and studies will take more than four
years to complete. The results should provide data which would be useful to
ascertain the effectiveness of vertical drainage in lowering the phreatic
water table in the clay cap and its viability on a wide scale. In particular,
it may be preferable to drain by deep wells some areas where irrigation
development at higher elevations is believed to be causing waterlogging of old
lands. Such areas are not a part of the proposed project, but could be
considered in a later phase.
xnplementation Schedule and Estimated Cost of the Program
4.15     The schedule for remodelling of open drains (417,000 fed) is shown in
Annex 3, Chart I (World Bank - 26974) and for installation of subsurface
drains (1.12 M fed) in Annex 3, Chart 2 (World Bank - 26978). These schedules
reflect the agreement reached with EPADP on the phasing of the Program and the
factors considered in phasing (para. 4.09). The implementation of these two
main components is estimated to proceed as shown in Annex 3, Table 4.
4.16     The cost of the full development, estimated in April 1985 prices, is
about £E628 M (US$502 M) of which £E338 M (US$270 M) are local costs and
£E290 M (US$232 M) are foreign costs. The total cost includes £E40 M
(US$32 M) for physical contingencies and £E191 M (US$153 M) for price
contingencies.  The taxes and duties, including contingencies, amount to about
E?:71 M (US$57 M). In the estimated cost for the Program, the cost of
iraintenance during implementation has been included for the period of each
phase. Cost estimates are given in Annex 3, Tables 5 and 6. Detailed cost
estimates by component are available in the Project File.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Rationale, Scope and Summamr Description
Project Rationale
5.01     The increased intensity of water use since the commissioning of HAD
has led to rising water table, an" in increased soil salinity in many areas
served only by open drains (para. 2.53). Much has been learned about the
problems of the subsector during t;ae Ymnk's long and substantial involvement
with drainage in Egypt.  The im .coverezzts to be introduced under the proposed
project include: (a) selection c.Z pr*--ect area on the basis of priority need
for drainage; (b) improvements in .echnical designs; (c) more realistic
implementation goals; (d) increased attention to construction management and
quality control; (e) effective M&E, and (f) improvements in O&M.
Implementation of these improvements would significantly enhance the cost
effectiveness and the quality of drainage program, which is the second largest
element in agricultural investment in Egypt, after land reclamation (para.
2.09).



- 20 -
5.02     Within the context of drainage of the remaining over 2 N fed in Egypt
in general, and for the 10-Year Program in particular, thes. improvements are
timely. The works proposed under the project would be undertaken in areas
where water table and soil stability conditions are far more difficult than
previously encountered, and hence the improved design, construction and
quality control standards are essential. Furthermore, Egypt's budgetary
situation is becoming increasingly tight, and the selectivity proposed under
the project (para. 4.05) would ensure improved allocation of scarce
resources. Finally, the knowledge gained from the Bank Group's past
involvement in the subsector provided the basis for discussing, and agreeing
upon, the urgently needed changes.
Project Scope
5.03       Within the framework of the objectives set out in para. 4.02, the
proposed project would finance the first time-slice of GOE's 10-Year Drainage
Program (para. 4.16). The project drainage works would include: (a)
remodelling of open main and branch drains on 280,000 fed, and (b) subsurface
drainage system to provide relief for 465,000 fed gross (see Annex 3, Table 3,
for area by catchment and Maps, IBRD 18733 and 18734, for location of
catchments). These drainage works would be executed by EPADP. Other project
components include improvements to ensure more effective M & E, adequate O&M
of project facilities and training and technical assistance. The project
would also provide equipment for automatic measurement of flow rates in canals.
Summary Description
5.04     The project works would include:
'i)    Surface Drainage.  Remodelling of about 667 km of existing
surface drains;
(ii)    Subsurface Drainage.  (a) Installation of about 3,900 km of
collectors and 46,200 km of field drains, with associated field
and outfall structures for subsurface drainage of about 416,000
fed net, and (b) production of about 50,600 km of 80 mm
corrugated PVC pipes for field drains;
(iii)    Maintenance of Surface and Subsurface Drains.  (a) Construction
of 9 maintenance centers and 90 subcenters; (b) provision of
maintenance equipment for both surface and subsurface drains and
of special weed-cutting plant for intensive testing, and (c)
maintenance of completed drainage works during the project
implementation period, and
(iv)    Other Components.
(a)  Training and Technical Assistance would include short-term
expatriate consultants, and local consultants to assist in
establishing a monitoring and evaluation system in EPADP,
and 43 man-months of practical training of EPADP engineers
in countries with comparable drainage facilities;



- 21 -
(b) Strengthening of Drainage Research Institute (DRI) for
assisting EPADP in determining normative discharge for
design of field drains in areas having upward seepage, and
for developing relationships between yield, water table and
soil salinity;
(c) Monitoring and Evaluation Program for monitoring the
project's implementation progress and the impact of field
drainage on water table, soil salinity and crop yield, and
(d) Provision of Equipment for measurement of flow rates in
canals.
B. Detailed Project Features
Surface Drainage (Base Cost US$20.4 M) 1/
5.05     Civil Works and Land Acquisition (Base Cost US$14.7 M). To provide
for free-fall outflow from field drains and capacities between 8 and 12
m3'fed/day, the project would deepen and widen 343 km of open drains in
Upper Egypt and 325 km in the Delta in order to maintain a water level at not
less than 2.5 m below ground surface (para. 5.13). The design and depth of
previously remodelled main drains 2/ are based upon this criterion. The total
quantity of earthwork excavation is estimated to be about 8.5 M m3. The
project would also rebuild and/or extend a total of 481 bridges, 15 siphons
and 96 escapes or aquaducts. About 637 fed land would be acquired to
accommodate widening of open drains. As in the past, acquisition of land is
not expected to pose any problem.
5.06     All civil works designs and construction would be consistent with
existing specifications of M0I for earthworks and of IMSP for structures,
which are satisfactory to the Bank. Virtually all earthworks would be carried
out with excavating equipment.
5.07     Equipment and Spare Parts (Base Cost US$4.4 M) 1/.  In order to
complete remodelling of open drains in a four-year period, the project would
provide 8 draglines of 1.20 m3 bucket capacity, 17 backhoes or hydraulic
excavators of 0.75 m3 bucket capacity, 2 low-bed loaders for transport of
equipment, and required spare parts.
5.08     Administration and Engineering (Base Cost US$1.3 M).  Project costs
include provision for required EPADP staff, and related funding for managing
this component as well as for planning, design and supervision of surface
drainage works. Based on experience with ongoing projects, this cost has been
estimated at lOZ of the cost of the civil works category, 6% for land
acquisition and 3Z for imported equipment and spares.
5.09     Pumping Stations.  OI is committed to ensure that irrigation and
drainage pumping stations (paras. 2.16 and 2.20) have adequate capacity, and
are maintained and operated efficiently. Much has been done under previous
drainage projects (para. 2.25) and the ongoing Irrigation Pumping Stations
Rehabilitation Project (para. 2.12) 3/ to help MOI in improving both the
I/ Excludes US$2.4 M for flow meters (see para. 5.34).

pumping capability and the performance of the pumping stations. In the
proposed project area, a futher 11 pumping stations would need improvement.
These pumping stations are located in the Delta (see Map,IBRD 18733).
5.10     A specialists' committee constituted by MOI from EPADP, MED and PPD
has prepared a report on the condition of the 11 pumping stations devoted to
pumping drainage effluent from the project area. MOI has agreed that
the specialists committee would plan the required renovation works. It has
further been agreed that the pumping stations would be renovated according to
the schedule required by the implementation of drainage works under the
proposed project. Following renovation of the pumping stations, the Bank
would aim at ensuring that the MED would design and implement an effective
inspection and O&M program (as per Agreement for Loan 2270-EGT) for
maintaining operational efficiency of these pumping stations over the
long-term.
Subsurface Drainage (Base Cost US$113.6 M)
5.11     Technical Features.  Groundwater in the project area would be
controlled to safe levels by installing subsurface drains. The areas selected
for tile drainage are those in most urgent need of drainage. The data on
which the selection was based are relatively good (paras. 3.09 and 3.10) and,
consequently, it is not anticipated that detailed investigations, as proposed
in para. 4.05 or on 300 to 500 m grid for final design work, would lead to
significant changes in the project area.
:5.12    Agreement was reached with EPADP on specific design aspects of
subsurface drainage. These are: (a) provision of site specific designs,
allowing adjustment of calculated lateral spacing to the nearest 10 m; (b)
where large areas of rice are grown, and crop consolidation maps have been
prepared by MOA, provision of a modified layout, developed by DRI with
assistance from Dutch experts, which takes care of ponding of water in rice
fields through a system of sub-collectors; (c) use of envelope for all
laterals with a spacing of 60 m or more, and for lesser drain spacings where
needed due to the presence of unstable soil at drain depth; (d) provision of
artificial envelopes, unless more economical and technically satisfactory
gravel designs can be implemented; (e) placement of polyethelene collectors
and joints in areas where conventional concrete pipes are difficult to lay,
and (f) provision of buried manholes, except where open manholes are required,
and of PVC joints. These improvements in design standards are expected to
increase efficiency of the drainage system, upgrade quality and reduce
maintenance needs.
5.13     For most crops grown in the project area, a water table 1 m below the
ground surface is expected to permit improved crop yields. This assessment is
based on the results achieved under previous projects (para. 2.28).
Furthermore, a 1981 root penetration study I/ indicates that for most crops
over 90% of roots are in the top 40-50 cm in heavier soils (Kafr el Sheikh
study area) and in 60-70 cm in the relatively lighter soils (Giza and El Minya
study areas). With water levels in open drains kept at 2.5 m below ground
surface (para. 5.05) for reasons of cost effectiveness, a well designed and
1/ Performed under USAID-assisted Egyptian Water Use and Management
Project.



- 23 -
properly ins talled subsurface system would effectively lower the water table
midway between the drains to at least 1 m below the ground surface.
5.14     In Egypt spacing between two adjacent field drains is usually
determined for a normative discharge of 1 um/day (steady state criterion).
Drain spacing thus calculated corresponds to the criterion that the water
table should drop to a depth of I m below ground surface four days after
irrigating the field (non-steady state criterion). For the purpose of
computing drain spacings for the Delta areas, an average normative discharge
of 1.2 nm/day has been applied to allow for the expected upward seepage.
Agreement was reached that DRI would investigate upward flow of groundwater in
the Delta for establishing normative discharge for designing subsurface
drainage for each sub-area. For Upper Egypt, a normative discharge of 1
mm/day, as generally applied, has been used.
5.15     Design and specifications for the subsurface drainage system would be
consistent with DIN standards for such works and for materials to be
incorporated in these works. A typical layout for subsurface drains may
consist of PVC pipe field drains, with an average length of 200 m, and a
gradient between 10 and 20 cm/100 m. The average depth of drains would be
about 1.40 m for the required design criteria (paras. 5.13 and 5.14). They
would be connected to generally non-reinforced concrete pipe collectors. Some
small areas, having problematic soils, and high water table, may require
polyethelene collector pipes. The length of the collector would depend on the
topographic boundaries but, based on design of 89,000 fed (para. 5.35), would
average about 1.5 km. The depth of the collectors would range from 1.6 m
upstream to a maximum of 2.5 a- at outlets, and pipe diameter would range from
15-45 cm. They would be laid at a gradient varying from 2 to 10 cm/100 m,
with smaller gradients usually associated with larger pipe sizes. Open and
buried manholes would be provided, as needed. Stone pitching would be built
at collector outlets into open drains for erosion control. A modified layout
for rice areas would have a system of subcollectors capable of being closed
during periods when drainage is not required, coupled with most features of
the typical system. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that EPADP
would apply design and selection criteria satisfactory to the Bank (paras.
4.05, 5.6, and 5.11-5.15) for carrying out drainage works under the project
(para. 9.01(a)).
5.16     Civil Works and Crop Compensation (Base Cost US$38.1 M).  The project
would provide for, installing about 3,900 km of collector drains, 46,000 km of
field drains with and without envelope (for gravel, 5 cm thickness around the
pipe), associated structures and two stores for PVC pipes. These requirements
are based on agreed technical features (paras. 5.12 - 5.15), detailed designs
prepared by EPADP for 89,000 fed (para. 5.35) and drain spacing determined
from hydraulic permeability data (para. 3.11).
5.17     Collector drains would be installed (except in orchards) by heavy
duty pipe-laying machines, and field drains by standard trenchers, both
similar to those currently being used in Egypt. Field tests have not yet
proved that the high speed trenchless plow can be used in the heavy soil
successfully and economically. The machines to be provided under the project
would have laser controlled mechanisms for economic and precise control of
alignment and levels during drain installation. No land, easements or right



- 24 -
of way would be purchased for installation of subsurface drains, which is the
generally accepted practice. However, compensation would be paid to farmers
for crop loss during construction.
5.18     Equipment, Vehicles and Spare Parts (Base Costs US$27.1 M, 4.8 M and
16.9 M). The project would provide the required pipe laying machines and
support equipment, vehicles and spare parts. The equipment requirements are
based on contract packages (see Annex 3, Chart 2, World Bank - 26978), output
of collector and lateral laying units and support equipment required to
maintain planned pipe laying output, after accounting for equipment which
would be available from Bank-assisted ongoing projects (para. 2.27). A
complete inventory of equipment to be transferred from ongoing projects is
available in the Project File.
5.19     To complete the 416,000 fed subsurface drainage system within the
proposed four-year construction period (see Annex 2, Chart 1, World Bank -
26975), 16 collector and 50 lateral layer machines, 45 laser units, 76
backhoe-loaders, 21 wheel loaders, and 23 bulldozers would be procured. Other
support equipment to be procured would include agricultural tractors and
trailers, mud pumps, low loaders, booster pumps and flushers, vehicles, fuel
trailers and stores. For both the new and old equipment, spare parts
corresponding to 5-10% of their purchase value and for each operating year
would be provided.
5.20     Administration and Engineering (Base Cost US$6.7 M).  The project
would provide administration and engineering cost for planning, design, and
implementation of subsurface drainage works by EPADP. As in the case of
surface drains (para. 5.08), this cost has been estimated at 10% of the civil
works category, 6% for crop compensation and 3% for imported equipment and
spares. The estimated cost also includes a lump-sum provision for
administration in respect of production of PVC pipes.
5.21     Production of Corrugated PVC Pipe (Base Cost US$20.0 M).  For ongoing
projects, PVC pipe is produced by EPADP using 11 extruding units
(6 USAID-financed in Upper Egypt and 5 IDA/Bank-financed in the Delta). For
the proposed project, it was considered whether the new PVC units should be
set up and operated by the private sector. It was agreed with EPADP to
maintain the existing arrangement for the following reasons: (a) the existing
plants have shown that they can be operated economically, efficiently and have
been able to meet the demand; (b) four new high speed units to be provided by
the project are portable, and can be set up in the existing factory compounds
using powder ancillary facilities that already exist; (c) the response of the
private sector to an invitation to manufacture corrugated PVC pipe is
uncertain because it would be a supply to a specific market, and (d) it is
desirable that PVC factories should, so far as possible, be set up at the load
center of tile drain implementation to minimize costs of pipe transport and
pipe damage.
5.22     Peak yearly pipe production requirements have been assessed for the
service area of each existing factory. These are about 4,300 km for Upper
Egypt (Beni Suef and Assiut), 5,600 km for West Delta (Damanhur), and 8,500 km
for East and Middle Delta (Aga and Zifta). In order to meet the demand in
Upper Egypt, the project would arrange scheduled rehabilitation of production
lines at Beni Suef and Assiut, and would also provide: (a) 2 crushers for



- 25 -
recycling damaged pipes; (b) spare parts for production lines, and (c) 2,700
tons of PVC compound and purge powder. For the Delta, the project would
rehabilitate two production lines (as scheduled by suppliers) at Damanhur and
Zifta and would provide: (a) 4 mobile high speed production units, (2 for
replacing old and obsolete units and 2 for additional capacity), a blowmould
unit for cross pieces and testing equipment; (b) spare parts for production
lines, and (c) 12,800 tons of PVC compound and purge powder. The total base
cost amounts to US$3.9 M for equipment and spares, US$0.8 N for production
expenditures and US$15.2 M for PVC powder and compound.
5.23     Technical assistance and training, amounting to US$0.1 H, would
include four man-months of expatriate specialist time in compound formulation
and processing, and training of two EPADP's engineers in pipe production, each
for a period of two months, by suppliers of production equipment.
Maintenance -- Bukdkie, Eqmpment and Recurrent Costs (Base Cost US$13.6 M)
5.24     The PPD in MOI is preparing au action plan for improved maintenance
of irrigation and drainage channels (para. 2.24). MOI has agreed to submit
this plan to the Rank not later than December 31, 1985, and to carry out this
plan in consultaLion with the Bank (para. 7.16). However, adequate provision
is included in this project for outlays required for proper maintenance of
project related facilities.
5.25     Buildings (Base Cost US$2.4 M). The project would provide nine
maintenance centers and 90 subcenters for subsurface drains and four offices
for mobile task force groups for maintenance of open drains in Upper Egypt,
and in East, West and Middle Delta. Each center would service about 50,000
fed and each subcenter about 5,000 fed tile-drained area. The estimated cost
includes provision for land acquisition for these buildings.
5.26     Equipment (Base Cost US$5.4 M).  Equipment would be provided for
maintaining both surface and subsurface drains. In the case of surface
drains, the equipment for mobile task force groups would include light weight
excavators, draglines with 1.2 m3 bucket capacity, small bulldozers, low
loaders, transport vehicles and office equipment. Some new types of
mechanical equipment would also be procured for intensive field trials with
the objective of selecting equipment most suited to Egyptian conditions. Such
equipment would include a long-reach excavator and a light-weight hydraulic
excavator with excavating and mowing buckets, a light-weight crawler for
cleaning of drains, light-weight bulldozers, mowing boat with cutters, rotary
slasher, and weed push boat with front loader. The equipment for open drains
would be operated by a mechanized company of MOI and maintained at its
existing facilities. The project would also provide equipment to improve the
application of herbicides (para. 2.24). Equipment, including mobile flushing
units, booster pumps, mud-pumps and maintenance equipment sets (hand too-is),
would be provided for maintenance of field drains. Also, adequate transport
and office furniture would be provided for each center and subcenter.
5.27     Technical Assistance and Training (Base Cost US$0.1 M). Four
man-months of expatriate consultant time and six man-months of local
consultancy services to assist in setting up trials for integrated weed
contre'L using special plant and chemical applications and in evaluating



-26-
results would be included. Two engineers of EPADP would each receive
practical training overseas for three months to facilitate efficient and
proper O&M of completed drainage works.
5.28     O&M Cost of Surface Drains (Base Cost US$3.3 M) and Subsurface Drains
(Base Cost US$1.5 M) during Project Implementation. The annual cost of
adequate O&M for surface drains has been tentatively estimated at about
£E3.0/fed at current prices. The present budgetary allocation averages about
£El.75/fed. The project would provide funds to correct the deficiency for
maintaining surface drains on: (a) 381,000 fed which have already been
remodelled (the project would equip this area with tile drainage), and (b)
areas where open drains are remodelled as a part of the project. Costs of
required maintenance of structures and staff for maintaining and operating the
task force groups would be provided.
5.29     Currently, the maintenance of subsurface drains is carried out by
technicians and labor employed by EPADP. The project would support
progressive extension of this system to the project facilities by providing
the required staff for each center and subcenter and related funding.
5.30     Engineering and Administraton (Base Cost US$0.9 M).  This cost,
estimated at 3Z of the equipment category and l0Z for all other items, would
cover engineering and administration of all O&M works.
Other Components
5.31     Improvement in Construction Management and Design Standards (Base
Cost US$0.3 M). The project would support EPADP's current efforts to improve
construction management and design standards. This support would include
seven man-months of expatriate specialist and 9 man-months of local expert
time to assist EPADP's Planning and Follow-up Unit in overall planning and
monitoring of project implementation and its Design Department in upgrading
design standards. Nine engineers of EPADP would receive overseas training
(each for a period of three months) in these areas.
5.32     Strengthening Research (Base Cost US$ 0.4 M).  The project would
provide field allowances for the existing staff of DRI, and required equipment
and transport to strengthen its ongoing activities in two fields: (a)
investigation of upward seepage in the Delta areas for establishing normative
discharge for design of field drains (para. 5.14), and (b) drainage technology
and the linkage between depth of water table, soil salinity and crop yield in
pilot areas at Mashtul in East Delta and Shereishra/Harara in West Delta. The
equipment would include a micro-computer and software, light drilling rig and
investigation equipment, water level recorders and indicators and salinity
recorders.
5.33     Monitoring and Evaluation (Base Cost US$0.3 M).  Three separate but
coordinated M&E activities would be carried out during the project development
period: (a) day-to-day monitoring of physical and financial progress; (b)
monitoring of depth to water table, and (c) soil salinity and impact on crop
yield. The project would provide two computers and software (one for Planning
and Follow-up Unit and second for FIDD), required transport and equipment,
field allowances for existing staff and costs of GRI. Technical assistance
and training would include three man-months of an expatriate specialist's



- 27 -
time, eight man-months of local experts time and six man-months for overseas
training of two employees of EPADP.
5.34     Flow Measurement Equipment for Irrigation Network (Base Cost
US$2.4 M). The project would provide equipment for use in conjunction with
the USAID-assisted telemetry system (para. 2.22) for providing flow rates data
from 200 points located throughout the canal system. The MOI would use the
data collected from the system to improve operational efficiency of the canals.
Status of Engineerng
5.35     Final designs and draft tender dscuments have been completed for the
installlation of subsurface drainage on 89,000 fed (21X of the project area)
in the Delta; these include 25,000 fed of El Geneana, 24,000 fed of
Bani-Ebaid, 24,000 fed of Upper Pump Station No. 1 and 16,000 fed of Zarkoun
catchments (see Annex 3, Table 3, and Map, IBRD 18733). At the time of
appraisal, field surveys by FIDD of EPADP were under way for El Mandoura and
Shereishra catchments (See Map, IBRD 18733 for location of these catchment
areas), covering 43,000 and 78,000 fed respectively. The Design Department of
EPADP has sufficient trained staff to complete, in a year, final designs and
tender drawings for about 200,000 fed. By September 1985, EPADP expects to
complete construction designs and preparation of tender documents for
subsurface drains covering 150,000 fed (33X of the project area) and open
drains covering about 120,000 fed (43Z of the project area).
Environment  Impact
5.36     The project would have a favorable impact on the environment.
Providing subsurface field drains, remodelling of open drains and improved
maintenance of open drains would result in lowering the water table in the
project area, and in lessening the incidence of stagnant water. Moreover, the
maintenance and cleaning of surface drains, which serve as waste disposal
systems for the villages, would improve both the general environment and rural
health conditions. The improvement of productive aspects of the environment
would contribute significantly to increased incomes and a better quality of
life for the inhabitants of the project area.
VL COST ESTIMATES. FINANCING. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
Cost Estimates
6.01     Total project cost is estimated at about EE247.6 M (US$198.1 K
equivalent), including US$14.9 M for physical contingencies, US$32.3 M for
price contingencies, US$4.9 M for incremental O&M costs of completed works
during project implementation, and US$17.6 M 1/ for import duties and taxes
(net of contingencies). Foreign exchange costs are estimated to be about
US$97.0 M, or about 491 of total project costs. The cost of civil works is
based on unit prices taken from: (a) recent contracts awarded by EPADP for
installing subsurface drains; (b) prevailing rates for earthwork, masonry
1/ Import duties and taxes, including contingencies, amount to about
US$22.4 M.

structures and items related to constructing and remodelling surface drains,
and (c) analysis of actual costs in Egypt for installing subsurface drains
with trenching machines, and for excavating existing drains by draglines and
hydraulic excavators.  Equipment cost estimates are based on unit prices of
similar equipment procured recently in Egypt or on price quotations from
suppliers. Unit costs have been adjusted to accomodate project conditions and
to reflect April 1985 cost levels. Physical contingencies are assumed to be
about 101 of the base costs. Domestic price contingencies are estimated as
follows: 1985, 7.91; 1986, 12.92; 1987, 9.91; 1988, 10.51; 1989, 10.51, and
1990, 10.11; and international inflation has been estimated as 51 for 1985,
7.5% for 1986 and 8.01 per annum thereafter. Project costs, detailed in Annex
1, Tables 1-6, are sunmarized in Table 6.1. Cost details for individual
project components by sub-area (Upper Egypt and the Delta) are available in
the Project File.

Financing
6.02     Tentative project financing totalling US$96.0 M has been agreed by
three external cofinanciers. This amount would finance about 55% of total
project cost net of taxes and duties (US$22.4 M), or about 99% of estimated
foreign exchange costs. The agreed financinig plan provides for parallel
financing of identified project components. The proposed Bank loan of US$68.0
N would finance: construction and maintenance of subsurface drains in the
Delta sub-area, procurement of vehicles and office equipment for EPADP and
data transducers for canals, and technical assistance and training. The
African Development Bank (AFDB) and the African Development Fund (AFDF) are
expected to finance US$18.0 M and US$10.0 M respectively. The components to
be financed are: construction of surface drains, construction and maintenance
of subsurface drains in Upper Egypt sub-area, and equipment for maintenance of
surface drains. Details of financing by expenditure category are shown in
Table 6.3. GOE would finance the remaining US$102.1 M from its budgetary
resources. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 6.2. A
condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan would be signing by GOE of AFDB
and AFDF agreements (para. 9.03).

6.03     Special Account.  Provision has been made that EPADP may open and
maintain in US$2.0 M a special account for funding the items to be financed by
the Bank (para. 6.02). The Bank financing would be channelled through a
commercial bank to be selected by the Central Bank of the GOE. Deposits into,
and payments ou' of, the special account would be made on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank. While withdrawals from the proceeds of the propos2d
Loan may be handled through the special account, the Bank would continue to
accept, in appropriate cases, withdrawal applications in amounts of more than
US$20,000 for direct payment and agreements to reimburse.
Procurement
6.04     Procurement for all items under the project would be carried out by
EPADP. The required equipment for surface drains, vehicles, PVC compound and
subsurface drainage works would be procured through international competitive
bidding (ICB), according to Bank Guidelines or the co-financiers' procedures.
Togtther, these items represent about US$119.4 M equivalent, or about 68% of
project costs net of taxes and duties. Local manufacturers would be allowed a



- 30 -
152 margin or the actual custom duty, whichever is lover, on ICB equipment and
material contracts to be financed by the Bank. During the implementation
period of the project, spare parts amounting to about US$8.0 M would be
required for repair and maintenance of equipment. They would be procured
directly from the original manufacturers, on the basis of negotiated prices.
6.05     The problems experienced in two ongoing projects (para. 2.27) were
partly due to a few very large contracts for subsurface drainage. Bids under
the proposed project would be invited for relatively small areas (see Annex 3,
Chart 2, World Bank - 26978, for contract packages). Package and slice
procedures would be used, whereby contractors may bid for specific parts or
for the entire contract. Contracting for subsurface drainage would follow ICB
procedures, with all labor, materials (excepting PVC pipe supplied by EPADP),
and construction equipment to be supplied by the contractors as part of the
contract. The Government would advance to the contractors the approximate
foreign exchange value of the equipment and/or spare parts, initially in the
form of a mobilization advance, and, subsequently as special advances, on
furnishing security by the contractors, as stipulated in the contracts. This
procedure is expected to remove the difficulties experienced by the
contractors in importing equipment and spare parts under contracts for ongoing
drainage projects. Furthermore, agreement was reached with EPADP that, to
improve utilization of pipe laying machines, local contractors would be
required to use the services of technicians from the equipment supplier for
training mechanics and machine operators for at least one year.
6.06     Civil works for re odelling of surface drains and for maintenance
centers and subcenters (financed mostly by the Government) are not suitable
for ICB because they are small and scattered throughout the area, and planned
to be implemented in small parcels during the whole construction period.
These works, amounting to about US$12.9 M, would be procured following local
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures. LCB procedures are generally consistent
with the need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the project.
There are, however, a few procedures which are inconsistent with Bank
Procurement Guidelines and others which require clarification.  In order to
make LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank, it was agreed that: (a)
representatives of foreign bidders would be allowed to bid, and (b) all
bidders would be treated equally in terms of eligibility for any preferences
or the requirement of furnishing bids or performance bonds (para. 9.02).
6.07     Also exempted from ICB procedures would be small items costing less
than US$100,000, to be procured following LCB procedures in accordance with
Bank Guidelines. The total value of items procured in this manner would not
exceed US$1.3 M. Also, small contracts of up to US$50,000 equivalent for
office and survey equipment may be awarded on a competitive basis to reliable
suppliers after quotations have been obtained from at least three such
suppliers. The aggregate amourt of such locally procured goods would not
exceed US$500,000 equivalent.  Procurement arrangements are shown in Table 6.3.

- 32 -
6.08     Prior review of procurement documentation by the Bank would be
undertaken for: (a) the installation of subsurface drainage system; (b) the
procurement of equipment, vehicles and PVC compound, and (c) for all other
contracts for works and goods over US$500,000 equivalent. Prior review would
apply to about 70X of total project costs. Other contracts would be subject
to selective post-award review.
Disbursements
6.09     Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made for:
(a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost or the domestic ex-factory
cost of equipment and spare parts, vehicles, PVC compound, purge
powder, and other materials or 70% of such items if they are
locally procured (US$50.0 M);
(b) 30% of the cost of civil works for: (i) subsurface drainage
works, and (ii) maintenance centers and sub-centers (total
US$10.5 M equivalent);
(c) 100% of the foreign expenditures for technical assistance and
overseas training (US$0.3 M equivalent), and
(d) Unallocated US$7.2 M equivalent.
Disbursementc under categories (a) and (b)(i) would be made against full
-3_ n;ad1ion. Disbursements under categories (b)(ii) and (c) would be made
against certified statements of expenditures; supporting documents would be
retained by EPADP for review by the Bank. This procedure has been found
satisfactory under the two ongoing projects.
6.10     It is anticipated that disbursements would be completed by June 30,
1991, about one year after scheduled physical completion of the project. An
estimated schedule of disbursement, shown in Annex 1, Table 7, reflects the
implementation schedule (Annex 2, Chart 1, World Bank - 26975), and is
si-arized in Table 6.4:
Table 6.4: Estimated Disbursement Schedule
Bank Fiscal Year
Disbursements            1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991

Cuimlative                 2.0    7.0    26.0   46.0   61.0   68.0
6.11     The proposed schedule features an accelerated disbursement period of
six years, which is considerably shorter than the country sectoral average of
about nine years and the estimated average of eight years for the two ongoing
drainage projects. The considerations supporting the proposed schedule are
that: (a) the project would be implemented by a single agency which has long
experience of tendering under ICB procedures; (b) most of the Bank loan would
be used for procurement of equipment, vehicles, and PVC compound, items which
are generally disbursed rapidly; (c) contracts for procurement of spare parts



- 33 -
for equipment transferred from ongoing projects would be negotiated with
original suppliers and would result in disbursements at an early stage of
project implementation, and (d) targets set for subsurface drainage under the
proposed project (peak rate of about 150,000 fed/year) are based an
implementation rates recently achieved compared to over-optimistic assumptions
made for previous drainage projects (peak rate of 340,000 fed/year 1/). The
closing date of the loan would be June 30, 1991.
Auditing and Accounts
6.12     A new accounting system was established for EPADP in 1980 by an
Egyptian firm of chartered accountants for the ongoing IDA/Bank-financed
drainage projects. This system is now operating satisfactorily and would also
be used for the proposed project. The Finance Department of EPADP would
establish and maintain separate accounts for the project to reflect the
operations, resources and expenditures in respect of the project. The Central
Audit Organization (CAO), an independent auditing agency, would continue to be
responsible for auditing the accounts of EPADP including those of the proposed
project. The CAO, which is auditing the ongoing IDA/Bank-financed drainage
projects, also carried out the audits of the two completed projects (para.
2.29) and was favorably commented upon in the completion reports. Two to
three interim reports are prepared by CAO each year on the basis of which an
annual report is prepared. The annual audit report, which also highlights a
comparison of actual with the budgeted figures, forms part of MOI consolidated
report presented to the People's Assembly. Annual audit reports, together
with the required financial statements, would be furnished to the Bank.
Assurances were obtained from GOE and EPADP that: (a) EPADP would prepare and
maintain separate project accounts; (b) the project accounts would be audited
annually by independent auditors satisfatory to the Bank; (c) certified copies
of the audited annual project accounts and of the final auditors' report would
be sent to the Bank for review not later than six months after the end of each
fiscal year, and (d) the auditors' report would include, inter alia, a
statement that the funds advanced by the Bank for the special account and
against statements of expenditure were used for the purpose for which they
were provided (para. 9.01(b).
VEIL PROJECT ORGAMZATION. IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION AND
MAINTENANCE
Institutional Arrangements
7.01     Project Organization.  EPADP, a unit of M0I (see Annex 2, Chart 3,
World Bank - 26976) would be responsible for most aspects of project
implementation, including field investigations, planning, design,
procurement, construction and O&EM (paras. 2.20 and 2.21). The present
organizational structure of EPADP is shown in Annex 2, Chart 4 (World Bank -
26977).
7.02     The Drainage Authority, headed by a Chairman, is structured along
functional and regional lines. It has one Undersecretary in charge of
_/ Nile Delta Drainage II Project, Report No. 1451-EGT dated May 5, 1977.



-34-
planning, field investigation, design and follow-up, and two Undersecretaries
for implementation-one for Nile Delta and one for Upper Egypt. Field
supervision of drainage works is the responsibility of five Directorates in
the Delta and sevien Directorates in Upper Egypt, each headed by a Director
General. EPADP's Mechanical Department is responsible for electrical and
mechanical equipment and related works, the MKaintenance Department looks after
maintenance of completed drainage system, and the Administration and Finance
Department is in charge of finance, accounts and procurement. A committee
comprising the Chairman, Vice-Chairman, concerned Undersecretary and the head
of the Technical Office approves technical specifications. This committee and
the Director General (Finance) evaluate bids and make recommendations for
contract awards.
7.03     At present, EPADP employs about 3,600 permanent staff in its
headquarters office and field directorates. Of these, about 1,200 are civil
and agricultural engineers and technical supervisory staff. The present
position regarding technical staff sanctioned and those actually in place,
tabulated in Annex 2, Table 2, shows that there is a considerable shortage of
middle level civil engineers.
7.04     Although the general organizational set up of EPADP is satisfactory,
its performance, as brought out in PPARs of two completed projects (para.
2.29), pointed to weaknesses in construction planning and follow-up. Other
major problems with respect to ongoing projects (para. 2.27) include: the
shortage of staff, particularly at field level; the frequent turnover of
staff; and the need for training and career advancement, and incentives for
technical staff at all levels. The proposed project would strengthen EPADP's
ongoing programs in resolving some of these problems.
7.05     Staff Training. EPADP has a current agreement (1983-85) with the
Government of the Netherlands for training and technical assistance by the
Lake Yjssel Polders Development Authority. The training program comes under
the general supervision of the Egyptian-Dutch Advisory Panel (the Panel) on
anad Drainage in Egypt. The activities of this Panel have also been financed
by the Dutch Government (para. 2.26) since it was established in 1976 mainly
for assisting MOI in improving planning and implementation of drainage works.
The current program, which expires in December 1985, provides for training
EPADP senior staff and instructors in the Netherlands, for consultants to
provide training in design of field drainage and in other specialized
subjects, and also for the Dutch training team's visits to Egypt for
on-the-job training of EPADP and contractor personnel. So far, a total of 250
staff at various levels has been trained, and this program is expected to help
about 500 engineers, technicians and machine operators of EPADP aud public
sector contractors engaged in drainage works. Subjects covered in the overall
program include field investigations, design, construction planning and
management, maintenance of completed works, and machine operation and
maintenance. EPADP has proposed an extension of the Dutch training program
for a further period of two years (1986 and 1987). Additional training
opportunities for EPADP personnel and all other agencies of MOI are provided
by the Ministry's Training and Manpower Development Institute. This institute
is supported by USAID consultants in designing and conducting training in
management, construction planning, O&M and other areas of interest to MOI.
Assurances were obtained from GOE that EEADP would review annually, with the
Bank, its program for the training of engineers and technicians and would



- 35 -
regularly inform the Bank of progress in implementing such programs (para.
9.01(c)).
7.06     In order to strengthen the capability of EPADP to implement drainage
works more effectively, the project would provide selective technical
assistance and training. The present level of participation by EPADP
personnel in training is close to the maximum that can be assimilated, and,
consequently, assistance is focussed on in-service training and developing
improved working methods. The project support would comprise: (a)
strengthening the capability of the Planning and Follow-up Unit to use modern
techniques for planning and programing of project implementation, together
with appropriate methods of reporting progress on all components; (b) setting
up a M&E system to assess the impact of drainage on depth to water table, and
on such other aspects as may be appropriate; (c) assisting in PVC compound
formulation and in pipe production, and (d) setting up trial tests for channel
maintenance, using special plant and controlled application of chemicals, and
reviewing results of such tests, reconiuending equipment and methods best
suited to Egyptian conditions for upgra-ing the standard of maintenance of
open drains. An assurance was obtained from GOE that MOI and EPADP would
contract suitably qualified expatriate and local experts on terms, conditions
and schedule satisfactory to the Bank (para. 9.01 (d)).
Field Supervision and Quality Control
7.07     Staff Requirements. Project implementation would require increase in
the number of the technical staff of EPADP (para. 7.03). If EPADP could fill
existing vacancies up to their sanctioned level, particularly at the
engineers' grades, this would provide the necessary key staff for
implementation. There would, however, be an increase of staff required to
meet the increased 0&M requirements generated by the incremental areas coming
into operation.
7.08    The increase in staff required for O&M is estimated in Table 7.1:

Part of this increase may be found from engineers released from construction
duties in Upper Egypt (Assiut, Sohag, Qena, Kom Ombo and Aswan Directorates)
as construction in these areas should be completed by 1987 (para. 2.27) and
also by the degree of success achieved by EPADP in recruiting to sanctioned



- 36 -
levels (see Anmex 2, Table 2) in the intervening period. Recruitment at entry
level (excepting agricultural engineers) has been difficult in the past
because of low public sector wages, unattractive field conditions, and
availability of more highly paid work in the private sector and neighboring
countries. Assurances were obtained from GOE and EPADP that: (a) EPADP would
review with the Bank, not later than six months before the start of each of
its fiscal years and until completion of the project, the technical staff
requirements of the project during the following fiscal year, for effective
implementation and quality control of project works and for O&M, and the
required additional number of civil and agricultural engineers would be
provided on a timely basis, and (b) EPADP would fulfill such requirements,
through the provision of necessary resources and facilities, including
financial incentives for the recruitment and retention of the staff (para.
9.01(e)).
7.09     Other Quality Control Measures.  In order to strengthen field
supervision and quality control, particularly for subsurface drainage, it has
been agreed with EPADP that: (a) check lists of items to be specifically
monitored during construction of each collector drain system would be
maintained; (b) gravel of required specifications for envelopes would be
obtained by contractors from processing plants approved by EPADP, and, failing
availability of satisfactory gravel, artificial filter material would be used;
(c) EPADP supervisory staff would receive intensive training in quality
control related to field construction and PVC pipe production, and (d)
training of Egyptian contractors' staff associated with ongoing projects would
be further strengthened under Dutch-Egyptian bilateral program in planning and
logistics, execution of works and O&M of equipment (para. 7.05).
Project Implementation
7.10     Project implementation is planned for five years as shown in Annex 2,
Chart 1. Most of the procurement would be completed during the first three
years. Estimated supply of equipment by contractors for subsurface drainage
is shown in Annex 2, Table 1, and schedule for procurement of equ-.pment and
PVC compound by EPADP in Annex 2, Chart 2 (World Bank - 27078). Remodelling
of surface drains would be carried out mainly in the first and second years in
Upper Egypt and during the second to fourth years in the Delta. Structures in
the open drains would be built during the same period. Construction of
buildings for centers and subcenters would be spread over FY87 through FY90.
Installation of subsurface drains would commence early in FY87 in the Delta
and in FY88 in Upper Egypt, and would be completed during FY90. This schedule
for commencing installation of field drainage in the project area would allow
prior completion of similar works under ongoing projects (para. 2.27) and
prior remodelling of open drains in Upper Egypt (para. 5.06). The remodelling
of open drains, installation of subsurface drains and construction of
maintenance buildings is estimated to proceed as shown in Table 7.2:

7.11     The schedule for constructing drainage works has been derived from
past experience as summarized in PPARs (para. 2.29), demands of ongoing works
(para. 2.27), and scheduled new works under other projects (paras. 2.30 and
2.31). To ensure that any changes in total program are properly reflected in
revised resource allocations to EPADP, assurances were obtained from GOE that
until the completion of the project, MOI and EPADP would provide to the Bank
for its comments (a) not later than three months before the start of the GOE's
fiscal year, EPADP's annual implementation plan, indicating work status,
budgetary, equipment and staffing resources required and available, and
allocations in M[I's budget for drainage projects, and (b) the proposals for
MOI's investment program in the drainage and irrigation subsector (para.
9.01(f)).
Operation and Maintenance
7.12    EPADP would be responsible for the O&M of all completed drainage
works, both during the implementation period and after completion of the
project. However, during construction and for one year following completion
of a contract unit, the contractor would be responsible for the maintenance of
the subsurface drains. The responsibility for O&M of subsurface drains and
the associated surface drains was transferred from the Irrigation Department
to the EPADP in 1979. It helped in establishing lines of responsibilitv in
accordance with geographic units and in structuring and enlarging its O&M
orguization to make it a more viable concern.
7.13    The EPADP's existing organizational structure for maintaining both
surface and subsurface drains is shown in Annex 2, Chart 4 (World Bank -
26977). The Undersecretary for maintenance controls eight field Directorates,
five in the Delta and three in Upper Egypt. Under each Di:ectorate are a
number of centers, each responsible for maintaining drainage works in an area
of about 40,000 to 50,000 fed. Under the centers are subcenters, each
responsible for about 5,000 fed of subsurface drains. At present, there are
47 maintenance centers and 214 subcenters. Channel maintenance, which is
performed almost entirely by contract, is handled by the Directorates. The
staff of the centers and subcenters are mostly concerned with maintenance of
subsurface drainage which is now performed exclusively by force account.
7.14    Maintenance of drainage works in Egypt have, in the past, not been of
a satisfactory standard due mainly to extremely difficult environmental
conditions (which result in very rapid weed growth in open drains), staffing
limitations (para. 7.03) and technical shortcomings. Whilst EPADP has, in the
last few years, improved maintenance of drains, further improvement is



-38-
required, and the project O&M component has been designed to help EPADP in
implementing required improvements.
7.15     The project would provide: (a) equipment and funds for four mobile
task force groups and for an open drain maintenance trial area in the Delta to
test new types of mechanical plant for removal of weeds; (b) maintenance
centers and subcenters fully equipped and staffed to maintain tile drains; (c)
overseas training of two engineers of EPADP staff on the organization and
amnagement of O&M; (d) more effective M&E to allow EPADP to determine the
effectiveness of installed drainage facilities and maintenance operations, and
(e) adequate funds for O&M of the completed facilities during the project
implementation.
7.16     At present, MOI is formulating a nationwide CMP (paras. 2.24 and
5.24) which is expected to integrate and improve the effectiveness of channel
maintenance in Egypt. This plan will provide for improved maintenance of both
irrigation canals and open drains, and thus take care of areas drained
previously. Assurances were obtained from GOE that MOI would: (a) prepare and
provide to the Bank, not later than December 31, 1985, a plan for maintenance
of drainage and irrigation channels, including the budgetary requirements
thereof, and (b) carry out such plan, taking into account the Bank's comments
thereon (para. 9.01(g)).
7.17     The proposed method of maintenance during the project implementation
period is based on accepted practices in Egypt, i.e., a strong emphasis on
mechanical removal of weeds and sediment. However, it is expected that the
CMiP would aim at developing a cost effective balance between mechanical and
chemical control of weeds (para. 2.24). The project would provide adequate
funds for at least one cycle of open drains clearance each year in place of
the current two-year cycle.
7.18     The project allows for a new feature in open drains maintenance.
This is the establishment of 4 mobile task force groups, three in the Delta
and one in Upper Egypt. Each unit would consist of a few mobile drain
maintenance units. Instead of routine maintenance, these units would be
directed to particular parts of the drainage system where blockages are
occurring. It is anticipated that these units would be cost effective in
maintaining good flow conditions in the drains.
7.19     For good maintenance, it is essential for GOE to make adequate
budgetary provisions and release funds to EPADP promptly for all aspects of
maintenance work. It is estimated that O&M cost/year would amount to about
£E4.0/fed for both surface and subsurface drains. Assurances were obtained
from GOE that: (a) sufficient funding based upon the estimated cost or agreed
target and other resources would be made available annually to EPADP for the
proper operation and maintenance of drainage facilities improved and/or
installed under the project; (b) prepare, with the assistance of experts, and
provide to the Bank, by June 30, 1986, a plan for the implementation of the
weed control trials utilizing special plant, together with controlled use of
chemicals; (c) carry out such plan, taking into account the Bank's comments
thereon, and (e) perform review of the results of the trials, using the
specialists group responsible for planning the trials (para 9.01(h)).

Monitoring and Evaluation
7.20     In the past, the Planning and Follow-up Department of EPADP has not
been able to provide timely and accurate information on program performance
and definitive data on crop responses to drainage. In order to correct this
situation, the following changes in the focus and operation of this Department
would be made in the proposed project. There would be three separate but
coordinated M&E activities for: (a) monitoring the implementation of the
drainage program; (b) monitoring the depth of water table and soil salinity in
areas to be provided with tile drains, and impact of drainage in those areas
where tile drains have been installed, and (c) establishing in experimental
areas relation between depth of water table, soil salinity and crop yield.
7.21     EPADP agreed during appraisal that its existing Implementation
Monitoring Unit would be provided required resources so as to make this unit
more effective. To assist in meeting these objectives, an expatriate
short-term consultant and local consultants would be recruited to help in
training, setting up the implementation monitoring system and identifying
staff and equipment needs. Assurances were obtained from GOE that EPADP
would: (a) adequately staff its Implementation Monitoring Unit so as to enable
it to plan, coordinate, and monitor the activities under the project and
promptly make available to it the services of consultants in implementation
planning and monitoring; (b) prepare by June 30, 1986, with the assistance of
such consultants, and provide to the Bank, for its comments, a plan for
monitoring the implementation of the project, and (c) promptly carry out such
plan, taking into account the Bank's comments (para. 9.01(i)). The
Implementation Monitoring Unit would also be responsible for preparing and
submitting through the Chairman to the Bank: (a) quarterly progress reports no
later than two months after the end of each quarter, and (b) a project
completion report within six months of the loan closing date. GOE assurances
on these matters were also obtained during negotiations (para. 9.01(j)).
7.22     Because of the complexity and difficulties experienced in the past in
determining crop yield differences due to drainage, EPADP agreed during
appraisal tlat the influence of drainage on water table depth, and such other
aspects ar .ay be appropriate would be separately determined.  It was further
agreed thtac EPADP would strengthen its M&E Unit to investigate and report on
required parameters. Measurements of water table depth, monitored by GRI on a
network of piezometers recently installed throughout the program area, would
be supplemenced by EPADP field crews to give a density of one
observation/l,000 fed. Determination of soil salinity, when required, would
be made on soil samples taken as a composite of the first 50 cm of the soil
profile. An expatriate expert and a local expert would be contracted on
short-term basis to help EPADP in setting up the program for M&E of the impact
of field drainage, including adivising on frequency of measurements,
evaluation techniques, and reporting requirement and formats. On major basins
in the Delta and Fayoum Basin, water and salt balance models are being
constructed by DRI with Dutch cooperation (paras. 2.26 and 7.05). These
models would provide a means of determining the effectiveness of subsurface
drainage in controlling soil salinity. Assurances were obtained from GOE that
EPADP would: (a) not later than December 31, 1985, prepare, with the
assistance of expatriate and local experts, and provide to the Bank for its
comments, a detailed program for M&E the impact of drainage on water table and



-40-
on such other aspects as may be appropriate, and (b) carry out such program in
consultation with the Bank (para. 9.01(k)).
7.23     In addition, EPADP has agreed that its maintenance units would
monitor flows in collectors and collect data for assessing drainage
performance. These measurements would serve two other purposes: (a) to
determine the need for drainage improvements at present, or at a predicted
future time, in both undrained and drained areas, and (b) to determine the
need for maintenance, repair, or replacement of drainage facilities.
7.24     To improve upon the information on crop response to the drainage
criteria, DRI would monitor the water table depths and degree of soil salinity
at its Mashtul and Shereishra/Harara research sites (set up with Dutch
assistance) where they have been collecting these data and crop yields for the
last three years. The results obtained at these sites would be supplemented
by DRI's work on test plots to be set up under the Canadian ISAWIP (para.
2.30). The data monitored at research sites, and to be collected for ISAWIP,
would relate to: soil, salinity, water table, cropping pattern, yields,
irrigation inputs and other technical, economic, and social aspects.
Assurances were obtained from GOE that: (a) not later than December 31, 1986,
MOI would provide to the Bank for its comments, an initial report on the
results of the experiments which are being undertaken by DRI in relation,
inter alia, to soil, salinity, water table, cropping patterns and yields, and
thereafter to make available annually to the Bank the results of such
experiments, and (b) to utilize, as appropriate, the findings of such
experiments in the design of the drainage systems (para. 9.01(1)).
ViMI. PROJECT BENEFITS, JUSTIFCATION AND RISK
Agrcutura inpact
8.01     The proposed project would relieve a major constraint to production
in the project areas, namely, the high and rising water table and soil
salinity status.  Other important constraints especially the quality of
agricultural supporting services-are progressively being addressed under
other projects and programs of GOE (para. 2.10). Relief of the drainage
constraint is essential if a progressive decline in yields is to be arrested
and significant increases in agricultural production are to be achieved in the
future. However, the direct impact on which project benefits are calculated
has been assessed only on the basis of the limited changes in yield which are
expected without any change in agricultural practices. The implication of
this conservative assumption is that project benefits, though possibly
understated, are independent of improvements in input supply, extension and
other non-project activities.
8.02     The anticipated incremental yields expected, with and without the
project, are shown in Table 8.1. These factors have been applied only to the
main crop product: by-product yields have been assumed to remain constant.

Sugar Cane    15   -5       15  -10
These data have been estimated on the basis of data from the areas with
generally less severe drainage conditions.  The incremental yields are
expected to be less in Upper Egypt than in the Delta areas, since soil
salinity conditions in Upper Egypt are relatively better, and soils are
generally more free-draining. Incremental production at full development
(1996) for major crops is shown in Table 8.2:

MaketinE and Prices
8.03     Egypt's deteriorating import-export balance in agricultural products
(Table 2.1) ensures a ready, well developed market for the major crops. For
the less significant crops--mainly fruits and vegetables-domestic markets are
also readily available.



- 42 -
8.04     Prices for agricultural products in Egypt are generally well below
world prices, and sometimes--for example, in the case of fodder crops-give
distorted incentives to farmers. For the purposes of this project, since no
project benefits based on changed agricultural practices are assumed, the
incentive structure is not a constraint to achieving project objectives.
Farm Incomes
8.05     Net farm income from cropping activities is estimated at about
EE 1,500/year for an average 3 fed farm. Additional income from livestock
would increase farm income to about EE 2,200. Smaller farms tend to have
somewhat more intensive livestock production and higher incomes per fed.
Incremental farm incomes due to project investments are shown in Annex 5,
Table 7.
Cost Recovery
8.06     Egyptian law provides for the direct and full recovery of the cost of
field drainage over a 20-year period, without interest, beginning within one
year of project completion. Provision is also made for the indirect recovery
of maintenance costs through the revision of the annual land tax following
introduction of drainage. Incremental annual payments for the proposed
project would average EE 20/fed, or almost 201 of incremental farm income at
full development. This includes both capital cost recovery and maintenance
charges. Increased income would more than cover these costs in every year
following completion of drainage works, a conclusion supported by two studies
of beneficiaries' ability to repay costs conducted by MOA and MOI (study
reports available in the Project File).
8.07     Given the relatively high implicit taxation on agriculture due to
low, controlled prices of farm produce, and the relative poverty of most
beneficiaries, GOE'S cost recovery rules are satisfactory, despite the element
of subsidy implicit in the interest-free recovery pattern.
8.08     The mechanism for effecting recovery, however, is complex and
slow-moving. Three agencies are involved--EPADP, which prepares the statement
of actual costs; the Survey Department of the Ministry of Irrigation, which
verifies the areas held by each beneficiary, and the Land Tax Directorate of
the Ministry of Finance, which prepares bills. In consequence, repayments are
behind schedule, and records of what has been spent, what has been recovered,
and what is due, are often confusing or lacking. GOE has recently revised the
cost recovery procedures and introduced an incentive system for the
village-level tax collector. This is expected to improve the rate of cost
recovery. Assurances were obtained from GOE that suitable arrangements would
be made to ensure that cultivators of land benefitting from field drainage
works (covered collectors, laterals and related structures) under the project
would be charged with annual amount sufficient: (a) to recover capital cost of
such works (plus a 10 administrative charge) over a period of 20 years from
the dates of completion of each drainage unit, and (b) to cover on a
continuous basis, starting two years after the completion of such unit, the
maintenance cost of such works, as such cost is determined in accordance with
principles satisfactory to the Bank (para. 9.01(m)). Assurances were also
obtained that GOE would also cause EPADP, in cooperation with its Ministry of



- 43 -
Finance: (a) to provide to the Bank, by December 31, 1986, an outline of the
measures and procedures to be adopted to improve collection of field drainage
costs, indicating an estimate of the expected annual collection; (b) to take
into account the coments, which the Bank may offer on the methods and
procedures to be implemented for improving collection of field drainage costs,
and (c) to provide annually to the Bank a report reviewing the progress made
in such collections and, if necessary, to make proposals for its further
improvement (para. 9.01(m)).
Benefifts and JustiriLeation
8.09     The gross incremental benefit from project investments has been
calculated on the basis of incremental production (Tables 8.1 and 8.2), and
projected 1990 border prices (see Annex 5). The net incremental benefit was
derived by identifying those elements of production costs which are a direct
function of yield levels-harvesting costs, on-farm processing, and
transportation-and calculating incremental costs associated with projected
incremental production. Labor costs equivalent to peak-season rates have been
used, since the incremental demand is almost entirely for harvest labor.
8.10     Net incremental economic benefits per feddan range from £E96 in Upper
Egypt to £E172 in West Delta. Without the project, yields are assumed to
decline linearly over a ten year period; with the project, incremental yields
are assumed to develop over a four year period following completion of surface
and subsurface drainage works. (These assumptions and calculations are
specified in more detail in Annex 5.)
8.11     The rate of return for the overall project is estimated at 23Z,
falling to 17S with a 10 increase in costs or decrease in benefits. For the
major areas of the project, located in the Delta, the rate of return would
remain above 121 despite large increases in costs (+401). decreases in
benefits (-501) or implementation delays (7 years). In Upper Egypt, although
still satisfactory, the switching values (301, 35S and 5 years, respectively)
are somewhat more constraining.
Proj Risk
8.12     The risks associated with the project are limited.  Incremental
yields have been estimated on the basis of available data from areas where
drainage problems were generally less severe than in most project areas.
Production benefits are based entirely on the yield effect of improved
drainage, and are thus not dependent on improved cultural practices, higher
input levels, or other changes. Costs and phasing are based on several years
of detailed experience, and no radical improvements have been assumed.
8.13     In the Delta areas, only very substantial increases in project costs,
or declines in incremental production values, would cause an unacceptable
economic rate of return. For the areas in Upper Egypt, the margin is
relatively lower. However, the data already available regardisg the existing
high water table and the improved design standards accepted fcor tilis project
ensure an acceptably low risk of sub-marginal economic returns 5n Upper Egypt.

DC. AGREEMENIS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMUERNDATIONS
9.01     Assurances have been obtained from GOE and/or EPADP that:
(a) EPADP would apply design and selection criteria satisfactory to
the Bank (paras. 4.05, 5.6 and 5.11-5.15) for carrying out
drainage works under the project (para. 5.15);
(b) (i) EPADP would prepare and maintain separate project accounts;
(ii) the project accounts would be audited annually by
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank; (iii) certified
copies of the audited annual project accounts and of the final
auditors' report would be sent to the Bank for review not later
than six months after the end of each fiscal year, and (iv) the
auditors' report would include, inter alia, a statement that the
funds advanced by the Bank for the special account and against
statements of expenditure were used for the purpose for which
they were provided (para. 6.12);
gc) EPADP would review annually, with the Bank, its program for the
training of engineers and technicians and would regularly inform
the Bank of progress in implementing such programs (para. 7.05);
(d) MOI and EPADP would contract suitably qualified expatriate and
local experts on terms, conditions and schedule satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 7.06);
'e) (i) EPADP would review with the Bank, not later than six months
before the start of each of its fiscal years and until
completion of the project, the technical staff requirements of
of the project during the following fiscal year. for effective

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
DRAINAGE V PROJECT
Monitoring and Evaluation
Background
1.       Monitoring of Implementation.  In the past, Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) by EPADP has been concerned with monitoring physical project
implementation as vell as the effects of tile drainage on crop yields. In the
first instance, the Implementation Monitoring Unit has had difficulty in
keeping up with the activities of each contractor. Timely, accurate data to
identify reasons for lack of progress and to identify potential future
constraints have been lacking. Moreover, follow-up, supervision and checking
on quality of installations has been inadequate.
2.       Impact of Field Drainage on Crop Yield.  The crop monitoring unit has
been conducting surveys to ascertain the effects of field drains on crop
yields since 1970/71. The procedure has been to compare net yield changes
after installation of field drains with yields of the same crop within or
outside the project area. Since yield differences were the only measurements
made, the results have been highly variable due to the effect of a number of
variables, such as, seed, disease and insect control, fertilization, other
cultural practices, management and other factors not known or identifiable.
Furthermore, the degree to which the tile drainage system after installation
was working or not working was not known, nor was the degree to which
waterlogging and salinity problems affected the control areas.
3.       To help the GOE in the problem of determining the influence of
drainage systems on crop yields, a bilateral program with the Netherlands
Government was instituted through support of the DRI. Under the auspices of
the Dutch-Egyptian Advisory Panel for Land Drainage in Egypt, DRI, with
assistance from Dutch experts, initiated a crash program on economic
evaluation of drainage projects in 1977. This program collected yield data on
four major crops (cotton, wheat, maize and rice), soil salinity information
and conducted interviews with farmers regarding inputs used in three pairs of
villages, one with tile drains and the other without. All villages sampled
were in the Delta.  During the 1980/81 season, information was secured on
water table depths, groundwater salinity and the status of the drainage
system. The procedure followed was an attempt to rectify the recognized
weaknesses of the EPADP program. The study was carried out from 1978 to 1981,
with a final report issued in September 1982. 1/
4.       The crash program study did not produce clear cut results.

villages varied from one set of villages to another. It was found that the
drainage systems in about 40X of the area in two villages were either not
required, or not functioning. In spite of the high degree of variation and
irregular pattern in yields obtained, it was concluded that tile drained areas
generally had higher crop yields than comparable non-tile drained areas.
Proposed M & E Program
5.       Under Drainage V Project, the Planning and Follow-up Department of
EPADP will now carry out two functions: (a) programming and monitoring the
physical and financial progress of the tile drainage program, and (b) M&E of
the depth of water table and such other aspects as may be appropriate in areas
to be provided with subsurface drains as well as those in which drains have
been installed. EPADP will staff the existing component units of the Planning
and Follow-up Department to the level necessary to assure success of the
program.
6.       Monitoring of Proiect Implementation.  The project would establish an
improved information system to monitor the project's overall progress, and
plan subsequent phases of the GOE's 10-year drainage program. It has been
agreed that expatriate and local short-terxm consultants, familiar with the
factors involved in the implementation of the tile drainage programs, be hired
for a total period of about 16 man-months. The consultants would assist in
establishing the methodology, training personnel and securing the kind and
type of equipment required to streamline data collection, storage and
retrieval. They would also assist in designing a format for reporting on
project implementation, including: (a) physical and financial aspects of the
project by component; (b) progress with procurement of civil works and
equipment, and (c) technical staff availability compared to requirements. The
reporting format would emphasize early identification by project management of
potential bottlenecks.
7.       Monitoring of Physical Parameters.  Tuc cxisting unit would be
strengthened to monitor and evaluate the depth of water table and such other
aspects as may be appropriate to ascertain that the design specifications and
construction standards are adequate to meet project objectives. Information
gathered by this unit will be valuable in identifying required changes in
design, construction or maintenance standards.  In addition, this unit will
coordinate with DRI for analyzing the relationship between water table, soil
salinity and crop yield. At its research farms, DLI, with Dutch assistance,
is carrying out work to determine the relationships between water table, soil
salinity and crop yield under controlled conditions.
8.       The procedure to be followed for monitoring the depth of water table
and soil salinity will be the same as that used in the Reconnaissance Survey
in the Drainage V Project investigations. The procedure was successful and
enabled EPADP to select those areas most in need of drainage. Measurements of
water table depth and soil salinity would be taken at one observation per
1,000 fed. Soil samples, a composite of the first 50 cm of the soil profile,

Page 3 of 3
would be made at the same time water table measurements are made to determine
soil salinity. The soil samples would be taken from 0-25, and 25-50 cm and
50-100 cm depth. For monitoring depth of water table, the existing network of
observation wells will be monitored by GRI and will be augmented over time.
For obtaining density of one observation per 1,000 fed, borings will be made
to depth of 2 meters, as was done in the Reconnaissance Survey. It is
ultimately intended to carry out this type of program on all the irrigated
lands under MOI jurisdiction over a five-year cycle. All measurements would
be repeated annually after installation of field drains until stable
conditions are reached. By repeated measurements of the above
drainage-related soil features, it would be possible to determine any positive
or negative trends over time.
9.       To properly conduct the field surveys, there will be need for only a
few additional staff. At the implementation rate of 150,000 fed per year, one
observation for every 1,000 fed would require observations to be made on 150
bore holes. For this, one agricultural engineer and one technician would be
required the first year, and another similar group each additional year of the
project. At year five, there would be five agricultural engineers and five
technicians involved. There would be a standard check sheet that each group
would have to complete and be responsible for the data collected. This
information would be made available to the other units in the Planning and
Follow-up Unit. To conduct water table (and required soil salinity
measurements) in selected sites where the MOA is securing its crop yield data,
EPADP would coordinate with MOA for the required number of sample sites.
These sites should be in or very near to the area where the tile drainage
program is in operation, or where it will be initiated within two years. The
analysis of the soil samples would be carried out by DRI and, for this
additional task, funds would be made available under the project.
10.      A detailed M&E program for the above activities would be prepared by
EPADP, including work schedule and organization. To assist EPADP in preparing
the program and in conducting a mid-term review, it has been agreed that
expatriate and local short-term consultants would be hired for a total period
of about 14 man-months. The consultants would also assist in designing
formats for data collection, evaluation and reporting. The program would make
maximum use of previous experience an4 would adopt appropriate and
cost-effective procedures for data collection and for establishing key
relationships.

Rate of Return Calculation
Assumptions:
1. Cost of open drain remodelling, tile drainage and maintenance are
based on unit rates derived from project cost estimates.
2. No allowance has been made for the residual value of machinery,
nor has allowance been made for the value of machinery taken over
from other projects, since these adjustments are approximately
offsetting.
3. All prices are converted at the exchange rate of £El.OOUS$0.80.
4.  Crop yields without the project are assumed to decrease linearly
over a ten-year period to the levels shown in Table 8.1
