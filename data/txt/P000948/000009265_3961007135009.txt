MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR A VOCATIONAL SKILLS INFORMAL SECTOR SUPPORT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 6.6 million (US$9.6 million equivalent). The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a project for improving
the skills of informal apprentices and mastercraftsmen who are already employed in the informal sector
in order to improve product quality and productivity in selected occupational areas. The Government and
beneficiaries will contribute US$2.8 million equivalent.
2.    Economic Background. Under the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) adopted in 1983, the
Ghanaian economy moved from a state of near collapse to a state of consistently strong growth. Real
GDP has grown at an annual average rate of around 5 percent since 1983, relative to an average of minus
2 percent during the previous decade. Significant policy reform and fiscal adjustment made such a
turnaround feasible. Policy reform involving the reform of the trade and exchange rate systems, the
elimination of price controls, liberalization of interest rates and investment regulations, created the
necessary incentives for efficient growth. In addition, increased revenue mobilization under the ERP
permitted the Government of Ghana (GOG) to invest substantially in the social sectors, including
education, while reducing fiscal deficits at the same time.
3.    However, the election-related fiscal shock of 1992 and subsequent developments have brought
the macroeconomic issue back to the fore. In the run-up to the 1992 elections, public service wage
increases and revenue slippages led to the re-emergence of relatively large fiscal deficits and their
financing mostly through increases in Central Bank credit. Although the fiscal situation improved
significantly in 1993 albeit not as much as planned and the economy grew by 5 percent, annual inflation
rose to 27 percent by December 1993. Lower GDP growth in 1994 and continued monetary expansion
originating from the Central Bank's financing of the deficit led to a further rise in inflation by the end
of 1994, which amounted to about 29 percent. However, stabilization efforts in 1995 are intended to re-
establish fiscal balance.
4.     Ghana's growth rate is projected to rise to 5.6 percent by the turn of the century. A higher
growth rate is predicated on the GOG's commitment to restore and maintain macroeconomic balance from
1995 onwards, proceed expeditiously with privatization, improve capacity in public and private sectors
and accelerate the investments in infrastructure and human resource development. In the immediate
years, most of the expected growth is likely to originate from agriculture, mining, financial services and
transport; higher manufacturing growth is projected to follow with a lag.
5.    Countrv/Sector Background. Ghana has approximately 16 million inhabitants and an annual
population growth rate of 3.1 percent (1992). It is well endowed with natural resources, including arable
land, forests, and sizable mineral deposits of gold, diamonds, bauxite, and manganese, as well as
considerable potential for hydroelectric power. The economy has traditionally depended on primary
production and exports of cocoa and minerals. Most of the Ghanaian labor force is employed in
agriculture. Agriculture production, primarily small scale, is concentrated in staple food crops and cocoa.
6.     Ghana's economic recovery program puts considerable emphasis on education and training to
provide the basic knowledge and skills required for development in both the formal and informal sectors.
The existence of a well trained workforce, able to adapt to changing market demands becomes even more



- 2 -
important as Ghana tries to accelerate its growth in the 1990s. The educational sector reform program
which started in 1987 at the primary and junior secondary levels, has been extended to the senior
secondary level in 1991, and to the tertiary level in 1994. The program has devoted great attention to
prevocational training, so that all students gain manual skills and dexterity as well as academic
knowledge, and thus will be more easily trainable to meet changing labor market demands.
7.     Although accurate labor force data is scarce, some information is available that provides an
indication of general trends. The Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) has shown that in 1991/92
about 32 percent of urban employment was in the informal sector whilst according to the Job and Skill
Program for Africa (JASPA) in 1989, 38.3 percent of the urban labor force, or 911,000 people were
employed in the urban informal sector, excluding those involved in the informal sector on a part-tine
basis. The same report estimated that urban informal sector employment was growing at about 5.6
percent per annum, whilst employment growth in the formal sector was less than 1 .0 percent per annum.
The JASPA report also estimated that the urban informal sector in Ghana was contributing around 22
percent of GDP.
8.     In 1991, there were 155 vocational and artisanal training centers run by ten different Government
agencies; and 250 private for profit and NGO run institutions, the largest number of which are involved
in training in commercial and secretarial areas.  The mnajority of these skill training centers, both
Governmental and private sector are poorly staffed and equipped, and do little to help their graduates find
productive and gainful employment. Virtually none provide short focused training for those already in
employment or in informal apprentice training schemes, but instead concentrate on training for formal
employment that does not exist.
9.     In 1990 the government established the National Council for Technical and Vocational Education
Training (NACVET), which falls jointly under the Ministries of Employment and Social Welfare
(MESW) and of Education (MOE). NACVET was set up by the Government in an attempt to rationalize
the whole system of vocational training, to help it build on the skills acquired in the new Junior
Secondary School system, and to enable training centers to integrate with formal and informal
apprenticeship schemes. The NACVET secretariat is responsible for preparing curricula for all the
different types of training institutions, for accreditation of courses, for arranging programs for the training
of teaching personnel, for monitoring and evaluation, for trade testing, and for servicing the Council.
It has not yet been involved in policy analysis.
10.    This project will draw from the conclusions of a 1989 sub-sector study, "Basic Education for
Self Employment and Rural Development" (Report No.7593-GH), especially those relating to the
importance of up-grading the skills of informal sector skilled workers in order to increase their earnings
and productivity, and also the need to restructure formal Ministry of Education training institutions so
that they will also offer short courses to informal sector apprentices.
11.    The project also draws from the work of an International Labor Organization (ILO) umbrella
project on developing strategies for achieving economic growth through micro and small enterprises
development in Ghana; and a United Nations Economic Commission in Africa pilot project on micro
enterprise development.
12.    Project design is largely based on three previous experiences launched between 1989 and 1992.
First, the retraining of 16,000 redeployees using informal sector master craftsmen under the Program of
Action to Mitigate the Social Costs of Adjustment. Second, providing short training for master craftsmen
and apprentices belonging to the Ghana National Association of Garages. Equipment kits were also given
to the trainees. This program was financed out of IDA's first and second Transport Rehabilitation
Projects. Third, a pilot especially designed as an input into the preparation of this project to find out the
extent to which public and private training institutions would be prepared to participate in short training
of youth already employed in the informal sector. The program was financed out of the Second Education



- 3 -
Sector Adjustment Credit (EdSAC, Cr. 2140-GH). Although evaluation of these training courses was
carried out, there has been no systematic evaluation of how the trainees have used their new skills. The
Government is aware of the need for such analysis, and through this project will establish a system of
tracer studies to monitor and evaluate training outcomes.
13.    From  these experiences and discussions with master craftsmen, apprentices, and trade
associations, it was apparent that there is a strong demand for short, highly focused competency-based
training in almost all skill areas. However the trade associations emphasized that training by itself,
though useful, was not enough. Basic but high quality tools are needed by the apprentices; and key
simple items of modern equipment by the master craftsmen. In addition, if any informal business is to
expand, then access to credit, and appropriate and convenient sites from which to operate are essential.
In response to these concerns, the Government is creating service sites from which informal craftsmen
can operate, and mutualist credit associations provide some credit.
14.    Project Objectives. The project has three main objectives. First, to redirect the focus of both
public and private vocational training institutions towards the provision of short, focused, practical,
competency based, demand driven training for people already in employment. Secondly, to improve
informal sector product quality and productivity in five selected occupational areas. Third, to create an
institutional capacity that will ensure that Government has access to regular labor force, employment, and
earnings data that will enable it to make reasoned decisions as to the types of training that should be
supported in future.
15.    To achieve the above objectives, a number of secondary objectives have been defined to (a)
strengthen the linkages between trade associations, and public and private training institutions; (b)
improve the content and relevance of training activities, including entrepreneurial training; (c) ensure that
graduating trainees have the necessary tools to apply productively what they have learnt; and (d) establish
a viable system for monitoring and analyzing the labor market on a continual basis.
16.    Proiect Description and Financing. The project will support short term training, equipment
provision, and institutional development in 14 public and 26 NGO and private training institutions in five
trade areas where demand appears to be greatest, namely: (a) electrical installation--to respond to demand
created by the national electrification program; (b) refrigeration and air conditioning--as an extension of
the electrical installation and expansion of the electric power network, as well as meeting environmental
needs to introduce non-chloroflurocarbon technologies; (c) woodworking and joinery--to respond to new
export regulations designed to increase the value added of timber exports; (d) dressmaking and tailoring--
to improve quality, productivity and efficiency in these occupations and increase the earning power of
women; and (e) blockwork and concrete products--to improve quality and durability of housing and public
infrastructure and increase efficiency of the construction industry.
17.    The project will concentrate on the following areas:
(a)    Short duration  practical courses  for  apprentices  and  mastercraftsmen/women
(US$3.7 million). The delivery of training services to the target population will be
carried out in all 40 Government and private training institutions mentioned in paragraph
16 above. Each of these is expected to conduct an average of three training cycles per
year per trade for approximately 5,000 apprentices and 1,000 masters. Any apprentice
or master will only be admitted into a training program if he or she possesses an intake
voucher, distributed by NACVET to the trade association for onward transmission to their
members. Over the project duration, it is anticipated that roughly 25,000 persons will
have their skills upgraded in the five occupational areas.  Support to the training
institutions will include: (i) provision of tools, equipment, and materials (US$2.3
million), (ii) staff training (US$0. 1 million), and (iii) upgrading of physical infrastructure
(US$0.6 million). Mastercraftsmen, in addition to being trained in the highest quality



-4 -
public technical institutes, will receive entrepreneurship training in MESW's Management
Training and Production Institute (US$0.7 million).
(b)   Assistance in obtaining tools and eguipment for trainees at a subsidized cost (US$6.1
million) to improve the quality of production when they return to the work place. In that
context, the project would procure basic tool kits that would be available to both
apprentices and masters at a subsidized cost. The tool kits would be inexpensive, and the
subsidy level adjusted so that it would never exceed the opportunity cost to the trainees
of attending the training. Trade associations will be involved in selecting the tool kits to
be used by their members. Proceeds from the sale of the tool kits will be deposited in
a revolving fund to be used for procuring additional training and tool kits.
(c)    Strengthening the capacity of the Planning, Budgeting. Monitoring and Evaluation
Division of the Ministry of Education (US$0.4 million) to set up a Tracer Study Unit for
designing and executing tracer studies both of formal vocational and skill training
programs, and of the new program under the project.
(d)    Developing the capacity of NACVET (US$0.9 million) in the areas of policy analysis,
competency based curriculum and materials development, and monitoring and evaluation
and to enable NACVET to ensure the smooth technical implementation of the project.
(e)    Carrying out a Labor Force Survey the Ghana Statistical Service will carry out the first
comprehensive labor force survey over the past two decades. There will be an in depth
inquiry into the structure and distribution of wages and conditions of work. Bench mark
data correlating these with educational and training qualifications will be collected.
Mutually consistent data on employment and unemployment and wage statistics in both
the formal and informal sectors, and in rural and urban areas will be collected and
analyzed. The sample frame and baseline will be given to MESW for regular updating.
The survey will be managed through this project but financed through the ongoing
Economic Management Support Project (Cr. 2224-GH).
(f)    Strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare (US$0.7
million) to collect, analyze, and regularly update labor force and employment data,
especially relating to the informal sector, to enable it to update on a twice yearly basis
the data from the Labor Force Survey established and carried out under this project by
the Ghana Statistical Service.  This will be done through the MESW's Public
Employment Centers and Employment Information Branch.
(g)   Providing for project management and coordination (US$0.6 million) for the daily
administrative implementation of the project. This would include adequate manpower,
office equipment and vehicles, staff training, and fieldwork.
18.    Proiect Implementation. All technical aspects of implementation will be the responsibility of
NACVET.   Physical aspects of implementation (procurement of goods, works and services,
disbursements, accounting and auditing) will be the responsibility of MOE's Projects Management Unit
which is responsible for all externally funded projects from all donors in the education sector. Also, as
the project is designed to assist those already employed through providing required short competency
based training at convenient times, extensive participation of the relevant trade associations and/or
mastercraftsmen in: (i) training program content, (ii) tool and equipment specification, and (iii) trainee
selection will be an essential aspect of project implementation.
19.    Proiect Sustainability. It is expected that the project's long-term sustainability will be achieved
through (a) forging links between training institutions, the trade associations, and the informal sector in



general; (b) establishing competency based training as an effective and viable approach to improve worker
productivity; (c) strengthening labor market data collection and analysis; (d) creating incentives for
training providers to shorten traditional long term training programs; (e) establishing a revolving fund
to ensure future training, tool kits, and equipment purchases; (f) ensuring that Government pays fees to
all training institutions from its own matching funds from project inception; and (g) creating an awareness
that training must be complemented by improvements in equipping the work place if it is to be effective.
Through the nurturing and acceptance of these concepts, it is expected that they will become part of the
education and training system and will remain as such beyond the life of the project.
20.    Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement.  The lessons drawn from the TRP and
EdSAC supported pilots in the design of the project have been discussed in paragraph 12 above. Other
Bank projects with similar objectives in Indonesia and Kenya have been considered during project
preparation. The main lessons from previous IDA projects in Ghana, which have been incorporated into
the project design are the need for a simple, coherent project structure, with a limited number of
procurement actions, a minimum amount of technical assistance, and some degree of flexibility during
implementation. Finally, there will also be annual reviews and a mid-term review which will allow for
a mid-course change in direction, if necessary.
21.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) and is specifically mentioned in the CAS that was discussed by the Board on April 14, 1994. It
is integral to the Government's objective of rapid growth and poverty reduction. Investments in human
resource development--especially primary education and vocational training--will not only be a key input
into private sector growth but will also ensure that the poor are sufficiently literate and skilled to benefit
from rapid growth. By supporting the provision of informal sector competency based training services
and by increasing the capacity of local institutions to manage the provision of such services the project
will contribute to both growth and poverty reduction.
22.    Both the 1987/88 and the 1991/92 GLSS show that a significant percentage of the population in
Accra and other large cities are classified as poor. Informal sector apprentices are amongst the urban
poor, and this project, by increasing the productivity and eventual earnings of these informal sector
workers will help reduce urban poverty. This is the first Bank education project in Ghana that has
provided direct assistance to private sector education and training institutions. There has been, up to
now, almost a complete lack of labor force, employment and earning statistics. The project will support
both the Ghana Statistical Service and the Labor Department of MESW in developing a capacity to
provide such data on a regular basis. It will also enhance the capacity of the MOE to carry out tracer
studies to find out what is happening to graduates of various programs run by public and private
institutions.
23.    The project has taken a relatively long time to develop (11' years) in order to ensure that its
quality at entry is high. According to the CAS, projects should have shorter life spans - this project is
to be implemented over five and a half years. The CAS also emphasized that there should be greater
Government involvement in project preparation - the project was entirely developed by a Government task
force. There should be involvement of implementing agencies in the project design stage - not only were
there four workshops involving beneficiaries, but also the leader of the Government task force has since
been appointed as the Project Manager for all vocational projects under the MOE.
24.    Given the paucity of reliable data on the informal sector and its training needs, it is felt that the
first project in this area should be relatively small, dealing with a limited number of trades and
institutions. The effectiveness of this approach and the degree of resistance from institutions as they
move away from time based to competency based training will be carefully monitored. In addition labor
force data will be collected, and used to identify skill areas that should be dealt with in any future
programs to be supported by public or donor sources. It is essential to move away from supply driven
programs, or worse still equipment supplier driven programs to a more demand driven approach.



- 6 -
Currently the main employment opportunities for new entrants to the labor force are in the informal
sector, and thus it is important for both growth and long-term social stability that informal sector
employment is encouraged and its productivity enhancement supported.
25.    Donor Coordination. Recent support to the sector by other donors incudes: (a) ILO/UNDP
US$2.0 million for competency based training, (b) Germany for assistance to selected National Vocational
Training Institutes, (c) Canada for support to the polytechnics, and (d) other support by the European
Union and various NGOs. An important element for the success of the project is to get the support and
involvement of other donors in competency-based short term training for the informal sector. In order
to sensitize other donors to the benefit of delivering the type of training financed under this project, and
to eventually agree on a common approach for the informal sector, dialogue between the Government,
the Bank, and the other donors has been undertaken and will be intensified. Part of this dialogue has
been taking place at the monthly education donor coordination meetings held in Accra where the project
concept has been discussed and where progress and results of the program could be demonstrated and
requests for support to allow the expansion of the program made. In addition, a Government/Donor
conference to establish new criteria for assistance in the sub-sector would be carried out at the mid-term
review of the project. Furthermore, the Government has prepared a Letter of Informal Sector Training
Development Policy which lays out the foundation for a Government overall strategy on vocational and
technical education with special attention to the development of the informal sector.
26.    Agreed Actions. The Government has (a) submitted to IDA a signed Letter of Informal Sector
Training Development Policy for the sub-sector laying out the foundation for a Government overall
strategy on vocational and technical education with special attention to the development of the informal
sector; (b) appointed a Project Manager and an Executive Director and his Deputy for NACVET, all with
qualification and experiences satisfactory to IDA; (c) presented a draft implementation manual containing
details on the physical and technical aspects of project implementation as well as a first year work
program; and (d) started a comprehensive nationwide labor force survey.  During negotiations
Govermnent agreed to (a) submit by September 30 of each year, the budget for the project for the
following year, which will show the needed Government matching fund contributions to project activities
by quarter, and thereafter implement such budget; (b) carry out a mid-term review between July and
December 1997, focusing on overall progress made in implementing project development and
performance objectives; the effectiveness of the training programs; and the quantitative deliveries. The
MOE will prepare, two months before the review, the report in sufficient detail for a comprehensive
review. Based on the review, an Action Plan, acceptable to IDA will be prepared by MOE for the further
implementation of the project; (c) carry out annual reviews to be held no later than October 31 of each
implementation year to assess progress and evaluate performance during the previous year especially
focusing on the ability of apprentices and masters to pay tuition fees and costs of tool and equipment kits;
review and agree on the work program and budgetary allocations for the following year; (d) use IDA's
standard bidding documents; (e) ensure that the Government shall maintain qualified and experienced
management personnel, assisted by competent staff in adequate numbers in NACVET; and (f) complete
the comprehensive labor force survey not later than August 31, 1996. As a condition of disbursements
for the release of funds to the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare for its Labor Force Data
System, the Government will appoint qualified staff to the Employment Information Bureau and the five
preliminary processing centers.
27.    Environmental Aspects. The project has been classified as category C, in view of its negligible
environmental impact.
28.    Program Obiective Categories. The project's major contribution aims, through the rationalization
and upgrading of vocational training, to improve informal sector productivity and to reduce poverty.
29.    Proiect Benefits. An awareness will be created of the inefficiencies of long, largely theoretical
vocational skill training for a modern sector employment that does not exist. The Government will



- 7 -
redirect a part of the resources it currently devotes to this long duration training to more effective, short
competency-based training for those already in informal sector employment or apprenticeship programs.
Both public and private training providers will become more responsive to labor market realities.
Training beneficiaries, represented by the informal sector trade associations, will play an increasing role
in determining training course content and trainee and equipment selection. The quality of goods and
services produced by the informal sector will improve and productivity and earninlgs will increase, which
will in turn lead to an expansion in informal sector employment.  The institutional structures for
managing an effective vocational training system will be strengthened, and eventually only those
institutions that offer meaningful training will be accredited and supported. A system will be developed
and put in place that will provide the Government with a regular source of up-to-date labor force data,
including data on changes in employment and earnings in different skill areas. Finally, donors will
redirect their support for vocational and skill training towards short demand driven programs.
30.    Risks. First, the key implementation agency, NACVET, thouglh created in 1990, has up to now,
played almost no role in the technical and monitoring aspects of managing the vocational skill training
system in Ghana. Second, public and private training providers are not yet fully committed to the
provision of practical competency based training for masters and apprentices who might have very low
academic qualifications. Third, participants in the new short courses might not always be drawn from
apprentices or others who are already employed, but from the unemployed who are ready to grasp at any
low cost training that might lead to their eventual employment.  Fourth, the unclear division of
responsibility between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare in
the area of vocational and skill training might lead to a dissipation of energies by these agencies on
matters not directly relating to project implementation. The first risk has been mitigated by the
appointment of the NACVET Director and Deputy Director as well as other key professional staff. The
second risk will take some time to be reduced, as only when the institutions have experience in providing
new short competency-based training will they be able to make a judgment as to how they might manage
such training in the long run. The third risk will be minimized by distributing "intake vouchers" to trade
associations for onward distribution to their members. As far as the final risk is concerned, an
independent consultant will make recommendations to cabinet as to the delineation of responsibility in
skill training between the two Ministries.
31.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
