ARGENTINb
ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           The Argentine Republic
Beneficiary:        Entidad Binacional Yacyreta (EBY)
Amount:             US$252.0 million equivalent of which
US$250.0 million for EBY and
US$ 2.0 million for Secretariat of Energy
Terms:              Repayment in 13 years  including  six  years of grace, with
interest at the Bank's standard variable rate.
Project
Objectives:         The project  is  designed  to  help  achieve  the following
sector objectives: (a) ensuring optimum resource allocation
by requiring adherence of the expansion program to least-
cost    principles;    (b)    implementing    a   Financial
Rehabilitation Plan (FRP) of the national power utilities;
(c) promoting rational use of  electricity through a tariff
system  based  on   economic   costs;   (d)  improving  the
efficiency of the  power  utilities;  (e) strengthening the
structure of the sector so as to bring about better
coordination, planning and regulation; and (f) establishing
policies and  procedures  for  environmental protection and
social aspects in power projects.
Project
Descriptions        The proposed  operation  would  help  finance the 1988-1989
time  slice   of  the  sector  investment  program.   Loan
proceeds would fund civil works and engineering of the
Yacyreta hydroelectric plant construction and technical
assistance to strengthen the Secretariat of Energy.
Project Benefits:  The project  would  enhance  the  allocation of Argentina's
scarce financial resources through an economic selection of
projects and setting of electricity prices, which, in turn,
would encourage rational use of energs resources. Sector
productivity would be improved through efficient operation
of existing installations and institution building efforts,
including better protection of environmental and social
aspects of power projects.
Risks:              The major risk facing the project  would be a lack of funds
to execute it under the envisioned time schedule. The main
cause for such lack of funds would be the inadequate
implementation   of   measures   included   in   the   FRP,
particularly  the  Government's   difficulties  in  keeping
tariffs in line with inflation and the complex arrangements
for resource transfers within the sector.

2. THE EIERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
2.01     Argentina's energy resources are diverse and abundant.  Proven and
potential gas reserves are estimated at 880 MMTOE (million tons of oil
equivalent) and proven and potential oil reserves at 560 MMTOE. Potential
coal reserves are also large, estimated at 220 MMTOE, but the low quality
of deposits, as well as their distance from consumption centers, make their
commercial exploitation doubtful. Uranium proven reserves are estimated at
400 MMTOE--or  the  consumption  of  about  8,000  MW  of nuclear installed
capacity for 30 years.    Hydropower  potential  is estimated at 44,000 MW,
equivalent to about 44 MMTOE p.a.--or 2,200 MMTOE over 50 years.
Demand and Supply of Energy
2.02     The country's energy  consumptior  in  1987  is  estimated at 47.4
MMTOE, resulting in a per capita consumption of 1.5 tons of oil equivalent
(TOE) p.a., compared with the Latin American average of 1.0 TOE p.a. The
country can be considered self-sufficient, although it imports gas from
Bolivia under a 1972 contract--which is scheduled to expire in 1992.
2.03     The  pattern  of  energy  consumption  has  changed  significantly
lately.   As  proven  gas  reserves  have  increased  and  gas  fields have
developed, gas has substituted for oil in industry and electricity
generation. This trend is expected to continue beyond 1990, with increased
use of natural gas in power generation (para. 1.16), industry and
households. In anticipation, the Government is expanding the capacity of
its gas pipelines.    Substitution  of  oil  would  also  continue with the
commissioning of large hydroprojects currently under corstruction (para.
2.17).
National Energy Policy and Sector Objectives
2.04     Argentina's energy policies have not fostered efficient use of the
country's energy resources. Distorted pricing policies are believed to be
the main problem since, for long periods of time, the Government allowed
prices of oil derivatives and electricity to decrease in real terms.
Additionally, wrong investment decisions have led to the development of an
expensive nuclear power program, while the economic criteria traditionally
adopted for planning the electricity sector have: (a) promoted the
installation of questionable large hydroplants (para. 2.16); and (b) not
provided for an adequate balance among generation, transmission and
distribution facilities (para. 2.18).
2.05     The  Government  recently  completed  an  energy  plan  whose main
objectives are:    (a)  to  increase  the  contribution  of  gas  and hydro
resources to the country's energy supply; (b) to increase oil exploration
efforts in order to improve the reserve/production ratio; and (c) to
correct pricing distortions and foster conservation and substitution.
Specifically, the country is expected to maintain its energy independence



-4-
through the year 2000 bv increasing the shares of gas and hydroelectricity
in the country's energy balance (gas:    from  25X  in 1986 to 362 in 2000;
hydro:  from 112 to 15?), reducing oil's share from 47? to 37?.  The energy
plan is a valuable planning tool which requires systematic updating to
ensure cost-effective and balanced use of resources.
Institutional Structure
2.06     A chart with the organization of the energy sector is presented in
Annex 2.1. The Ministry of Public Works and Services (MOSP) controls the
energy  sector  through  the   Energy   Secretariat  (SE)  and  the  Public
Enterprises Directorate (DEP).   The  SE  is  in  charge of defining sector
policies.    SE  is  responsible   for:       (a)  overall  energy  planning;
(b) granting of concessions for exploration and exploitation of petroleum
and gas fields and for electricity power supply; (c) pricing policies; and
(d) policies for energy conservation and development of new sources of
energy. The SE has limitations for contracting personnel and usually
resorts to borrowing staff from AyE and SEGBA, but still is weak in
fulfilling its wide range of responsibilities. The proposed project would
support the strengthening of the SE's technical staff [para. 3.06(b)]. The
DEP is responsible for supervising the operational performance of the major
public enterprises, including those of the oil and gas and electricity
sectors. In theory the DEP is also responsible for authorizing tariff
adjustments; in practice the Ministry of Economy retains the final
authorization because of the Government's price setting policy (paras. 2.21
and 2.22).
B. THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
Legal Framework and Regulation
2.07     The legal framework of  the  power  sector does not facilitate its
comprehensive, coherent regulation.   Furthermore, the autonomy provided to
the provinces by the Constitution permits them to set rules which often do
not foster economy and efficiency (e.g. establishment of royalties on the
use of hydro resources, setting of tariffs to the final user which have no
relationship with costs, application of taxes and other surcharges over and
above electricity rates, etc.). It is expected that a review of the sector
organization, currently being carried out by the SE (paras. 2.11 and 2.14),
would  provide   recommendations   for   addressing   the  above  problems.
Additionally, the Government is improving coordination of the sector by
making  effective  use  of   the   Federal  Electricity  Council  (CFE),  a
coordinating body with representation of the SE, the national utilities and
the provincial authorities responsible for the power sector (usually their
Ministries of Public Works). Recently, the CFE has played an instrumental
role in recommending actions to the Government aimed to correct tariff
imbalances.
Organization
2.08     The  Argentine  power   sector   has   a  fragmented  and  complex
organization. Most of the power facilities are owned by the federal and
the  provincial  governments,   although   autogeneration,  mainly  in  the
hydrocarbon and mining industries, contributes with an important share of
the total country's production (about 102 in 1987). National utilities are
in charge of the development, production, transmission and distribution of



- 5 -
electricity and of the development of binational hydro resources. There
are about 20 provincially-owned utilities mainly in charge of distribution
of electricity (para. 2.11).
2.09     The country's utilities owned by  the Federal Government and their
role in the power sector are the followir.g:
Servicios ElEctricos del Gran Buenos Aires (SEGBA), in charge of
generation, subtransmission, and distribution in the Greater Buenos Aires
area (see Annex 2.2.1).
Agua  y  Energia   Electrica   (AyE),   in  charge  of  nationwide
generation, transmission and bulk supply, and also distributes electricity
in  a  few  provinces.      It  has  responsibilities  in  integrated  basin
development, irrigation, flood control, drainage and land reclamation (see
Annex 2.2.2).
Hidroel4ctrica   Norpatag6nica    (HIDRONOR),    responsible   for
developing the hydro resources of the Northern Patagonia region (see Annex
2.2.3).
In addition, the Government participates in two binational entities with
Uruguay and Paraguay, which are, respectively:
Comisi6n Tecnica Mixta del Salto Grande (CTMSG), in charge of the
Salto Grande Hydroelectric Plant (1620 MW), operating since 1Q80.
Entidad Binacional Yacyreta (EBY), in charge of the construction
and eventual operation of the Yacyreta Hydroelectric Plant (see Annex
2.2.4).
The Federal Government also owns the Comisi6n Nacional de Energia
At6mica (CNEA), an agency in charge of nuclear research and applications.
Under this role, CNEA builds and operates nuclear power plants which
supply energy to  the  sector's  interconnected  system.   The CNEA reports
directly to the presidency and, since its creation in 1950, has been
managed independently from the energy sector (see Annex 2.2.5).
2.10     The MOSP, through DEP,  has  direct  controi of the three national
utilities: AyE, SEGBA and HIDRONOR. EBY reports directly to the MOSP, and
CTMSG to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A national dispatch center (DUC)
operated by AyE is in charge of coordinating the operations of the larger
electricity producers (AyE, SEGBA, CTMSG, HIDRONOR and CNEA) to ensure
reliability and economic use of generation facilities.
2.11     Some of the  provincial  utilities  own generation facilities, but
most of them distribute electricity purchased from AyE. The most important
are in the provinces of Buenos Aires, C6rdoba, Mendoza and Santa Fe. Most
of the provincial utilities were created in 1979, when the Government made
arrangements with provinces to transfer distribution responsibilities from
AyE to them. The arrangements provided for the transfer of the physical
facilities and assets but did not relieve AyE of the corresponding
liabilities. The transfer from AyE resulted in the formation of a number
of provincial utilities with weak managerial and institutional structures.
Also, because of the autonomy which the provinces enjoy, coordination of



system operations and development D tween SE and the national utilities and
the provincial utilities is  weak.    The  study of the sector organization
agreed upon under the revised covenants of the Yacyreta Project (para.
2.14) and the studies being carried out under the Power Engineering
Project, Loan 2751-AR (paras. 2.15 and 2.18), are expected to provide the
basis for improving coordination between the Federal Government and the
provincial utilities.
The Electric Power Market and Existing Facilities
2.12     The degree of  electrification  in  Argentina  is high compared to
other Latin American countries.   About 792 of Argentina's inhabitants ha,ve
access to electricity. Almoqt all the urban centers and about 50? of the
rural  population  have  electricity   service.    Electricity  per  capita
consumption was about 1450 kWh in 1987 (compared with 1,100 kWh per year
for Brazil and 270 kWh per year for Bolivia). Consumption increased at a
rate of  6.1Z  p.a.  in  the  period  1970-1980.    It  slowed  after 1980,
reflecting the difficult economic situation, reaching 2.8Z in the period
1980-1984 and decreasing by 2.22 in 1985. Consumption growth recovered in
1986 and 1987, however, at a high rate (7.4? p.a.). In 1987 industrial
consumption accounted for 48? of total consumption from public service
utilities and  residential  and  commercial  for  40?.   Demand projections
prepared in the past tended te be over-optimistic. The SE corrected this
bias in the recent revision of the demand projection which was used to
define the expansion sector plan (paras. 2.16 and 2.19). The revised
projections were found satisfactory by the appraisal mission and show a
global electricity demand increase of about 6.0? in the period 1987-1995
which is consistent with expected GDP growth rates of 3.5? for 1989 and 4?
for 1990 and beyond (Annex 2.3.1).
2.13     Most of  the  country's  power  facilities  are  installed  in the
National  Interconnected  Svstem  (SIN),  which  covers  about  90?  of the
nation's electricity market.  The  total  installed  capacity of the SIN by
end 1987 was 12,802 MW of which 5,960 MW (46?) was hydro, 5,824 MW (46?)
conventional thermal and 1,018 MW (8?) nuclear (Annex 2.3.2). A 500 kV
transmission system links the major consumption areas with the production
centers and is used for the transfer of large blocks of energy. A network
of 230 kV lines completes the grid and permits energy transfers between
production and load centers.
2.14     Performance of the national utilities  is uneven and  reflects the
sector's fragmented organization. The utility most affected by the overall
sector problems is AYE, whose performance is weak in all aspects:
managerial, staffing, operations and finances.   This is the result of many
years of political interference, high rotation of personnel and financial
difficulties. SEGBA, which has been a traditionally well-run utilitv, has
lately also been affected by the sector institutional and financial
deterioration. HIDRONOR is probably the best sector utility oerformer.
EBY is currently a well-organized and well-run institution. The Government
is addressing the utilities' operational problems by carrying out a study
to improve the sector organization and efficiency and accountability of the
national utilities.    During  appraisal,  agreement  was  reached with the
Government on terms of reference and specific timetable to complete this
study. During negotiations, it was agreed that completion of the study by
March 31, 1989 would be a covenant of the proposed loan (para. 4.01(a)].

Planning and Investmznnt
- Organization
2.15     Planning of the generation  and  transmission systems is under the
responsibility of the SE which updates the planning studies every two
years.  Demand projections  are  produced  by  a  working group composed of
r-nresentatives of the electricity companies under the supervision of the
SE; this arrangement is working satisfactotily since it provides for the
Government economic policies to be taken into account in the projections
and permits an adequate exchange of views regarding methods and criteria.
Generation expansion is based on the interactive use of two mathematical
models: (a) an investment selection model based on linear programming
which defines the optimum final configuration of the system for pericds of
three years; and (b) a simulation model which defines more precisely the
dates when additions to generatiorn are required. Transmission expansion is
defined  on  the  basis   of  state-of-the-art  conventional  studies  with
assistance of  foreign  consultants.    Distribution  expansion planning is
under  the  responsibility  of  each   distribution  utility.    There  are
differences in planning and design and in equipment standards among
utilities which do not permit adequate integration. This problem is being
addressed under Loan 2751-AR (paras. 2.18 and 3.18).
- Expansion Plan
2.16     Although  the  sector's  methodology  in  defining  the least-cost
solution for generation expansion is sound, the Bank has had reservations
regarding the assumptions made and economic parameters selected in the
past. These reservations concerned, in particular, a discount rate of 82
p.a., lower than the estimated opportunity cost of capital for Argentina
(122) and the reluctance to consider gas-fueled thermal plants for
operation in the base of the load cycle in future power generation studies.
In addition, demand projections were consistently over-optimistic. These
assumptions biased the results of planning exercises towards hydro projects
with high level of investments while they undervalued the potential
contribution to power generation of the sizeable reserves of natural gas
available in the country.    Demand projections were satisfactorily revised
downward by the SE (para. 2.12). Following long discussions on the matter,
during appraisal agreement was reached on the adoption of a 12? p.a.
discount rate in the  expansion  plan.    This  has resulted in substantial
changes to the expansion plan; major hydroprojects have been cancelled or
postponed while gas-fueled base thermal plants appear as the best option
for the future and a sizeable reduction in the investment requirements was
achieved. This agreement constituted the first step in the rationalization
of sector investments and sets the framework for a sounder approach to the
development  of  electric  power  resources  and  services.   Additionally,
during negotiations it was agreed that the SE would engage consultants,
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, to carry out a study on
thermal generation options: (i) to evaluate the operating conditions of
existing thermal plants and recommend a rehabilitation program for the
units deemed to have deteriorated; and (ii) in order to further optimize
the thermal-based expansion, examine the merits of introducing the combined
cycle alternative and the possibility of achieving utilization factors for
existing and future thermal plants in line with international standards for



- 8 -
planning and operation. This study should be completed in time to be used
in the required April 30, 1989 update of the sector expansion plan [paras.
2.17 and 4.01(b)]. Terms of reference for the proposed study are attached
as Annex 2.3.3.
2.17     The 1988-1995 sector expansion  program,  which provides the basis
for  the  proposed  project,  was   prepared  for  appraisal  under  agreed
principles and methodologies and constitutes the least cost sequence to
meet the demand projections for the period. It includes generation works
to be developed by AyE, HIDRONOR and EBY, transmission works by SEGBA, AyE
and HIDRONOR, and distribution works by SEGBA and AyE. The generation
projects included in the program are among those which originated from
expansion plans prepared in the 1970s on the basis of unduly optimistic
demand growth expectations and the other inappropriate assumptions already
described. This has been corrected subsequently, as noted in para. 2.16,
in the course of the Government's recent coming to grips with the macro-
economic and fiscal implications of past sector planning. The completion
of such projects, and their associated transmission systems in a time
schedule compatible with the revised demand projections, was an outcome of
the least cost planning exercise. The only two new projects in the period
are gas fueled thermal plants with a size module (325 MW) compatible with
forecast demand increases. Generation works to be implemented as well as
energy and power balances for the SIN are detailed in Annexes 2.4.1 and
2.4.2.    Scheduling  of  ths  new  projects,  especially  projects  to  be
commissioned beyond 1995, will be periodically reviewed in the light of (i)
updated demand projections; and (ii) results of the studies on generation
options outlined in para. 2.16 above.   To ensure that appropriate measures
to implement the optimum sector expansion program are taken, during
negotiations it was agreed with the Government that: (i) by April 30, 1989
and every April 30 thereafter, the SE will update: (a) the sector expansion
plan under methodologies and assumptions mutually agreed upon [para.
4.01(c)]; and (b) the financing schemes for major projects to assure that
inter alia commiss_'oning dates required by the expansion plan are feasible
(para. 4.01(d)]; and (ii) it will authorize the initiation of construction
of any major public power generation or transmission project only if such
project is in accordance with the sector expansion plan and has an adequate
financing plan [para. 4.01(e)].
2.18    Iavestments in distribution  expansion  have been neglected during
the last few years because of the difficult financial situation of the
sector and the priority given to financing of large hydroprojects under
construction. The transfer of distribution networks to the provincial
utilities (para. 2.11) has resulted in deterioration of distribution
networks, poor  customer  service,  a  decrease  of  system reliability and
substantial increase in  technical  losses  and  energy theft (para. 2.26).
The Government is attempting to correct this imbalance through: (i)
increasing emphasis on distribution investments,  as indicated by the SEGBA
expansion program (SEGBA V project  financed  under Loan 2854-AR); and (ii)
defining  nationwide  reliability   criteria   for  distribution  expansion
compatible with those used for generation and transmission expansion, as a
result of the studies under Loan 2751-AR (paras. 2.15 and 3.18).
- The Nuclear Power Program
2.19     Decisions on the nuclear power program have been taken outside the
sector for other-than-economic  reasons.    CNEA  has developed the largest



- 9 -
nuclear power program in the region, which is much more costly than other
power sources. Currently, CNEA has two nuclear power plants in operation
with an installed capacity of 1,018 MW (Atucha I, 370 MW and Embalse, 648
MW) and a third plant under construction (Atucha II, 745 MW). A fourth
nuclear plant has been planned by CNEA for the year 2000 under an initial
agreement with a foreign supplier, but the Government is currently delaying
any commitment on this matter due to the high investments involved. Atucha
II is a very expensive project whose original high cost has been aggravated
by implementation delays and cost overruns.   The original project cost was
estimated at about US$1600 million (1979 price level). Currently, after
completing 60X of the project, investments still to be made amount to about
US$1470  million  (January  1988   price   level).    This,  together  with
difficulties to provide further financing, has led the Government to
consider  cancelling  the  project.    The  Bank  analysis  of  this option
(summarized in Annex 2.4.3), was based on an economic comparison with a
conventional thermal plant and considered that investments already made are
sunk costs. It concluded that even though the project should not have been
started, there are not sufficient grounds to recommend its cancellation
given the advanced status of implementation and the economic costs to be
incurred in the cancellation of the contracts for equipment and services
with the degree of  commitments  already  made.   However, as nuclear power
will be clearly an uneconomic choice in Argentina in the foreseeable
future, and as during negotiations agreement was reached on criteria for
implementation of new projects that allows the Bank to require that the
expansion be based upon least cost principles (para. 2.17), the Government
could not initiate uneconomic projects, such as a new nuclear power project
without Bank's concurrence.    Additionally,  to  ensure  that the costs of
inefficiencies resulting from the development of nuclear power do not
burden electricity consumers, it was agreed that: (i) CNEA would obtain
sector-generated funds only after the financial requirements of other
sector utilities have been fully met; and (ii) bulk tariff which CNEA
charges to DUC will not be higher than the maximum bulk sale price of the
generating utilities supplying to the SIN [para. 4.01(f)].
- Investment
2.20     The 1988-1995 sector investment  program  has an estimated cost of
US$7,931 million (Annex 2.4.4) as shown below:

Electricity Pricing
2.21     Argentina's  electricity  pricing  system  is  quite  complex.   A
substantial part of the revenues of each sector utility is paid to the
Federal Government in the form of a value added tax (VAT) and to earmarked
Electricity Funds in the form of surcharges which, return to the sector as
government equity contributions. Also, a portion of taxes on the sale of
petroleum products flows to the power sector to help fund its investment
requirements.   Annex  2.5.1  gives  a  description  and  projection of the
electricity and energy funds.   In  addition  to  the above taxes the final
user also pays provincial and municipal taxes as part of his utility bill
which vary substantially throughout the country.
2.22     Tariff structures, except SEGBA's  to  a  certain extent, have not
been designed on  the  basis  of  economic  criteria.    While the national
average level of tariffs including taxes and surcharges is in line with the
estimated national average economic cost, there are significant differences
among utilities as similar consumers pay prices which are considerably
higher or lower without relation to their corresponding estimated economic
costs (see Annex 2.5.2). This has been caused in part by the difficulties
associated with the management of utility prices in a high inflation
environment and the autonomy of provinces to set their own rates.
2.23     The Bank and the Government  have maintained a continuous dialogue
on possible ways and means to improve this complex tariff situation with
aims to establish a price system (structure and levels) which would reflect
the economic costs  of  the  service.    Under  the  1986 amendment to Loan
1761-AR, the SE is preparing a tariff study based on LRMC principles which
is expected to provide the basis for restructuring the tariff system.
Major results of the study are expected by February 1989. Under the
proposed project, during negotiations it was agreed with the Government
that the results of the tariff study would be implemented in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank [para. 4.01(g)].
Sector Finances
- Past Performance
2.24     Over the past several years the  sector has had to bear the impact
of changing economic policies and the burden of an investment program
decided at a time when demand growth expectations were higher and external
financing had been assumed to be easily available. During 1976-1982 the
sector incurred a high level of external indebtedness, to a large degree
prompted by the Government which in such manner was financing a substantial
portion of its foreign currency needs.   The major devaluation of the local
currency that followed placed a heavy debt service burden on the sector and
caused  a  major  deterioration  in   its  financial  structure  which  has
subsequently been somewhat  corrected  by  the  refinancing of the sector's
debt.  However, since 1986, the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, to
which the Austral  is  pegged,  is  again  causing  problems because of its
effect on the sector's investment and debt service programs which have
significant components of Japanese and European hard currencies.
2.25     The recent economic difficulties  also resulted in a deterioration
of financial discipline  among  public  sector  entities.   Arrears for the



- 11 -
purchase of electricity by national, provincial and municipal agencies and
by autonomous agencies mounted.   As  of  December 31, 1987, the balance of
accounts receivable from electricity consumers of the three federally-owned
utilities was as follows (in US$ million):
No. of                  Of Which:        Of Which:
Utility        Days       Balance       Overdue       Public Sector 1/
AyE             167        223.2        184.4            134.4
HIDRONOR         96         31.1         12.4             12.0
SEGBA           63         107.4         48.7             28.2
1/ Excludes debt from other national utilities
As can be seen from the above table, the public sector had overdue accounts
of about  US$175  million  to  the  power  sector.    Loan 2854-AR includes
commitments to reduce SEGBA's accounts receivable from the public sector
and from all customers.    Collection  of  receivables showing a decreasing
trend is part of the set of performance indicators agreed upon under the
proposed operation (para. 3.18).
2.26     Argentina's  recent  economic   difficulties   may   have  been  a
contributing factor to the increase in electricity theft which accounts to
a sizeable degree for the increase in distribution losses that has been
taking place since  1981.    The  financial  problems  of  the power sector
itself, however, were also an important contributing factor for the
increase in distribution losses as they resulted in curtailment of
expenditures in  network  expansion  and  maintenance.    SEGBA, under Loan
2854-AR, is to carry out an electricity loss reduction nrogram to address
this sector issue and the performance indicators agreed upon under the
proposed operation also include targets for reduction of electricity losses
(para. 3.18).
2.27     In March  1986,  the  Federal  Government  prepared  a  program to
address the various financial problems faced by the sector and the
covenants under Loan 1761-AR were amended to reflect the agreements then
reached. The key aspects of these agreements are:
(a) to increase the internal cash generation of the sector;
(b) to reach a prudent mix of self financing and external borrowings;
and
(c) to review annually the financial targets for the federal utilities
for the following year.
During 1987, the targets defined for the above objectives were not achieved
basically  because  of  a   higher-than-expected  inflation  which  reduced
revenues, in real terms. In compensation the Government has returned to
the sector a larger proportion of taxes collected from it than anticipated.

- National Utilities Financial Rehabilitation Plan (FRP)
2.28     Based on the policies outlined above and facing the new realities,
in late 1987 the Government, with Bank assistance, started preparation of a
Financial  Rehabilitation  Plan  (FRP)   which  would  reverse  the  dismal
financial situation of the national utilities which, at present, have
negative rates of return and are significantly dependent on Government
contributions (Annex 2.6.1).   The  FRP  relates  to  the group of national
utilities (AyE, SEGBA and HIDRONOR) which account for about 60? of sector
operations. The basic principles agreed upon between the Bank and SE for
the preparation of the FRP were as follows:
(a) each utility and the consolidated group of national utilities
would show clear improvement trends to be measured particularly by
the cash operating ratio (cash operating expenses as a percentage
of revenues)  and  by  the  contribution  to  investment from non-
borrowed sources, all within a reasonable level of indebtedness;
(b) the required overall tariff increases would be made in a phased
manner consistent with the stabilization program;
(c) to balance the financial situation among utilities;
(d) the investment program for each utility would be strictly in line
with the least-cost expansion of the sector agreed with the Bank;
and
(e) the working capital needs would reflect sound practices of power
utility financial management, especially regarding collection and
payment periods.
2.29     The detailed  financial  projections  for  each  of the individual
national utilities and the consolidated group are included in Annex 2.6. A
summary of the 1988-1995 flow of funds under the FRP is shown in the
following table:

- 13 -
2.30     The PRP is based on a  set  of assumptions which take into account
the limitations imposed by the stabilization program on (i) rate increases
and on the corresponding availability of Electricity and Energy Funds
(Annex 2.5.1), (ii) Government contributions, to be used mainly for debt
service payments, and (iii) borrowings, committed for ongoing projects and
to be committed to finance the foreign cost component for future projects.
Annex 3.2 gives a detail of the above assumptions. The resulting cash
operating ratio (cash operating expenses as a percentage of operating
revenues) would have a steady and positive trend as shown by the following
tables
1988   1989   1990   1991   1992   1993
Cash Operating Ratio (Z)       91.0   81.0   78.7   68.4   64.4   61.1
The FRP shows in its funding mix that the internal fund generation of the
national utilities would increase steadily and with the contribution of
ele!tricity  and  energy  funds  would   show  a  healthy  contribution  to
inveitment, as shown in the following table:

-Sector Financing Plan (National Utilities and EBY)
2.31     With due regard to the fact  that Yacyreta is a binational project
belonging to Argentina and Paraguay (Annex 3.1.4), tut considering that the
bulk of the funding for the project is channeled through Argentina, a
conventional definition of sector as the consolidation of EBY (Annex 2.6.5)
and the national utilities FRP (Annex 2.6.1) would result in the following
financial plan:

The above financing plan is viable and adequate as the assumption, used for
its preparation (see para. 2.28) are reasonably conservative and the
resulting funding mix is a sound  one.   Its feasibility during the project
execution period (1988-1989) has a high degree of certainty because of
commitments already made by the Government during negotiations (paras. 3.13
and 3.14). These commitments refer basically to the assumption of service
payments of existing debt and annual increases of tariffs in real terms.
Regatding tariffs, during the first eight months of 1988, the Government
has given positive evidence of its willingness to increase tariffs in order
to comply with  the  targets  of  the  FRP.    Besides  the monthly nominal
increases that have been implemented to  keep  up with inflation, in July a
15? average increase in the tariffs of SEGBA was carried ouit with the
intention of reducing significant differences between its tariffs and those
of the provincial utilities, and in early August a general increase of 30Z
was  established  for  all   tariffs   in  anticipation  of  the  so-called
'voluntary' price freeze under the Government's Spring Plan. The following
table summarizes the present situation as compared with the December 1987
average tariff levels:
SEGBA     AyE        HIDRONOR
December 1987 (A/MWh)       168.0       79.4       66.9

It is expected that by year end s.me deterioration ir real terms will occur
but that tariff levels will be enough to reach the 1988 targets established
under the FRP.
Bank Participation
2.32     Since 1962, the Bank  has  made  eight  loans to Argentina's power
sector; five of which were to SEGBA to help finance an oil-fired thermal
generation  plant,  and   transmission,  subtransmission  and  distribution
expansions; one to HIDRONOR for the construction of the 1200 MW El Chocon
Hydroelectric Plant; and two to the Federal Government, the first one in
1979 to help finance the Yacyreta Hydroelectric Project and the second one,
in 1987, for a Power Engineering Project which is expected to provide the
basis for improving the efficiency and economy of distribution expansions
countrywide. Project performance audit reports have concluded that, while
the physical objectives of the first five projects were largely met, their
financial objectives were not.   The  latest  of these reports, on SEGBA IV
Project (Loan 1330-AR, approved in September 1976 and completed in June
1985), indicates that the project was successful in meeting its technical
and physical objectives of providing facilities to meet the growing
electricity demand of the Greater Buenos Aires area, and that SEGBA
succeeded in improving its overall efficiency during the period of project
execution. However, because of the lower-than-eypected demand and also
because of the poor financial situation of SEGBA, the project suffered a



- 15 -
completion delay of 4.5 years and a 40X increase in total costs. Moreover,
the Government's failure to implement adequate tariff increases prevented
SEGBA from complying with its financial covenants except for a short period
of time, and its financial performance was poor.
2.33     Initial execution  of  the  Yacyreta  project suffered significant
implementation problems (para. 3.01), while the Power Engineering Project
(Loan 2751-AR) is progressing satisfactorily.    A US$276.0 million loan to
SEGBA which will help SEGBA finance its transmission and distribution
expansion program, improve its ope; ional performance and reduce losses,
was signed in June 1988.
Bank and Country Goals and Sector Lending Strategy
2.34     The Government is seeking  to  improve resource allocation and the
efficiency of national and provincial utilities and restore the financial
soundness of the sector by:
(a)  sharpening the  delineation  of  responsibility  for  planning and
implementing the expansion of electricity services for which:
(i)     planning  for  all  new   investments  in  generation  and
transmission facilities will be centralized in the SE;
(ii)    only  the  national  utilities   will  implement  all  new
generation and high voltage transmission works; and
(iii)   coordination  between  national  and  provincial utilities
will be strengthened.
(b)  establishing  efficiency  improvement  programs  for  the national
utilities;
(c) initiating a medium term program of tariff structure reform and
rate increases so as to reflect economic costs over a reasonable
period of time; and
(d)  improving the self-financing capabilities  and operating ratios of
the major power companies.
2.35     The Bank  fully  agrees  with  these  objectives  and, within such
framework, its lending strategy in the sector aims at:
(a) ensuring optimum allocation of scarce financial resources through:
(i)   confining the investment  programs  to projects which adhere
to least-cost principles;
(ii)  productivity improvements; and
(iii) a tariff system based on economic principles.
(b) implementing an institution building plan which would streamline
and improve the sector's organization and legal structure;



- 16 -
(c) promoting the financial soundness of the sector, particularly the
improvement of the sector's contribution to investment; and
(d) helping the Government meet the large financial requirements of
the sector.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.36     The proposed operation would be  the  first in a planned series of
sector investment loans intended to assist the Government to attain the
aforementioned objectives (paras.  2.34  and  2.35).    The envisaged loans
would address sector issues in a phased manner: conditionality for a single
sector loan would concentrate on a few key targets in the short-term
(during the two to three year disbursement period), within a long-term
strategy. The new approach intends to relate sector and macroeconomic
policies more realistically within the constraints of existing country
conditions. By improving sector resource allocation, it would also help to
rationalize power investments and promote the integration of hydrocarbons
and hydropower sectors in investment planning and decisions. Further, in
addition to strengthening its direction of the sector and overcoming some
of its most severe problems, the Government would be assisted under the
proposed  operation  to maintain   the   implementation  of  the  Yacyreta
Hydroelectric Plant Project, whose financial requirements constitute the
most important resource need to be resolved in the short term.

3. THE PROJECT
Proiect Origin and Status of Preparation
3.01     The Yacyreta project, for which the Bank approved in 1979 a US$210
million loan (Loan 1?61-AR), has suffered significant implementation
problems which have caused an eight-year delay in the completion schedule
and i sizeable financial  gap.    The  implementation problems began at its
inception, with a protracted dispute between the Government and the Barnk
over procurement procedures, and was only resolved by end-1982. Later on,
works were stopped  because  of  the  South  Atlantic  War.   The country's
economic recession and high inflationary trend during 1983-1984 worsened
the sector's--and the project's--financial situation. These problems were
further compounded by the following events: (a) the Executing Agency, EBY,
has been unable to fully secure the financing which had been foreseen at
appraisal from foreign commercial banks (US$945 million), suppliers credits
(US$830 million) and local banks (US$300 million); (b) the project's seven-
year delay caused (i) repayment of principal of most of contracted debt to
become due; (ii) increased financial charges; and (iii) foregoing of
internal cash generation from energy sales (estimated at US$1,884 million
at appraisal).
3.02     For these reasons and in order to seek possible economies, the new
authorities, early in 1984, made a thorough evaluation of possible options
regarding the fate of the project, including cessation of works. After
careful consideration of engineering, economic, internal and international
factors, the Government decided to complete the project, and appointed a
new management with the mandate to carry out an in-depth revision and
optimization of the project.   This  resulted in changes in project design,
renegotiation of contracts with construction and engineering firms and a
rescheduling of project execution to adapt the pace of commissioning of the
project's units to  updated  demand  projections.   Important reductions of
cost were also obtained.   The  Government placed great emphasis on seeking
adequate financing for project completion and, in 1986, the Government
requested additional IBRD/IDB financing to complete it.
3.03     Processing of a possible Bank loan had been delayed because of the
uncertainties  emerging  from   country   conditions   which  had  hindered
preparation of a comprehensive and viable sector Financial Rehabilitation
Plan (FRP). It was subsequently agreed to change the approach to power
lending for Argentina from project specific loans to sector investment
loans so as to link better Bank lending with the investment needs and
financial conditions of the  sector.    The  project  was appraised in June
1988. Negotiations were held in Washington from September 26 to 28, 1988.
The Argentinian delegation was headed by Mr. Ramon da Bouza, Director for
External Economic and Financial Policy, Ministry of Economy.
Legal Arrangements
3.04     The Borrower of the  proposed  US$252.0  million loan would be the
Government, which would retain US$2.0 million for SE and onlend the



- 18 -
remaining US$250.0 million under the same terms and conditions to EBY,
which would bear the risks related  to  exchange  and interest rates.   The
Bank would enter into the following legal arrangements: (a) a Loan
Agreement with the Government of Argentina; (b) a Project Agreement with
EBY for the transferring of US$250.0 million; and (c) a Second Owners
Agreement with the governments of Argentina and Paraguay which would
support obligations contained in the Project Agreement, as EBY is a
binational entity.    Annex  2.2.4  gives  a  detailed  description  of the
institutional aspects of EBY.
Project Objectives
3.05     The project  would  initiate  a  process  designed  to achieve the
following sector objectives: (a) improving resource allocation within the
sector through optimization of its expansion program; (b) implementing a
Financial Rehabilitation Plan (FRP) of the national power utilities; (c)
improving the efficiency of the power utilities; (d) promoting rational use
of  electricity  through  a   tariff   system   based  on  economic  costs;
(e) strengthening the structure of the sector so as to bring about better
coordination, planning and regulation; and (f) establishing policies and
procedures for environmental protection and social aspects in power
projects.
Project Description
3.06     The proposed project consists of:
(a) Sector  Investment  Program.       This  project  component  is  the
1988-1989 "time slice" of the sector's investment program, under
responsibility of AyE, SEGBA, HIDRONOR and EBY, defined on the
basis of the sector expansion plan for the period 1988-1995, as
presented under paras. 2.16  to  2.20.   This program (Annex 3.1),
which  adheres  to  least-cost   principles,  includes  only  high
priority works for the period 1988-1989: (i) ongoing generation
and transmission works being carried out by AyE, HIDRONOR and EBY;
(ii) generation and transmission works  to  be initiated by AyE in
order to meet  dates  established  in  the  sector expansion plan;
(iii)  distribution  works--either   under   execution  or  to  be
committed in the period by AyE and SEGBA; and (iv) the carrying
out of studies for futu-e works.
(b) Institutional Strengthening of the SE.   This project component is
technical assistance to provide to the SE for a period of two
years: (i) 240 staff months of specialized consultants; (ii) up to
US$1.0 million equivalent of computer, and office equipment; (iii)
a data base/communication link equipment between the SE and the
main energy sector institutions; and (iv) miscellaneous equipment.
UNDP would help with administrative support for the project. The
cost of this component was estimated during appraisal at US$3.0
million of which US$2.0 million would be financed with proceeds of
the proposed loan.
Estimated Cost
3.07     The 1988-1989 slice  of  the  sector's  investment  program has an
estimated cost of about US$2,350 million (Annex 3.1.5) as shown below:

3.08     The base cost estimates are at  January 1988 price levels and were
prepared by SE's planning  staff,  based  on information provided by sector
utilities for individual  projects.    This  information  is  based on: (a)
c.ontracts for projects under construction, which amount to about 902 of the
project cost; and (b) detailed design for those projects to be initiated in
the period, which accounts for the remaining 102 of the project cost.
Included in the costs is an amount of 10? to cover physical contingencies,
which is the resulting average of estimates for the various individual
projects.   The  breakdown  of  the  project  cost  into  foreign and local
components reflects estimates for the major components of the sector
investments (Yacyreta, SEGBA V and HIDRONOR's Piedra del Aguila) and Bank
staff estimates for the remaining projects which are based on past sector
experience. Price contingencies for the period 1988-1989 were calculated
for both foreign and local costs at 3.0? per year.
3.09     As the Yacyreta project is the largest sector investment, detailed
cost estimates were prepared for the entire remainder of its construction
period, 1988-1996, and are presented in the following table:

3.10     The above cost estimates have  a high degree of certainty because:
(a) preliminary works have been basically completed; (b) the direct cost of
the engineering and civil works are based on existing contracts; (c) the
cost of the electromechanical equipment is based on awarded bids; and (d)
costs of the relocation component are based on existing contracts for a
substantial part of the component and final design for works to be
contracted. Physical contingencies .yere estimated for every major element
of the project and resulted in an overall rate of 10X. Price contingencies
were estimated on the basis of projected national inflation rates fo.
countries of origin of goods  and  services.   They result in the following
overall figures: 4.42 for 1988, 3.52 for 1989, 4.42 for 1990, 3.52 for
1991, 4.02 for 1992, 5.02 for 1993 and 3.02 p.a. for 1994 through 1996.
Local costs also include approximately US$130 million to cover taxes and
import duties.
Financing Plan
3.11      Since the project has been defined  as the 1988-1989 time slice of
the sector investment program which, conventionally, comprises: (a) the
national utilities; (b) EBY; and (c) the SE component (para. 3.06(b)] the
project financing plan would also have the same three corresponding

- National Utilities
3.12     The national utilities financial plan (PRP) is described in paras.
2.28-2.30 and Annex 2.6.1. During the 1988-1990 period, the FRP shows that
the national utilities wou .d reach the following key financial targets:
1988      1989      1990
Cash Operating Ratio 1/                 91.0      81.0       78.7
Contribution to Investment 2/           54.7      50.7       56.3
l/  Cash operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues.
2/  Consumer-based funding  (including  electricity  and energy funds) as a
percentage of investment.
The improving trend in the cash operating ratio is particularly relevant
for the Argentinian power sector as it shows that the level of cash
operating costs as compared to revenues which is too high in 1988 will
decrease significantly in the next two years. The operating ratio would be
about 2C percentage points higher with the inclusion of the depreciation
charge. The high operating ratio is the main issue in the finances of the
national utilities and its improvement will be the main measure of their
financial rehabilitation process.
3.13     To achieve said targets, it  has  been assumed that measures would
be taken by the Government and the utilities to achieve the following
levels (in January 1988 US$ million) of key financial variables:
1988      1989       1990
Average sale price (US$/MWh)                33.5      36.7       38.5

AyE                                   214.8      190.8      189.9

HIDRONOR                               43.7      155.4     143.5
Additionally, under the FRP it has been assumed that efficiency improvement
measures in financial administration and utility operations would be taken
and result in positive trends for a group of selected key performance

1/  Based on Version No. 48 of EBY's Projected Flow of Funds.
2/  US$1.5 million of  the  loan  (US$210.0  million)  is allocated to
sec'.or studies.
The viability of this plan is based on the following main assumptions:
(a)   through loans made  to  EBY,  the  Government would honor debt
service payments (US$270.4 million);
(b)   through the transfer of  energy  funds  also  as loans to EBY-
(US$272.3 million) and equity contributions (US$20.0 million),
the Government would provide for local currency requirements
of the investment program;
(c)   through Banco de  la  Nacion,  US$42.8  million of local banks
debt service would be financed;
(d)   foreign  banks  have  already  committed  US$63.0  million  to
refinance part of debt service obligations owed to them;



- 23 -
(e)   financing from export agencies (US$82.7 million) and suppliers
(US$59.0 million) has already been secured; and
(f)   the proposed IBRD and IDB  loans (US$250.0 million each) would
finance US$500.0 million, which would pay civil works and
engineering contracts (US$419.9 million) and interest on
current and proposed IBRD/IDB loans (US$80.1 million).
As can be seen, this plan is basically contingent upon the Government
actions to secure local currency funding and upon the IBRD/IDB proposed
financing. It is important to note that the degree of financial viability
is greater when considering only the investment requirements as debt
service needs constitute a significant share (27Z) of total requirements
and they depend fundamentally on fiscal (budgetary) resources. As the
construction of the project will be completed only in 1996 and the internal
fund generation will start only in 1993, it is recommended that interest on
current and proposed IBRD and IDB loans (US$80.1 million) be financed so as
to avoid additional fiscal contributions or refinancing for such purpose.
- SE
3.15      The financing of  the  SE's  technical assistance program (US$3.0
million) would come from proceeds of the proposed loan (US$2.0 million) and
the Government's budgetary resources (US$1.0 million).
Financial Covenants
3.16      To ensure the viability  of  the project's financial plan, during
negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and EBY, as
appropriate, on the following commitments (para. 4.01(h)]:
(a) to cause the national utilities to meet the main targets of the
FRP, i.e., cash operating ratios of 912 in 1988, 812 in 1989, and
79Z in 1990; and a contribution to investment which would not be
lower than 302 in any single year;
(b) to hold, commencing with May 31, 1989 and each May 31 thereafter,
a review of sector performance during the previous year and of
measures required to achieve the FRP targets in the current and
following years;
(c) to take all the necessary measures (e.g., tariff adjustments,
transfers of electricity and energy funds, assumption of debt
service payments and budgetary contributions) to achieve the FRP
targets and viable financial plan for EBY and the SE technical
assistance program; and
(d)  to  establish  necessary  measures  in  order  for  the  national
utilities  to  achieve   financial   management  and  operational
improving  levels  to   be   measured   through  key  performance
indicators (para. 3.18).
Due to the importance of the parallel IDB loan in the viability of the
project's financial plan, it is a condition for effectiveness of the
proposed loan that the IDB loan has been executed (para. 4.02).



- 24 -
Implementation and Monitoring
3.17     Implementation of the different  elements  of the proposed project
would be responsibility of the corresponding utilities which have adequate
capability and resources to carry out these projects. At the sector level
Bank supervision would concentrate on: (i) the follow-up of the FRP, during
the annual reviews to be carried out starting on May 31 of each year, (ii)
ensuring that SE carries out adequately the Technical Assistance Program,
and (iii) ensuring that progress  is made in the environmental regulations.
At the Yacyreta project level it is proposed that, given the magnitude of
the project, the Bank continues performing detailed supervision, as it has
done for Loan 1761-AR, including review of institutional, engineering and
environment/resettlement aspects.
3.18     The monitoring of the sector  efficiency improvement would be made
in connection with the follow-up of the FRP under this project (para.
3.16(d)) and actions agreed upon under Loans 2751-AR and 2854-AR. Annex
3.2 shows the performance indicators to be used. To improve the sector's
global efficiency, the Government has agreed under Loan 2751-AR to carry
out studies which would assess the quality of service of the utilities,
their use of resources, distribution planning methodologies and increase
the coordination of the national and the provincial utilities regarding
distribution expansion planning  and  implementation.   Under Loan 2854-AR,
SEGBA and the Bank have agreed on the carrying out of a comprehensive Plan
of Action to increase SEGBA's efficiency and reduce losses.
Procurement
3.19     As the number of elements included  in the project, defined as the
time-slice of the investment program of the three major national utilities
and Yacyreta, is very large, a precise computation of the amounts which
would be procured through the different procurement methods is not feasible
and, thus, the procurement table usually shown in Bank appraisal reports is
not shown for this project. As detailed below the procurement arrangements
are satisfactory.
3.20     Proceeds from the loan  would  be  applied to finance: (a) ongoing
contracts for the execution of the Yacyreta project procured under Loan
1761-AR, as follows: (i) the major civil works contract which was awarded
through ICB procedures in accordance with Bank Procurement Guidelines, and
(ii) ';he contract for consulting services which was awarded in accordance
with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants; (b) the SE Technical
Assistance Program; and (c) interest under loan 1761-AR and the proposed
Bank loan. Procurement of equipment and contracting of consultants under
the technical assistance program would be carried out in accordance with
Bank Guidelines for Procurement and Bank Guidelines for Use of Consultants,
respectively. Procurement of goods, principally computers, software and
office  technology  equipment   would   be   carried  out  through  limited
international bidding which is  the  most  suitable type of procurement for
this kind of equipment.   Ex  ante Bank review of procurement documentation



- 25 -
on contracts for equipment above US$200,000 would be required. The Bank
would approve terms of reference, selection procedures and fee range for
individual consulting positions.
3.21     Procurement of goods and services  not financed with proceeds from
the loan would be procured through a variety of procurement methods,
depending upon the origin of the corresponding financing. Procurement for
Bank-financed projects (Power Engineering and SEGBA V) would be done in
accordance with Bank guidelines.    IDB-financed  projects for EBY, AyE and
HIDRONOR would be procured in accordance with IDB's procurement methods
which are generally consistent with  the  Bank's.   Other components of the
project would be procured under the specific arrangement governing the
particular financing available (i.e. bilateral agreements). Finally, items
financed with local funds would be procured through the corresponding
utilities'  normal  practices  which   are   restrictive  for  they  oblige
Argentinian goods to  be  bought  when  available.    As  a result of this,
acquisition of goods and services for an amount estimated at US$200 million
which would be feasible for ICB would constitute reserved procurement.
Thus,  for  the  purposes  of  determining  the  maximum  loan  amount, the
estimated cost of reserved procurement was excluded from the total project
costs. This type of procurement is not expected to affect the economy or
efficiency of the project as it represents less than 1Z of its cost.
Disbursement
3.22     The proposed loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of two
years. As such, the disbursement schedule does not follow the Bank's
standard profiles as it reflects projected billings on the contracts of the
Yacyreta  project.    Expenditures  would  be  disbursed  against Certified
Statements of Expenditures for expenditures under US$500,000. The proceeds
would be applied to finance up to:
(a) 50Z of expenditures on the major civil works contract for the
Yacyreta project in the period 1988-1989 (US$182.4 million);
(b) 50Z of expenditures on the engineering contract for the
Yacyreta project in the period 1988-1989 (US$27.0 million);
(c) interest and other charges on the proposed Bank loan during the
disbursement period (up to US$18.2 million);
(d)  interest and other charges  on  loan 1761-AR accrued during the
disbursemert period of the proposed operations (up to US$22.4
million); and
(e) 100Z of expenditures under the SE Technical Assistance Program
(up to US$2.0 million).
Withdrawal of proceeds of the loan to finance the aforementioned categories
of expenditures would be subject to an aggregate limit of US$170 million,
unless the following conditions are met [para. 4.03(a)]: (i) the Bank be
satisfied with the results of the Hay 1989 review of the FRP [para.
3.16(b)]; (ii) satisfactory progress in implementing the recommendations of
the sector organization study (para. 2.14); and (iii) fulfillment of all
conditions of disbursement under the IDB loan.



- 26 -
3.23     The remaining expenditures on the  contracts  of items (a) and (b)
above (502 of the civil works contract and 502 of the engineering contract)
would be financed with proceeds of the proposed parallel IDB loan (para.
3.14(f)). As the IDB loan may become effective at a later date than the
Bank's, it has been agreed at EBY's request to increase the percentages
indicated in (a) and (b) above up to 1002 during the time elapsed between
Bank loan effectiveness and IDB loan effectiveness. IDB has agreed to have
a similar provision which would permit restoring the targeted pari-passu.
It was further agreed that such front-end loading of the Bank's loan will
be subject to a limit of 502 of the aggregate amount allocated to
categories (a) and (b) above (US$104.7 million) in order to allow the Bank
to review the financing of the project if disbursements under the IDB loan
do not commence within a reasonable time frame [para. 4.03(b)]. The
closing date would be June 30, 1990.
3.24     In order  to  improve  the  timeliness  of  disbursements  and the
availability of funds  for  the  project,  the  Bank  would make an advance
payment from the loan account into a Special Account, to be opened and
maintained in US dollars in a bank acceptable to the Bank. The funds would
be used to reimburse EBY and the SE for the Bank's share of the project
cost, as well as to reflect direct payments in foreign currencies. The
total amount in the Special Account (about US$50.0 million equivalent)
would not exceed an amount that is about four months of estimated average
disbursements for the project.   Replenishment of the Special Account would
be made in accordance with standard Bank procedures.
3.25     Financirg of the major  civil  works and the engineering contracts
has been partially made with proceeds from Bank Loan 1761-AR and a parallel
IDB loan. As the proposed Bank and IDB operations would continue the
financing of these contracts, the Government has requested, and the Bank
agreed to accept, that commitments made by EBY for execution of works and
services under the approved contracts for the period of time elapsed
between completion of disbursements under Loan 1761-AR and effectiveness of
the proposed loan be eligible for financing with proceeds from the proposed
loan provided no payments will have been made in respect to such
commitments at the time the respective disbursements under the proposed
loan are called for.
Environmental and Social Aspects
3.26     Sectoral aspects.  The Government is  aware that the growth of the
energy sector has the potential to impose long term adverse effects on the
environment. Accordingly, the SE has already taken initiatives to develop
an institutional capacity in the power sector to identify and analyze the
impact of its activities, and to structure these so as to mitigate adverse
consequences. It is also the SE's understanding that, in order to ensure
long-term compliance with acceptable  environmental  standards, it would be
important to have sector criteria for provisions to meet these standards in
the design of power projects and  for their adherence in project execution.
Consequently, it was  agreed  during  negotiations  that  the SE will issue
regulations in connection with  power sector projects concerning protection
of the environment and mitigation of the economic and social effects of
involuntary  resettlement  [para.  4.1(i)].    The  SE  has  already issued
regulations requiring the national utilities to present for review a report
on all possible effects of the construction of hydroplants on the
environment and the population, and to demonstrate that the proposed



- 27 -
remedial actions would be adequate.    These regulations, which codify some
of the best international practices in this field, have been reviewed by
the Bank and found highly satisfactory. The SE is now preparing comparable
regulations for thermal plant construction, which will be sent to the Bank
for comments before May 31,  1990.    In  addition,  it was agreed that the
Government will present to the Bank, by May 31, 1989, an assessment of the
operational safety of nuclear plants in Argentina prepared under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank [para. 4.01(j)].
3.27     Yacyreta project.   Potentially  adverse  effects  of the Yacyreta
project on the environment and on the affected population, which the Bank
has been monitoring for several years, are adequately addressed by EBY as
detailed in Annex 3.1.4.    To  deal  with  the environmental impact of the
project, EBY has developed a Master Plan for environmental protection,
acceptable to the Bank, that adequately addresses matters related to water
quality, aquatic fauna, riverbank species, development of natural reserves,
animal rescue,  reservoir  cleaning  and  public  health.    The relocation
component, which includes the resettlement of about 40,000 people, is well
advanced, and adequately scheduled for completion by the fourth quarter of
1992. The Bank and the EBY have recently exchanged views and reached
agreement on the following relevant social, technical and economic aspects
of the EBY's resettlement and environment program: i) establtshment of a
panel of international experts on environment to provide high level
assistance to EBY staff and help monitor its efforts in developing the
project in accordance with the most desirable international standards; ii)
installation cf fisheries and  fauna  sanctuaries;   iii) adequate size and
composition of the resettlement staff and execution of a training program;
iv) implementation if an Urban Master Plan for the city of Encarnacion and
completion of a sanitation plan for the city of Posadas; v) provision for
averting invasion of the areas to be flooded, thus obviating undue increase
of claims for resettlement;    vi)  mitigation  of  the economic and social
adverse effects on the owners and workers in the small clay industries in
the areas to be flooded. In view of the importance of a timely execution
of  both  the   environmental   and   the   relocation  components,  during
negotiations it was agreed with EBY on the carrying out of a Plan of
Action, attached as Annex 3.1.6, with specific schedules and targets to
complete the environment and relocation components in a manner satisfactory
to the Bank [para.4.01(k)].
Dam Safety and Inspection
3.28     EBY has taken  adequate  steps  to  ensure  that  the dam's safety
aspects are  duly  considered.    It  has  appointed  a  panel  of experts,
satisfactory to the Bank, which has reviewed the design of the dam, with
particular  emphasis   on   safety   aspects,   and   has  included  enough
instrumentation to ensure that the dam behavior is properly monitored. To
ensure that these considerations continue to be properly taken care of,
during negotiations EBY agreed to continue seeking adv'ce of the panel of
experts and to have the dan inspected regularly by experts during its
useful life in accordance with a program to be submitted to the Bank by
January 1, 1990 [para. 4.01(1)].



- 28 -
Auditing
3.29     As required by Argentine  law  for all government-owned companies,
EBY has its financial statements audited by the Public Enterprises
Comptroller (Sindicatura General de Empresas Publicas/SIGEP) which the Bank
has found to perform effectively. In the case of Paraguay, at present the
auditing firm is Auditores y Consultores Asociados (AYCA), an independent
audit firm acceptable to  the  Bank.    During  project execution EBY would
continue to engage the services of independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank and would present, in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank, duly audited financial statements and project accounts within
four months of the  close  of  the  fiscal  year.   The auditors would also
review statements of expenditures related to the project. In addition, the
project Special Account (para. 3.24) would be audited in accordance with
terms of reference and by an independent auditor, both acceptable to the
Bank [para. 4.01(m)].
Economic Justification
3.30     The economic analysis is based on the 1988-1995 investment program
for  the  sector,  which  includes   all  the  investments  in  generation,
transmission  and  distribution   facilities   developed  by  the  national
utilities and EBY  necessary  to  meet  electricity  demand.   The proposed
investment program is based  on    the  Energy Plan, a comprehensive energy
sector study completed in 1986 and revised--in regard to the power sector-
-for purposes of appraisal of the proposed project. The investment program
is considered to be a sound development program for the period 1988-1995 as
it contains the least-cost sequence of generation and transmission projects
for that period. As detailed in para. 2.17 the development program beyond
1995 warrants re,iew as it includes projects that have not reached the
stage of final design for construction; but such review would not affect
significantly the conclusions of the economic evaluation.
3.31     The rate of  return  on  the  investment  program was estimated ds
being the discount rate which equalizes the present value of the economic
net cost and benefit streams associated with the investment program
(Annex  3.3.1).    The  economic  net  cost  streams  include:  (i) capital
investments on generation, transmission, sub-transmission, distribution and
general investments to be made by the sector; (ii) costs of operation and
maintenance related to the capital investments and (iii) energy purchased
from CNEA and CTHSG. Since benefits in the power sector arising from the
investment program cannot be quantified with precision, the use of a proxy
is required. Therefore, the economic net benefit streams were measured by
the forecast revenues from the incremental sales of electricity, attributed
to the facilities  included  in  the  investment  program,  on the basis of
retail  tariffs,  including  surcharges,  required  to  attain  the targets
established for the  FRP.    The  rate  of  return  of the sector 1988-199!
investment program utilizing the above  tariffs  is estimated at about 152.
A sensitivity analysis  was  carried  out  to  evaluate  the impact on this
return of the possible failure to implement the tariff increases contained
in the FRP.    It  shows  that  if  revenues  are  valued  at tariff levels
prevailing in July 1988, the rate of return is about 1OZ.
3.32     The above results confirm  that,  if  the planned tariff increases
nre adopted on schedule,  the  rate  of  return of the 1988-1995 investment



- 29 -
program would be over the opportunity coet of capital in Argentina
(estimated at 12Z). The above rate of return does not fully measure some
of the benefits to society such as the social benefits of residential and
public uses, or the indirect benefit to industry and commerce, whose
production and empleyment depend on reliable electricity supply.
3.33     Because of the  large  amount  of  investments  to  be made in the
Yacyreta project, a separate economic evaluation has been made for this
project (Annex 3.3.2). It is based on the comparison of completing the
project (excluding sunk costs) with the alternative of implementing a gas-
fueled thermal plant which would provide a similar service. Results show
that completion of Yacyreta has an IRR over 18X. A sensitivity analysis
carried out to evaluate the impact of cost overruns shows that an IRR of
15? is still attained for a cost overrun of 20?.
Risks
3.34     The  major  risk  facing  the   project   would  1i the  pace  of
implementation of the FRP, especially in light of the possible continued
surges in the inflation rate. Considerable effort will be needed to ensure
that electricity prices reflect inflationary changes so that planned cost
recovery targets are met as well as that other supporting financial
measures are taken in time to avert deterioration in sector finances and
execution  of  the  project.    On  this  account  the  annual  review will
concentrate on the assessment  of  the  degree  of compliance of the sector
with these targets.

(f) the Government ensures that (para. 2.19):
(i) CNEA would obtain sector-generated funds only after the
financial requirements of other sector utilities have been
fully met; and
(ii) the bulk tariff of CNEA will not be higher than the maximum
bulk sale tariffs of generating utilities supplying to the
SIN;
(g) the Government will implement the results of the tariff study

which would not be lower than 30Z in any single year;



- 31 -
(ii) to hold commencing with May 31, 1989 and each May 31
thereafter, a review of sector performance during the
previous year and of measures required to achieve the FRP
targets in the current and following years;
(iii) to take all the necessary measures to achieve the FRP

(i) in  relation  to  the   implementation   of  power  projects,  the
Government  would   issue   regulations   to:   (i)   protect  the
environment; and (ii) mitigate the economic and social effects of
involuntary resettlement (para. 3.26);
(j) by May 31, the Government will submit to the Bank an assessment of
the operating safety of the nuclear plants in Argentina, prepared
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank;
(k) EBY will implement an Environment/Resettlement Plan of Action in a

(1) by January 1, 1990, EBY will present to the Bank a satisfactory
program for dam inspection during the useful life of the Yacyreta
project (para. 3.28); and
(m) EBY will engage independent auditors acceptable to the Bank (para.
3.29);
4.02     As a  condition  of  effectiveness,  a  subsidiary  loan agreement
between the Government and EBY, and the IDB loan for financing the Yacyreta
project should have been executed (para. 3.16).
4.03     The following conditions of disbursement have been established:
(a) Disbursements beyond US$170,000 would not be made unless: (i)
satisfactory agreement is reached in the May 1989 review of the
PRP;   (ii)    satisfactory    progress    of   implementing   the
recommendations of the sector  organization  study is reached; and
(iii) fulfillment of all conditions  of disbursement under the IDB
loan (para. 3.22);
(b) The percentage of expenditures to be financed under the Yacyreta
civil works and engineering contracts may be increased up to 1002
of such expendutires until the conditions of disbursement of the
IDB are fulfilled, provided that such withdrawals will not exceed
the aggregate amount of US$104.7 million (para. 3.23).
4.04     With the  above agreements the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a Bank loan to the Government of Argentina of US$252.0 million
equivalent, under applicable terms and conditions for Argentina.

ARGENTINA
ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
SEGBA: Institutional Aspects
Background and Ownership
1.       SEGBA was c'. ,ated  in  1958  as  a  decentralized electric utility
fully owned by the A:gentinian federal government through the Sindicatura
General de Empresas Publicas  (SIGEP).    SEGBA  reports to the Ministry of
Public Works and Services (MOSP) through the Secretariat of Energy (SE).
Recently, the government created the Public Enterprises Directorate (DEP)
which is expected to replace SIGEP and play an increasing supervisory role
over public enterprises, including SEGBA.
2.       SEGBA's Concession  Agreement,  approved  by  Decree  No.  1247 of
February 8, 1962, gives the company responsibility for electricity supply
in the metropolitan Buenos Aires area on a non-exclusive basis and for an
indefinite period. During 1979-198? SEGBA took over the concession held by
CIAE (Compania Argentina de Electricidad, formerly Compania Italo-Argentina
de Electricidad, S. A./ITALO) which served a large area in downtown Buenos
Aires. SEGBA's original by-laws were approved in 1961 and have been
amended frequently, most recently in May 1986.
Organization and Management
3.       SEGBA has a Board of  Directors  of  six members, appointed by the
Government.  The Board chooses  two  of  its  members to serve as President
(Chairman of the Board)  and  Vice  President.    The  Board is assisted by
several ad-hoc committees, as  required.    A General Manager, appointed by
the Board is responsible for  day-to-day  management.   He is assisted by a
group of committees (planning, finances, procurement and management) and
supervises   four   departments   (planning,   finances,   procurement  and
management)  and  sales,  operations   and   finance  and  three  divisions
(engineering, supply, and personnel and industrial relations).
Planning
4.       SEGBA  plays  a  leading   role   in  the  preparation  of  demand
projections  as  SEGBA's  concession   area  includes  the  most  important
electricity market in the  country.    For  this  SEGBA participates in the
working group which, under the supervision of the SE is in charge of the
preparation of demand projections.    SEGBA  has good expertise in planning
distribution  facilities,   which   is   carried   out   by   well  trained
professionals.
Financial Planning and Budgeting
5.       While short term financial  planning  through annual budgeting and
control is satisfactory, the resources for medium and long range financial
planning have  not  been  developed  appropriately.    The  reason for this
situation stems from the excessive influence that the Government annual



ANNEX 2.2.1
Page 2 of 4
budget process  imposes  on  all  public  enterprises.    As  a result, the
financial projections department of SEGBA is understaffed (in both quantity
and quality)  and  underequipped.    SEGBA,  aware  of  this situation, has
already  begun  upgrading  this  function.    The  Financial  Department is
responsible for SEGBA's annual budgeting activities through its Financial
Planning  sub-division.    Coordination  is  achieved  through  a Budgeting
Committee where the various departments are represented. The process takes
about 6 months, from June to November to enable the tariff department to
evaluate rate levels  for  the  forthcoming  budget  year.   The actual vs.
budgeted control process is computerized and is carried out monthly. The
process is satisfactory, but would require integration in both format and
procedures with the medium and long range financial planning.
Engineering
6.       SEGBA's engineering staff is  well  trained  and capable and SEGBA
does not require the use of consultants except for very specialized tasks.
As SEGBA is seen as a desirable institution to work with, it is in a
position to select the best qualified engineers graduated from local
universities.    However,  training   programs   for  engineers  and  other
professionals in the last few years have not allocated slots for training
abroad in quantities adequate to keep the staff up-to-date with new
technologies and  engineering  developments.    The  SEGBA  V project (Loan
2854-AR is to support SEGBA's training activities through the financing of
this kind of activities.
The Market and the Means to Meet Demand
7.       By end 1987 SEGBA operated  in  a concession area of 13,800 square
kilometers, had about 3.8 million clients and about 21,600 employees.
During 1987 SEGBA's system had a maximum demand of 3,652 MW and delivered
18,600 GWh of which 43? was generated in its own plants and 57? was
purchased from the National Interconnected System (SIN). SEGBA's physical
installations by end 1986 included 2,470 MW of installed capacity in
thermal plants, 17,700 MVA of transformer capacity in substations, 7,100
MVA in distribution transformers, 2700 km of high voltage lines and cables,
14,500 km of medium voltage lines and cables and 49,900 km of low voltage
lines and cables. The composition of energy consumption in 1986 was as
follows: 33Z industrial, 36? residential, 15? commercial, 16? public sector
and others.
Operations
8.       SEGBA's overall efficiency  indicators  are  good when compared to
other large utilities  in  Latin  America.    The  number  of consumers per
employee increased from 100 in 1975 to 180 in 1987 while the energy sold
per employee increased from 380 MWh/year  in  1975 to 670 MWh/year in 1987.
Although these global indicators remain in the good range, lately the
efficiency  of  SEGBA's   operations   has   deteriorated  in  some  areas.
Production has not been affected by this trend because of adequate
preventive maintenance and training programs.   The aggregate efficiency of
thermal plants has increased from 31? in 1975 to 34Z in 1987. The average
availability, however, has decreased in the last few years - from 83? of
total generating capacity in 1983 to 74Z in 1987 because: (i) some of the



ANNEX 2.2.1
Page 3 of 4
machines are becoming obsolete and (ii) the long time required to import
spare parts due to the country's import restrictions.
9.       The  main   efficiency   problems   remain   in  the  distribution
operntions: First: the status of deterioration of the networks, seconds
obsolete technology of part of the networks, third: lack of adequate
preventive  maintenance,  and  fourth:  labor   problems.    As  a  result,
electricity  supply  in  practically   all  SEGBA's  concession  area,  but
espec:.ally the Buenos Aires downtown area, is poor in quality and in
customer's service. The average interruption time is 20 hours/client/year.
The average tm-- to replace service in cases of interruption is 200
minutes, while the percentage of complaints unattended for more than 90
minutes has increased from 35Z in 1983 to 47Z in 1987.
Metering, Billing and Collections
10.      SEGBA's billing  and  collection  procedures  are  well developed.
They are bighly computerized and make extensive use of the commercial
banks. SEGBA's clients are divided into Private and Official (national,
provincial, and municipal). Special clients (about 8.2Z) which are Lilled
monthly are those with an installed capacity greater than 25kW, the rest
(about 3.7 million) are  billed  every  two  months.   Metering and billiag
while requiring improvements in the shanty towns around Buenos Aires, is
generally satisfactory.
Staffing and Training
11.      SEGBA's global  employment  level  is  adequate  to  the utility's
current operations.   Actually  the  number  of  employees has consistently
decreased - from 26,000 in 1975 to 21,600 in 1987. However, there are some
problems regarding staff distribution.   SEGBA's relations with unions have
been traditionally a difficult area because of the unusual strength of
SEGBA's labor union.   This  has  resulted  in  the past in an unreasonable
increase in the number of staff and levels of remuneration. Also very
complex regulations agreed upon by SEGBA in the framework of collective
contracts with the unions introduce unreasonable limitations. As a result
of poor drafting of labor legislation enacted in 1983, SEGBA is facing a
mountain of labor suits which in 1987 involved more than 40,000 persons
(active and retired staff and third parties) and resulted in an allocation
to settlement expenses reserve of about US$30 million. SEGBA has increased
resources allocated to work safety programs which benefit both the utility
and the workers and have resulted in a substantial decrease in the
frequency of accidents from 20 accidents per million of men-hours wotked in
1980 to 9 accidents per million men-hours worked in 1987.
12.      SEGBA  has  designed  a  job  description  system  and performance
evaluation to replace the current one which is too complex. The new system
is well structured and would favor career development. It is estimated
that the average wage has been eroded by inflation by about 40Z in the
period 1980-1987, which might be partially responsible for a notorious
increase in the absenteeism from 5Z to 82 noted in the period 1980-1987.
Despite this, the work morale is generally good and there is no important
loss of capable staff.



ANNEX 2.2.1
Page 4 of 4
13.      SEGBA has  a  comprehensive  training  program  and  maintains two
centers to fulfill the majority of its training needs for workers. Other
specialized  training  is   carried   out   under   agreements  with  local
institutions (technical  universities  and  centers).    A  total  of 2,400
pereons or 11? of the staff received some kind of training during 1987 and
a total of 9,000 is expected to be trained through 815 courses during the
period 1988-1992 in accordance with a sound master plan. SEGBA has also
training arrangements with two well-credited foreign utilities for on-the-
job training of professionals on specialized matters and the provision of
experts.
Auditing
14.      Since 1981 SEGBA was  required  (and  the  Bank agreed) to use the
services of Sindicatura General de las Empresas Publicas (SIGEP) as
external auditors. This obligation was imposed to all public enterprises.
However, current preliminary reports by the Financial Management Specialist
(FMS) of the Bank indicate that nationwide, the performance of SIGEP has
not been as originally intended because of repeated poor quality audits
performed on some of the public sector enterprises. The internal Auditing
Department of SEGBA reports to the Beard and is divided into two main
areast Control and Operational  Auditing  sections.   The iorner audits the
accounting,  the  latter  monitors   the   performance  for  the  economic,
financial, administrative and operational areas according to budgeted
targets. The monthly reporting from both areas is very comprehensive,
their timeliness particularly towards the end of the year could be
improved.
Insurance
15.      SEGBA's   major   installations   such   as   generation   plants,
substations, distribution centers and buildings are insured against fire,
explosion, terrorism, %andalism, etc.   Works under execution and personnel
of the contractors are insured against all risks. Also, SEGBA's vehicles
are covered with  standard  insurance  policies.    Regarding those SEGBA's
assets which because  of  their  large  number  and geographical dispersion
(such as distribution networks) do not require special insurance coverage a
policy of self insurance would seem adequate but would require the
establishment of a special fund as is usual utility practice. No such fund
exists.

ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
AyE: Institutional Aspects
Background and Ownership
1.       Agua y Energia Electrica,  Sociedad  del  Estado  (AyE) is a fully
owned government utility, created in 1947, reporting to the Minist:ry of
Public Works and Services (MOSP) through the Secretariat of Energy (SE).
Its legal structure, organization and dependency have changed several times
since its foundation but  its  main  objecti%as have remained basically the
same. They are: (i) generation, interchange and supply of electricity to
the whole country; and (ii) control and utilization of water resources in
activities such as irrigation, flood control and inventory of hydro
resources.
2.       In  1980  the  government  decreed  the  transfer  of  electricity
distribution systems to the provinces. Except for four provinces (La Rioja,
Santiago del Estero, Formosa y Rio  Negro)  which do not have the technical
and financial capability, AyE has transferred distribution systems to other
provinces who have thus become responsible for their operation and
expansion.    A  similar  transfer  has  been  carried  out  regarding  the
irrigation  systems.    Consequently,  AyE  has  been  transformed  into  a
basically generation and transmission electric utility, with distribution
responsibilities only on an exception basis.
Organization and Management
3.       AyE's Board of  Directors  has  six  members:  a President, a Vice
president and four directors. They are nominated for three-year terms and
are responsible for setting up general company policy. The headquarters of
AyE is located in Buenos Aires and six Regional Administrations (NW, NE,
Cuyo, Comahue, Litoral and Patagonia), which report to the Operations
Manager, take care of rutinary regional business. The Operations Mariager
and the Engineering and Administration Manager report directly to the
President. Six units report to the latter: Construction, Engineering,
Industrial Relations, Planning and Control, Commercial, and IDB Program.
Staffing and Training
4.       By the end of 1987,  AyE  had  11,074 employees, of which 642 were
under the Operations Unit.   With  the transfer of the distribution systems
to the provinces, the number of personnel has been reduced by about 452 and
further  reductions  would  be  advisable   as  there  is  still  room  for
improvement. The company has a training program which is carried out in
its own training centers (NE, Cuyo, Centro and Parana) and through external
services inside and outside the country.



ANNEX 2.2.2
Page 2 of 3
Accounting and Auditing
5.       The accounting system of  AyE  is  adequate  for  the needs of the
company. Host of it has been computerized. both at headquarters and at the
regional offices. The system is basically decentralized for the sources
and it is centralized for the consolidation of the financial statements of
the company. The Internal Audit unit reports directly to the President and
performs its work on the basis of an annual program, with rutinary and non-
routinary activities. Regional offices have their own audit units which
report to the central Audit unit.
6.       As is the case for  other government-owned companies, the external
auditor of AyE is the National Comptroller's Office (Sindicatura General de
Empresas Publicas/SIGEP) which performs its functions through a permanent
Supervisory Commission and through its own professional staff.
Financial Planning and Budgeting
7.       AyE has only  recently  begun  using  computerized  models for its
financial planning activities. The pressing problems of the short-term and
the complications inherent to running  a  company which is both an electric
utility   and   an   irrigation   entity,   with   national   and  regional
responsibilities,  have   created   an   environment   which  has  centered
management's attention on  solving  day  to  day  problems.   This has been
further compounded by the strict  government  requirements for the one year
fiscal budget--carried out on a cash basis--on which the financial planning
activities have been centered.   Only  because  of the participation of IDB
under ongoing operations and IBRD under the proposed operations, exercises
in medium-term planning have been carried out with positive results. The
company's budget system has been made compatible with its accounting
system, and budget control is carried at the level of the regional offices
and of responsibility centers.
Insurance Policy
8.       The insurance practices of  the  company  are  weak as most of its
assets are not covered by any policy or by a self-insurance fund. This
scheme is presently under review of special consultants engaged under an
on-going IDB operation. The recommendations of the consultants study would
be implemented so as to redress the existing lack of coverage.
Procurement
9.       AyE has its  own  procurement  guidelines  which differ from those
which central government units have to follow. According to their amounts,
purchases are classified for public bidding, private bidding, local
shopping, and direct acquisitions.

HIDRONOR: Institutional Aspects
Background and Ownership
1.        HIDRONOR S.A.  (Hidroelectrica  Norpatagonica  Sociedad Anonima) was
created on October 17, 1967 under the Corporate Law of Argentina (Law No.
19,550).    It  is   responsible   for   the  construction  and  operation  of
hydroelectric plants in the Comahue Region, including transmission lines and
complementary facilities necessary to transport electricity to the consumer
systems.   Within  this  general  framework  additional  individual  laws give
HIDRONOR concessionary rights on each plant it constructs. Its by-laws have
been amended several times, the last in 1986. HIDRONOR is fully owned by the
Argentinian government and its stockholder's capital is equivalent to US$80
million.
Organization and Management
2.        The  Shareholders  Meeting  has   the  highest  authority  over  the
company's activities which it exercises through functional delegation to the
Board of Directors composed of a minimum of five and a maximum of seven
members. Day to day activities are handled by the General Manager who is
designated by an Executive Committee selected by the Board. Six area managers
assist the General Manager in its activities: Operations, Civil Works,
Electromechanical Works, Administration, Finance, and Regional Matters.
3.        The headquarters of the company  is  located in Buenos Aires and its
center of operations in Cipolleti, Rio Negro Province. As the geographical
location of the organizational units is based on different functional criteria
both have basically separate organizations, in certain cases with duplication
of functions. Such scheme requires the General Manager to move permanently
between Buenos Aires and Cipolleti.   In  spite of this cumbersome scheme, the
company operates efficiently.
Management Systems
4.        The company does not  yet  have  detailed management systems manuals
for all tte organizational units and the activities they perform. Until 1983,
HIDRONOR engaged the services of external consultants to design such manuals
which would be divided into 27 groups, to be developed during the 1982-1988
period.   Unsatisfied  with  the  consultants  work,  HIDRONOR  called off the
contract and decided to go ahead with the project on its own, following the
basic design left by the consultants. However the work has been slower than
scheduled and has not yet covered several areas. Under the Administrative
Manager, the Systems Unit has developed manuals for some areas: Human
Resources, Taxes, Budgetting, Work Certification, Inventories, Debt, and
Maintenance.



ANNEX 2.2.3
Page 2 of 3
Human Resources
5.        HIDRONOR has about 1,700  employees which are professionally capable
of performing, in an efficient manner, the activities entrusted to the
company. The most important groups are Operations, Administratior, and Works,
which have the following shares: 44?, 33? and 15Z, the rest belonging to the
other units.   The  small  share  of  Works  reflects  the company's policy of
contracting most of its construction and consulting tasks. Productivity during
the last four years  has  been  as  follows (kWh/employee): 1984, 1,374; 1985,
1,507; 1986, 1,490; and 1987,  1,479.    With  regard to its staff educational
background,  HIDRONOR  shows  a  composition   of  272  professional  and  36?
technical, the rest being support and non-qualified staff.
Financial Planning and Budgetting
6.        The units in charge of  financial lplanning, budgetting and relations
with international credit institutions are located in Buenos Aires. They
produce a financial management report which is issued monthly for higher
management information. On the basis of a model developed by IDB, the company
prepares financial projections for the medium and long-texm. As for other
government-owned entities, the budget system is referred to the fiscal budget
which is carried out on the basis of cash disbursements.
Accounting
7.        The unit in  charge  of  accounting  is  located in Cipolletti which
implies some problems of communication between accounting and the financial
planning and budgetting  areas.    The  accounting  system  of  the company is
satisfactory, but it lacks a system to measure operational expenses on a
reliable  basis.    All  accounting  procedures  are  fully  computerized  and
centralized.   The  budgetting  system  is  carried  out  separately  from the
accounting system, because of their different objectives.
Auditing and Internal Control
8.        The Internal Auditing Unit reports  directly  to the Chairman of the
Board and, in spite of increases in personnel during the last few years, it
lacks the importance it should have for a company the size and complexity of
HIDRONOR. The unit performs its functions on the basis of an annual plan of
action but it also performs unscheduled activities required by the Chairman.
As established by Argentinian Law the external auditor of all government-owned
entities  is  the  National   Comptroller  (Sindicatura  General  de  Empresas
Publicas/SIGEP), but it usually delegates its functions to a Fiscalization
Commission and to independent external auditors engaged for this purpose. The
Fiscalization  Commission,  composed  of  three   members,  is  in  charge  of
supervising the internal control system of the company and evaluating the
financial condition of the utility. SIGEP's report has been issued during the
last few years without major observations.
Insurance
9.        HIDRONOR does  not  have  insurance  coverage  for  dams, spillways,
ditches, roads and transmission lines as it considers, as a policy, that the
risk is minimum. For works in progress, HIDRONOR engages insurance coverage
against all risks of construction and erection, including civil responsibility



ANNEX 2.2.3
Page 3 of 3
and the transport of materials  and  equipment.    Plant in service in insured
against break-down and fire risks, on the basis of a blanket coverage and a
pro rata coverage, respectively.   Other coverage includes vehicles, personnel
transport, goods, equipment, life insurance and workmen compensation and
general civil responsibility.   The  insurance  system has been well developed
thanks to the engaging of insurance consultants who have advised the company
since 1980. This notwithstanding, there is doubt about the valuation of the
company's assets for insurance  purposes.    A specialized consultant has been
hired to analyze this matter.
Procurement
10.       As for other  government-owned  entities,  the procurement system of
HIDRONOR is under Law No. 5340 and Law No. 18875 which covers procurement of
goods,  contracts  for  civil  and   other  works,  consultant  companies  and
individuals. When financing from multilateral agencies requires different
procurement procedures they are usually granted by a law of exception.

EBY: Institutional Aspects
Background
1.                 The  Yacyreta  Binational  Entity  (EBY) was constituted on
December 3, 1973 under a Binational Agreement between Argentina and Paraguay,
with the main objective of constructing and eventually operating the Yacyreta
Hydroelectric Plant. EBY was formally established on September 6, 1974 with
headquarters in Buenos Aires and Asuncion and a stockholders capital of
US$100  million  equally  shared  between   AyE  of  Argentina  and  ANDE  of
Paraguay.l/
Organization and Management
2.              EBY  is  administered  by  a  Board of Directors (wConsejo de
Administracion") and an Executive Committee ("Comite Ejecutivo'). The Board
of Directors establishes the general policies of the entity and approves
important proposals made by the Executive Committee, such as loan contracts
and the annual budget. It has eight members--four for each country--who are
appointed for periods of four years but can be removed by their governments
at any time. The Executive Directors (one for each country) participate as
non-voting members in the Board's deliberations, which are held at least
every other month alternatively in Argentina and Paraguay, and is presided
over, on a rotating basis, by members of each of the two countries.
3.            The  Executive Committee comprises two Executive Directors (one
Argentinian and one Paraguayan) and five Directors for each of the functional
areas (legal, technical, administrative, finances, and coordination). It is
in charge of carrying out all the administrative duties necessary to the
execution of the Project.   The  tenure  of  each director is for a five-year
period. The ordinary meetings of the Executive Committee take place at least
twice a month and are chaired alternatively by Argentina and Paraguay.
4.            After  significant delays due to procurement differences at the
beginning of project execution, during the last three years the execution
process has improved substantially thanks to a good management team. Such
process is expected to continue in the future implementation of the project
and in the eventual operation of the plant, for which the necessary actions
are already envisioned: consultant services would be engaged for the setting
up of the operations unit of EBY.
Staffing
5.          As  of  March  31,  1988 the total number of employees of EBY was
1,192. The following table gives a summary of personnel for each major
organizational unit and its evolution during the last three years:

The small share of Construction employees is justified because of the
utilization of consulting services for project supervision. In future years,
when the first units are commissioned the above mix will change significantly
as the operations unit is set up and the construction works wane.
Finances and Accountin9
6.                The  Financial  Directorate  is responsible for planning and
executing   financial,  operations,   and   registering   the   corresponding
transactions under its accounting  system.    For  this  purpose, it has five
operational divisions: Budget and Financial Planning; Accounting; Funding;
Taxes, Insurance and Customs; and  Treasury.   According to EBY's by-laws its
unit of account is the  US  dollar.    The accounting entries are implemented
following the guidelines established in the entit3's Accounting Manual which
is adequate for an institution  like  EBY.   Most of the accounting processes
are performed through computerized equipment which allows opportune issuance
of quarterly financial reports.   Project-related transactions are adequately
registered and  can  be  easily  monitored  during  project  execution.   The
entity's financial planning system is adequate and has three levels: long-
term, annual and quarterly.    The  last  two  levels  are part of the budget
system and their follow-up is carried out directly through the accounting
system.
Auditing and Internal Control
7.           The  auditing  process  at EBY is carried out internally, by its
shareholders and externally.    The  Internal  Auditing  unit  reports to the
Executive Committee and it has the following personnel: two professional
auditors and 11 assistant auditors working in all the organizational regions.
It carries out its work under a program approved by the Executive Committee.
The two shareholders of EBY, i.e. ANDE and AyE, also perform auditing
functions through sporadic visits and during the reviews performed for the
annual shareholders' meetings. As required by Argentinian Law for all
government-owned companies, EBY has its financial statements audited by the
Public   Enterprises   Comptroller    (Sindicatura    General   de   Empresas
Publicas/SIGEP). In the case of Paraguay, the same principle applies and at



ANNEX 2.2.4
Page 3 of 3
present the auditing firm is Auditores y Consultores Asociados (AYCA). The
recounendations of the external auditors to improve the internal control
system of EBY are beirg implemented gradually but some areas still need
adjustments.    EBY  has  a   plan  to  continue  implementing  the  auditors
recommendations. This notwithstanding, the internal control system of the
entity is adequate.
Tax Scheme
8.         Under the Additional Fiscal Protocol of September 15, 1983, signed
between Argentina and Paraguay, EBY is exempt of any tax, tariff or
contribution of any kind on the materials and equipment to be used in the
project.
Insurance
9.         The  insurance  policy of the entity is based on a study performed
by independent consultants engaged under IDB Loan 346/OC-RG. In this respect,
EBY has an insurance policy to cover all construction and erection risks for
the main works up to a maximum of US$3 billion. Supplementary works are
insured by the civil works contractors until they are transferred to EBY.
After the plant is commissioned, the insurance coverage will be modified
accordingly.
Procurement
10.          Unless the financing institutions establish different conditions
--which would prevail--EBY's norms and procedures establish a preferential
treatment for Argentinian and Paraguayan goods and services for the project.
The Executive Directors are authorized to approve purchases up to US$180,000
and civil works  contracts  up  to  US$900,000  equivalent.   Contracts up to
US$35,000 can be approved by the Financial Director and the head of the
department making the request.   All  procurement  above these limits is done
through public bidding.

ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
CNEA: Institutional Aspects
Background
1.       The National Atomic Energy Commission (Comision Nacional de
Energia Atomica), CNEA, was created in 1950, and since then it has been
under the direct supervision of the President of the Republic.   CNEA has
been traditionally managed by the military, but during the Alfonsin
administratiou its president has been a civilian. CNEA is managed by its
president who is assisted by four consultative bodies. It has six
departments: Nuclear Power Plants, Nuclear Supplies, Isotopes, Research and
Development, International Projects, and Planning. CNEA's staff is
currently 6224, of whom 262 are professionals, 34? technicians and 40?
support staff.
CNEA's Activities
2.       CNEA's activities cover a wide range of research and applications
in the nuclear field: construction and operation of reactors, both for
power generation and for research and production of isotopes; exploration
and exploitation of uranium (including mining and concentration);
manufacturing of nuclear fuel and heavy water; manufacturing of special
alloys; production and marketing of isotopes; and research and development
in a wide range of subjects. CNEA's mandate includes the development of
national technology which would permit independence in strategic fields.
This has been achieved to a certain extent; e.g. in the area of small
reactors CNEA is supplying a research reactor to the Peruvian Institute of
Nuclear Energy which is 80  complete, and has reached agreement with
Algeria for the construction of a similar unit. Both units will have a
high degree of Argentinian input. CNEA also intends to construct small
power reactors in Argentina.
CNEA's Budaet
3.       The cost of CNEA's activities represent a heavy burden for the
government. CNEA's 1988 budget, even under a low scenario for investing in
Atucha 1I construction works (para. 8), amounts to about US$781 million
equivalent with 50Z for investments, 17Z for operating expenses, 7Z for
salaries and 26Z for debt service. The government provides a substantial
proportion of the  funding for the CNEA, as cash generation from CNEA's
activities is limited. CNEA intends to finance the 1988 budget as follows:
Government contributions -direct plus indirect- US$484 million (62Z),
income: US$130 million (17Z) and borrowing: US$167 million (212).
CNEA's Role in the Power Sector
4.       CNEA's power activities have not originated in economic choices,
but in political decisions based on the desire to increase national
prestige, develop national technologies, and possibly military strategic



ANNEX 2.2.5
Page 2 of 2
reasons. The decision to construct nuclear power plants has always been
taken at the Presidency level and communicated to the SE, which considers
the nuclear plants as a given for planning purposes.
Existing facilities
5.       CNEA owns and operates two nuclear power plants: Atucha I, a 370
MW Pz?ssurized Heavy Water Reactor (PHWR), located in the province of
Buenos Aires, commissioned in 1974, and Embalse, a 648 MW PHWR, located in
the province of Cordoba, commissioned in 1984. Until 1987 both units
performed very well, with availability factors of 912 and 94? respectively.
Without considering capital costs, the combined generating costs of these
units, is about US$12 mills per KWh, which is much lower than any other
thermal generation in the country.
Works in Prosress
6.       The Atucha II project, a 745 MW Phil, is the only nuclear power
plant under construction. Its works began in 1980 and was planned to be in
operation by 1987. The original estimated cost of this project was about
US$1580 million (1979 price level without escalation), or US$2120/kW,
which, at the time, was a more expensive option than other available hydro
and thermal projects. About US$1330 million have been invested in the
period 1980-1987. The project has suffered high cost overruns due mainly
to the delays in ezecuting the construction works (the project is now
scheduled to be completed in 1993) and to the docline in the US dollar vis-
a-via the DH. (Host of the foreign ezchange costs are in DH). The current
estimated cost of the project at end 1987 price level, without including
allowances for escalation, amounts to about US$2800 million.
7.       The execution of Atucha II is well advanced.  The global progress
of the project is estimated at 60Z. Foreign supplies and services have been
completed in more than 80?, while civil works have reached 64Z. Local
supplies is the less advanced item (372), because of the difficulties CNEA
has experienced in obtaining financing for it.
8.       Investments required to complete the project amount to about
US$1,470 million. CNEA has not yet a financing plan to complete the
project. Until 1987 it had relied on government contributions for financing
the construction works. Since 1988, however, the government has
substantially reduced its contributions -the 1988 budget includes only
US$90 million for Atucha II. The financing gap amounts to about US$1051
million, of which US$897 million is local currency. and US$154 million is
foreign currency. Of the local currency portion of the gap, about US$224
million equivalent are taxes (VAT) for which CNEA is trying to obtain
exemption. Because of the inability of the government to provide
additional funds, at appraisal time CNEA was trying to arrange external
financing to complete the project. This financing would include the local
currency portion of the gap.

Demand Projections
MethodologY
1.       Sector demand projections  are  prepared  in  the framework of the
overall energy planning by a working group that includes representatives of
the SE as well as the major electricity companies, This is an appropriate
structure which allows for an exchange of view points in methodology
developments, in the interpretation of data trends and in the addition of
criteria and parameters, while facilitating dialogue among the concerned
parties and the reaching of consensus in the results. Projections are
updated annually during the second quarter of the year on ths asis of
actual consumption of the previous year.
2.       The methodology is evolving regularly  as experience is gained. At
present the group makes use of a model based on econometric method applied
to  each  sector  of   consumption;  residential,  commercial,  industrial,
government and others. For the residential sector, projections are based on
the population  growth  (an  exogenous  data),  the  electricity population
coverage and the per-household consumption. The latter is correlated to the
GDP per capita. Consumption elasticity to electricity prices is reflected
in the model. For the commercial sector the projections are based on a
mixed autonomous-value added model. This is adequate for a sector whose
growth process incorporates features that are similar to the industry
because of its sensitivity to the economic environment as well as other
features similar to the residential sector. For the industrial sector, the
heavy industry is segregated and projections for this sub-sector are based
on their individual expansion plans, while the light and miscellaneous
industries are correlated to the manufacturing GDP. This approach was
recommended by the Bank in 1984 because of the fast increase observed in
the electricity/value added ratio for industries, especially due to the
electricity intensive character of the aluminum industry. Results of this
model have been satisfactory. For other sectors (government, agriculture,
transport, public lighting) a simple extrapolation method is used. This is
acceptable given the small gravitation of these sectors.
Results
3.       Results of the  current  projections,  completed for the appraisal
mission in June 1988 are shown in Attachment 1. They show a global
electricity demand increase for the country (including autoproducers) of
about 6.0Z p.a. in the period 1987-1995 which is consistent with GDP growth
rates of 3.5Z for 1989 and 42 for 1990 and beyond as projected by the
Argentinian Ministry of Economy.

Draft Terms of Reference for the Power Generation Options Study
Background
1.       The 'Secretaria de Energial, (SE) of the Ministry of Public Works
and Services is responsible for the preparation of expansion plans for the
National Interconnected System (SIN). To develop least-cost
generation/transmission development plans, the SE uses a set of
mathematical models, oriented to minimize the total present value of the
system investments and operations. Results of this exercise depends of
assumptions and parameters used for operating the models. To ensure that
the sector expansion -and investment needs- reflects economic costs, the Se
requires to review -and eventually revise- the following criteria and
parameters currently used:
(a) plant factors of the existing and future thermal plants;
(b) thermal options to develop the SIN generation plant; and
I! oeo    c cosp  of oae f   i np.er genQeYratien.-
%_0 -  ~    ~ __ ar---  --
Obiectives
2.       The objectives of the study are the following:
(a) to define the operating conditions of the existing thermal
plants and recommend the corresponding parameters to be used
in expansion planning;
(b) to recommend the future role of gas-fueled Combined Cycle (CC)
thermal plants in the expansion of the SIN; and
(c) to recommend a set of values for the economic cost of gas for
power generation expansion.
Scope of Work
3.       1. Existing Thermal Plants. To evaluate the operating conditions
of the thermal plants, to project these to the future, and to prepare a
cost/benefit analysis of rehabilitation, whenever this is deemed possible.
2. Future Thermal Plants. To estimate the costs and operational
characteristics and reliability of steam thermal plants of modern
technology and to recommend operating criteria and parameters for expansion
planning.
S. CC Plants. To gather information on generation characteristics
and costs of existing thermal plants elsewhere in the world -investments
and operating costs,heat rates, availability, lifetime, and other technical

and economic data-, to examine options for converting ex$sting steam plants
or/and gas turbines to CC,to seek data which would perm't to assess the
future development of the CC technology and strategy of the main
manufacturers of CC plants.
4. Cost of Gas. To evaluate the availability of gas for power
generation and to recommend projected economic costs.
Organization of the Study
4.       The study would be carried out by independent consultants
satisfactory to the Bank, under terms of reference agreed upon between the
SE and the Bank, with substantive participation of technical staff from the
SE and the federal utilities. The consultant should arrange visits for
selected personnel to power stations abroad and to manufacturers
headquarters.

ARGENTINA
ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
Economic Evaluation of Completion of the Atucha II Project
1.       Completion of Atucha II may  or  may  not be justified on economic
grounds depending on the possible costs associated to the cancellation of
the ongoing contracts for equipment supply, civil works construction and
erection and installation. To analyze whether the project is economically
viable, the costs of completing the project must be compared with the cost
of implementing an alternative which would provide equivalent service.
Atucha II is expected to provide 745 MW of power and 5150 GWh/year of
energy at an operating cost  of  US$  3.4/MWh (excluding capital costs). If
financing were readily available, the plant could be completed by 1992, but
because of market growth reasons  it  is  only needed in 1994.  Investments
amount to about  US$  1245  million,  excluding  taxes  (Attachment  1).  A
aR-fuelpd mltRrnativ= whch u   ould --vide similar service would consist of
3x312 MW steam plants with capital investments of about US$ 840 million and
would generate at an operating cost of about US$ 13.0/MWh (excluding
capital costs).
2.       The economic evaluation  of  the  two alternatives mentioned above
provides an estimate of the order of magnitude of the rate of return of
investments to be made in Atucha II (Attachment 2). The results show that
completion of Atucha II has a low rate of return (5.9Z) when compared with
a conventional plant.
3.       The  advanced  status  of  implementation  of  Atucha  II  (60Z of
physical implementation, 80? of contracting; Attachment 3) suggests that
cancellation of the contracts would have a high economic cost, estimated to
be in the range of 402 to 602 of the remaining value of the contracts (80Z
is CNEA's estimate).    To  calculate  the  effect of possible cancellation
costs on the IRR of the project, both alternatives of para. 1 are compared
assuming that cancellation of the contracts would have an economic cost
equivalent to 50Z of the remaining value of the contracts under execution
while non-contracted items are totally saved (Attachment 4). The results
show that under these assumptions, the IRR of completing the project would
be about 16Z. Results of a sensitivity analysis made for the lower bound
of cancellation costs show that the IRR of completing the project is still
well above the estimated opportunity cost of capital (12Z) as shown below:

ANNEX 2.6.1
Page 1 of 2
ARGENTINA
ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
National Utilities: Finances
Income Statements (Annex 2.6.1.1)
1.       The rate of return of the  sector  during the last three years has
been constantly negative (-7.72, -2.1Z, -4.5Z) due to the low level of
tariffs (average of about 31 US mills/kWh). During the projection period
(1988-1995) the rate of return is expected to increase steadily until it
reaches a level of 4.42 in  1995.    This would be done through operational
efficiency measures (labor/gross plant in service would decrease from 2.62
to 1.92) and tariff increases (until they reach 47 US mills/kWh in 1995).
Under these circumstances, the cash operating ratio (cash operating
expenses as a percentage of operating revenues) which was 112.72 in 1987 is
expected to reverse its past deteriorating trend and reach 61.6Z in 1995.
The values of the cash operating ratio resulting are the following:
1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993
Cash Operating Ratio (2)   91.0  81.1  78.7  68.4  64.4  61.6
2.       Under the proposed operation,  the  cash  operating ratio would be
the main indicator to monitor the financial rehabilitation of the National
Utilities. It highlights the main problem cf the sector, i.e. low revenues
to cover cash operating expenses.   It is also convenient because its trend
is much less erratic than that of the rate of return which is affected by
the incorporation of new plants, and avoids the serious controversy
regarding the valuation of the sector fixed assets in service. Such
controversy stems from the factors used and the need to retire old plants.
Regarding the revaluation factors, the sector organization study (see para.
2.14 of main text) would review this matter, and regarding the old plants,
studies are being carried out to assess their availability. Under the
present principles used by the utilities for asset revaluation and
depreciation,  the  forecast  operating   ratio  (all  operating  expenses,
including depreciation, as a percentage of revenues) is as follows:
1988   1989   1990   1991   1992   1993
Operating Ratio (Z)      113.0  101.9   98.3   86.8   82.4   78.4
3.       However, it should be noted  that  the tariff the consumer pays is
about 402 higher (43 US mills/kWh) because of sales taxes--national and
provincial--and surcharges for energy funds earmarked for investment. If
the tariff paid by the consumer would fully remain in the utility to cover
its operating expenses, the rate of return would have been slightly
positive in the past and would reach a projected maximum of 11.62 in 1995.



ANNEX 2.6.1
Page 2 of 2
4.       The return  on  equity  is  significantly  affected  by  the heavy
interest on debt charges which has been negative in the past, it is
expected to remain so for a couple of years and then become slightly
positive in the remaining portion of the projection period.
Flow of Funds (Annex 2.6.1.2)
5.       The gross internal fund generation of the National Utilities group
during the last three years has been insufficient to cover debt service
obligations, it is expected to continue so in the next two years and become
increasingly positive  starting  in  1990.    However, other consumer-based
contributions have been enough to offset those negative values and leave a
positive balance, which zogether with the government equity contributions
have allowed to diminish substantially reliance on borrowings to fund the
investment program. In the funding mix, borrowings have been reduced from
21.9Z in 1985 to 12.82 in 1987 and are expected to remain at reasonable
levels during the projection period with a maximum of 48.52 in 1989.
Therefore, the complement of this percentage, i.e. the non-borrowed
funding, has had and is expected to have strong levels. To ensure that
sound levels are maintained, under the proposed operation a floor of 302
for non-borrowed funding would be established.
Balance Sheets
6.       The asset composition shows a  heavy  share of fixed assets (above
90!) which is typical of electric utilities. The degree of indebtedness is
reasonable as it reached a maximum of 441 in 1986 and during the projection
period it shows a decreasing trend until it reaches a minimum of 28.2f in
1995 as a result of the improving returns (para. 2) and the low reliance on
borrowings for its investment needs (para. 5). The current ratio has been
extremely low in the last three years (0.2, 0.4 and 0.5 times) in spite of
a high and increasing collection period (149, 165 and 190 days). Under the
assumptions utilized for the financial projections the collection period is
expected to start decreasing in 1988 (119 days) and continue until it
reaches about 80 days in 1991 and thereafter. The current ratio would be
maintained at a level of 0.6-0.7 times which is on the low side of what
would be reasonable for power sector utilities.

SEGBA: Finances
Income Statements (Annex 2.6.2.1)
1.       SEGBA's rate  of  return  hit  its  lowest  level  in 1987 (-13.7)
basically because of a decrease of tariffs in real terms of 102 with
respect to 1976 and substantial increases in its operating expenses,
especially labor which was 37.6Z of total operating revenues and 6.42 of
gross plant in service.   Inflation  was  one  of the main factors for such
behavior as tariffs did not keep up with the increasing rate of price
increases and labor demands grew more rapidly, including retroactive
payments decreed by  the  government.    In  1988,  such  negative trend is
expected to be reversed: the rate of return would be -2.62 as tariffs
increase 9.2Z in real terms and labor costs are reduced to 24.3Z of total
operating revenues and 5.02 of gross plant in service. SEGBA is making its
best efforts to reach such levels in 1988 under an austerity program and a
close follow up on its operational budget, which until in August 1988
showed no major deviations.    During  the 1988-1995 projection period, the
positive trend is expected to continue as the rate of return would reach
5.02 in 1995 resulting from an average tariff for the utility that would
increase from 48.2 to 'B.5 US mills/kWh; in 1995 labor expenses would be
14.4Z of operating revenues and 3.62 of gross plant in service; and the
working margin (percentage of operating revenues left after covering cash
operating expenses) would increase from 6.8Z to a maximum of 25.22 in 1993
while it was -30.92 in 1987.    Due  to the high interest charges, however,
the return on equity would be lower than the rate of return, moving from
-6.82 in 1988 to 2.82 in 1995.
2.       Of course,  all  of  the  above  expectations  are  subject to the
government taking corrective actions to neutralize the negative impact of
the high inflation rates currently affecting the economy of the country.
The weight of SEGBA in sector finances is quite important as it has the
major group of consumers (3.8 million) and is the major generator of funds
in the sector which are in great measure transferred to the other companies
(AyE and HIDRONOR), its major suppliers of energy.
Flow of Funds (Annex 2.6.2.2)
3.       From a very poor performance  in  1987  when all the internal fund
generation was not sufficient to cover its debt service payments, and the
negative balance could not be covered by the electricity and energy funds
received by the utility, during the projection period the funding mix of
SEGBA is expected to move to positive and improving grounds reaching
extremely good levels at the end of the period. The net internal funding
would grow from 11.72 in 1988 to 97.72 in 1995, and its reliance on
borrowings would be null in some years (1988, 1994 and 1995) and reach a
maximum of 53.82 in 1991. One reason for such funding mix is the pattern
of investment as the replacement ratio (investment/depreciation charge)



ANNEX 2.6.2

moves from about 1.0 times at the beginning of the projection period, it
reaches 2.2 in 1991 and drops to 0.7 in 1995. Under those circumstances,
the utility is expected to have cash surpluses at the end of the projection
period, but those surpluses will most likely be used in a more ambitious
investment program, with a higher replacement ratio and that would somehow
slow down the rapid aging of assets (accumulated depreciation/gross plant
in service) which would reach 46.22 in 1995.
Balance Sheets (Annex 2.6.2.3)
4.       As typical  of  an  electricity  distribution  utility,  the asset
composition shows a great concentration on fixed assets at the beginning of
the projection period (about 902) which is somehow reduced at the end of
the projection period should the cash surpluses materialize and increase
other type of assets (financial).   The indebtedness of the company is 302,
expected to reach a maximum of 35.82 in 1991, and drop, again to 302, in
1995. Such indebtedness ratio is low and shows the capacity of the entity
to get more debt should borrowings be available in view of the expected
internal fund generation. Under the Financial Rehabilitation Plan (FRP) to
be implemented for the sector, it is expected that the liquidity of the
company should improve as the current ratio which was about 0.5 times
during the past three years would  move  to  0.9   times in 1995 which is a
good  level  for  an   electric   distribution  company  like  SEGBA.  Such
improvement implies a better administration of its working capital as
payment periods for electricity which were 209 days in 1987 would be
reduced to 178 in 1988 and 61 in 1990 and thereafter. Collection of
receivables, which has not been a major problem at SEGBA, is also expected
to continue the improving trend of the past as it would move from 68 days
in 1987, to 62 in 1988 and 51 in 1995.

years, it is expected to become positive only in 1991 and to reach a level
of 4.12 in 1995. The labor/gross plant in service ratio which was 1.4? in
1985 reached a high of 2.12 in 1987 due especially to retroactive payments
decreed by the government. Such trend is expected to be reversed in 1988
when the ratio would be 1.7Z and go on improving until 1995 when it would
be 1.32. As related to operating revenues, the labor expense follows the
same pattern: 27.92 in 1987, 24.9Z in 1988 and 9.8Z in 1995. Considering
the increases expected under the sector Financial Rehabilitation Plan (FRP)
the average tariff for the utility would increase from 21.2 US mills/kWh in
1988 to 37.9  in  1995.    Under  these  circumstances,  the working margin
(percentage of revenues left after covering cash operating expenses) which
has been declining since 1985 (15.3X to 7.12), is expected to start
increasing in 1989 (10.42) and to reach a maximum of 33.4? in 1995. The
return on equity would remain negative until 1993 because of the high
interest charges.
Flow of Funds (Annex 2.6.3.2)
2.       The internal fund generation  of  AyE  has  not been sufficient to
cover its debt service payment in the aggregate of the past three years and
it is expected to continue that way during 1988 and 1989. In 1990 the debt
service coverage ratio would become 1.2 times and increase until it reaches
a peak of 3.0 times  in  1993.    With  the addition of the electricity and
energy funds to be allocated to the utility for its expansion program the
net consumer-based funding would be positive and steadily increasing during
the projection period.    As  a  result,  its  reliance on borrowings would
diminish from 84.82 in 1988 to 25.92 in 1995 showing a sound funding mix.
This positive trend would be achieved in spite of a growing replacement
ratio (investment/depreciation charge) which would move from 0.7 times in
1988 to 3.2 in 1995.
Balance Sheets (Annex 2.6.3.3)
3.       AyE's indebtedness is reasonable  (50.62  in 1987) and is expected
to i.mprove during the projection period until it reaches 32.42 which
denotes a sound capital structure and reflects the improving returns of the
company and its low reliance  on  borrowings.   Its current ratio which was
0.7 times in 1987 is expected to reach 1.0 times in 1988 reflecting a good
level  of  liquidity.    Such   ratio  depends  greatly  on  a  substantial
improvement in the payment period of electricity purchased which would be
reduced from 428 days in 1987 to 210 in 1988, 150 in 1989, 110 in 1990 and
60 from 1991 onwards. The collection period is expected to be reduced from
300 days in 1987 to 146 in 1988 and about 70 from 1989 onwards. All these
ratios reflect a sound working capital management which the company will
have to implement during the projection period.

HIDRONOR: Finances
Income Statements (Annex 2.6.4.1)
1.       During the last two years HIDRONOR's rate of return has been close
to zero. During the projection period (1988-1995) the rate of return is
expected to have a low of 0.6Z in 1988 and a maximum of 5.82 in 1992, and
remain at  5.62  thereafter.    Such  pattern  is  common  to hydroelectric
generating utilities due to the incorporation of major assets in its rate
base. In the particular case of HIDRONOR, one of the reasons for the low
rate of return at the beginning of the projection period is the low
generation due to major repairs in the El Chocon dam which will reduce
sales by 15.82 in 1988 and the filling of the Piedra del Aguila reservoir
which will reduce sales by 22.22 in 1990. Plant turnover, which was 142 in
1985 is expected to reach a low of 4.42 in 1988 and increase from then
until 1992 when 't would reach a  maximum of 9.22.  This low- plant turnover
reflects the low tariff levels prevailing in Argentina ard the relatively
young age of HIDRONOR's assets (accumulated depreciation/gross plant in
service of 2.52 in 1987 and 3.9? in 1995) resulting from the continuous
incorporation of new plants in service.
2.       The cost of labor to total  operating revenues is high for a hydro
generating utility   2.6Z in 1987)  basically  because of the low levels of
tariffs (13.9 US mills/kWh in 1987), but at the end of the projection
period it is expected to reach a more appropriate level (9.62) when tariffs
would be much higher (24.2 US mills/kWh). Depreciation which was 33.72 of
operating revenues in 1986 would be reduced to 7.22 in 1988 due to a change
in the depreciation charge, from straight line to sinking fund, as
authorized under the concession agreement with the government. HIDRONOR's
working margin (percentage of operating revenues left after covering cash
operating expenses) has been positive in the last three years and is
expected to continue so during the projection period. It would move from a
high of 56.32 in 1985 to a low of 21.72 in 1988 and increase until it
reaches a plateau of about 62% in 1992 and thereafter.
Flow of Funds (Annex 2.6.4.2)
3.       The internal funds generated from such operational results was not
sufficient to cover the debt service payments in 1986 and 1987 and is
expected to continue  eo  until  1990.    Starting  in  1991 it will become
slightly positive as the debt service coverage ratio becomes 1.1 times in
1991. However, due to the significant amounts of electricity and energy
funds that HIDRONOR will receive, the consumer-based net fund generation
will be positive every  year.    Borrowings  will  reach a maximum of about
-2.0 in 1989-1990 at which time the investment of the company also reaches
a maximum.

balance Sheets (Annex 2.6.4.3)
4.       Such funding mix  has  allowed  the  preservation  of a reasonable
degree of indebtedness which in 1987 was 38.6Z and will improve in the
future until it reaches 17.0S in 1995. Under those circumstances, HIDRONOR
could be able to face a larger construction program with greater reliance
on borrowings than planned.   Its  current ratio follows an erratic pattern
because of the also erratic patterns of sales and investment: it reached a
maximum of 0.7 times in 1986 and is expected to reach a low of 0.2 in 1990
at which time the trend will be reversed as it increases steadily until it
reaches 0.6 in 1995. This ratio is reasonable as it is the result of a
collection period of about 90 days and a payment period for suppliera of 45
days, both normal under the present contractual arrangements of HIDRONOR.
To achieve such level, however, it has been assumed that the collection
period which was 136 days in 1987 would be reduced to 90 days in the
projection period.

2.       Up to 1987, two  thirds  of  the  funding requirements of EBY have
becn for direct investment in the  project  and one third has been used for
debt service payments. Most of the financing has been through borrowings:
47? from the Argentinian government and 51? from financing agencies, the
rest (2X) being equity contributions from the Argentinian and Paraguayan
governments.
3.       The above utilization and composition  of  funds has resulted in a
balance sheet with heavy shares of fixed assets (US$3.0 billion or 99% of
total assets) and debt (US$2.9 billion or 982 of total equity and
liabilities). The asset composition is typical of a hydroelectric utility
during the construction  period.    The  heavy  debt  would be particularly
worrisome, but since the Argentinian government is the mai'. creditor (53Z)
the remaining portion of debt owed to non-shareholders (45%) is reasonable
for a hydroelectric utility.
4.       However reasonable this share  of  debt to non-shareholders may be
considered, the main problem with the debt of EBY is its profile in
relation to the long project construction period as many repayments become
due before the project is completed (e.g. IBRD loan 1761-AR will be fully
repaid by end-1994, two years before project completion).
Forecast
5.       Basically because  of  such  debt  profile,  and the corresponding
interest payments, forecast the funding  requirements of EBY will be larger
for debt service (53Z) than  for  the physical construction of the Yacyreta
project (46X), as shown in the following table:

6.       To ease the heavy  debt  service  burden,   the government and EBY
have taken already some measures such as negotiating the rescheduling of
significant portions of the debt  and  the  assumption by the government of
future debt service payments. On the part of government loans, a flexible
arrangement on repayments has been set up as they will be made only when
the entity has the resources available for this purpose.
7.       These measures have signifieantly  alleviated  the finances of EBY
and have allowed it to concentrate on the financing of the physical

construction of the project.   Except  for a relatively minor non-committed
supplier credit (US$13.0 million), EBY's non-committed requirements for the
physical construction of the project are about US$400.0 million, which EBY
plans to finance with two loans it will request in 1990 also from the Bank
and IDB (US$200.0 million each).    Therefore, the entity relies heavily on
the financing that it can obtain from these two multilateral agencies for
the conclusion of the Yacyreta project.   Annex 2.6.5.2 gives a forecast of
fund requirements and planned sources of funds for the conclusion of the
project, of which the following l-ble is a summary:

I/ Bsed on version No. 48 of EBY's Project Flow of Funds
V/ It Includes the two potential future loans from IBRD and IDB
(US8200.0 million each)
8.       As can be seen from the above table, during the 1990-96 period the
internal cash generation becomes significantly important as it has a
preponderance in the funding composition (40Z), reducing substantially the
weight of the non-government borrowings (from 55Z in the 1988-89 period to
24X). The internal cash generation is expected to come from the sales of
electricity starting in 1993 as the first units become operational. Even
though  the  Binational  Agreement  for  Yacyreta  es.ablishes  a financial
tariff, which is supposed to provide all the funds necessary to cover its
operational  cash  expenses  and   its  financial  obligations,  the  above
projection has been prepared on the basis of a tariff resulting from a
capital recuperation factor of 8Z for a sinking fund type of amortization.
This system has been officially adopted as more adequate for implementation
than the financial tariff which, if strictly applied, would produce erratic
tariff levels. Under a broad interpretation of the Agreement, the adopted
tariff system wnuld basically comply  with  the legal provisions because of
the flexible repayment conditions of government loans to EBY (para. 6).

ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
The Yacyreta Project
Background
1.       The Yacyreta  hydroelectric  project  has  its  origin  in studies
carried out since the beginning of this Century initially with the main
objective of improving navigation on the Parana River at the rapids of
Apipe. In 1958 the Governments of Argentina and Paraguay formed the
"Comision Mixta Tecnica Paraguayo-Argentinal (CMT) for the purpose of
studying  the  river's   hydroelectric   potential   at  these  rapids  and
improvements in navigation. A prefeasibility study was completed in 1964,
and in 1971 an international consortium of consultants, formed by Harza
Engineering Co. (USA), Lahmeyer International GMBH (Germany), A.D.E., S.A.
(Argentina), Yacyreta S.A. (Paraguay) and Cuyum, S.A. (Argentina) was hired
to prepare a feasibility study. This study was completed in December 1973,
and its conclusions provide:d the basis for the preparazion of the Treaty of
Yacyreta which was ratified in that same month by both Governments.
2.       The treaty contains agreements related to:
(a) the creation of "Entidad Binacional Yacyretal (EBY) to study,
design, build and operate the Yacyreta hydroelectric project and
related works;
(b) the co-ownership of the works to be constructed;
(c) the ratification of the principle of free river navigation and the
construction of the necessary facilities to this effect; and
(d) the rules on the use of energy produced by the project.
3.       A further step in  the  preparation  of  the  project was taken in
1974, when Yacyreta hired the consortium Harza, Lahmeyer and Associates to
prepare the final design for the project w.iich was completed during the
period 1974-1978. On the basis of these studies the Bank appraised (July
1978) and approved (October 1979) a US$210 million loan to the Government
of Argentina for the construction of the project.
Project Description
4.       The project is  located  on  the  Parana  rirer, the international
boundary between Argentina and Paraguay, about 80 kms downstream from the
towns  of  Posadas  (Argentina)  and  Encarnacion  (Paraguay).    The  main
objective of the project is to provide base-load hydroelectric energy for
Argentina's power sector.   Other  objectives  are to improve navigation on
the Parana river by eliminating the rapids of Apipe and to provide



ANNEX 3.1.4
Page 2 of 5
irrigation for both Argentina ant Paraguay in the provinces of Misiones tad
Corrientes and the Department of Itaipu, respectively, and to augment the
fishery industry of the region.
5.       The project comprises:
(a)  an earth dam,  approximately  65  km  long (including power house,
spillways and navigation lock), with a uniform elevation above
sea-level of 86 m, and a maximum height of 42 m, creating a
reservoir with an area c1f about 1,720 km2 and a total storage
capacity of 21,000 million cubic meters;
(b)  two spillways with a total discharge capacity of 95,000 m3/sec;
(c)  a conventional covered power house  with  20 Kaplan turbines 1  of
135 MW, operating at 71.4  rpm;  20  generators of 150 MVA, with a
power factor of 0.9, operating at 50 HZ, 13.2 kv, which will
produce 20,200 Gwh/year and transformers, control equipment, etc.;
(d)  fish passage facilities to  preserve  the fishery resources of the
Parana river;
(e)  a navigation lock which would  allow  the  passage of ships with a
maximum draft of 12 ft.;
Cf)  irrigation intakes, one in each  country  with a maximum intake to
permit the development of agriculture in the lands bordering the
reservoir;
Cg)  the Aguapey, Tacuary,  San  Martin  and  Caraguata dikes, with the
same elevation as the main dam, to avoid flooding of potentially
rich agricultural lands in Paraguay, including either pumping
facilities or discharge channels to transfer the water to the
reservoir;
(h)  permanent  villages   to   house   supervisory   personnel  during
construction and, afterwards, the personnel in charge of the
project operation;
Mi)  about 90 km of access roads which will be incorporated to the road
systems of both countries;
(j)  a bridge, 1,500  m  long,  over  the  Ana-Cua  branch of the river
needed for access to the project site;
(k)  the relocation of  infrastructure  works  such as railways, ports,
highways,   sanitation   works    and   electric   and   telephone
installations;
1/ The power house will permit to install intake structures for 10
additional units to be installed in the future when the extra peaking
capacity would be justified.



ANNEX 3.1.4

(1) the resettlement of about 40,000 persons on both riverbanks as the
result of the creation of the main reservoir; and
(m)  a 500 KV transmission  system  to  transmit the energy produced at
the plant to the consumption centers.
Project Execution
- Engineering
6.       EBY retained the services  of  Harza  Eng. Co. (USA) together with
Lahmeyer  International  (Germany)  and   their  Argentina  and  Paraguayan
associates for the technical supervision of the execution of the project.
This consortium called "Consultores Internacionales de Yacyreta" (CIDY) has
total responsibility for supervising the execution of the project. EBY
controls the activity of its consultant at the project site through a
superintendent of works with a small group of qualified professionals.
Given the exceptional size of the project, EBY has retained a panel of
well-know'- international experts satisfact.ry to the Bank in different
disciplir.es (geology, hydraulics, etc.), to conduct periodic reviews of the
dam and structures during construction.   EBY  has also agreed to submit to
the Bank for review no later than one year before the expected completion
of the dam, a report showing appropriate arrangements to periodically
inspect the dam and related structures during the operation of the project.
- Construction Works
7.       The main  civil  works  are  being  executed  by  an international
consortium (ERIDAY-UTE) composed of Impregilo S.P.A. (Italy), Dumez S.A.,
(France) and several contractors from Germany, Italy, Argentina and
Paraguay, under a contract signed in October 1983. The bidding process for
executing the civil works begun in 1979 through a pre-qualification of
constructors. The proposals presented by the contractors were opened in'
June, 1980, but the contract was signed only in October, 1983, due to a
protracted procurement dispute between EBY and the Bank. The works begun
in 1984 at a low pace because of the economic problems faced by the
country, the low rate of collection of the electrical funds and the
difficulties encountered by the Government in securing external financing.
By mid 1986 EBY, under a new management, reviewed the design and
implementation schedule of the project, and negotiated with the contractor
a rescheduling of works which resulted in a two-year delay in relation to
the original  schedule.    Execution  of  the  work  has  been, since then,
satisfactory. By April, 1988 the global progress of the execution of the
main civil  works  contract  was  estimated  at  40Z.    Ine  status of the
different elements of the plant is as follows: (i) the navigation lock
structure is completed and the navigation channels very advanced; (ii)
progress of the dam reaches 26Z, (iii) excavation for the main spillway has
reached 872 and the concrete works have progressed 78Z; (iv) excavations
for the Ana-Cua spillway have reached 902 (v) excavations for the power
house have reached 702, while concrete works have reached 202

8.       The electromechanical equipment is  being procured through several
bids  (turbines,  generators,  cranes,   fish  passage.i facilities,  gates,
transformers, bus bars, SF6 substation equipment, control equipment, and
navigation lock equipment). The acquisition of all this equipment is well
advanced and no one is at this time in the critical path of project
implementation. Contracts for supplying of the electromechanical equipment
which are signed are:

led by Siemens (Germany) on which the contract has not been negotiated;
(ii) cranes and fish passage equipment; and (iii) transformers and other
equipment distributed in several packages.
- Implementation Schedule
9.       The project implementation schedule  is presented in Attachment 1.
Milestones are: completion of dams: April 1992; reservoir filling: November
1992;  installation  of   first   generation   unit:   February  1993;  and
installation of unit number 20: September 1996.
Project Cost
10.      The original project cost,  as  reflected  in the 1979 SAR (Report
No. 2342-AR) including physical and price contingencies, at December 1977
price level, was US$3,706.3 million of which US$2,187.1 million was local
costs and US$1,519.2 million  was  foreign  cost.   Investments made in the
period 1979-1987 amount to about US$2,052 million expressed in current
dollars. Of this, US$1,659 million is local currency and US$393 is foreign
currency. Investments yet to be made in the period 1988-1996 expressed in
January 1988 price level amount to about US$2,290 million of which US$1,482
million in local currency and US$808 is foreign currency.

Environmental Aspects
11.      The environmental impact that the project will cause is related to
the transformation of the river's natural flow conditions and the flooding
of areas in Argentina and Paraguay.   Research on the ecological aspects of
the project began  in  1972,  and  has  continued  to  date.   In 1978, EBY
approved a long-range program for the environment coordinated with project
implementation that includes studies on water quality, fishery resources,
river-bank forestry species, development of natural reserves, animal
rescue, reservoir cleaning and public health.   This program has evolved to
a Master Plan for the environmental protection which has been reviewed by,
and is acceptable to the Bank and is available in the project file. A
summary of the main EBY activities regarding the protection of the
environment is attached as Attachment 2.
Relocation Aspects
12.      Attachment 3 provides a  description  of  the policies defined and
the actions taken by EBY to implement the vast resettlement program for the
about 40,000 persons affected by the flooding of the reservoir as well as
infrs.' ructure works flooded by the reservoir. During supervision of Loan
1761-AR the Bank has closely followed up the design and implementation of
this program. Progress has been satisfactory and plans for completing this
component on time are also satisfactory.

ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
Yacyreta Proiect
Environmontal Aspects
Fish Hikration Facilities and Fisheries
1.       Protection of the ichthyofauna at the Yacyreta project requires is
the construction of up-stream migration and fish passage facilities.
Construction of the Yacyreta dam without these facilities would mean
closing off 650 km of the river to fish migration with possible adverse
effects on reproduction of the species and fishing all along the river.
The fish passage facilities provide for the passage of species with a broad
range of behavioral patterns such as displacement velocities and normal
depth habitat. Downstream migration of the fish will be allowed through
the spillways, navigation lock and the turbines themselves. In order to
develop the fishery potential of the Yacyreta reservoir, EBY has set a
special program to study fishery resources. It includes researeh on the
bioecology of major fish species and on inventory of fish industries and
fishery conditions in the zone. These studies will serve as the basis for
the formulation and implementation of a program to develop and manage fish
production.
Water Quality
2.       Conversion of the river into a reservoir is expected to produce
minor changes in water quality such as turbidity, conduc-ivity, alkalinity
(pH factor) and biological productivity of phytoplankton. However, these
changes will not have damaging effects since the power plant will be
operated as a  run-of-the-river  plaut to permit a steady flow of the water
(the reservoir average retention time is lower than 15 days). The most
negative effects will be felt immediately after the reservoir is filled
because of the decomposition of organic material in the flooded area. EBY
has plans for clearing the dam area to decrease the negative effects of
decomposition during the early years of operation of the project.
3.       Over the long run water quality can be negatively affected by
pollution resulting from population growth and industrial development in
the area. Treatment plants for liquid waste are envisaged in the Posadas
and Encarnacion resettlement projects, and since these cities do not have
such facilities at this moment, river pollution from this source is
actually expected to decline. EBY has a hydrobiological laboratory in
Posadas to monitor water quality.
4.       The experience of other dams in similar climates indicates that
the Yacyreta reservoir could develop water hyacinths and ferns, although
because the low retention time these plants are not expected to pose
special problems, except in shallow areas. Clearing of the reservoir will
help to impede development of that vegetation, which needs a suitable
bottom in which to anchor. However, control measures may have to be



ANNEX 3.1.4
Attachment 2
Page 2 of 3
adopted in the future. Eutrophication, that is, the reduction of oxygen
levels, transformation of organic material into gases such as toxic
hydrogenated sulphurs, are not expected to be important because Yacyreta is
a run-of-the-river plant, but the process will be carefully monitored.
EndanRered Species
5.       The flooded areas, mainly on the Island of Yacyreta, contains
certain species of animals in danger of extinction. These include swamp
deer, maned wolf (aguara-guazu), alligator (vacare) and possibly two
species of otter. EBY has created a natural reserve park in Paraguayan
territory and has transferred the wild animals to the area.
fEosion and Maintenance of Minimum Water Levels
6.       Operation of the Yacyreta plant will produce high fluctuations in
river level downstream of the dam which are not expected to produce
erosion. Proposed operation of the plant stipulates that minimum water
discharge will be very similar to the minimum average river flow and, since
this is a "run-of-the-river plant, the difference in water level between
dry and rainy seasons will closely follow normal river behavior.
Habitat Downstream the Dam
7.       Project construction will not exert negative effects on the life
cycle of fish and other aquatic organisms living downstream from the dam.
The variation in oxygen level from water discharge will not be expected to
be significant. A 4.5 Ka section of the Ana-Cua arm would be dried up when
the spillway located on that arm is not in use (78.5Z of the time), which
would form shallow pools of water with unfavorable ecological and health
effects. To avoid this problem the plant will maintain a minimum water
flow in the Ana-Cua arm.
Forestry
8.       Conservation of river bank forestry species is an important aspect
of ecology in the project zone. EBY is carrying out a program aimed at
making recommendations on proper use and conservation of the forest and
river-side habitat. This will not only help reduce evaporation but will
also reduce erosion and increase the esthetic value of the project, which
is highly important for tourism.
Water-borne Diseases
9.       Since 1975 EBY has conducted studies on health aspects in the
project zone, ascertaining that water-borne diseases such as intestinal
parasites are present in the area. There is also the risk of contracting
diseases transmLtted by vectors (malaria, Chagas disease, yellow fever,
etc.). The construction contracts contain provisions on health actions
designed to control endemic diseases in the area. Moreover, with advice
from specialists from the Pan American Health Organization, EBY is
monitoring endemic diseases in the area and intend to continue this after
the reservoir is filled. Special precautions are being taken in the
construction of dwellings for relocation purposes to control the "kissing
reduviid bug, vector of the ^Chagas disease^ (trypanosomiasis).

ELECTRIC POWER SEOTOR PROJECT
Yacyreta Project
Relocation Aspects
Background
1.       The construction of Yacyreta requires  the  carrying out of a vast
relocation  program  designed  following   principles  established  in  the
Yacyreta Treaty which reflects the concerns of the two countries for the
well being of the population displaced and for the replacement of
installation flooded by the project execution. The governing principles in
the Treaty are construction and replacement of installations affected and
resettlement of groups displaced in equal or upgraded conditions. This
responsibility implies that Yacyreta must not only expropriate or purchase
property as required for the works, reconstruct infrastructure works
affected by the flooding, pay indemnity for damages suffered by third
parties and construct housing and community facilities, but also carry out
activities oriented to adapt the population concerned to its new location,
endeavoring insofar as possible to avoid creating social distortions or
breaking ties with work, welfare and cultural centers.
2.       Relocatior. plans were prepared  by  consultants  on the basis of a
survey completed in 1980 and have been duly revised on the basis of updated
information. Information provided by surveys include cartographic maps,
detailed data of the population affected including socioeconomic and
cultural profile of inhabitants, population density, possible relocation
and  expansion  areas,   housing   and  population  distribution,  sanitary
equipment, soil use, educational facilities and spheres of influence,
current status and building affected, road networks and connections, etc.
Design of infrastructure works was made following the replacement principle
for  roads,  railways,  port   facilities,   sanitation  and  electric  and
telephonic facilities. Relocation proposals for urban and rural population
were then prepared in coordination with national and local authorities.
For the urban sector a structural approach to the cities concerned was
adopted,  taking  into  account   development  possibilities  and  existing
relationships and interdependencies.   For the rural population, relocation
sites were discussed with local authorities and integrated to rural
development plans of both countries.
Description of Flood Zone
3.       The Yacyreta reservoir with a  normal  elevation  of 82 m over sea
level, will have an approximate area of 1,720 km2 of which 820 km2 are
flooded land in Paraguay and 240 km2 in Argentina, while 660 km2 are
covered by the river and its  adjacent  canals.   Of this area, only 19 km2
are used for farm crops and 248 km2 for natural pastures. The land subject
to periodic flooding is 210 km2, the swamps are 400 km2, the woods and
shrubs account for 196 km2 and the towns and cities cover 7 km2. The
flooding of this area will affect about 9,000 families, economic activities
(agriculture, industry and commerce), community facilities (educational,



ANNEX 3.1.4
Attachment 3
Page 2 of 8
religious, recreational and government) and infrastructure installations
(railways, ports, roads, electricity facilities and government buildings).
4.       According to the  population  census  conducted  by the binational
entity in 1977 and subsequent updating efforts, the group displaced would
total about 40,000 persons, of whom 25,000 are located in Argentina and
15,000  in  Paraguay.        This   represents   5,800  and  3,100  families,
respectively. Most of this population (about 30,000 persons) is located in
the urban areas of Posadas in Argentina and Encarnacion and Carmen del
Parana in Paraguay as shown below:

5.       Of the houses affected in the Argentine side by the reservoir, 18Z
are substandard units built with discarded materials and 82 are slabs with
adobe walls, straw roofs and dirt floors. Property tenure indicates that
30t of the families are land and housing owners, 72 are land and housing
tenants and 63Z are land occupants with no legal title.

6.       From the socioeconomic standpoint the population in the zone to be
flooded in the city of Posadas can be characterized as belonging primarily
to the most depressed  and  marginal  strata.    Activities relating to the
provision of personal services for the Posadas urban center and temporary
jobs predominate. A large group operates on a subsistence level depending
upon the river settJng from which they derive water, firewood, fish and
income from smuggling.
7.       The rural area flooded on  the  Argentine side amounts to 225 km2.
It is characterized chiefly by natural pasture, and to a lesser extent, by
rice fields, which are irrigated by water pumped from the Parana river and
adjacent streams. In addition wheat and soybeans with very low yields are
produced.   The  lack  of  suitable  practices  and  technologies  and poor
irrigation and drainage conditions are factors limiting farm output. There
are some wooded areas,  p-rticularly  pine  forests.    With regard to land
tenure, the predominant system is large landed estates, especially in the
Province of Corrientes, but there are 120 farms of less than 24 hectares
operating on a subsistence economy and employing only family labor.
8.       The flooding will affect a  large number of community services and
industrial  and  commercial  establishments.    These  include  ten primary
schools, two churches, two first aid clinics, police installations and the
naval headquarters, nine lumber industries, one cold storage operation, one
shipbuilding outfit, and 150 olerias.   The olerias deserve special mention
since they use the clay  soil  on  the  banks  of  the Parana River to make
bricks and tiles. Their traditional aources of raw material will disappear
entirely when the  dam  is  built.    The  port  installations and railroad
station at Posadas will be under water, as will 30 km of main railroad
tracks, 10 km of roads, the Empresa Electrica de Misiones (EMSA) thermal
power plant, and the electrical telephone and water supply networks.
- Paraguay
9.       The urban population affected in Paraguay numbers 8,153 persons in
Encarnacion, (about one third of the city), and 500 persons in Carmen del
Parana. The rural population totals 6,673 persons. Income data classify
692 of the population affected at Encarnacion as belonging to the middle
and higher income strata.    In  contrast,  in  the  rural area 952 are low
income.
10.      The number of housing  units  affected  in  the  zone is 3,294, of
which 1,877 are located in urban areas (1,552 in Encarnacion) and 1,417 in
rural areas. Of the urban housing 412 has more than 700 m2 in land and 852
more than 360 m2, indicating a pastoral setting that is changing radically
with the construction of the new international bridge, the influx of
workers and proposed regional development plans for the area which would
render these lot sizes inappropriate.
11.      The flooding will have  major  implications for the urban dynamics
of the Encarnacion city, since it will affect its central area and major
commercial sector. Seventy percent of the houses are occupied by their
owners who also own the land, 902 have electric lights and 64Z a septic
tank waste disposal system.



ANNEX 3.1.4

12.      In the rural area of Paraguay  there are 12 km2 of cultivated land
and 119 km2 of natural pastures, 392 km2 of swamps, 132 km2 of woods and
brush and 192 km2 of land subject to flooding. The major crops are rice
and cotton. Stock raising is extensively practiced but productivity is
low. On Yacyreta, Talavera and other islands that would be under water,
farming is essentially at the subsistence level.
13.      Solutions given by EBY to  the  only identified problem related to
relocation of tribal people is satisfactory. In 1987 the Bank learned that
a group of indians of the tribe Mbya formerly living in the Yacyreta island
had left the island by 1974, at the time the Yacyreta international treaty
was being prepared.    A  field  investigation  conducted  by the Episcopal
Conference (PEC) concluded that the tribe, composed of 10 families (about
40 people) might have left the island to avoid problems with the
authorities and thus the construction of the project would have been the
cause of disruption of the tribes norma: way of life. Upon the Bank's
request, and following meetings between representatives of the PEC, EBY and
the Bank, EBY devised a solution for reuniting the affected tribal people
by resettling it in a 370 hectare property, bought by EBY. The relocation
area provides adequate agricultural support capability, as well as access
to fishing areas. EBY is also committed to provide social and sanitary
support to the tribe during the adaptation period.
14.      The total number of commercial establishments flooded will be 601,
of which  500  are  located  in  Encarnacion.    The  number  of industrial
enterprises affected is 280. Most of them are involved in processing farms
commodities from  the  area  (mills,  tanners,  sawmills,  grain silos, oil
factories, etc.), with about 100  olerias  which, as noted on the Argentine
side, will lose their traditional source of raw material.  Special programs
have been prepared to address these situations.
15.      The inirastructure  works  flooded  include  the  major Paraguayan
public administration buildings in the Department of Itapua, three schools,
two churches, military installations, the launch dock and wharves in the
city of Encarnacion, 106 km of railroad lines, the Encarnacion electric
power plant and 702 of the electricity dist'ibution network, 80% of the
telephone lines, the water supply facility a.i.d much of the water supply
distribution network.
Relocation Policy of EBY
16.      The basic standards for the  policy  on resettlement of the urban,
semi-urban and rural population affected by the dam is that all those
inhabiting  urban  or  semi-urban   housing,  whether  owners,  tenants  or
occupants, are entitled to have another housing unit built for them by EBY.
However, if the person displaced should not wish to relocate, EBY will pay
proper indemnity.
17.      The housing to be delivered to  owners will be at least similar in
quality and size to that expropriated but should have the improvements
necessary to meet minimum health and habilitation standards. If the value
of the property affected is less than that to be delivered in exchange, EBY



ANNEX 3.1.4
Attachment 3
Page 5 of 8
will absorb a reasonable difference in price; if more, EBY will compensate
for the price difference or have access to housing programs to be run by
the National Housing Ministries.
18.      The tenants and  occupants  of  housing  and/or lands belonging to
others will be allocated minimum housing as their own property to be paid
for with financing and conditions suited to their payment capacity. If
their financial position permits, those beneficiaries could choose better
quality and/or larger housing.
19.      The minimal housing program  is  aimed  at  relocation of very low
income family groups, generally with uncertain rights to the land they
occupy.   Minimal  housing  is  the  initial  stage  of  a  house  that can
progressively develop as the economic and labor resources of the families
increase. In the urban sector of Paraguay minimum housing lots will have
running water and sewerage with a connection pipe or septic tank and
electricity installation with connection as the owner wishes, together with
public lighting and minimum finishing for adequate hygienic and maintenance
conditions.
20.      The policy defined  for  the  rural  sector stipulates that owners
could be indemnified but that every farm producer directly working a rural
field affected by the dam will be entitled to have the entity award him
another plot constituting an "economical farming unit". The award would be
based on a sale at cost to be paid for by a long-term development credit.
'Economical farming unit" is construed to mean a plot which, when worked
rationally by a family, enables it to meet its needs and ensures favorable
development of  the  farmizg  enterprise.    Preferably  the  plots will be
awarded in farm settlements.
21.      As defined, the relocation  policy  for  the urban, semi-urban and
rural population is adjusted to the socioeconomic position of those
affected, with a view to the least possible negative impact of the
flooding. This particularly facilitates the improvement of the conditions
of life of very low income groups with a reduced capacity for response to
the impact of the dam and provides them with a benefit in the form of
possible access  to  housing  with  minimum  habilitation.   The relocation
policy is adapted to the particular features of property structure in the
area and endeavors to retain the rural population on the farm.
22.      Relocation  of  the  urban  population  is  being  carried  out by
unintegrated groups, and EBY undertook the construction necessary to
urbanize the area and to provide community services. For relocation of the
businesses  involved,  commercial  areas   will  be  established  in  those
complexes in which they will be given relocation preference.
Development and Implementation of Relocation Plan
23.      The  implementation  of  the  relocation  plan  is  well advanced.
Schedules for completing it are satisfactory and are available in the
project file.    Budgetary  provisions  have  been  taken  to ensure timely
completion of the component which is being implemented as follows:

- Infrastructure Works
24.      The designs for the infrastructure  works were done by consultants
belonging to the Harza, Lahmeyer and Associates Consortium. These designs
were coordinated with concerned public institutions of Argentina and
Paraguay. A general description of the works to be carried out is as
follows:
(a)   Argentine side
(i) Railroad: construction of 31 km of main lines; passenger terminals
for trains and buses, with a covered surface, including sheds, of
approximately  14,000  m2;  freight  station,  with  an  11,500 m2
surface;  4  km  of   road  embarkment  protectors;  and  services
infrastructure.
(ii)  Port works: construction of freight and passenger docks at Posadas
approximately 300 m in length; buildings for passengers and
customs administration, with a covered surface of some 700 m2; and
services infrastructure.
(iii) Road projects: construction of 9.5 km of highways and two bridges
with spans of approximately 200 m each.
(iv)  Sanitation works: construction of  intakes with a pumping capacity
of 60,000 m3/day, 2 km of dischazge pipes; 1.7 km of feeder pipes;
two 750 m3 storage tanks  and  a  500  m3 regulator tank; 33 km of
distribution networks; a purification plant for liquid sewage; 35
km of sewer lines; 3 km of  outfalls with a pumping station; 12 km
of network storm drains.
(v) Electric and telephone works: installation of a provisional 24 MW
turbo-gas plant until the city of Posadas is fed power from the
Yacyreta plant; a 132/13.2 KV transformer substation; 9 km of
medium-tension lines; 33 transformer stations and 10 km of
distribution networks; and relocating 66 km of medium-tension
lines and 80 telephone lines.
(b)   Paraguayan side
(i) Railroads: construction of 93.4 km if railroad lines; a passenger
and freight station, with 17,000 m2 of covered surface; and
services infrastructure.
(ii)  Port facilities: construction at  Encarnacion  of 320 m of freight
and  passenger  docks;   buildings   for  passengers  and  customs
administration, with an area of 950 m2; services infrastructure.
(iii)  Roads: construction of 8 km of  highway sections; 230 m of bridges
and other road structures;
(iv)  Sanitation facilities: construction of  a  pumping plant; a 500 m3



ANNEX 3.1.4
Attachment 3
Page 7 of 8
storage  tank;  36  km   of   potable  water  networks;  a  sewage
purification plant; and 36 km network of sewers; a pumping station
with discharge piping; 14 km network of storm drains and 1.5 km of
open canals.
(v)  Electric and  telephonet construction  of  a  66/23  KV step-down
substation; 17 km of medium-tension lines; 35 km of low-tension
lines; 65 transformers stations; relocation of telephone network.
- Urban Housing
25.      Relocation at Posadas  is  being  made  in  four diversified areas
flexible enough to accommodate the different socioeconomic groups of the
population involved. A total of 4,250 dwellings with a total of about
250,000 square meters of area are being constructed. Dwellings consist of
single-family housing compatible with the housing and cultural patterns of
the population to be relocated.    The area for resettlement in Encarnacion
was chosen with a structural approach to the city of the future, taking
into account the forthcoming construction of the Encarnacion-Posadas
international bridge and the necessary ties between the city and rapidly
developing farm settlements in the Department of Itapua. The number of
dwell.'ngs in Encarnacion will be 1,900 with a total area covered of about
110,000  square  meters.    An  attempt  has  been  made  to  avoid  social
distortions or break in ties to job sites.
- Rural Programs
26.      On the Paraguayan side the best  alternative for most of the 1,230
houses affected was be to include them in expandinv existing national
settlements. This alternative required the formulation of an integrated
rural development project, including technical and credit assistance,
social  services,  road  infrastructure,   organization  of  producers  for
marketing purposes  and  other  activities.    On  the  Argentina  side, an
agreement was entered into with the Province of Corrientes whereby the
latter identifies alternatives for relocation of its rural population, and
a similar agreement is expected to be signed with the Province of Misiones.
-Social Programs
27.      The social programs, which will support and expedite relocation of
the population involved, are also being carried out. Those programs call
for undertaking the following activities, among others:
(i) Information and communication to the population on characteristics
of the Yacyreta project and relocation plans;
(ii)  identification  and  recording  of   needs   and  desires  of  the
population group involved and preparation of replies by the entity
to their concerns;
(iii) individual and collective advisory services to the population to
be relocated on options offered by Yacyreta;



ANNEX 3.1.4
Attachment 3
Page 8 of 8
(iv) implementation of labor training programs to enable the local
population to take advantage of job facilities created by the
project; and
(v) implementation programs to familiarize the relocated population
with their new housing, job and human environment to assist them
in solving problems created by adjust-msnts during the initial
resettlement period.
28.      The social programs is being  carried out in three phases: before,
during and after relocation.   EBY  has  setting up a follow-up and control
unit under the Coordination Directorate which is responsible for assessing
the efficiency and effectiveness of social programs, controlling adaptation
and transformation of the groups involved and changes in quality of life
and proposing corrective action required by the relocation plan.
-Monitoring
29.      The programming,  implementation  and  evaluation  of all programs
under the relocation plan is the responsibility of a specialized unit which
performs its functions in the work area on the right bank (Paraguay) and in
the left bank (Argentina).    Each  of  these  units  is be responsible for
areas: (a)  road,  port  and  railroad  works  and  supplementary jobs; (b)
housing, services and community facilities; (c) planning and administration
and relocation program; and (d) studies and projects. Under the planning
and administration of the relocation program are the social and rural
programs and all aspects of the relocation plan not involving physical
construction.   Appropriate  coordination  is  maintained  between  the two
implementation units both in the work sites and in EBY's headquarters.
30.      The degree  of  progress  achieved  by  the  relocation program is
estimated at 30Z. Schedule for completing the component are in line with
plane for filling the reservoir during November 1992.
31.      Monitoring of the  results  of  social  programs  is made by EBY's
social workers on a  continuous  basis.    Additionally  EBY has designed a
survey to assess results of the efforts made for solving problems
associated to relocation, mitigating social distress and for evaluating the
improvement in the standards of life expected to be achieved for the major
part of the displaced population.   So far results have been very positive.
For the purpose of verifying how the population affected has adapted to its
new environment and living conditions, ex-post evaluation should be made
two and five years after the project has been completed.

ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR PROJECT
Economic Evaluation of the Yacyreta Project
Background
1.         An oconomic study carried out in  1978 under Loan 1330-AR showed that
Yacyreta (2,700 MW) was part of the least-cost solutior. for expanding the
capacity of the  National  Interconnected  System  (SIN).   Commissioning of the
project's 20 generation units was scheduled for the period 1985-1989. On these
basis the Bank appraised the project in August 1978 and approved a US$210
million loan (Loan 1761-AR).    The  total  project cost, including physical and
price contingencies at December 1977 level prices, was estimated at appraisal at
US$3781 million, of which US$1519 million was the foreign component and US$2262
million the local component. Generating costs of the project were estimated at
US$18.9/MWh. The project's internal rate of return was estimated at 14Z.
2.         Some of the assumptions made at the time of appraisal for the project
economic evaluation are no longer valid:  First, demand of the SIN grew at rates
well below than expected; the appraisal estimate for demand growth during
1980-1990 was 9.OZ while actual growth in the period 1980-1987 has been only
3.31 p.a. and growth from 1987 to 2000 is now estimated to be about 6Z; and
second: the opportunity cost of natural gas is currently much lower than the
cost assumed in 1978; this is due to an important increase in the country's
proven gas reserves. These changes raise the question whether Yacyreta is still
in the least-cost expansion program to supply the demand.
Least-Cost Solution
3.         A "with/without the project, approach  was used to assess whether the
project is still the least-cost expansion solution by comparing the present
value of cash flows for components which would be different in both options.
Because of the relatively low cost of gas in Argentina, the alternative option
selected for the case without Yacyreta consists of a group of gas-fired thermal
plants which would ensure to the system a security of supply similar to
Yacyreta. A more comprehensive methodology would have been to produce a long-
term optimized master expansion program for the SIN where completion of Yacyreta
together with all other feasible projects available for sector expansion would
be compared, and then see whether or not Yacyreta would be chosen. It is felt
that this academically more sound but longer and more complex method would lead
to similar results given inevitable uncertainties in the evaluation of the costs
associated with the possible cancellation of the project.
4.         The evaluation was made using the following principal assumptions:
a)    Demand growtht 61 average in the period 1987-2000;
b)    Cash flow period:  1988-2038;

e)    Useful life of gas turbines:  15 years;
f)    Constant prices in US$ equivalent of, January 1988;
g)    Costs of gas:  equivalent to US$1.7/million BTU (or per thousand
cubic feet).
5.         Costs associated to the Yacyreta option include:
a)    investments in the hydroplant in the period 1988-1996;
b)    investments in the transmission system associated to Yacyreta;
c)    operating and maintenance costs  of Yacyreta, and the associated
transmission system;
6.         Cost associated to the gas option include:
a)    investments in thermal plants;
b)    operation and maintenance costs of thermal plants.
7.       The advanced stage of  execution  of the Yacyreta project suggests
that cancelling the works would result in either foregone benefits which
could be associated to the construction of Yacyreta or economic costs due
to the project cancellation. These cancellation costs are:
a)   navigation benefits;
b)   economic  costs  borne   by  contractors,  consultants  and
suppliers for cancellation of contracts;
c)   maintenance of abandoned works; and
d)   compensations  to  Paraguay  for   the  revocation  of  the
international treaty.
Investments
-Yacyreta
8.       Investments  in  Yacyreta  includes  infrastructure  works,  civil
works, mechanical and electrical equipment, camps, indemnization and
relocations, and environmental programs to be executed in the period
1988-1996.    Investments  made  up  to  1987  are  considered  sunk costs.
Investments in transmission were estimated on the basis of results of the
master plan study for developing of the SIN transmission facilities in the
period 1990-2000, financed by loan 1761-AR.

-Thermal alternative
9.       The first stage of Yacyreta will have twenty 135 MW turbines for a
total rated output of  2700  MW.    The  average  generation will be 20,200
GWh/year, for a plant  factor  of  802.    Thus,  the  plant is expected to
generate at full capacity to provide base load during most of the year.
The equivalent group of thermal plants was estimated to be four 750 MW
(net) steam plants located in different sites in the system (in the
northeast, in the northwest, in the Litoral area and close to Buenos Aires)
which, operating 6,730 hours/years, would generate the same amount of
energy as Yacyreta. However, as the reliability of this type of thermal
plant (because of planned plus forced outage) is about 75-802, studies
carried out with the system simulation model show that it would be
necessary to add about 270 MW (net) in gas turbines as reserve capacity to
provide, with equivalent reliability, the same total output as Yacyreta.
10.      Total average investment costs were estimated at US$850/kW for the
steam thermal plants and at US$350/kW for the gas turbines. These costs
represent  current  market  values.    Annu&l  investments  of  the thermal
alternative weriu prepared on  the  basis  of:    (i) the commissioning date
required to match the scheduled commissioning dates of the 20 units of
Yacyreta and which is consistent with the system energy requirements due to
the demand growth; and (ii) typical investment profiles for each type of
plant.
Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
11.      O&M costs of Yacyreta  were  estimated  by  EBY (US$15 million per
year). O&M of the thermal alternative (other than fuel) was estimated as
follows:  US$12.5/Kw-year  for  steam   plants  and  US$9/Kw-year  for  gas
turbines.    Fuel  consumption  was  estima:ed  as  the  needed  to replace
Yacyreta's expected generation. Thermal plants efficiency was estimated as
392 for steam plant. Generation in gas turbines was considered negligible.
12.      The economic cost of gas adopted in this analysis is based on Bank
estimates and is equivalent to about US$1.7/million BTU.
Cancellation
13.      Though difficult to estimate, they  cannot  be ignored and will be
handled as a lump sum in this evaluation. These items are:
a) Navigation benefits
Navigation benefits were estimated in the SAR at US$16 million for
1985, increasing from US$16 million/year to US$59 million/year
from 1986 to 2005 and remaining at that level thereafter (1979
price levels). The basis for this estimate was a transport study
for Argentina and Paraguay, which was part of the project
feasibility study. Estimates made by EBY on the basis of the
original study are that the present value of navigation benefits



ANNEX 3.3.2
Page 4 of 5
would be, as a lower bound, about US$220 million, of which half,
or US$110 million, would be attributable to Argentina.
b) Compensation to contractor, engineering consulting firms and
suppliers in case of cancellation of the project.
The cost of the civil works contract, which is likely to originate
most of the potential compensation claims in case of cancellation,
amounts to about US$1200 million (1983 dollars). The constructor
has mobilized about 4,500 people to the work site and his
installed  large  facilities  including   a  cement  plant,  three
concrete plants, camps,  etc.    Any  cancellation  of works would
imply considerable expenses for the contractor as well as the loss
of foregone  income.    Negotiations  for  rescheduling  the works
(stretching out for two years the construction period), for
example, originated a US$120 million claim from the contractor.
EBY's estimates amount to US$500 million, which might be on the
high side. A notional figure of US$120 million was taken as a
lower boundary for the evaluation.
c) Maintenance of abandoned works.
If the project were cancelled, no cost would be assigned to
maintenance  of  abandoned  works.    However,  it  would  not  be
reasonable to lose the investments already made and leave works
unattended. It was estimated that at least an annual cost of
about US$5 million would be required for vigilance and maintenance
of the works or US$40 million present value.
d) Compensation to Paraguay.
Any cancellation of the project would certainly originate a claim
from  Paraguay.    In  addition  to  the  expected  benefits  from
compensation for the energy which belongs to, but is not used by
Paraguay (US$656 million present value at 121 discount rate) there
is a noticeable effect of economic activity originated by the
project. Conditions of the settlement of such a dispute are
difficult to imagine.    Again,  as  a  lower  bound, an amount of
US$200 million to be paid as compensation was estimated.
e) Total Cancellation Costs
As a lower bound, the total estimated amount of costs associated
to the project's cancellation would be in the order of US$500
million. Although these costs represent the present value of a
stream, they will be assumed to be made in the first few years of
the period  of  analysis.    A  sensitivity  analysis  with US$200
million cancellation costs was also made. However, the base case
assumes these costs equal to zero.

Results of the Evaluation
14.      Attachment 1 presents the  results  of the economic evaluation for
the base case. It shows that, assuming that investments made until 1987
are sunk costs, Yacyreta is the least-cost expansion solution for any
discount rate lower than 18Z.
15.      If cost overruns of 201  are  assumed  for the construction of the
plan. Yacyreta would still be the least-cost solution at 152 discount rate.
