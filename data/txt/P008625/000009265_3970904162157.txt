PROJECT ODMPLETION REPORT
PORTUGAL - FIRST LOAN TO BANCO DE FOHENTO NATIObAL (BFN)
(LOAN 1432-PD)
PREFACE
This report which covers the first line of credit extended by the
Bank to Banco de Fomento National (BFN) Loan 1432-PO in the amount of
US$50 million, was approved by the Board on May 26, 1977 and became effective
on March 31, 1978.
The attached Project Completion Report (PCR) was prepared with the
cooperation of BFN which provided most of the data and other factual inputs.
No special mission to prepare the PCR was mounted but the matter was discussed
with BFN during the supervision mission of BFN II in December 1982. Comments
from the Borrower have been taken into account in finalizing the report and
are reproduced as Annex 12.
This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT CDMPLETION REPORT
PDRrUGAL - FIRST LOAN TO BANCO DE FOIENTO NATIONAL (BFN)
(LQAN 1432-PK)
HIGHLIGHTS
The objectives of Loan 1432 were (i) to contribute to the recovery of
industrial sector investment with particular emphasis on industrial projects
with high employment and export potential; and (ii) to provide institution-
building assistance, as requested by the Government and BFN, for the
improvement of appraisal and other procedures so as to enhance BFN's impact on
the industrial sector. In addition, it was hoped that the Bank loan would
provide a transfer of resources to ease the foreign exchange constraint faced
by Portugal, and also serve as a catalyst for other foreign lending to BFN.
The objective of the loan with regards to institution building
assistance for improvement of BFN appraisal procedures was achieved
(para. 3.02) but there is still substantial room for improvement in other
areas, particularly in the improve.tent of BFN's supervision of project
implementation (para. 3.04). Part of the problem with supervision is the
Portuguese industrialists' reluctance to disclose information regarding their
operations, especially to a Government owned bank, as well as their inadequate
book-keeping. Further initiatives are being taken by the Bank to assist BFN
in improving the effectiveness of its supervision (para. 3.05).
Substantial progress has been made by BFN in increasing its foreign
exchange resources from about 10% of BFN's total resources in 1977 to 19.5% in
1981 (Annex 9).
During the course of project implementation, there was no progress
made in reducing the proportion of the portfolio affected by arrears which
remained high at over 33%. The problem with accumulating arrears became more
severe as the amount of arrears increased from 10% to 18% of the principal
outstanding. While BFN did make some efforts to improve its supervision of
the private sector arrears, it did not prove an effective vehicle to remedy
the fundamental problems of the public sector arrears. The general issue of
public enterprise reform has become a major focus of the Bank's economic
dialogue with Portugal (para 6.03).



PROJECT ODMPLETION REPORT
PORTUGAL - FIRST LOAN TO BANCO DE FOMENTO NACIONAL (BFN)
(Loan 1432-PO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     In October 1974, the Government of Portugal asked the World Bank to
resume its lending program; a loan to BFN was included in this request and an
identification mission went to Portugal in 1975. Following an economic
mission to determine Portugal's economic prospects, developmental priorities,
and the role of the banking and industrial sectors, an appraisal of BFN was
carried out in September/October 1976. Loan negotiations were carried out in
April 1977, a loan of $50 million was approved by IBRD Board on May 24, and
was signed December 19, 1977. The loan became effective March 21, 1978, and
was committed by December 1979. However, due to a decrease in project costs
in US dollar terms and cancellation of a few projects, US$4 million of the
loan was cancelled on July 24, 1981. The loan closed on December 31, 1981 as
projected. The Bank's involvement with BFN, via lending and country economic
work, assisted BFN in raising foreign exchange resources from other
international lenders. A further objective of the loan was to provide
technical assistance to help BFN improve its appraisal standards and
operational procedures, assist in better allocation of development resources
in Portugal, promote new industries and investments and thereby become an even
more effective lender in the development of Portugal's industrial sector.
1.02     IBRD studies during 1975 and 1976 had identified the two major
problems facing Portugal as acute balance of payments deficit and
unemployment. The manufacturing sector held an important key to the solution
of these problems and, given the broad range of subsectors and the
inexperience of the commercial banks in providing term loans, BFN was the most
suitable institution at that time for intermediating the Bank's assistance to
industry.
1.03     BFN was founded in 1959 and nationalized in 1975; until the
revolution only BFN and CGD were allowed to provide term loans, and BFN
specialized as a supplier of medium and long-term loans to manufacturing
industry. BFN also had the better project appraisal capability. Although
BFN's project supervision and industrial promotion work was not as impressive
as might be expected, it was felt that in the process of lending to BFN, the
Bank c3uld provide technical assistance for improving BFN procedures for
project appraisal, loan supervision and promotion. At the time of appraisal,
BFN4s portfolio contained a high percentage of loans in arrears, about half of
them to public enterprises. Both BFN and the Government undertook, as
recorded in the Bank loan documents, to reduce these arrears. Finally, Bank
lending to BFN was considered an important catalyst in BFN's effort to
diversify its resources from abroad.
1.04     BFN did a creditable job of relending the Bank loan to a large number
of subprojects, mostly for modernization and expansion, with high financial



-2-
and economic rates of return and reasonably well distributed geographically.
Of the loan, more than 90% of the funds went to the private sector, while only
two companies in the public sector received Bank funds. BFN has made great
strides in upgrading, with Bank assistance, its appraisal technique which has
reached very good standards. BFN made efforts with less success to improve
its loan supervision and industrial promotion, and the arrears position has
remained virtually unchanged.l/  Further improvements in these areas depend on
an organizational restructuring on which the Bank has made a proposal in 1982.
II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
2.01     The industrial sector is a leacing sector in the Portuguese economy
accounting for about 30% of GDP, 35% of employment, 40% of capital formation
and about 90% of merchandise exports. The public sector controls large
capital intensive industries (i.e., steel, oil refining, chemicals,
fertilizer, pulp and paper, cement and ship building) accounting now for about
35% of the manufacturing capital stock. These industries are primarily
oriented towards domestic markets. In addition, the Government retains
varying interests in over 1300 enterprises (mixed sector) whose shares are
owned by banks that were nationalized after the Revolution in 1974. The
private sector predominates in the light industries, including textiles, food
processing, transport equipment (other than ship building), electrical-
mechanical products, wood, and cork. Small and medium enterprises (SMI) are
predominant in almost all of these industries.
2.02     During the 1968-1973 period, industry (growing at 10% p.a.) was the
driving force of the remarkable growth of the Portuguese economy (7% p.a.).
The Revolution of April 1974 brought an end to Portugal's colonial era, the
loss of important preferential markets, and the repatriation of more than half
a million of former colonists, many of whom were absorbed in an expanded
public sector. Banks and large industrial groups were nationalized and their
operational efficiency suffered. Labor laws were introduced reducing labor
mobility and productivity. Price controls were established causing
substantial declines in profits or even losses. The difficulties of
implementing these major reforms were further aggravated by major external
changes notably the increase in oil prices and the levelling off of Portugal's
exports due to recessionary conditions in Western Europe. The effects of
these events were serious disruptions in industrial growth (3% in 1974, 9.7%
in 1975, and 4.5% in 1976). Substantial recovery took place, however, by 1977
with a 9.4% growth during the year, essentially based on general improvement
in productivity of the labor force. In the period 1977-1979, performance of
industry continued to be good (about 3% p.a. or at the same pace as for the
economy as a whole), in spite of the deflationary effects of the stabilization
program started in 1977. Economic policies were progressively adjusted to the
long-term needs of an export-based industrial sector, and industrial exports
resumed their pre-Revolution role of driving force of industrial progress,
growing at some 26% p.a. in real terms over 1977-1979 (compared to a decline
of 30% p.a. during the period 1974-1977).
1/ BFN feels that the lack of improvement inthe arrears position is not
linked to project supervision but to cost overruns and declines in the
domestic and foreign markets.



-3-
2.03     Affected negatively by the events of the 1974 Revolution, industrial
investments fell steadily until 1977, even though capacitz' utilization did
improve markedly during those years. In 1978, the level of industrial
investment accounted for about 40% of productive capital formation in
Portugal, representing a real increase of about 17% over 1973. By 1980, it
was some 32% higher in real trrms than in 1973. This seemingly good
performance however masked some serious structural problems:  continued strong
bias for the large public sector industries, and a significantly lower share
of investment in the major exporting sectors (47% and 10% share respectively
of accumulated investment over 1974-1978). While the industrial sector
contributed significantly to job creation (130,000 net new jobs in 1978 and
1979), this increase occurred largely in public sector industries, several of
-          which had little or no increases in production (e.g., 10,000 in ship-building
where production was practically stagnant), and in activities with very small
productivity gains (e.g., 11,500 in clothing, where productivity rose onlX by
2%).  During 1980-1981, the performance of the industrial sector has been
mixed and not as dynamic as in the last years of the 1970's.
2.04     In addition to external constraints such as the depressed European
economic environment and the uncertain general political situation of the
country, the deteriorating performance of Portuguese industries, large and
small, derives from several fundamental internal problems. Productivity
remains low, partly due to overmanning, and partly due to inefficient planning
and management of operations and in some cases, failure to modernize
production practices. Output structure needs to be changed towards greater
product specialization and innovation to aim at larger volumes, better quality
and its control, and lower costs in order to be more competitive and address
more rapidly the changing markets. Consolidation of industries, particularly
in traditional subsectors (e.g., textiles, electrical-mechanical products) is
urgently needed to phase out uneconomic production lines or units, and to
integrate (by relocation if necessary) smaller capacities into more efficient
sizes. The financial structure of most enterprises is very weak with high
short-term debt and low equity base; as a result, their profitability, which
is already poor, is vulnerable to changes in factor and market prices,
especially in the present periods of high interest rates leading to high
debt-service burden. Several factors are responsible for this low
profitability: general unwillingness of entrepreneurs to borrow long-term, or
to diversify their equity base for fear of losing control; preference of banks
for short maturity loans to minimize risk, and their leniency towards equity
participation requirement; and the very limited capital markets.  Clearly,
substantial and comprehensive financial and technical assistance is needed by
Portuguese industries to address the above constraints.
III. BFN: THE INSTITUTION
3.01     Until 1974 BFN accounted for some 20% of term loans extended by all
credit institutions to private manufacturing industry. Through its project
appraisal capability it had acquired a comparative advantage which placed it
ahead of other Portuguese financial institutions in manufacturing financing.
Through its sectoral and regional development studies it had engaged in a few
promotional activities. BFN has grown in size and prestige with the growth of
modern industry in Portugal. It is a conservative and proud institution, well
settled in its ways. It is well managed and staffed. Nevertheless its



-4-
organization lacks the flexibility required to deal with tlie enormous tasks it
is facing - tasks created by its growth, Portugal's post-revolutionary
industrial needs, and by the restructuring of Portugal's industry needed to
deal with open competition within the EEC community. The Bank has advised BFN
that, if it is to match its owo1 historical record in the rehabilitation and
modernization of industry, it ihould, under the guidance of dynamic
leadership, adapt itself along functional divisions with clear-cut
responsibilities for different types of banking operations.
Project Appraisal
3.02     In a supplemental letter dated December 19, 1977, BFN undertook, for
the purpose of improving its operational procedures and to ensure the rational
allocation of resources, to introduce as part of its project appraisal the
calculation of internal financial rates of return and of internal economic
rates of return. The Bank provided appropriate assistance in this regard
through EDI training and organization of seminars, conferences by staff in
Portugal, and the review of a representative sample (17) of investment
projects submitted to the Bank for approval. The Bank also had discussions
with the Ministries of Planning and Industry, at their request, to suggest the
project evaluation methodology appropriate for public investment projects.
BFN achieved great improvement in its appraisal technique as was demonstrated
by the quality of appraisals of subprojects which were submitted to the Bank's
review before approval. BFN, in turn, has provided training to a number of
Government officials and the staff of some Latin American development banks.
Project Supervision
3.03     In a Supplemental Letter dated December 19, 1977 BFN undertook to
ensure that securities offered by borrowers complied with their contractual
obligations. Any technical, economic, financial or organizational problems
affecting BFN's borrowers would be promptly brought to the attention of BFN's
management, and remedial actions would be taken in time to diminish the
possibility of default. The supervision division would have adequate staff in
terms of numbers, technical training and experience.
3.04     The inadequacy of BFN's supervision procedures to meet these
objectives has been pointed out to BFN not only during loan negotiations but
by every Bank follow-up mission. BFN responded by increasing its supervision
staff, arranging a program of setting collection targets for its branches,
co-operating with other financial institutions on *-iability contracts for
borrowers in default, and taking legal action to foreclose in cases where
firms could not be rehabilitated. HDwever, the whole approach of BFN to its
borrowers has remained principally concerned with clients in default rather
than the type of broad joint banker-client co-operative relationship prevalent
in the best DFCs. At the same time, Portuguese industrialists are fiercely
independent and are reluctant to disclose information regarding their
operations, especially to a Government-owned bank. They believe that
disclosures could prove costly to a business enterprise.  In response to the
Bank's many requests for a more substantive follow-up, BFN has repeatedly
taken the position that it has not been able to insist on regular reports and
visits to clients because of competition from commercial banks. This is



demonstrated by the paucity of information on sub-projects provided to the
Bank for this Completion Report, and perhaps also the large number of loans in
arrears. 1/
3.05     A long time will be needed before significant improvements in this
respect take place.  Meanwhile, BFN could take a number of initiatives.  Staff
of large branches could be strengthened for supervision and given
responsibility for smaller loans, since the Control and Inspection Department
could never supervise expeditiously and economically thousands of loans
extending from t3,000 to several million dollars equivalent. With projects in
default that are nevertheless viabile, BFN should provide technical and
financial assistance to bring them into profitable operation, thereby
demonstrating the value of full disclosure.  It obviously needs more staff and
training to enable its supervision staff to spot problems in production,
marketing, finance, manpower, and general management problems leading to
defaults. This training could also prepare BFN to assist in industrial
restructuring, another important industrial objective in Portugal. The Bank
is currently discussing these possibilities with BFN management and its Board,
and improvements are expected.
Industrial Promotion
3.06     BFN's Economic Department has always engaged in some sectoral and
regional studies to identify project ideas, but until recently BFN had not
shown a strong interest or capability to undertake a full promotional role.
Prompted by the Bank and motivated by the national need to go beyond being a
passive provider of industrial finance, BFN has strengthened its Economic
Department and stimulated its Project Development Department to upgrade its
promotional activities. New export-commodity producing projects in a number
of promising sub-sectors have been identified, pre-feasibility and, in some
cases, feasibility studies have been carried out, and likely investors have
been approached. Also, through banking associates in Western Europe, U.S.A.
and Japan, contacts have been made with interested joint-venture partners.
BFN has joined Banco Totta e Acores and Societe Generale of France in
establishing a leasing company, and in partnership with Banque Nationale de
Paris has founded an investment company to identify foreign and local
investors in new projects and joint-ventures and to buy equity participation
in attractive finns.
*           3.07     A wore vigorous attempt at promotion would require a separate
"promotion department" which would combine some of the activities of the two
Departments of Economic and Project Development. The other element which is
essential for promotion and enterpreneural activity is the ability and
willingness to participate in equity financing of the promoted enterprises.
BFN, like many other individuals and investors, is well aware that under
present tax regulations and the depressed economic situation, the rewards of
equity investment do not match the risks involved.
I/ Since the beginning of 1984 BFN has implemented a number of measures to
improve its operations, including its supervision procedures (Annex 12,
pages 1, 4 and 5).
2/ BFN does not feel the need to create a separate promotion department
(Annex 12, page 5).

IV. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Operations
4.01     BFN operations have increased dramatically over the 5 years since the
loan was made.  Between 1977 and 1981 total annual approvals tripled f-rom
Esc. 16 billion to Esc. 50 billion, commitments quadrupled from
Eec. 11 billion to Eec. 41 billion, and disbursements tripled from
Esc. 10 billion to Esc. 30 billion (Annex 1). However, taking into account
the Consumer Price Index inflation of 212Z over the same period, the increase
in real terms was 47% for approvals, 76Z for commitments, and 42% for
disbursements. Actual figures exceeded forecasts every year (except for a
minor shortfall for 1977 approvals), but this is due in part to inflation.
Nevertheless, the figures show the importance the banking system has acquired
in providing the finance that industrial companies need for their
rehabilitation, and the success BFN has had in mobilizing external and
internal resources. It also shows the substantial needs of public
enterprises, especially transportation and power, for financing the huge
programs and operations they have undertaken. During the period 1977 to 1981
there was an almost sixfold increase in EFN's public sector commitments from
Esc. 5 billion to Esc. 28 billion, while private sector commitments only
doubled from Esc. 6 billion to Esc. 13 billion and decreased in real terms
(Annex 2). As anticipated, BFN's share in gross domestic capital formation
went up from 7.5% in 1977 to 10.2% in 1980 and 8.9% in 1981. The Bank loan
represented 2.5% of total BFN disbursements during the period 1977-81.
4.02     BFN operations include loans for direct investment, indirect loans
for working capital and sales in Portugal, and export credit for goods and
services. Direct loans are made to manufacturing, agriculture, mining,
construction, power generation, transport and other services. In 1977, 60% of
loans were for manufacturing, 10% for construction, 13Z for power generation
and 1l% for transport and communications. In 1981 these percentages were 56%,
4%, 21% and 14% respectively. Agricultural loans accounted for 5% of the
total in 1977 but only 1.5% in 1981 (Annex 3). Total annual commitments in
1981 amounted to Esc. 41 billion for 730 projects or about four times the
loans of Esc. 11 billion for 565 projects in 1977. Mainly due to inflation
and financing of public sector projects, 74% of the loans in amount and 8% in
number were above Esc. 100 million in 1981 as against 62% in amount and 3% in
number in 1977. Nevertheless 75% of BFN's number of loans are made for small
projects with loans of Esc. 25 million or less (Annex 4).  In 1980 and 1981,
as in previous years, the chemical, petroleum products, metallurgical and
electrical equipment industries formed 46% of the number and 56% of the value
of loans. Whereas private enterprises received 46% and public enterprises 54%
of BFN loans in 1977, the proportions were 32% and 68% in 1981. Loans with
duration over 7 years increased from 17% in 1977 to 48% in 1981, and those of
one to three years decreased from 19% to 6% (Annex 5). Geographically,
projects financed are distributed all over Portugal. However, 64% of loans in
1980 are located in the Lisbon area, though these figures are inflated because
companies registered in the Lisbon area are statistically treated as Lisbon
industries even if manufacturing operations are in the provinces (Annex 6).
Private sector projects financed by BFN have allocated their resources in



-7-
general economically because of BFN's sound and painstaking appraisal
procedures. BFN's financing of a large number of small projects helped to
promote exports and create employment.
Arrears
4.03     At the time of loan appraisal, as of June 30, 1976, 33.6Z of BFN
total loans, or Esc. 8.8 billion were affected by arrears as against 33.2% and
Esc. 32 billion on December 30, 1981. The total amounts in arrears, principal
and interest, increased from Esc. 2 billion in 1976 to Esc. 17 billion by the
end of 1981. Over this period, the amount of the arrears increased from 1OZ
to 182 of the principal outstanding. Public sector arrears in 1976 amounted
to 44.5% of total arrears and decreased in 1981 to 41.8Z. Private sector
arrears amounted to 33.9% of total arrears in 1976 and 33.2Z in 1981. The
rest of arrears were due to loans in the former colonies. Provisions for loan
losses have increased from Esc. 1.8 billion in 1976 to Esc. 7 billion or 40%
of arrears in 1981, and were about 9% of outstanding loans and investments
during the period. As many of the public sector arrears are covered by
guarantees, these provisions are considered satisfactory.
4.04     Arrears have been of serious concern to the Bank ever since
pre-appraisal discussions, and this problem has been raised by every
supervision mission. In the loan documents the Government as the Guarantor
undertook to review the financial ability of the defaulting enterprises in an
effort to develop a plan for the payment of the arrears or for the
rescheduling of the outstanding loans. The Guarantor also agreed that if
after the review of the financial position of defaulting enterprises, it was
found that they were unlikely to be able to service BFN loans, the Guarantor
would take adequate measures to compensate BFN for these loans by
March 31, 1978. Since 1978, a Government commission reviewed the position of
many defaulting public enterprises but little progress has been made in
restructuring or in reassigning the debt. BFN itself, during the
negotiations, undertook to establish by December 31, 1977, quantitative
targets and timetables for the reduction of private sector arrears and, in
consultation with the Bank, to closely monitor the progress on achieving these
targets. While BFN did establish targets and reporting systems to monitor
progress, there were few improvements in results due to the deteriorating
economic conditions and its insufficient supervision effort.
4.05     A laxge number of private enterprises have secured "Viability"
contracts through Parraempresa and the banks for financial restructuring. BFN
has taken the leading role in arranging the "Viability" contract when they
were the largest creditor. Yet the private arrears situation has worsened
over the years as new defaults have occurred, and many of the renegotiated
loans have fallen in default. In addition, at the end of 1981 about 7% of
BFN's portfolio represented loans in arrears to non-viable public sector
enterprises.
4.06     The arrears problem of both private and public industrial enterprises
started with the profit squeeze just after the revolution when rising labor
costs (for needed or redundant labor), low productivity, price controls and



-8-
dwindling markets seriously undermined the financial positions of companies.
Many of the public companies also launched major investment programs without
adequate and/or appropriate equity structures and financing. The steady
increase in nominal interest rates has also caused a snowball effect on the
arrears. The Portuguese export growth to Europe in 1978 to 1980 improved the
financial position of private firms engaged in export, but the 1981/82
recession and adverse climatic conditions created more defaults. With an
energetic follow-up by the BFN Control and Inspection Department and the world
economic recovery, most private arrears could be regularized.
4.07     BFN's public enterprise clients faced additional difficulties due to
their special relationship with the Government. In the absence of strong
centralized budgetary planning and financial control over public enterprises'
financial operations, inefficiencies and political pressures have inhibited
sound business practice and financial discipline. The pricing, subsidies, and
investment decisions by the Government have not been well-conditioned. Given
the major role of public enterprises in the economy as a whole and the recent
serious deterioration in public finances, the Bank has offered assistance to
the Government to first establish an overview of the nature and magnitude of
the link of public enterprises and macroeconomic management, and in developing
and implementing the range of options which may be available to improve
performance.
Financial Situation and Profitability
4.08     Over the period covered in the report, 1977-81, BFN has remained a
relatively well managed institution with respect to its i mediate financial
situation. However, serious underlying problems were aggravated during this
period, in particular the quality of the portfolio as described in the above
paragraphs. The Bank plans to explore with the Government and BFN, as part of
the Government's overall program for rationalizing the public enterprise
sector, what role BFN can play and how, in the longrun, the public sector
arrears to the entire banking community can be regularized. With these
qualifications, BFN's financial conduct has been guided over the years by good
standards of prudence. The monetary size of its assets has multiplied by
three between 1977 and 1981. However, if adjustment is made for inflation (on
the basis of a deflator of 2.12 over the four-year period) BFN's total assets
grew only from Esc. 41.4 billion to Esc. 56.2 billion, i.e. an annual growth
of 8%. During the entire period BFN's liquidity remained ample. BFN's
current ratio was most of the time significantly above 1.5 (audited balance
sheet basis). At end-1981 it was 1.8 (Annex 8).
4.09     In current terms, BFEN's interest margin (the difference between
interest income and interest payment) grew from Esc. 1.4 billion to
Esc. 2.3 billion. If this is adjusted for inflation, the margin decreased
somewhat from Esc. 1.4 billion to Esc. 1.1 billion. The increase in interest
rate which took place in 1980-81 is however likely to have a positive impact
on BFN's future profitability. Total interest and commissions received in
1981 was Esc. 19 billion, 4-1/2 times the corresponding figure in 1977,
indicating the higher volume of loans and higher interest charged (Annex 7).



Administrative expenses were 0.8X in 1977, and 0.7Z in 1981 of average total
assets, which indicates that such expenses are tightly controlled. During the
three years 1980-82 BFN's personnel expenses as a percentage of total income
fell from 2.6% to 2.1%. While this ratio is well below average among
development banks, it is questionable whether BFN has not been unduly
stringent in increasing its professional staff, resulting in weaknesses in the
areas of industrial promotion and loan supervision.
4.10     Net income after interest and non-interest expenses, but before loan
loss provisions, has more than doubled from Esc. 1.1 billion in 1977 to
Esc. 2.5 billion in 1981, but is still lov. After setting aside 80% of the
net income for provisions, the net profit rate on average equity in 1981 was
only 3.3% but that was higher than the 2.3% recorded in 1977 (Annex 7). Given
the Government's agreement under the loan to ensure full compensation to BFN
on arrears from the public sector, the Government is clearly committed to
protect BFN and ultimately full repayment will take place. On that basis, it
can be found acceptable not to exclude the interest on non-viable public
sector loans, though this point can be argued the other way in classic
accounting. Therefore, auditors have issued unqualified certificates on the
income. What is more important, however, is to continue to press the
Government for a settlement of these debts. The Bank has been discussing this
with the past Government and intends to continue to press the new Government
for a satisfactory solution. The Bank's suggestion that the Government issue
bonds to cover part of the public sector arrears to BFN, including accrued
interest due on that debt, has been discussed, but the Government is unlikely
to take any action for BFN, without also taking into account comparable
actions for the other creditors as well.
Resources and Capital Structure
4.11     BFN resources derive from deposits, sale of bonds, loans from the
State and credit institutions, foreign loans, capital, quasi-capital and
reserves (Annex 9). In 1977, only 34.3Z of these resources were provided by
deposits and bonds and 10% by foreign credit institutions. The structure of
resources was improved at the end of 1981 as 43.7.X came from deposits and
bonds and 19.54Z from foreign credit institutions. BFN's debt/equity ratio
was fixed at 6:1 at the time of appraisal and it was covenanted in the loan
agreement. The Bank agreed to consider increasing this ratio under the second
loan to BFN, depending in the results of the program to improve the arrears.
The Bank acknowledged that this limit was too restrictive for a well
established institution with the experience and financial management record of
BFN. By 1980, the European Investment Bank (EIB) decided, after consultation
with IBRD, to allow BFN to increase its debt/equity limit to 8:1. On
June 30, 1982 the actual debt/equity ratio of BFN was 8.4:1, well in excess of
the 6:1 still formally required by the Bank Loan Agreement, or even the 8:1
limit agreed with EIB (Annex 8).  The Bank had a legal right to insist on a
Government settlement of its direct (share capital increase) and indirect
(public sector arrears) debt obligation vis-a-vis BFN.  But remedies, however,
are not within BFN's control. The Treasury agreed to pay Esc. 4.1 billion in
1983 in capital increases previously approved 1/, which would bring the ratio
to 9.3:1.
1/ BFN notes that at the end of 1982 the Government approved an increase in
BFN's capital of Esc. 2.6 billion, of which Esc. 391.9 million was paid up
in September 1983 (Annex 12, page 6).

V. SUB-PROJECTS FINANCED
5.01     Due to the supervision deficiencies mentioned above (para 3.04), the
information provided by BFN on the performance of sub-projects has been
incomplete and sketchy and has not been adequate for proper analysis.
5.02     US$11.8 million were committed under the loan for 71 sub-loans under
the free limit of US$600,000; US$34.2 million were committed for sub-loans
over the free limit. Annexes 10 and 11 indicate characteristics, operational
and financial performance and economic benefits of sub-projects over
US$600,000 as far as information was provided by BFN. Judged by this
information and the files of sub-project appraisals, the sub-projects
generated some employment, but more importantly, they kept borrowers'
redundant labor in productive employment as a result of expansion and
modernization. The sub-projects made substantial contribution in increased
production and exports, again through modernization, improved productivity or
producing new products required by the market. The economic rates of return,
as calculated at the time of appraisal, were satisfactory. Considering that
the period was notable for inflation and interest rate increases, the
implementation record of sub-projects was, with minor exceptions, satisfactory.
VI. OONCLUSIONS
6.01     By making the first loan to BFN, the World Bank demonstrated its
timely support for the Portuguese Government's efforts to return the country
to the path of economic recovery and growth with stabilization. It supported
Portuguese industry, the most vital sector for the resumption of development
in Portugal. BFN proved a good vehicle for the transfer of resources for the
expansion and modernization of medium scale enterprises. In addition to
increasing employment, this helped maintain productive employment in the
borrowing enterprises whose labor could not be dismissed, and increase
production and exports at a critical time. The loan has enabled the Bank to
provide technical assistance to BFN to improve its procedures and become a
more effective organization for the allocation of resources. The BFN loan,
together with the Bank's other industrial loans, enabled the Bank to provide
technical assistance to the whole Portuguese industry by its numerous sector
and sub-sector studies and policy measures proposals for Portugal's industrial
development and restructuring necessary for Portugal's preparation for entry
in the European Common Market.
6.02     The relationship of the Bank with BFN has been rendered difficult by
the inadequate depth of BFN's supervision and the problems of arrears, which
lead to default on the agreed debt/equity ratio. During the time of the
project, the percentage of the portfolio affected by arrears, in both public
and private sectors, remained high at 33% overall, and total arrears as a
percentage of principal outstanding increased from 10Z to 18%. BFN's efforts
to improve the supervision of the private sector were insufficient, but
agreement has at last been reached under the Second BFN project to implement
specific measures designed to improve supervision of



clients, including a special program for the most serious cases of arrears.
The problem of public sector arrears is often present when a development bank
lends to Government-owned enterprises. The Bank should always assist with the
introduction of adequate autonomy for these government DFCs which finance
public sector enterprises. In the case of BFN, more than half of its
operations were involved in enterprises which had been its private clients
before nationalization. This brought BFN into such exposure, which was
natural given its long-standing relationship with such companies and its
experience with these industrial subsectors. BFN's operations and
effectiveness would have been curtailed if it had been forced to exclude
public enterprises from its operations. BFN has had little imfluence on
non-industrial public sector enterprise; however, its appraisal of new
industrial public enterprise investments has been conducted with the same
rigorous standards as for the private sector. On that basis, BFN's 'swe of its
resources to support the manufacturing public sector is justified.
6_03     It was clearly beyond the authority of EFN to address the fundamental
problems of the public sector. Nevertheless, as a development financing
institution, it had some role to play in the design and monitoring of
appropriate public enterprise rationalization measures and, in fact,
participated in some diagnostic studies carried out by Government
Comnissions. In the context of the dialogue regarding public enterprise
reform which is now taking place between the Bank and Portuguese authorities,
BFN is being encouraged to play a somewhat more active support role in
encouraging public enterprise restructuring and modernization.

BFN Comments
On the Project Completion Report - First Loan
to BFN (Loan 1432-PO)
Please find hereafter the specific comments on some aspects of the
above report following its structure. We also include some tables
to which some alterations were introduced, as is the case   of the
"Currency Equivalents" for 1979 and 1978 (page iii) and Annexes 1,
2,6,7,8,9,10, and 11.
-   Highlights (page iv)
cReferring to the second paragraph, it is our view   that    the
Reflected
in text of   problems raised by the supervision of project   implementation
PCR         are the fact of a deficient organization of the companies  and
their consequent difficulty to keep an adequate    bookkeeping
rather than of any reluctancy on their part to   disclose that
information to a Government owned bank.
- I Introduction (pages 1,2)
1.03 - Instead of "BFN's project supervision   and  industrial
Text of PCR        promotion work was not impressive", we would   say that
amended             "BFN's project supervision andindustrial promotion work
wasnotasimpressive as it could be expected".
1.04 - We do not think that the increase in arrearsis directly
linked to difficulties in the project's supervision; in
fact, about 50 per cent of the projectswere effectively
in footnote         supervised by BFN, with first priority to   those  that
on page 2           were expected to raise more problems. On the other hand,
from the analysis of our experience, the conclusion can
be drawn that the main reasons for the failures of the
projects have been:
increase in the investment cost (due to  the  strong
devaluation of the escudo);

. significant drop in the domestic market;
. and, in some cases, drop in the foreign markets as
well.

Text of    )         during the period 1968-73.
PCR amend-  )
ed         )  2.03 - As far as the employment in the industrial sector is
concerned, the figures that, to our knowledge, show
the balance between new jobs and suppressed jobs are:
Dec. 31, 1977 to Dec. 31, 1978 - about + 30,000
Dec. 31, 1978 to Dec. 31, 1979 - about +100,000
III  BFN - The Institution (pages 3 to 5)
3.04 - We would like to reaffirm the comments made  in  the
Highlights and in 1.04.
Besides the companies'organization       difficulties,
namely regarding an adequate bookkeeping, it must be
underlined that many operations were not greenfield
projects but concerned the extension and/or modern -
ization of existing plants, and this   renders   the
charging of costs and profits to the projects   even
more difficult. This was the reason why BFN proposed
that, in those cases where it was not possibleto get
data concerning the projects, overall figures for the
company should be accepted. The proposal was approved
by the World Bank.
Anyway , and as the supervision of projects   is   a
Reflected             field that calls for  a particular attention on  the
in footnote           part of BFN, the subject was comprised       in    the
1 on page 5
of PCR                resolution of the Management Board of December  27 ,
1983, "Restructuring of the Credit Function",   that
was transmitted to the World Bank, and   implemented

in the beginning of 1984. Under the terms of the new
system, the supervision field of action was widened
so as to include the services of the Development De-
partment (headoffice and regional departments)   and
Special Credit Operations.
3.06 . Regarding the investment company established by  BFN
Reflected           and Banque Nationale de Paris, one of its purposes is,
in text
of PCR              among others, to buy equity participations, an  ac -
tivity that it already started to develop.
3.07 - We suggest that the first sentence of this paragraph
Reflected           should read as follows: "A more vigorous attempt  at
in footnote
2 on page 5         promotion would require the strengthening   of   the
of PCR              Economic Department's promotion activities   in  co-
operation withotherBFN Departments,   namely   those
concerned with credit operations and   international
activities".
IV  Operating and Financial Performance (Pages 6 to 9)
4.01 - According to the annual growth  rates of the consumer
price index over the period 1977-1981 (77-78 = 22.0%;
Text of             78-79 = 24.2%; 79-80 = 16.6%; 80-81 = 20.0%),   the
PCR modi-           inflation in that period amounted to 212% notto230%.
fied
In accordance with this figure the increase in real
terms was 47% for approvals, 76% for commitments and
42% for disbursements. As the revised Annex 2 shows,
the public sector commitments. increased from Esc. 6
billion to Esc. 28 billion and the private    sector
commitments from Esc. 5 billion to Esc. 13 billion.
4.02 - The percentages included in this item concern   just
Text of             commitments of investment loans (direct investment ,
PCR modi-           production and sales and imports of equipent), thus- ex
fied
clbding the credit for the export of capital goods and servmx.
According to the figures for 1981 included in Annex
2 , private sector commitments account for 32% and
public sector commitments to 68%.

Text of     )  4.03 - Line 3 should read "The total ammounts in arrear,....
PCR modi-   )
L fied        )  4,08 - On the assumption of an inflation rate of 212% during
the period 1977-81, BFN's total assets grew from Esc.
41.4 billion to Esc. 56.2 billion, i.e.    an  annual
growth of 9%.
As far as one of the financial structure   indicators
shown at Annex 8- "Provisions for Losses as %of Loans
and Investments" is concerned, we think that thisf
Annex 8                ratio should be estimated on the basis  of  the gross
modified               loans and investments, including provisions; therefore
the indicator that seems more correct is "Provisions
for Losses as % of Gross Loans and Investments", the
figures shown at the revised Annex corresponding   to
that notion.
4.09 - If we adjust the BFN's interest margin for  the above
inflation, the margin decreases in real terms from
Text of     !          Esc. 1.4 billion in 1977 to Esc. 1.1 billion in 1981.
PCR modi-    )
fied        )  4.11 - Annex9 shows that the share of the deposits and  sale
of bonds in BFN.resources reached 44.4% not 43.7%.
As for BFN's debt/equity ratio in June 30, 1982, its
value was 8.4:1, not 8.6:1.
As far as the last sentense of this paragraph is con-
cerned, we would like to clarify that at the end   of
Ref lected in
footnote on            1982 the Government approved for 1983 an increase  in
page 9 of              BFN's capital of Esc. 2.6 billion, of which Esc.391.9
PCR
million were paid up in September 1983; in relatim to
the approved increased, about Esc. 2.2 billion are yet
to be paid in.
However, in 1983 BFN required an extra increase of Esc.
1.5 billicn, but  notwithstanding our efforts, it   was
not yet authorized by the Government.
