A.Project Development Objective

1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
The objective of the Project is to enhance the delivery of basic municipal services and infrastructure,
through: (i) improving the financial and institutional capacity of CPSCL for the provision of funding for
municipal investments; and (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of local governments and related
central government agencies.

2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)

·     Implementation (signature) of restructuring plan contracts between municipalities, central
      government and CPSCL:
      - 30% of most financially vulnerable municipalities by end of first year (2003),
      - 100% of municipalities with financial situation problems by end of 2nd year (2004).
·     Reduction in number of municipalities identified as in difficult financial situation:
      - most financially vulnerable municipalities, from 71 baseline to 60 by end of 3rd year, and to 30
      by end of project,
      - municipalities with financial situation problems, from 61 baseline to 55 by end of 3rd year, and
      to 45 by end of project.
·     Increase in collection of revenues from local taxes and fees:
      - TIB: increase in collection rate from 58% baseline (with the period analysis) to 62% by
      Mid-Term Review, and to 70 % by end of project,
      - TCL: 25% of municipalities collect the TCL at its base rate by Mid-Term Review, and 50 % by
      end of project.

B.Strategic Context

1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex 1)
Document number: R2000-46 Date of latest CAS discusslon: April 27, 2002
The CAS emphasizes the role of the Bank and its involvement in municipal and urban development. It
specifically underscores that: "In the longer run, Tunisia's growth poles would appear to be in the urban
areas and along the coast. With nearly two thirds of the country's population now urbanized and with
unemployment pressures felt in urban peripheries, municipal and urban development needs to be
consolidated in the CAS. This would be pursued with: (a) maintaining involvement in municipal
development projects, (b) strengthening municipal finance and decentralization, and (c) preparing to
expand integrated urban development in low-income areas."

3.Main sector issues and Government strategy:
The Primacy of Tunisia's Urban Areas. Tunisia is among the most urbanized countries in the Middle
East and North Africa Region. Presently, 64% of the population live in cities and towns, the vast
majority of which are in cities with over 50,000 inhabitants. Between 1995 and 2000 urban population
grew by 3.35% and is projected to reach 70% by the year 2020. This demographic pressure will create
further demand on municipalities to provide and maintain basic services.

An Evolution of the Municipal Sector to strengthen. The Tunisian municipal sector has developed over
the last decade, yet its capacity to meet its investment responsibilities and respond to the increased
demand for services is still at a relatively early stage of development, and needs to be reinforced.


                                                       -3-

Tunisian municipalities remain fairly limited in their financial resources to face their skill base which is
delimited by the Organic law . Their economic contribution has been growing during the ninth plan at a
slower rate than the overall economy and presently accounts for 1.5% of GDP and 5% of total public
expenditures.

In an effort to redistribute expenditure and service responsibilities between the State and local
authorities, the Government of Tunisia (GoT), with Bank support, initiated a process of sector
restructuring in the early nineties. This restructuring was intended to provide municipalities with the
means to assume a greater role in financing their priority investments and increase investment at the local
level. The CPSCL was transformed from a simple cashier's window to a specialized financial institution
that can appraise and monitor municipal investments, and assist municipalities in planning and
implementing services. Interest rates on municipal loans were gradually increased to better reflect the
cost of funds for CPSCL. At the same time, municipal capacity was strengthened by intensive training
carried out by the National Training Center for Regional and Municipal Staff (Centre National de
Perfectionnementet de Recyclage des CadresRegionaux et Municipaux- CNPRCRM). These measures
were followed by reform of the local finance and the inter-governmental transfer systems in the late
nineties. The outcome of these efforts was a substantial level of municipal investment of about TD 860
million during the Ninth Development Plan period (1997-2001); of this, 37% was financed by borrowing
(CPSCL loans), and 17.5% by local revenues.. The remaining balance of some 45% was financed
through central transfers, the bulk of which were administered by CPSCL in combination with loans.

A Weak Financial Situation of Municipalities. Notwithstanding the increase in local revenues (through
fiscal and non-fiscal revenues) and investment in the latter half of the nineties, many municipalities will
have difficulty in the future mobilizing the resources needed to carry out investment, repay debt and
maintain existing infrastructure. It is estimated that about 25% of municipalities, principally the smaller
ones, fall into this category, and will need to adjust both their level of investment and improve their
management of resources.       Another 25% of municipalities remain dependent to varying degrees on
capital subsidies to supplement loans. To better target financial strengthening initiatives, the Tunisian
Government has for the Tenth Development Plan divided the municipalities into three categories, based
on their financial health:
*       Municipalities in financially vulnerable situation:       this includes 71 municipalities at the
        beginning of the project with such a precarious financial status that they are not able to borrow to
        finance investments. Their investments will be scaled back to absolute priorities which are to be
        totally financed through subsidies.
*       Municipalities in a weak financial state:     this comprises 61 municipalities at project start-up
        which face financial problems. Their investments will also be scaled back and will benefit from a
        modulated financing plan.
*       Normally functioning municipalities: this includes the 128 municipalities in a sound financial
        situation.

To increase the capacity of municipalities to finance their own investments, either through borrowing or
own resources, there will clearly be a need to increase their level of revenues, as it is unlikely that the
global volume of capital subsidies administered through CPSCL can be increased. The outcome of the
1997 and 2000 fiscal reformns are still being evaluated, however preliminary indications are that the local
tax reform has had positive, albeit limited, effects while the financial situation of local governments still
needs to be consolidated. Fiscal reforms have brought about an 40% overall increase in fiscal resources
(1996-2000) primarily through the TCL (Taxe surles Etablissementsai CaractereIndustriel, Commercial
et Professionnel)and TNB (Taxe Fonciere sur les TerrainsNon-Batis). However, the increase has not
been uniform, and tax recovery rates are still less than 50%. An additional fundamental weakness of
current financial management practices is the present budget accounting and classification process which



                                                    - 4 -

makes it difficult to evaluate costs of services. These issues are recognized and efforts to address them
are being initiated.

A Development of CPSCL to strengthen. As noted earlier, CPSCL has evolved substantially over the last
decade. It is now a specialized financial institution , an EPIC (Etablissement Public a Caractere
Industrielet Commercial),which has financial autonomy. Its Board is chaired by the Minister of Interior
and Local Development, and has eight members, including representatives of Ministry of Development
and International Cooperation and of the Central Bank. The DirecteurGeneralis designated by a decree.
CPSCL's staff has increased from a few units to about one hundred people. During this period the
financial analysis of its accounts (see annex 4) shows that CPSCL's activity has strongly increased, while
its financial situation has been consolidated. CPSCL has maintained adequate financial performance
ratios but is still dependant on official external lines of credit for its resources, and remains restricted in
its freedom to approve or reject funding for projects listed in the Municipal Investment Plan (Plan
d'Investissement Communal - PIC). One of the CPSCL's main concerns is the financial weakness of
municipalities that may have over-borrowed to finance the previous PIC. The strategic study on CPSCL,
carried out under PDM II, recommended the transformation of CPSCL into an autonomous financial
institution; yet such an objective is unlikely to be achieved without a parallel strengthening in the local
government financial framework.        Thus, despite marked improvement in CPSCL capacity to serve
municipal investment needs, its future growth is dependent not only on its own transformation and
autonomy but more fundamentally on improvement in municipal financial performance.

A Sound Macro-economic environment. The macro-economic situation in Tunisia and the status of
development of its financial sector provide an acceptable framework for the proposed Bank financial
institution loan. Indeed, Tunisia's economic performance over the past decade has been underpinned by
prudent macroeconomic policies. Overall fiscal deficit has fallen to 3.3 percent of GDP, while inflation
declined to around 3 percent. The monetary stance has been prudent, and the exchange rate management
fairly flexible. The Central Bank is now allowed to undertake open market operations and the use of the
inter-bank money market has become more active. GDP growth which exceeded 5% in 2001, is projected
at 3.5 percent in 2002, partly due to the slowdown in the world economy, particularly in the Euro zone
and its negative effect on the country's tourism sector. However Tunisia's economic fundamentals are
expected to remain strong in the medium term (the 10th Development Plan (2002-2006) aims at an
average annual economic growth rate of 5.7 percent). To achieve these goals, the Government recognizes
the need to maintain a sound and stable macroeconomic framework, which is critical to accessing the
international financial markets at affordable costs, and attract larger amounts of Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI). The government adjustment efforts aim at increasing domestic savings, productivity
and efficiency, and easing the transfer of technology. They also aim at containing the budget deficit
through tighter expenditure control, a broader tax base and better monitoring of the performance of
public enterprises. Specific measures would involve: (i) the progressive dismantling of trade barriers and
the creation of an enabling private investment climate; (ii) the mobilization of finance for private
investment by promoting efficient and competitive banking, capital market and insurance sectors; and
(iii) the introduction of active management techniques for public debt, and the establishment of a
National Tax Council to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.

Tunisia recently participated in the joint Bank/IvF Financial Sector Assessment Program, which should
help determine priorities in terms of financial sector reforms. In the meantime, Government efforts to
foster a competitive financial sector and ensure adequate financing for private investment, are focused on
the following:

1. Improving the efficiency of financial intermediation, dominated by commercial banks where the level
     of nonperformning loans remains high. Besides the need for adequate provisioning,          this requires


                                                     - 5 -

     measures to lower the cost of financial intermediation and improve banks' lending decisions with
     less reliance on collateral-based lending and better access to reliable information on borrowers'
     credit and financial status. In terms of specific measures, the Government seeks to: strengthen
     financial sector governance with more transparent and autonomous management of public banks; and
     pursue its disengagement from the banking sector in a progressive manner (this would include
     withdrawal from two commercial banks, and review of alternatives for restructuring or privatizing
     the six development banks).
 2. Enhancing the role and efficiency of domestic securities markets, which over the recent years have
     benefited from a number of policy measures including fiscal incentives. However, Tunisian
     companies' recourse to market finance through equity and bond issues remains limited due to
     constraints primarily related to the high transaction costs of public issues, and the lack of specialized,
    independent operators prepared to promote new products.
 3. Promoting the insurance sector, which should be more developed compared to other countries. This
     would in turn be vital to the development of a strong financial system as insurance companies are
    usually the largest institutional investors, stimulating capital market development.

 Government Strategy

 Toward municipal strengthening.
 The Tunisian government has just adopted its Tenth Development Plan for the period 2002-2006.               It
recognizes that it needs to consolidate the progress made during the previous period. Municipal financial
and managerial capacity-building remains one of the priority objectives. In this overall context, and in
light of the long-term Bank involvement in the sector, the Government has requested a follow-on project
to build on the gains of PDM II, and support municipal development during the next Plan period. The
strategic directions for the sector during the Tenth Plan, as communicated in the draft request, include:
(i) strengthening the role of municipal administrations            in local development;       (ii) continuing
decentralization reforms; (iii) quantitative and qualitative improvement in urban services to accompany
national efforts to strengthen Tunisia's economic competitiveness; (iv) increasing citizen participation in
urban planning and management; (v) improving mobilization and utilization of municipal revenues
through a combination of transfers, better cost recovery and collection of local taxes and fees; and (vi)
CPSCL reform by simplifying the regulations governing credit and subsidies, expanding its services to
include private service providers and enhancing its ability to mobilize resources in financial markets.
These strategic orientations recognize that without additional effort, it is likely that an increasing number
of cash-strapped municipalities will be unable to finance new investments, or even reimburse outstanding
loans.

Toward CPSCL autonomy.
The Tunisian Government has endorsed the conclusions of the PDM II financed study on the strategic
evolution of the CSPSCL. Thus, the Government has recognized that (i) the financial situation of the
municipalities needs to be improved in parallel with the institutional strengthening of the CPSCL, (ii) the
Caisse should have a clearer role in the financing of local public investments, and (iii) there is a growing
need for public investments at the local level to improve people's living conditions. However, the banking
sector is not ready and interested yet in the market of municipal loans. Consequently, there is a need for
the CPSCL to remain the long term viable financing instrument for municipalities. Therefore, the main
orientations of the Government strategy for the CPSCL can be defined as follows:
*   Providing to the CPSCL the adequate structure and status for ensuring its autonomy: by transforming
    the CPSCL into a Socie't Anonyme, the Caisse would be able to get a clear independence in its
    management and functioning, and to introduce corporate responsibility and accountability;
*   Given that the Caisse should play a major role in financing the municipal sector, there is a need (i) to
    separate the management of the government subsidies from the CPSCL Credit activities, (ii) to end


                                                     - 6 -

    the implicit cross-subsidizing   and the indirect subsidy system     of the local budgets (for    instance by
    stopping the automatic arrears      write-offs), (iii) to remove     the responsibility and     obligation of
    financing systematically all  registered investments in the   PIC.

Facing the future growing    financing needs of the municipalities      for local investments, the Government
wishes in the long term the     municipalities to be able to    access the capital market     by improving their
credit worthiness and complying     with the banking sector requirements.     In order to achieve this goal,    the
Government intends to    (i) gradually allow the CPSCL       to act in a competitive environment       in the long
term, and (ii) support the CPSCL to rely on and develop      its competitive advantage given      by its extensive

experience with local governments       and its low intermediation     costs, in order to continue    to be a key
player in this market and to retain/attract creditworthy municipalities.

3. Sector issues to be addressed     by the project and strategic    choices:

The project will address  the issues and the needs defined     in the GoT's request. The     further evolution of
both municipalities and sector   institutions are intertwined   and will need to be addressed     in tandem. The
proposed project seeks to address    the structural weaknesses in    the sector and consolidate    the progress to
date to allow further transformation   of both CPSCL and its clients,    the municipalities. In order    for this to

be successful,     the role of central governmental        entities must evolve from         one of centralized
decision-making and control      over the municipalities    and the CPSCL, to one        of providing technical
assistance and support with ex   postcontrols. Consequently,     the project's strategy is two-fold:

Financial viability and management     capacity of the municipal sector.

In order to face their continuously   increasing needs for investment     financing, the municipalities    ought to

increase their financial resources,   either through borrowing    or own resources. As it is      unlikely that the

volume of government     subsidies administered through      CPSCL can be sufficiently       increased, there is a
clear need to increase their    level of revenues. Thus,    it is critical for the municipalities    to be able to

adequately finance their  priority investments and    fulfill their expenditure obligations.     In that effect, the
PDM III project will support     the improvement of this   potentially worsening environment         by addressing
the key constraints that prevent  municipalities to improve    their situation. Therefore,  the project will assist

in strengthening    the technical and financial     capacity of the municipalities,     enabling them to move
progressively and in a sustainable    manner from a very difficult     financial situation to a viable   one (from
the "vulnerable" category   to the "normal" category).

This will be achieved    by (i) improving the collect       of local taxes (in particular      TIEB, Taxe sur les
Immeubles Bdtis, and TCL),      and (ii) strengthening government      transfers through a sustained    increase of

the FCCL (Fonds        Commun des Collectivites        Locales) or direct allocation        of tax revenues to
municipalities. At the same    time, management capacity     ofmunicipalities will be reinforced      with the help

of sector institutions such    as Local Government Department           (Direction Generale des       Collectivites

Publiques Locales -     DGCPL), Department         of Regional Affairs       (Direction Generale      des Affaires

Rggionales - DGAR) and        the Municipal Training Center         (CNPRCRM). The thrust          of the capacity
measures will cover: (i)   theimplementation of action     plans for all municipalities,    (ii) improved training
delivered by the CNPRCRM          to municipal staff and     (iii) technical assistance notably      to the project
 coordination unit (DCPDM)     in charge of implementing    the reform agenda.

On the long run, the most    efficient municipalities would     be able to get access to   other sources of funds
for their investments, directly    to the capital market or to     other private banks interested     in providing

municipal loans.




                                                       -7 -

Providing for a sufficient and effective source of investment funds.

In parallel, CPSCL may not be able to respond adequately to future increasing demand from the
municipalities due to managerial and financial constraints. In that effect, while CPSCL growth is
dependent on improvement in the local government finance framework, it will require a number of
institutional changes, including upgrading the skills of CPSCL staff, and a modification of its legal
framework and internal procedures. It is also critical that CPSCL improves its profitability in a
sustainable manner. This would allow it to mobilize resources on local credit markets, rather than relying
solely on the availability of funds from multilateral development banks.

The CPSCL will notably be able to (i) refrain from lending to non credit worthy municipalities, (ii) bill
late payment fees to municipalities, (iii) lend to non-municipalities borrowers or for non-PIC investments
at free deterrnined interest rates. This transformation would, at a later stage, have to be reinforced
through a change in CPSCL's legal status to provide it with the necessary decision-naking autonomy and
credibility as a financial institution.

C. Project Description Summary

1. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost
breakdown):

The project objective will be achieved through two main components:          (i) Capacity-building for the
Municipal Development Fund (CPSCL) to provide funding for municipal investments; and (ii)
Capacity-building for local governments and related central agencies to deliver and manage services.
Each of these components comprises a number of activities to address specific issues identified in the
Strategic Context section.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:

The Municipal Development       m Project will support and be carried out in conjunction with a number of
institutional and policy reforms on the part of the Government of Tunisia. These include: (a) revision of
the Organic Law; (b) amelioration of the texts governing Local Finance; (c) sustained strengthening of
central government transfers; (d) introduction of adequate administrative improvements in the
CNPRCRM and (e) strengthening CPSCL in view of its transformation into an autonomous agency (see
Annex 2A).


The first two urban sector projects have prepared the ground for these institutional and policy reforms by
financing key development studies aimed at defining the appropriate strategy and actions for the entities
involved. The strategic policy and institutional reforms supported by the project are:


(a)      CPSCL. The CPSCL strategic study recommends that CPSCL become a financially viable and
         autonomous financial institution, able to respond to the increasing needs of the municipalities.
         Corporatization   of CPSCL, also suggested by the study, was assessed at pre-appraisal.       The



                                                    -9-

        study recommends specific measures         to improve municipal financial soundness,         strengthen
        CPSCL management processes to assess        borrower creditworthiness and approve loans,     and build
        its capacity to assess its exposure limit   and finance a level of investments that    is affordable to
        municipalities. The CPSCL's management          capacity will be at the same time reinforced.       The
        Government has approved the recommended strategic         directions for CPSCL, and the institutional
        strengthening action plan forms the basis   of the technical assistance component to    CPSCL.


(b)     DGCPL. DGAR, and local governments.             A series of studies (municipal database,        analytic
        accounting, human resource management,          budget and account classification, etc.)      has been
        initiated aimed at strengthening local    government management and financial        position with the
        help of state entities. Recommendations       will be incorporated into the institutional development
        components and the         institutional reforms on budgeting and        financial management and
        capacity-building, including intercity associations    to be carried out under the proposed project.
        Other studies are also underway to       improve the capacity of the line ministries        to support,
        supervise and coordinate investment in rural    communities (conseilsruraux).The project       will also
        support local community participation through      the GESCOM subcomponent.

(c)      CNPRCRM. The CNPRCRM strategic study               recommended a strengthening of this entity       by
         changing its legal status and making its training     program more client oriented (transformation
         into a public-owned enterprise).       The Government considered premature          such institutional
         change. Rather, it proposes to introduce adequate        management capacity imrzprovements. The
        project will support the further strengthening   ofthis key institution accordingly.

3. Benefits and target population:

The project seeks to improve the delivery    of basic services and infrastructures tothe urban population by
strengthening the institutional capacities  of municipalities. Therefore, urban residents,   particularly those
in cash-strapped municipalities or living      in under-equipped neighborhoods, will       benefit from more
provision and better management of basic      public services and hence will have better     living conditions.
The participation of local communities          in planning, implementing, monitoring          and evaluating
development activities coordinated      by the municipalities will ensure that       their priority needs are
addressed, ensuring long term sustainability.

  Local Goverrments will benefit from           capacity-building components and strengthening           of the
CNPRCRM and CPSCL to provide support.               Municipalities in financial distress, in particular,    will
receive targeted support to enable them to      move towards financial viability. Central Government        will
benefit from a reduced burden for municipal        management as cities are increasingly      able to program,
finance and maintain local services.     The CPSCL will become self-sustaining         and CNPRCRM more
flexible in its management, to allow them    to provide a reinforced support to municipalities.


4. Institutional and implementation      arrangements:

Project oversight: A steering committee        (ISC), with representative of the Ministries     of Interior and
Local Development, Finance, Development          and International Cooperation, and        of CPSCL will be
created (i) to monitor and provide recommendations       to the policy agenda of the project (improvements
and reforms of the municipal law and local tax      system, FCCL and Govemment fiscal transfers),        and (ii)
to monitor implementation of the municipal restructuring       plans. At least once per year, the World    Bank
and the AFD representatives will be invited to      attend an evaluation meeting. The ISC will     examine the
implementation of the policy agenda and       make proposals as needed to expedite and       deepen the policy
reforms.

Implementation:         Each component and       subcomponent of the      project will be implemented
relevant entity as follows:

     (a) DGCPL will be      responsible for implementing    the technical assistance  programs for itself and    the

    municipalities and     for implementing the    computerization of municipalities      and local tax collection

     centers (sub-components      1.2, 1.3, and 1.5),

     (b) DGAR will be       responsible for undertaking     its institutional strengthening    program (technical

     assistance, equipment     and studies) to strengthen    the rural communities     and the regional districts
     (sub-component 1.4),

     (c) CNPRCRM will          implement its institutional     strengthening plan     (technical assistance     and
                                                                                                                it in
     equipment) to establish    a client-oriented training  program (sub-component       1.1), and implement

     support of the capacity   building program for the    municipalities,

     (d) CPSCL will be      responsible for evaluating   and financing local government      investment proposals,

     following eligibility    criteria for subprojects   and beneficiaries satisfactory    to the Bank. ,CPSCL

     municipal loan rates    will be set at a level that would allow CPSCL     to cover its costs and   generate an

     adequate return on     capital (sub-component   2.2 and 2.3); CPSCL     will also implement   its institutional

     strengthening plan     (sub-component 2.1).    CPSCL will be responsible     for monitoring and evaluating
     its activities. It willin particular follow the implementation of an    asset-liability management   system.


 Monitoring: The DCPDM           will be responsible for day-to-day   monitoring and follow-up    and the ISC will
 oversee all project activities.     Implementation progress     reports will be prepared     by.the DCPDM and

 submitted to the Bank      and to the AFD on     a quarterly basis. Regular    Bank supervision missions       will

 monitor progress on project     implementation and achievement      of development objectives.


 Financial Management:         CPSCL will be responsible      for the financial management      of the project and

 hence for maintaining        accounting records, preparing        Financial Monitoring       Reports (FMR) and

 transmitting them to     the Bank on a semi-annual      basis. It will also be   responsible for preparation      of

 annual Project Financial      Statements and submitting      them to the auditor.    The financial management
 procedures, including internal      control mechanisms,    flow of funds, accounting       policies, disbursement

 procedures and reporting     will be implemented    according to the requirements   defined in Annex 6.


 Auditing: CPSCL will         appoint an independent     auditor acceptable to the   Bank, to carry out an   annual

 audit according to internationally    acceptable auditing standards    as issued by the International   Federation

 of Accountants, the Bank's      Guidelines and specific   Terms of Reference     (TORs) acceptable to    the Bank.

 The auditor will express     a professional opinion  on (i) the annual project  financial statements   and (ii) the
                                                                                                             will be
 Statements of expenses       (SOEs). The audit report,     which will include two     separate opinions,
 transmitted to the Bank     and to the AFD within     six months of the close   of each fiscal year. CPSCL      will

 also have its financial statements audited by independent      auditors acceptable to the Bank.

 World Bank Loan arrangements: Three legal             agreements will be signed under the project:     (i) a loan
 agreement will be signed between the       Bank and the CPSCL for the total loan amount,        (ii) a guarantee
 agreement of the Government of Tunisia to        the Bank, which will cover the Bank's loan to      CPSCL, and
 (iii) a subsidiary-loan agreement between    the CPSCL and the Government of Tunisia for       the financing of
 the institutional component of the project (component       1).

 World Bank funds will be credited to the     CPSCL loan account in the currency in which       the Bank loan is
 denominated. CPSCL would withdraw from              this account in Tunisian Dinars (DT) at      the prevailing
 exchange rate. CPSCL will be charged the nominal        interest rate of the World Bank foreign currency    loan.
 An exchange risk premium will be paid        to the Treasury to cover the foreign exchange     risk of CPSCL.
 This would ensure that CPSCL would remain         on a level playing-field with all other financial  institutions
 in Tunisia that are recipients of foreign currency   loans. The premium, currently set at 1%,   on the basis of
 the historical volatility of the DTriLuro exchange   rate, will represent the remuneration of the   Government
 for assuming the foreign exchange risk on      World Bank and AFD funds. CPSCL is not in           a position to
 bear this risk itself since it cannot be transferred  to its local government borrowers, nor otherwise     hedge
 the risk.

 Financing arrangements: Priority municipal            investments Under the Xth Development            Plan are
 estimated in aggregate at US$576.08 million.        These would be financed by the municipalities         from a
 combination of sources including: (i) own     resources, central government subsidies, and     national agency
 participation (US$381.86 million); and (ii)    CPSCL loans and own ressources(US$194.22           million). The
 resources required by CPSCL are expected         to be covered by a credit line from the Bank        (US$75.25
 million), a credit line from AFD (US$45.26 million),         and CPSCL internal cash generation (US$73.71
 million). The municipal investments which are       not included in the Tenth Plan will be financed       by the
 municipalities from their own resources and        possible CPSCL loans. CPSCL has planned to            borrow
US$35 million on the local financial market to refinance       these extra-PIC loans.

The institutional strengthening of Government and       public entities is evaluated at US$3.99 million.    It will
be financed as follows: GoT- 21%; IBRD -           59% (sub-components 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5);       and AFD (
Agence Fran,aisede De'veloppement) -        20% (sub-component 1.1).
CPSCL strengthening is evaluated at US$0.73        million. The CPSCL will finance 20% of this       amount and
AFD will finance 80%.



D. Project Rationale

1. Project alternatives considered and       reasons for rejection:

Three alternatives to the proposed project      were considered with the Government.       The first alternative
was to maintain the status-quo; i.e., maintaining       the financing of CPSCL without significant        further
reform or evolution in its structure and operations       and in the financing and management capacity         of
municipalities. In the absence of specific measures      considered under the proposed project to     strengthen
the management and financial situation of municipalities,       the projected total investment amounts of local
governments would need to be significantly      reduced, and the poorest municipalities would     be compelled
to decrease their investments. As a consequence        of these "disinvestments", CPSCL financial       situation
would quickly deteriorate, as many clients     would have neither the possibility to borrow    nor the capacity
to reimburse outstanding loans.



                                                      - 12 -

The second alternative entailed financing municipal        investrnents through a disproportionate increase       in
the total amount of central government transfers.        However, the current and projected macroeconomic
situation of Tunisia would      not allow such a decision given its impact         on the national budget and
implication on the overall economic activity.
The third alternative considered was the transforrnation      of CPSCL into a fully privatized bank, involved
along all other financial institutions in the financing    of Tunisian municipalities. This scenario is clearly
premnature. CPSCL in its current structure    is not ready to withstand the sudden competition      resulting from
the opening of its activities. In fact, private banks     would lend to the more attractive clients, while      the
weakest municipalities would not have access         to financing on acceptable terms and would       have to rely
heavily on central government subsidies.     Although this a]ternative was not retained,    the proposed project
would create the conditions for the eventual development        of an open, competitive market for municipal
financing, by strengthening both municipalities      and CPSCL

 3. Lessons learned and reflected      in the project design:

 The Bank has learned in the design and          implementation of municipal development         projects how to
 address issues on the demand side as well      as on the supply side within the sector; this has proved to be a
 key element for a successful and sustainable       project. The proposed project will therefore    address both
 sides:

 (a)      On the demand side, municipalities should       have the financial capacity to qualify   to borrow and
          meet the debt servicing requirement.         A thorough analysis of municipal        finance has been
          undertaken, which has underscored the         need to address the weaknesses in        the institutional
          capacity and financial situation of local governments     within the context of the proposed project.
 (b)      On the supply side, the proposed project     will seek to transform the municipal development       fund
          (CPSCL) into an autonomous and self-standing        financial institution. This would enable    CPSCL
          to raise resources on the capital markets        by the end of the project period       and become a
          sustainable financial institution able to finance the demand of the local governments.

 More specifically, the design of   the proposed project reflects the lessons    learnt from the implementation
 of the previous Bank projects (PDM I-       project outcome rated satisfactory by    OED- and PDM II - being
 satisfactorily implemented) and the numerous       studies that were/have been launched under       the PDM II
 project.

 Key lessons drawn from the projects and      studieg are that: (i) municipalities need to generate a significant
 and stable level of resources through     tax collection, (ii) the present system   of state financial transfers
 needs to be further reformed, particularly     in targeting poor municipalities with few     resources, (iii) the
 system of financing local government investments       needs further broadening to transform    the CPSCL into
 a financial institution that offers a    wide range of products adapted to the         evolving needs of local
 governments and other stakeholders,        (iv) alternative solutions are necessary       for human resource
development at the municipal, regional         and national levels, (v) programs aimed       at upgrading local
governments should be strengthened,        and adapted within their environments        and, (vi) efforts toward
greater consultation with and     participation of the population, with        a special emphasis on the poor
communities need to be reinforced.

The proposed project will integrate    these lessons through: (i) the upgrading    of municipalities' managerial
and financial capacities and computerization      of their tax collection; (ii) DGCPL's    reform of its working
procedures and relations with municipalities;       and (iii) DGAR's reform of its      working procedures and
relations with rural communes and     regional districts. Also, the implementation      of the recommendations
of the strategic studies, financed      by PDM-II, on future evolution         of CPSCL and CNPRCRM for
strengthening and transforming these     institutions will be a critical component   of PDM-Ell. The social and
participatory outcome of the community        participation programs financed      under the PDM II will help
redefine these programs to better involve    community participation in municipal      investment decisions and
better design projects with direct impact   to the population.

4. Indications of borrower commitment          and ownership:

Commitment to and ownership       of the proposed project are undoubtedly       strong. The demand for a third
municipal development project comes          from both the Tunisian Government          and the CPSCL.       The
Tunisian authorities prepared their     Tenth Development Plan which includes          the priority program for
local investments, in which CPSCL     is the central financing vehicle.

Both the Tunisian Government and         the CPSCL agree that the Tenth        Plan objectives will not be met
without improvement in the current      local government situation. Both      recognize the need for reforms   to
strengthen the financial position of  Tunisian municipalities and to transform      CPSCL into an autonomous

and financially viable institution able to raise resources on the long-term credit markets, as   recommended
in the conclusions of the strategic  study on CPSCL. In that context,     the latter has already received from
"Maghreb Rating," a regional    rating agency, a "AA" rating -   one of the highest for a financial institution
in Tunisia. After securing    this rating, CPSCL issued in   January, 2002, its first bonds    on the Tunisian
capital market.

5. Value added of Bank support       in this project:

The worldwide experience of the      Bank in the municipal development      sector, its long term involvement
in this sector in Tunisia, its recognized expertise and credibility,   will allow the Bank to (i)  advise on a
comprehensive package of      reforms necessary to strengthen     municipalities; (ii) provide  access to high
quality training and assistance  to the different stakeholders;  and (iii) enhance the partnership  with other

donors.

Both CPSCL and GoT view       the Bank's loan and technical  assistance as a critical resource to finance local
investments and accompany the       implementation of the sector   policy reforms, in a period during    which
CPSCL would be put on the path      to becoming more independent    and financially sustainable.

"Entitlement" of municipalities    to CPSCL's financing under     the "Municipal Investment Prograrn".      The
proposed line of credit to CPSCL     would finance a large number    (5,000) of small and medium     municipal
projects. The bulk of these projects      would be listed in the five-year   "Municipal Investment Program"
(PIC) approved by the Government         as part of the Tenth National     Development Plan.      These would
mainly be investments in        municipal roads and drainage,       waste water disposal, rehabilitation      of

neighborhoods and community        facilities. Listing of a project in the PIC would, in a way,      "entitle" a
municipality to CPSCL's financing      under a formula that would define    the project financing plan in terms
of municipality own source    contribution (auto-financing),  central government contribution    (subsidy), and
loan component (CPSCL loan       financing). In the context of  the PDM-m, CPSCL's role       and due diligence
in approving financing requests,    even for those projects listed in the PIC, consist of a thorough   appraisal
of the subprojects feasibility   on the basis of economic,      financial, social and environmental     criteria.
(Projects not listed in the PIC may be revenue-earning projects     such as markets places, business    centers,
etc. which also qualify for     CPSCL's lending when they         meet CPSCL's eligibility criteria,    mainly
financial profitability and environmental    safeguards).

Expected benefits and the economic        analysis of subproiects.  Among the proposed project's       expected
benefits resulting from increased        access to basic infrastructure     facilities would be:      improved
environmental conditions through      the promotion of solid waste  collection systems and disposal    schemes
and green spaces within communes;        reduction in health hazards to    the local population through   better
 access to water distribution and  sewerage (in those small communities     outside the operational boundaries
 of national public utilities);    and better support of economic          activities through the upgrading,
rehabilitation and expansion of the    existing network of municipal    roads. Some of these benefits    can be
 quantified while others may   not.

 CPSCL assesses the merit     and priority of subproject requests   along criteria detailed in its  Operational

 Manual which defines the costs, benefits,      and the methodology to be considered.        Developed in the
 course of the two previous World Bank municipal           development projects, the methodology seeks        to
 ensure that projects are financed on the     basis of economic merit.       The guidelines, which are sector
 specific, involve standard cost-benefit analyses  for large subprojects with quantifiable benefits   and entail
 the calculation of the economic rate of return (which       should be no less than the opportunity cost of
 capital). For smaller projects - mainly municipal roads         which account for a large share of CPSCL
 financing requests - the guidelines seek to ensure   that least-cost alternatives are chosen and that  projects
 are cost-effective in terms of unit outlays and       number of beneficiaries.      In the course of project
 preparation, the economic analysis of subprojects     (which is satisfactory, overall) has been reviewed   and
 updated as needed to improve further the efficiency    of municipal resource allocation and ensure    effective
 screening of financing requests in terms        of subproject quality and priority.        This involves the
 establishment of reliable benchmarks (on       which work is ongoing at CPSCL).           Moreover, demand
 estimates for commercial type activities (markets,    parking, etc...) and sensitivity analyses would  need to
 be strengthened. Training for CPSCL's staff   will be provided in this area during the project's life.

 2. Financial (see Annex 4 and Annex 5):
 NPV=US$ million; FRR = % (see Annex 4)

 The CPSCL's financial statements are audited       each year by DFK International, an auditing       company
 whose selection was approved by the World Bank.        A complete financial analysis of CPSCL was carried
 out during pre-appraisal and has been archived with     all other project files. A summary of this analysis  is
 presented in annex 4. These documents show       that CPSCL is currently in a good financial position      and
 that its situation has improved over the past     five years. The project will monitor CPSCL's        financial
 situation through precise financial indicators which   will be also financial covenants.

CPSCL's dependence on the financial condition of        the local government sector. CPSCL could continue
to play an effective role in municipal infrastructure     finance only if the financial situation of   the local
government sector were to improve markedly. Barring          this, CPSCL could face liquidity problems and
the risk of insolvency. A growth scenario for CPSCL       assumes that the problems stemming from the poor
cash-flow of municipalities has been corrected       by an increase in the resources made available      to the
municipalities.

CPSCL resource mobilization and availability     of counterpart funds. It would be important     to support the
government reform agenda in the municipal               sector in particular the implementation         of the
recommendations of the strategic study on      the future of the CPSCL - carried out under        the PDM-II.
Indeed, one of the main thrusts of the study      is that for CPSCL to put itself on the path to      financial
sustainability as a market-based financial    institution, it would have to reduce its    reliance on official
sources of funding - which hitherto has been      the main source of term financing to CPSCL         - through
access to the private credit markets, or      to other committed lines of credit from        private financial
institutions willing to joint CPSCL in strategic  partnerships. Nonetheless, for the period    covered by the
proposed loan, CPSCL's resource needs      are likely to be met from the World Bank and      AFD, in addition
to CPSCL's internal cash generation.

CPSCL's loan portfolio guality.    At the end of 2001, 11% of    the loan portfolio was affected     by arrears of

more than six months. These     arrears involved close to 30%   of all CPSCL borrowers       and some 40% of all

loans (in terms of number   of loans). The value of arrears   amounted to 3.5 % of the      portfolio. In the past

even borrowers not current     on their repayment obligations      continued to be eligible for      CPSCL new

lending perceived as an entitlement   in the context of Tunisia municipal     finance system. CPSCL has        been

setting provisions as if it had to be in compliance     with Central Bank prudential       policies for loan loss

provisioning applicable   in the banking sector.      The management of arrears          is an issue to address.

Portfolio quality, a main parameter     of creditworthiness, will   have to be adequate so that      CPSCL may

access the long-term credit markets     at an affordable cost that would     allow CPSCL to operate amongst
prospective commercial bank     players in the potentially competitive     municipal finance market.       Progress.

will be realized through the possibility given to the CPSCL     (i) to consider not lending    to a city that is not

creditworthy and (ii) to systematically  recover interest on late payments.


CPSCL borrowing costs. lending      rates and financial performance     indicators. CPSCL has maintained         or

exceeded the financial ratios   covenanted under the PDM-II:         net income/total assets of       2.1% (1.5%

required), return on equity  6.7% (4% required), debt/service      coverage of 4.3 (1.5 required).       But these

good results have been achieved     without resources from the    open market (only budgetary       resources and

external donor loans have   been used). Furthermore,      the precarious financial situation     of municipalities

and the resulting increases    in their outstanding payments      might ultimately weaken       CPSCL financial

standing. On its path to becoming      a commercially viable, market-based       financial intermediary, CPSCL
would need to strike a balance          between:     (a) the growth objectives driven          by the needs of

poorly-endowed local government       borrowers, and (b) the requirements        of profitability and the need    to

maintain a strong capital  base - which CPSCL now         has - that would allow future       CPSCL's access to

private credit markets.    This would require an enhancement           of CPSCL's operating revenues          - the

intermediation margin between      lending rates and costs of      resources.    This may require (upward         or

downward) adjustments to     CPSCL' lending rates to     reflect its costs of borrowings.     It would also mean

that CPSCL's administrative     costs (currently around 0.5%      of assets) would need to      be kept in check.

CPSCL would need to maintain       a satisfactory financial condition   and continue to comply with        financial

performance indicators - such    as return on equity, debt service   coverage, provisions to loans,     in addition

to intermediation margin   and administrative expenses     to asset ratio. Precise ratios    to be achieved have

been defined during the pre-appraisal    mission and agreed upon during     appraisal (see Annex 1).


Preventing interest rate distortions.
In order to assess the potential  impact of the CPSCL case on      the interest rates in Tunisia,   it is important

to differentiate loans to municipalities   and local governments, to loans       to the private sector. Thus,    the

interest rates proposed by   commercial banks to private      companies are somewhat         higher than the ones

used by the CPSCL. This     situation is due to the cost  of the large amount of defaulted      loans those banks

have to provision (up to    30% of default).     In comparison, defaults on       municipal loans amount       for a

maximum of 3.5% of the total      amount of outstanding loans.    Furthermore, the Bank's loan      to the CPSCL

will not distort the market,given that:


 1. In terms of the cost of   the resources: The rate of     the IBRD's loan, +1% of        foreign exchange risk

     guarantee, is very close    to the rate at which commercial        banks can find their own         resources.

     Furthermore, CPSCL has     access to capital funding at market    rates: it has already started  raising funds

     with its recent Bond floating on  the local capital market.
 2.  In terms of the lending    rates to municipalities: it   is important to note that      the administratively

     determined interest rate for CPSCL    loans to municipalities is close   to interest rates commercial    banks

     would apply, and aimed at     targeting the priority projects   listed in the PIC. For non-PIC        projects,

     CPSCL will be able, through    the PDM    m,  to establish its own interest   rates, similarly to commercial




                                                      -17-

     banks potentially interested in this market.

Fiscal Impact:

Over the five-year period of implementation of the proposed        PDM m project (2003-2007), the overall
envelope of the communal investment program (PIC) is estimated at                US$576 million. In terms of
financing, this investment is funded from several sources:          (i) equity contributions from Tunisian
municipalities in an aggregate amount of US$114 million;          (ii) credits from CPSCL in an amount of
US$194.22 million, which the municipalities are fully liable      for; (iii) transfers from central government
in an amount of US$130 million; and (iv) specific contributions         from various technical ministries and
central agencies in an amount of US$138 million.

Only expenditures under items (iii) representing central          government (US$130 million), and (iv)
representing central agency transfers (US$138 million)     would put a fiscal burden on central government
budget. Municipal expenditures related to debt service     for credits contracted by municipalities and for
which these are liable would not be part of the fiscal liabilities of the central government.

Therefore the fiscal cost of the PDM mIproject would       be estimated at US$268 million to which should
be added the local costs of the various capacity building   components under the loan (component 1), and
which are the responsibility of the central government.   In aggregate, the fiscal impact of the World Bank
project would stand at US$270 million.

3. Technical:

CPSCL technical staff have developed some indicators       of the quality of a project that is submitted for
financing, but they are mainly limited to the average  unit costs of major civil works components. CPSCL
technical staff will become more involved in analyzing projects       and ranking them in terms of technical
and economic feasibility. As it now stands, CPSCL will     finance any project that has been submitted by a
financially sound municipality, if it falls within pre-established  categories and it does not deteriorate the
credit rating of that municipality. Greater care will be taken to   ensure that these projects clearly benefit
the municipality from an economic and an environmental point       of view.

All projects submitted for CPSCL financing will include      a maintenance cost schedule, and an operation
cost schedule as the case may be, in addition       to the construction cost itself, to make sure that the
municipalities will be able to properly maintain and operate       facilities that will have been financed by
CPSCL. Its Operations Manual will include such provision.

At the present time, CPSCL technical staff hardly monitor       the impact of projects financed by CPSCL,
although a close supervision of civil works is exercised.        More information will be gathered on the
outcomes and outputs of the projects financed in     each municipality. These major projects will only be
financed if the municipality can demonstrate that they are part   of a master plan for its future development
(15 - 20 year horizon). For smaller municipalities without planning        capabilities, the investment will be
monitored on the basis of the number of persons, families       or households directly benefiting from it, or
other suitable indicators to be used, for instance, in the development     of a central market or an industrial
estate. The Operations Manual will address these issues       and provide guidelines to the municipalities.
The revision of the Operations Manual is currently being         undertaken by the CPSCL with the Bank
support.

4. Institutional:

CPSCL was created in 1975 and functioned essentially as       a cashier's window under the DGCPL. It was



                                                    - 18 -

restructured in 1992 as an EPIC      (Etablissement Public a CaractereIndustriel      et Commercial) with its
own lending policies administered      by a Board consisting of ministerial  representatives.   It has evolved
considerably under both the PDM-I         and PDM-Il projects and improved      its procedures and financial
performance. A Strategic Study      on the future of CPSCL, financed    under the PDM-II considered various
scenarios regarding the evolution of      CPSCL and its role in the local   government finance sector. The
study's recommendations mainly         seek to strengthen the role of CPSCL        as a commercially viable
market-based specialized financial institution,      that would gradually move towards     corporatization and
resource mobilization on the domestic        credit market. Indeed, to ensure     its sustainability, meet the
growing demand of local governments,        and create the economy of scale  needed for commercial viability,
CPSCL would need to expand and diversify         its resource base beyond the official sources of funding now
available. This means first and foremost,      an enhanced capacity to raise long-term    resources on private
credit markets.     Yet the creditworthiness of CPSCL         and its growth prospects require    a significant
improvement in the financial position      of municipalities and their capacity  to borrow. This would call,
inter alia, for a growth in their fiscal revenues, an improvement in their  tax collection practices and/or an
increase in central government transfers.

Furthermore, CPSCL in the medium         term might have to explore the  potential for partnerships with other
domestic banks which have a potential       interest in local government finance.   On the resource side, this
may allow CPSCL to secure access          to relatively low-cost resources - e.g., the deposits base of such
partner banks. On the asset side,    this may allow CPSCL - given its    comparative advantage and expertise
in the area of local government        finance - to participate in syndicated    lending with such partners,
especially if it were to expand     the scope of its activities beyond  the local government borrower      base
strictly defined, and include other    entities involved in the provision  of local infrastructure. Such new
borrowing entities may include      utility companies operating under   concession agreements and/or larger
projects and operations where      CPSCL may not be the sole creditor       given the risks inherent in their
funding.

The Government, as a policy arbiter        and "owner" of CPSCL, has agreed        in principle to corporatize
CPSCL with the objective, inter-alia,     of strengthening its,capacity to access credit markets and mobilize
further resources to the local governments.      This is in line with the government    long-term development
vision and strategic orientations in    the local government sector and    within which CPSCL's long-term
evolution must be charted. The    decision to corporatize CPSCL would     be taken at the time ofthe project's
mid-term review (anticipated to    be June 2005) giving due consideration    to the situation of the municipal
sector in which CPSCL's activities      are solidly anchored. The decision  would need to be based upon the
financial position of the municipalities     -- so far the sole borrowers of  CPSCL - and their borrowing
capacity. This position would be assessed       on the basis of the loan performance    indicators (provided in
Annex 1 section l.a). Moreover,         the set of actions (internal organizational   changes, revision of the
Operational Manual, improvements          in procedures to evaluate municipal      financial health and risks,
improvement in staff skills, etc)   would be implemented and supported      by technical assistance under the
Project.

CNPRCRM, the Training Center,           was created in 1995 to respond to    the training needs of local and
regional governments. The Center       is an autonomous entity under   the administrative supervision of MoL.
Its Board is chaired by its director,       and the Board members are        Mol, CPSCL and the National
Admninistrative School. The Center       is financed through a budget annexed     to the MoI budget, through
international donors, and through      local governments participation. Although     its performance has been
highly satisfactory, a strategic     study financed under the PDM      II recommends to transform it into     a
non-administrative public entity,      to give it more autonomy. The      GoT considered this legal change
premature, and decided to introduce     adequate administrative improvements    in the CNPRCRM.

 DGCPL, within MoL, is in charge of Local Government           management. Its monitoring capacities, notably
 of the municipalities in financial difficulty, will be improved with the help   of technical assistance.

 DGAR, also within MoL, is in charge of regional governments,               rural councils, and neighborhood
 committees (comit6s de quartiers). Its objectives are     to strengthen the governorates, and to improve its
 monitoring through a computerized organization scheme       for itself and the governorates.

 4.1 Executing agencies:

 CPSCL will be the Borrower for the total loan amount of the      project.
 CPSCL will sign a subsidiary-loan agreement with          the GoT, for the financing of the "Institutional
 strengthening of government and public entities" component       (component 1).
CPSCL and DGCPL (DCPDM) are the executing                 agencies. Their capacity is deemed satisfactory to
implement the proposed project as they have been          the executing agencies of the previous two Bank
supported municipal development projects.

4.2 Project management:

Each component and subcomponent of the Project            will be implemented by the relevant entity.        The
Directorate DCPDM of the DGCPL in the Ministry              of Interior, will monitor the day-to-day project
activities and be responsible for coordination.         It will also monitor performance indicators during
implementation.     An Interministerial Committee supported by a technical               secretariat (DCPDM),
including representatives of all involved ministries and     agencies, will resolve issues of coordination that
are brought to its attention. In that framework, CPSCL       will be responsible for evaluating and financing
local governments proposal for investments, following            eligibility criteria, including environmental
criteria, for subprojects and beneficiaries satisfactory to         the Bank. In addition, CPSCL will be
responsible for monitoring the environmental aspects of sub-projects       during their implementation.

Procurement:
For procurement of goods or consulting services related               to capacity building for the various
municipalities and governmental agencies or departments,           primary responsibility will lie with these
entities. DCPDM will provide support to these entities,       it will coordinate all procurement activities and
be the executing agency vis-a-vis the Bank. For        procurement of works, goods or consulting services
related to the execution of a subproject financed by CPSCL,       primary responsibility will lie with the local
community or its delegated agency that will be the recipient      of the loan. CPSCL has agreed that before it
confirms its final agreement to a loan to a local community         or a regional entity, (i) it will ensure that
proper procurement procedures have been followed, and             (ii) it will submit to the Bank for its no
objection any subproject whose expected cost is equal to     or greater than the thresholds established for the
procurement method to be used or the need for prior review,      as described in Annex 6 of this document.

Financial management:
CPSCL will be responsible for financial management of all        project funds, including those managed under
its own account and those managed on behalf of the Government.              A management agreement will be
established between the Ministry of Finance and CPSCL             for the financial management of the funds
destined for the institutional strengthening component.         FMRs will be prepared by CPSCL and will
contain information useful for CPSCL at the same time         as providing the Bank with information for its
purposes.

4.3 Procurement issues:

The latest Country Procurement Assessment Report         (CPAR) dates from 1990-91. A CPAR is envisaged
for FY04. By and large there are no major procurement issues          in Tunisia, although protection of local


                                                      -20 -

suppliers is a common practice. The    Bank thinks that some ameliorations    should take place to improve
National Tender Board (Commission superieuredes        marches) and Departmental /Regional     Tender Board
operation. Local practices are some    times at odds with the Bank's guidelines:    (i) consultant proposals
are evaluated mechanically, without  due consideration for the actual expertise of the firm or the pertinent
experience of its employees; (ii) a system  of dual envelopes is required for goods and   works, with undue
preference given to other considerations     than the price; and (iii) project managers      often introduce
post-qualification criteria during bid evaluation. A CPAR should do much       to align the various Tender
Boards' regulations with the Bank's  guidelines.

In the on-going Second Municipal Development      Project (PDM-ll), the Bank thinks    also that procurement
problems stemmed mostly from the     fact that the Borrower (CPSCL) was not     involved with procurement
decisions at the local level. Once   a loan had been approved, the municipality     had total responsibility
over procurement procedures and there     was no guarantee that they would   follow the Bank's guidelines.
For major investments that called for   an economic evaluation and an environmental      impact assessment,
CPSCL did not have sufficient expertise     to perform these analyses, nor did   the municipalities for that
matter, and thus the Borrower was not    in compliance with various legal covenants    of the project. At the
same time, it proved difficult to enact   prior reviews for projects that exceeded    the agreed thresholds,
because CPSCL would only approve a        major loan when the municipality had     submitted detailed plans
and a budget. However an ex post review     of a number of projects showed that with    very few exceptions,
the procurement procedures were adequate.

To remedy problems encountered during      PDM-II, CPSCL has agreed to the following:

*   ensure that its borrowers follow Bank    guidelines on procurement, environmental      impact, economic
    and/or financial analysis, and resettlement.
*   seek Bank no objection prior to tendering   any investment project for which civil works    are estimated
    to cost US$3.0 million or more, or    for which goods are estimated to cost    US$0.6 million or more;
    such procurement will be done under     international competitive bidding procedures.
*   To foster international competition, contracts    for procurement of goods will be packaged       in large
    units.
*   Selection and employment of consultants      for contracts valued at US$100,000 or     more for firms or
    US$50,000 or more for individual consultants         will be subject to Bank guidelines      and will be
    advertised periodically in UN Development     Business on the Internet.
*   Works, goods or consultant services    under these thresholds may be procured     under national bidding
    procedures.
*   The Bank will not finance projects     executed by force account, and it   will not make payments to
    reimburse extra wages paid to civil      servants or other government employees        by a ministry, a
    governmental agency, an NGO or     a consulting firm.
*   The first two contracts under each category   of investment (with the exception of land   acquisition that
    is not financed by the Bank), whatever   their amount, will be subject to the Bank's   prior no objection
    before the CPSCL can confirm its final   agreement to the borrower.

The Bank is satisfied that CPSCL's new       procurement guidelines include most of       the comments and
suggestions it made during PDM-II implementation      .
CPSCL has agreed to improve its      procurement capabilities. It is reviewing   its Operational Manual, in
order notably to take into account the  Bank's procurement guidelines. This Operational       Manual will be
discussed with the Bank before the effectiveness   of the loan.

4.4 Financial management issues:

 Country risks. The Country Profile ofFinancial Accountability (January 2000) reviewed both public and
 private sector accounting and auditing. With regard to private auditors, it commented that "auditors are
 generally well trained; the degree of Expert Comptable is quite demanding." On the other hand, there is
 a shortage of qualified accountants. The governing body, the Ordre des Experts Comptables de Tunisie
 only has about 230 members while needs are estimated at about 1,000. Also, requirements in the area of
 continuing professional training have not yet been established.       The Country Portfolio Performance
 Review in February 2000 did not raise any significant financial management issues, other than the
difficulties encountered by several project units in managing special accounts with the Central Bank of
Tunisia.

ProjectFinancialManagementRisk.          CPSCL has consistently met the financial targets specified under
PDM-II and the audits of its financial statements and management systems, carried out by private
auditors satisfactory to the Bank, have been unqualified and timely.        During the implementation of
PDM-ll, a series of three studies on the future institutional set-up of CPSCL have been undertaken. The
last, just completed in July 2001, outlines the steps to be taken towards greater financial autonomy on the
basis of a scenario agreed between the Government and the Bank. The financial risk lies in the growing
dependence upon loan repayments from relatively weak municipalities, whose resources are limited.
These vulnerable municipalities will be submitted to restructuration plans and will not be allowed to
borrow from CPSCL until their financial situation improve. These measures will considerably mitigate
this risk.

An assessment of the financial management arrangements under the Project has been carried out during
pre-appraisal. The financial management system was found satisfactory.

5. Environmental:                         Environmental Category: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)
5.1 Summarize the steps undertaken for environmental assessment and EMP preparation (including
consultation and disclosure) and the significant issues and their treatment emerging from this analysis.

The Tunisia Municipal Development HI Project is a category Fl project.               The World Bank will
support municipal developments by making funds available through the Municipal Development Agency:
Caissedes Pretset de Soutien des CollectivitgsLocales (CPSCL), the financial intermediary (FI) for the
investments. This project fully adheres to the requirements of OP-BP 4.01 and Tunisian Law No.115 of
1992. The EIA Directorate of ANPE is the body responsible for Environmental Impacts Assessments
(EIA) in Tunisia. ANPE is responsible for administration, reviewing, and monitoring EIAs.

The Project is to fund the following type of infrastructure investments: urban roads and sidewalks; water
distribution, drainage, sewerage, street lightening, green and recreational areas, and low-income
neighborhood upgrading.      CPSCL is responsible for the financing of these investments and their
environmental soundness. CPSCL must verify that subprojects in which they invest meet the
environmental requirements of Tunisia, and are consistent with the Bank's environmental policies, either
through in-house staff, outside experts, or environmental agencies. The FI will screen each sub-project
and ensure that any legally required Environmental Assessment (EA) report prepared by the
requesting municipality has been approved by the ANPE, before approving any loan or
investment.

Although it is not expected, the project could, in certain circumstances, result in adverse environmental
impacts. A process to ensure that potential environmental risks of subprojects are adequately assessed
and managed is included in the Operational Manual (OM). The environmental assessment, carried out by
GOT during preparation, reviewed all the environmental aspects of the project. The environment
assessment: (a) reviewed the environmental work undertaken under PDM-Il focusing on the subprojects
financed by CPSCL and found it satisfactory; and (b) identified improvements and amendments to the

Operational Manual (OM), with the aim of ensuring that environmental        measures are integrated within
the subprojects and that subprojects comply with Tunisian law and            regulation.   Institutional and
monitoring arrangements for the implementation of the environmental     work is also detailed in the EA.

5.2 What are the main features of the EMP and are they adequate?

All relevant environmental measures have been integrated         within the design of the project, and are
reflected in the Environmental Chapter of the OM.        Each proposed sub-project is subject to meeting
environmental criteria. If a sub-project does not meet all the  environmental criteria it is not eligible for
funding.   When an eligible sub-project is subject to an EA,         the EA will be carried out by the
administration, company or individual carrying out the subproject,    and will have to be cleared by ANPE
for the sub-project to be eligible for funding.          Currently, CPSCL is only responsible for the
environmental aspects of the project up to implementation. However,       under this project CPSCL will
also assume     responsibility for supervision of the implementation of envirotnental             aspects of
sub-projects.    As mentioned above, the majority of sub-projects will        have positive environmental
impacts. Under the PDM II, 4 out of 2,172 projects had environmental      impacts for which environmental
mitigation measures were implemented. One out of 2,172 projects was          rejected for funding due to its
negative environmental impacts. In assumning its supervision   role, CPSCL will ensure that ANPE closely
monitors the technical implementation of the environmental    mitigation measures for the small percentage
of projects which will require it. In addition, CPSCL will   report to the World Bank on the performance
of the implementation of agreed environmental actions in its progress   reports. (see section 5.5)

5.3 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status ofEA:
                   Date of receipt of final draft: not applicable

5.4 How have stakeholders been consulted at the stage of (a)   environmental screening and (b) draft EA
report on the environmental impacts and proposed environment      management plan? Describe
mechanisms of consultation that were used and which groups      were consulted?

The FI   category, which is used for the first time in Tunisia,       has been discussed with the main
stakeholders during the preparation of the environmental assessment.     The key stakeholders, CPSCL and
ANPE, and also the National Sanitation Board          (Office National de lAssainissement - ONAS) and
DGCPL in the Ministry of Interior have provided instrumental     technical input into the EA.

Many consultations will take place during project implementation,    especially at the municipality level. At
the sub-projects' environmental review phase, before the approval      of the check-list, which is the most
frequently used tool to assess environmental impacts of sub-projects,        a wide consultation of many
stakeholder representatives, among them ANPE, ARRU           (Agence de Rehabilitation et de Renovation
Urbaine), CPSCL, DGCPL, ONAS, AFH (Agence               Fonciere d'Habitation), SNIT (Societe Nationale
Immobili&re de Tunisie), the Ministry of Equipment and Housing,      CNPRCRM, and inside the concerned
municipality, will take place.

5.5 What mechanisms have been established to monitor and evaluate the impact        of the project on the
environment? Do the indicators reflect the objectives and results  of the EMP?

The FI has developed environmental performance monitoring procedures           to ensure implementation of
agreed environmental actions, and to assess the risks associated          with changes in the regulatory
framework or the sponsors operations. These procedures, outlined in the     Fls operational manual, include
simplified pro-formas for submission of monitoring reports      by sponsors. Environmental monitoring is
linked to standard credit-risk monitoring procedures, and      involves staff from the sponsor and Fl in
completing reports.

Progress reports to the Bank from FIs will include:           the environmental screening decisions for



                                                    - 23 -

 subprojects; the results of the EA process; evidence of necessary permits/licenses provided; status of
 compliance with agreed environmental actions; and any action on the part of the FT to resolve outstanding
 environmental concerns with subprojects.

 Periodic Bank supervision should evaluate (a) the environmental screening and review process (including
 the successful implementation/use of the manual, effectiveness of training, etc.), and (b) random
 checking of a few subprojects.

 6. Social:
 6.1 Summarize key social issues relevant to the project objectives, and specify the project's social
 development outcomes.

 There are two key social issues for PDM-I.         The first is how to ensure a balance between (a) the
 imperative of poverty reduction that will direct an appropriate level of state support to upgrade the
 physical environment of the more disadvantaged communities; and (b) continued progress towards
greater municipal fiscal and financial autonomy. The second key social development issue is to develop
and strengthen effective mechanisms (including financial and administrative mechanisms) that will
promote greater participation of citizens in the area of municipal development. The project objective
here would be to enhance existing mechanisms not only of consultation, but of partnership and resource
mobilization for municipal development between municipal administrative and technical officials, the
local communities (particularly in the most disadvantaged areas) and voluntary support from the private
sector. Considerable interest exists in such an approach at many levels in principle, and it was pioneered
in a few municipalities some years ago, but its potential remains to be more fully developed.

6.2 Participatory Approach: How are key stakeholders participating in the project?

PDM-m will build on the lessons learned from the GESCOM component of PDM II, a small, localized
and pilot community based participatory development program. Neighborhood groups in low income
areas will identify their priority developmental needs and participate in the implementation of projects,
including through financial and in-kind contributions. A training program building on the experiences of
PDM-II for municipal and govemorate level committees will be conducted by CNPRCRM, the training
institute for local government personnel.    Site visits to successful GESCOM projects and exchanges
among communities implementing participation projects are planned as part of the training. The primary
goal of the training programs is to strengthen linkages between municipal officials, civil society
organizations and ordinary citizens to launch collaborative partnerships for local development.
Workshops at the govemorate level are also planned to promote participatory development.

6.3 How does the project involve consultations or collaboration with NGOs or other civil society
organizations?

  Select visits during project identification indicated that the preparation of municipal investment
programs includes a significant effort in public consultation with civil society, elected city councils and
the technical services of the municipality. Prioritization of investments is subject to public debate.

6.4 What institutional arrangements have been provided to ensure the project achieves its social
development outcomes?

Institutional arrangements have been provided to promote and coordinate a greater level of citizen
participation in municipal affairs. Overall coordination and monitoring of the project is conducted by a
civil servant at PDM-lII project coordinating unit based at DGCPL. At the govemorate level, regional
coordinating committees, "Comitis Regionaux d'Orientation des Projets" (CROPS), composed of
selected members of the Governor's staff, representatives of NGOs and other civil society organizations
will coordinate and monitor GESCOM activities within municipalities located in their jurisdiction. At
the local level, teams composed of municipal leaders, representatives of civil society, neighborhood-



                                                    -24  -

groups etc will be responsible for mobilizing communities and implementing        the investment programs.
An NGO will also be contracted throughout the life of the project to offer     technical assistance to guide
the municipal level committees and neighborhood groups in          identifying and implementing projects
through a participatory way.

6.5 How will the project monitor performance in terms of social development      outcomes?

Monitoring and evaluation of the project will be done at all levels.        Municipalities and beneficiary
communities will set simple indicators for project performance (such      as pictures taken before and after
project completion) and will be required to report periodic evaluations           to the govemorate. The
govemorate level committees (CROP) will also conduct periodic monitoring        of the projects and report to
DGCPL. The NGO is also required to monitor, evaluate and report        on not only project investments but
also the participatory process itself. A midterm and final evaluation of     the project's social impact and
participatory process will be conducted.

7. Safeguard Policies:
7.1 Do any of the following safeguard policies apply to   the project?
                                 Policy                                              Applicability

7.2 Describe provisions made by the project to ensure compliance     with applicable safeguard policies.

The CPSCL's OM integrates environmental safeguard          measures where all proposed sub-projects are
evaluated on environmental criteria. When an eligible sub-project      is subject to an EA, the EA will be
carried out by the administration, company or individual carrying   out the subproject, and will have to be
cleared by ANPE for the sub-project to be eligible for funding.   Currently, CPSCL is only responsible for
the environmental aspects of the project up to implementation,      but under PDM m CPSCL will also
assume     responsibility for supervision of the implementation             of environmental aspects of
sub-projects.

A Bank social scientist has verified that there were no land acquisition or resettlement issues under PDM
I and II. The small-scale municipal investments to be financed under PDM       m are not expected to incur
involuntary resettlement or physical cultural property issues  (see GoT environmental assessment of June
2002). The OM will ensure that any such case       would be screened through appropriate environmental
assessment, and dealt with under the provisions of Tunisian          law which provide for due. process,
compensation for any land acquisition, and protection of     cultural heritage. Bank supervision missions
will also monitor any resettlement issues that may  arise during project implementation.

F. Sustainability and Risks

1. Sustainability:

The project will build management and financial capacity of both local governments                and central
government entities as well as help in the transformation of CPSCL               to ensure their long-term
sustainability. Direct technical assistance and long-term training programs will enable adequate       support
to the Project and the sustainability of its objectives. Key factors built in  the framework of the Project
are:

(a)     Preliminary assessment of issues, priorities and needs for training and technical assistance       for
        each of the key stakeholders (CPSCL, DGCPL, DGAR, CNPRCRM,                   and municipalities) will
        help define client-oriented training programs and adequate objectives for consultancy      work.
(b)     A specific set of mandatory actions to help municipalities in vulnerable financial      situation will
        ensure that municipalities will not remain mired in their difficulties.  These actions consist of (i)
        placing municipal budget under administrative supervision, (ii) direct        technical assistance to
        restructure municipal budgets and investment planning, and (iii) mandatory              financial and
        technical management training for municipal staff. These actions will be defined      by a committee
        made up of representatives of the Ministries of Interior and Finance and CPSCL.
(c)     Long-term involvement of the Bank in the financing of CPSCL would be a valuable                sign of
        confidence that would encourage institutional investors to extend credit to CPSCL,        for instance
        in subscribing to bond issues by CPSCL.
(d)     Design of mechanisms for municipalities to improve revenue collection            and strengthen their
        financial capacity to become self-sustaining.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The preparatory study on social impact did not identify any possible controversial aspects. We do not
anticipate any negative impact on municipal personnel as a result of the restructuring plan for the most
financially vulnerable municipalities and municipalities with financial difficulties.
Enforcement of tax laws on recalcitrant tax payers may cause political discontent. This issue will be
carefully addressed through timely information of people coupled with concrete improvements in
municipal services.

                             TUNISIA: MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT                  III

The project objective will be achieved through     two main components:       (i) Capacity-building for the
Municipal Development Fund to provide funding       for municipal investments; and (ii) Capacity-building
for local governments and related central agencies      to deliver and manage services.       Each of these
components comprises a number of activities    to address specific issues identified in the Strategic Context
section of the main PAD document.

Project funding will be provided by IBRD     (48%), Government of Tunisia (20%) and parallel         financing
by AFD (32%).The proposed resources will      complement the required financing for a five year     municipal
investment program (PIC) prepared by the Government        as part of the tenth national development       plan
covering 2002-2006.

Component 1 is designed to strengthen the CPSCL          to provide financing for local investment        on a
sustainable basis.   This will involve legal, structural and financial      reform of the CPSCL and its
transformation into a corporation. Component    1consists of three main subcomponents:

Subcomponent 1.1. Credit Line to the CPSCL      to finance priority municipal investments.     The Bank will
provide a credit line of US$74.9 million equivalent       to CPSCL, along with an AFD credit            line of
US$45.26 million equivalent, and self-financing   of US$72.56 million equivalent over the next      five years
to finance municipal infrastructure subprojects  for a global amount of US$192.72 million Most         of these
subprojects are part of the approved fourth  Municipal Investment Program (PIC). Approved         subprojects
include the following types of investments:

        Construction and maintenance of municipal      infrastructure such as streets and sidewalks, public
        lighting, potable water, drainage and sanitation;
        Land management, including land acquisition and     beautification activities;
        Economic infrastructure;
        Socio-cultural infrastructure and projects;
        Acquisition of equipment and supplies;
        Construction of administrative buildings;
        National Program for Rehabilitation of Low-Income      Neighborhoods;
        Solid waste management;
        Rural council support; and
        Studies.

These projects will be financed by CPSCL    through flexible financing plans, at interest rates  reflecting the
cost of market resources. For investments     in projects listed in the PIC, CPSCL loan       conditions will
depend on the financial situation of the borrower:

        Category 1: 71 municipalities in critical    financial situation, with direct investment program
        significantly reduced and entirely financed    through subsidies. These municipalities are being
        restructured to improve their situation and reduce  the overall number within the category.
        Category 2: 61 municipalities which face     financial problems. Their direct investment program



                                                   - 33 -

         has also. been reduced and will be financed as follows: 10% self-financing, 43-53% subsidies,
         and 37-47% loans. These municipalities are also to be restructured to improve their situation and
         reduce the overall number within the category.
         Category 3: the remaining 128 municipalities whose financial situation does not call for specific
         financial measures. Their direct investment program will be thus financed under the common
         scheme: 30% self- financing, 33% subsidies, and 37% loans.

CPSCL loan conditions, defined by decree, determine the rate and maturity of the loan based on the
nature of the investment. These vary from 6% interest rate and 7 year maturity for goods and equipment,
to 8.5% and 10 years for economic projects. The average interest rate for infrastructure financing is 7.5%
with a 15 year maturity. This decree will be modified to give more flexibility to CPSCL and allow it to
reflect the cost of its resources, for at least its non PIC loans.

Subcomvonent 1.2. Credit line to finance microprojects:            The CPSCL will also contribute to the
financing of community microprojects under GESCOM.                  Beneficiaries will provide 10% of the
financing, 70% will be provided in grants (up to 90% for cities in financial difficulty) and the remaining
20% will be in the form of a CPSCL loan. Again, the loans will be offered to the municipalities at a
7.5% interest rate over 15 years.

Subcomponent 1.3, Institutional Stren,ethening of the CPSCL to support its transformation into an
autonomous, effective and financially viable institution. This includes:

         Modification of the CPSCL legal status;
         Implementation of an IT development plan
         Training and technical assistance to improve account management
         Strengthening the 5 regional branches through equipment, computerization, improving the
         coordination with headquarters and relations with the municipalities
         Strengthening of the environmental management during evaluations for subproject financing.

The Government of Tunisia will provide its counterpart contribution to all sub-components. AFD and
CPSCL will co-finance subcomponent 1.3; the Bank, AFD and CPSCL will co-finance the subcomponent
1.1; and the Bank and GoT will co-finance the subcomponent 1.2.            Annex 3 provides the detailed
financing arrangements.

Project Component 2- US$3.99 million

                       Institutional and Policy Reforms Associated with the Project

Recent projections show that tunisian municipalities are expected to face significant difficulties in
mobilizing adequate financial resources, jeopardizing local govemments' efforts to finance, deliver and
maintain infrastructure and services to the local populations. In the forthcoming fourth PIC, the
municipalities are divided into three categories, based on their financial health:

         Municipalities in vulnerable financial situation: currently 71 municipalities are in a vulnerable
         financial status and are not able to borrow to finance investments. Their investment programs
         will be reduced to absolute priorities which will be financed through 100% subsidies.
         Municipalities in difficult financial state:     currently 61 municipalities are facing financial
         problems. Depending on their situation, their investment programs will also be reduced and will
         benefit from a modulated financing plan.
         Normally functioning municipalities: this includes the remaining 128 municipalities in a sound
         financial situation.

In line with the GoT objectives of strengthening municipalities and ensuring CPSCL autonomy, the
project will address these issues. Taking into account the intertwined approach of both municipalities and
sector institutions, the proposed project will address the structural weaknesses in the sector and
consolidate the progress to date to allow further transformation of both CPSCL and its clients, the
municipalities. At the same time the project will encourage necessary legal reforms. Consequently, the
project's strategy is two-fold:

1.       Allowing the Municipalitiesto move from a vulnerablefinancialsituationto a normalsituation:
         In order to face their increasing needs for investments and operations financing and the limitation
         Df government transfers, the municipalities must increase their financial resources, either through
         borrowing or own resources. In that effect, the PDM m project will participate to the
         improvement of this situation. Therefore, the project will strengthen the technical and financial
         capacity of the municipalities, allowing them to move progressively and sustainably from the
         "vulnerable" category to the "normal" category. On the long run, the most efficient municipalities
         would be able to get access to other sources of funds for their investments, directly to the capital
         market or through a nascent market for municipal loans.

2.       Providingfora sufficient andeffective sourceof investmentfunds:
         In parallel, CPSCL may not be able to respond adequately to future increasing demand from the
         municipalities due to managerial and financial constraints. In that effect, while CPSCL growth is
         dependent on improvement in the local government finance framework, it will also require a
         number of institutional, managerial and financial changes.

The Municipal Development m Project will support and be carried out in conjunction with a number of
institutional and policy reforms.       These include: (a) revision of the Municipal Organic Law; (b)
modification of the texts ruling Local Finance; (c) sustained increase of FCCL; (d) introduction of
adequate administrative improvements in the CNPRCRM and (e) transformation of the CPSCL into an
autonomous agency.

Revision of the Municipal Organic Law. By order of the President, the Ministry of Interior has embarked
on a revision of the Municipal Organic law to better support decentralization.
The Municipal Management and Finance Study initiated by the Bank has identified a number of themes
that should be taken into account during the Project implementation:


                                                     - 36 -

*    Precise definition of the responsibilities and necessary capacity of municipalities;
*    Lightening the central oversight of local governments by reducing the      volume of required approvals
     and potentially establishing a legal means for local governments       to challenge central government
     infringement on their authority;
*    Establishment of the legal framework for local government         service provision and incentives for
     delegation of such services; and
*    Incentives for inter-city cooperation.
The project includes specific activities to support two of these        themes:    improvement of the legal
framework for local government service provision and incentives      for inter-city cooperation.
It is expected that the Municipal Organic Law will be revised before December       31, 2006.

Modification of the texts ruling Local Finance. A local finance      reform instituted in 1997 has begun to
show results. The Government has emphasized the need for further       improvements in instituting a number
of measures to improve the rate of recovery for local taxes.

Along with this initiative, the Municipal Management and      Finance Study identified a number of steps to
improve local resource mobilization that fall within two       main themes: (a) to better understand and
incorporate the tax-paying capacity of the population       and reinforce tax equity; and (b) to enable the
evolution of local finances.       Specifically, the study initiated by the bank made the following
recommendations:

*    Real Estate Tax (TIB): (i) consider differential rates per square      meter for buildings according to
     location (i.e. lower in poorer areas, higher in wealthier areas); and (ii) enable cities to determine for
     themselves the services to be covered by this tax base, in          order to fund services for which
     cost-recovery is not possible;
*    Business Tax (TCL): increase the tax ceiling to increase     tax recovery from large companies whose
     local branches may not reflect their real business turnover;
*    Indirect Taxes: indirect taxes could be an important source    of revenues, however they are currently
     too numerous and difficult to collect. The reform should       focus on reducing the number of taxes,
     particularly those which cost more to collect than the revenues        they generate, and simplify the
     framework of those taxes to be retained so that they can  be assessed and collected more easily;
*    User fees: a reform of user fees should concentrate on defining   the general framework and principles
     by which fees would be charged for services (i.e. types   of services amenable to cost recovery, equity,
     financial equilibrium, etc). With guidance from the central    government, cities should be free to set
     user fees for the services that they provide, to define thecollection methods and adapt the fee levels
     to the need for financing and consumer capacity to pay.

The modifications of the texts ruling Local Finance should be    introduced before December 31, 2006.

Sustained increase of FCCL: To encourage local governments to          improve their fiscal capacity, central
government transfers should at least remain at their current level.   The State effects part of its transfers to
local governments through a Local Government Communal Fund           (FCCL). For the period 2000-2002, the
State increased the amount of funding for the FCCL annually.          It has committed to continuing these
annual increases over the period 2003-2005. However, the minimum          central government transfer should
be guaranteed. This guarantee may take several forms: it could     for example be indexed on the amount of
the national budget or tied to levels of certain types ofrevenue,  or any other kind of measures.

The allocation of FCCL funding could be revised according          to the fiscal situation of different cities,
particularly in response to project initiatives (restructuringof cities in financial distress, improvement of


                                                     -37 -

 city management, improvement in tax assessment and collection, tax role computerization, etc). In
 addition, reallocation could take account of the following recommendations:

*    Reduce the amount of the Fund earmarked for special initiatives. Currently, 25% of FCCL funding is
     earmarked for certain initiatives. This earmarked amount represents approximately 10% of municipal
     operating resources and might be better targeted if given directly to the municipalities;
*    Allocate a portion of the Fund to help defray operations costs for cities in distress. This amount
     should be included in the restructuring plans for these cities;
*    Review the Fund apportionment criteria to improve the equity and efficiency of central government
     transfers. This review should take account of experience since the reform and include simulations of
     different allocation scenarios.

The FCCL revision guarantee should be in place before 2006, along with the reallocation of Fund
proceeds.

Improvements of the CNPRCRM.            The project aims to strengthen the CNPRCRM to become more
autonomous in its strategic decisions and management, as well as to significantly improve its
client-orientation in delivering adequate and operational assistance and training to the municipalities.
Despite the recommendations of a strategic study on the evolution of CNPRCRM (financed under the
PDM II) which recommended the transformation of the CNPRCRM into an EPNA (EtablissementPublic
Non Administratif), the Government considered premature to authorize such changes. The Tunisian
Government however accepted to:

*    Review the Law which created the CNPRCRM, in order to promote its role and to provide
     complementarity    between recruitment      and training. It will also allow municipal           elected
     representatives and other actors concerned by municipal and regional action to participate in training
     activities.
*   Adopt a decree which will strengthen the role of the CNPRCRM's management committee, and
    deepen the issue of the creation of a scientific committee.
*   Create a planning and evaluation unit which will have eventually a computer office to improve
    CNPRCRM's organization and functions. The Bank recommends the implementation of an analytical
    accounting to improve the Training Center's management.
*   Increase the participation of the municipalities to the training costs, in compliance with the adopted
    categories of municipalities. Thus the municipalities which have a sufficient financial capacity will
    pay the same proportion, and the State will pay for the totally subsidized municipalities.
*   Study the issue of the teachers' remuneration in order to increase their fees.

Those administrative improvements should be approved by the mid-term review of the project.

Transformation of the CPSCL into an Autonomous Agency. The project aims to strengthen the CPSCL
to become self-sustaining and provide long-term financing to municipalities. This is to be done in three
phases, supported by the project, through capacity-building activities and extension of lines of credit for
municipal investments and community microprojects.

Phase I consists of revision of loan conditions and CPSCL-municipal loan arrangements. These revisions
are necessary to address the different needs of the three classes of city (according to financial status) and
to accommodate implementation of the Annual Investment Program. Specific revisions will render the
CPSCL more like a regular financial institution by enabling it to refuse to lend to a municipality judged
not creditworthy and to bill interest on late payments. This will promote better management and fiscal
responsibility among the cities and within the CPSCL; it will enable cities in good financial standing to


                                                    - 38 -

access additional funding and permit   CPSCL to lend to other types of clients       operating in the local
development sector, at market rates.

Phase II involves CPSCL's incorporation   of its accumulated reserves as a step  towards its transformation
into a limited enterprise. This will beaccompanied by a separation of accounting     for loans and for State
grants. The project will finance a studyto define the steps needed to effect  the change in the legal status
of the agency.

Phase III comprises the actual transformation     of CPSCL into a limited enterprise       to give it more
operational latitude, secure its own funding and attract partners to bolster its position through access to
other sources of funding than those provided by donors.

At Mid-Term review the municipalities'    financial situation will be assessed (key performance indicator
2.a). Depending upon the result of thisevaluation, the Phase m will be launched    and will be expected to
be completed by June 30, 2006.

                                    The FourthMunicipal Investment Plan
                              (Component of the Tenth National Development Plan)

 Tunisia is currently implementing its Fourth Municipal Investment Plan (Programmed'investissement
 communal- PIC) which covers the period 2002 - 2006. The Ministry of Interior developed this PIC in a
 fairly transparent manner. In each municipality, the projects are discussed among civil society, local
 administrative services and elected representatives. The 5 year program, which prioritizes the proposed
 investments, is then discussed at advertized opened meeting and adopted by the municipal council. From
 there, it is sent to the different ministries in charge of local development (Interior, Finance, Economic
Development), which verify the ability of the municipalities to finance their projects by borrowing from
CPSCL, and which develop a global financing plan for the program with the amount of subsidy available
from the Central Government.

As explained earlier, for the new PIC, the Tunisian Government has created three categories of
municipalities, based on their financial health: (i) Municipalities in financial distress (71 municipalities),
(ii) Municipalities in a weak financial situation (61 municipalities), and (iii) Normally functioning
municipalities(remaining 128 municipalities). In developing the new PIC, the investment requests from
municipalities in financial difficulty have been reduced to absolute priorities. However, this is offset by
larger Central Government subsidies for their planned investments.

The table below describes the global financing plan for the Fourth PIC by the three categories of
municipalities. The global municipal investment program for 2002-2006 amounts to DT 888.6 million, of
which DT 787.5 million is for new planned investments. These new investments will be financed by (i)
the municipalities themselves for DT 155.9 million (19.8%), (ii) Central Government subsidies of DT
177.9 million (22.6%), (iii) select central agencies ( tourism development and sewerage) for DT 189.2
million (24.0%), and (iv) CPSCL loans for DT 264.5 million (33.6%). This last amount represents the
US$ 194.22 million which finances sub-components 1.1 and 1.2 . The Donor financing amounts to US$
120.52 million, of which the Bank will provide the equivalent of DT 104.5 million and AFD will finance
the equivalent of DT 63.6 million. The Bank's credit line to CPSCL will thus represent 13.26% of the
new municipal investments.

                                          ECONOMIC ANALYSIS


 A - Macro-economic Framework

Tunisia's economic performance over the past decade has been underpinned by prudent macroeconomic
policies with an overall fiscal deficit now reduced to 3.3 percent of GDP. The monetary stance has been
prudent, and the exchange rate management fairly flexible. The growth of monetary aggregates has
gradually been brought into line with nominal GDP growth, with inflation declining to around 3 percent.
The Central Bank has now been allowed to undertake open market operations; it has also discontinued its
policy of financing all liquidity needs of commercial banks, encouraging thus a more active use of the
inter-bank money market. Thanks to the flexible management of the exchange rate, supported by capital
controls, the authorities have managed to prevent a significant real appreciation of the currency vis-a-vis
Tunisia's trade partners. Overall GDP growth estimated at 5.2 percent in 2001 is projected to decrease to,
3.5 percent in 2002 as result of slowdown in the world economy, particularly in the Euro zone and with
regard to the tourism sector.

Aware of these challenges, the authorities are pursuing adjustment efforts through policies aimed at
increasing domestic savings, productivity and efficiency, and easing the transfer of technology. They
seek to contain the budget deficit through tighter expenditure control, strengthening of the tax base and
better monitoring of the finances, performance and efficiency of public enterprises. Tunisia's economic
fundamentals are expected to remain strong in the medium term. To achieve the goals of the 10th
Development Plan (2002-2006) - an average annual growth rate of 5.7 percent and an increase in per
capita income of 4.8 percent - the Government recognizes the need to maintain a sound and stable
macroeconomic framework, which is critical within an increasingly liberalized external environment that
requires greater reliance on international financial market. External financing is expected to be mobilized
on the international bond markets (this can be done at favorable spreads as the country continues to enjoy
a good credit rating). The authorities' commitment to implement short-term adjustment measures and
medium-term structural reforms should allow Tunisia to attract larger amounts of FDI.

The Government reform program essentially aims at: (i) the progressive dismantling of tariff barriers and
the promotion of a private investment climate that facilitates business creation, operation, and offers
opportunities for private participation (inter-alia by allowing private participation in key infrastructure
sectors - a strategy for private participation in infrastructure (PPI) is currently under preparation with
World Bank support); (ii) the mobilization of finance for private investment by promoting efficient
financial intermediation through competitive and dynamic banking, capital market and insurance sectors;
and (iii) the reduction in cost and improvement in quality of information and communication
technologies which are critical for a modem and open economy. Among the components of the
govemment program (supported by the on-going ECAL E) are: (i) the adoption of a system for
comprehensive information on external debt with an integrated and computerized debt database put in
place in 2001, inter-alia , with a view to improved risk management; (ii) the introduction of active
management techniques for public debt so as to minimize the cost of debt service given increasing
exposure to changing borrowing conditions for emerging market economies and exchange rate
fluctuations; and (i) the establishment of the National Tax Council to ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability, improve efficiency and equity and strive to modernize Tunisia's tax system.

 B - Financial Sector

 Government efforts to foster a competitive financial sector      and ensure adequate financing for private
 investment, are focused on improving the efficiency       of financial intermediation, strengthening capital
 market operations and promoting insurance services.     (Tunisia recently participated in the joint Bank/IMF
 Financial Sector Assessment Program, which should       help determine priorities in terms of financial sector
 reforms in the short and medium term.) In this regard, measures      - which under ECAL II involved laws
 and regulations to improve the quality of banks' loan portfolios    and strengthen their financial viability -
 would be reinforced by actions designed to: (i)       improve financial sector governance through more
 transparent and autonomous management of public       banks, whereby a banks can replace their single board
 of directors with a dual board system composed          of an executive management board (Directoire),
 responsible for the day-to-day administration, and    a supervisory board (Conseil de Surveillance), which
 oversees management; and (ii) promote securities market     development (along an action plan based on the
 recommendations of studies conducted by the Financial     Market Regulatory Authority).

 In the banking sector, financial intermediation is dominated by         commercial banks, which are also
 majority owners of many other financial institutions, including      leasing companies, mutual funds, and
 other stock market assets. The Govemment retains close control           of the three largest public banks:
Banque Nationale Agricole (agriculture), Banque de l'Habitat          (housing), and Societ6 Tunisienne de
Banque (SMEs and PEs). Banking sector soundness improved             in the late 1990s, partly as a result of
actions supported under ECAL II related to public enterprise        debt restructuring and tighter prudential
controls and supervision. However, throughout the         banking sector, the level of nonperfornning loans
(NPLs) remains high (20 percent of GDP) compared to           international standards and raises the cost of
financial intermediation. A significant percentage of NPLs       are secured by real estate, exempting them
from provisioning requirements under central bank regulations.       Given the slow judicial process for real
estate foreclosure and the inertia/reluctance of banks in taking action  against nonperforming borrowers, a
significant amount of banks' assets are not producing      income and not available for reinvestment in the
private sector. Measures are needed to improve banks' lending        decisions that rely more on analysis of
borrowers' repayment capacity and less on collateral-based      lending (which creates a barrier to access to
financing, especially for SMEs, which are less likely to have    real estate collateral). In order to make this
change, banks need access to reliable, transparent information          on borrowers' credit histories and
financial situations. Banks should be encouraged to enforce      their security interests or to protect against
capital erosion by making the required provisions. In recent      years, banks have had an improved fiscal
incentive to provision adequately because provisions    have been tax-deductible up to 75 percent of profits
(this deduction was increased from 50 percent to 75 percent       under ECAL II). Moreover, to strengthen
private sector role and participation, the Govemment     seeks to pursue its disengagement from the banking
sector in a progressive manner, including withdrawal from       two commercial banks, and examination of
alternatives for restructuring or privatizing the six development  banks.

The role and efficiency of the Tunisian capital markets have    in the recent years been enhanced by various
policy measures. Nonetheless, Tunisian companies' recourse       to market finance through equity and bond
issues remains limited, despite strong fiscal incentives    (a reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35
percent to 20 percent). The primary constraints to    the development of the capital markets remain related
to the cost of transparency that a public issue would      imply, and the lack of specialized, independent
operators prepared to promote new products.

The Insurance sector has, over the past decade,        grown in line with the economy but remains less
developed when compared to other countries. A robust insurance        sector is vital to the development of a
strong financial system because insurance companies         are usually the largest institutional investors,


                                                     -44 -

stimulating capital market development        by providing long-term resources       for private investment. In
addition, insurance companies provide     an important social safety net by    protecting individuals and firms
against financial losses due to accidents    or other crises. Areas that would     require further strengthening
relate to the legal and institutional framework, auto insurance, life     and personal insurance, treatment     of
financially distressed insurance companies,    and contractual savings mobilization.


C - Economic Criteriaforsubproiect         selection

The investments financed under the     proposed line of credit will have important     economic benefits, which
include: (a) improvement of public      health and better quality of life    through improved access to water
distribution and sewerage in those    small communities where the national      utilities (SONEDE and ONAS)
do not operate the network, and through      the creation of green spaces within     the communal boundaries;
(b) modernization of urban services    through the expansion and rehabilitation     ofpower and road networks
and the development of distribution     systems: (c) improvement of environmental         conditions through the
consolidation of the solid waste    collection system (quite developed      in Tunisian urban centers) and the
promotion of solid waste treatment and disposal.

The CPSCL has adopted a set of economic         criteria for eligibility of projects that were agreed upon with
the World Bank. Such criteria      differ according to the sector concerned.       They can be summarized as
follows:

         (a)     for all eligible sectors and for all project dimensions, different mutually exclusive     project
                 alternatives need to be compared and         the least-cost solution chosen. Environmental
                 considerations need to be taken into    consideration even if not qualified    or quantifiable;
         (b)     for each communal service, a cost-recovery       scheme for operation and maintenance      needs
                 to be agreed upon and submitted, with       clear indication of the coverage of     costs by the
                 budget and by the users;
         (c)     for revenue-generating activities, the       financial internal rate of return needs       to be
                 calculated and be larger than 10%; and
         (d)     for subprojects larger than TD 1million,       a financial and economic rate of return    of 10%
                 is required.

The operational manual defines in     detail, by sector, which benefits    are to be considered, the costs to be
included in the calculation, and the methodology      to be used. Drawing from the experience       of the years of
activities under these guidelines, the    following modifications have been introduced         in the Operational
Manual and in particular in the Practical       Guidelines distributed to communes         for the preparation of
financing requests for the subproject      indicated in paragraph 2 (c) and       (d) above:     (a) more careful
estimate of demand is carried out, taking     in consideration the past trend for    all significant variables; (b)
sensitivity analysis is required for any  financial and economic evaluation, and      sensitive variables are used
as indicators and are monitored during       supervision of projects; and (c)      more attention is paid to the
market studies for revenue-generating     activities.



D - Financial aspects of the CPSCL



The CPSCL has shown strong growth          over the course of the Ninth National      Development Plan (1997 -
2001) and the corresponding Third      Municipal Investment Plan. Over        this period, the CPSCL disbursed
DT 270 million in loans (DT 55 million      per year) and DT 154 in grants and       its balance sheet showed an

 average annual growth of 13%.

 Generatly favorable trends. The evolution of CPSCL accounts            has been generally favorable over the
 period.
         Reduction in use of own funds in financing loans and grants, although still        representing 30% of
 the balance sheet;
         Steady growth in transaction fee profits, becoming positive in 1999 and growing         1.8% in 2001;
         Commensurate growth in net bank proceeds, service activity and transaction           fee profits (DT 12
 million in 2001);
         Decreasing average annual operation costs: although showing an increase            up to 1999 with the
 establishment of regional branches, they have fallen from 21% of the budget to 16.6% in        2001;
         Achievement of a satisfactory level of profitability by CSPCL (net profits      exceeded DT 7 million
for the past two years). This is tempered by the fact that it does not include          its reserved stock in its
accounting and does benefit from free financing through grant management;
         Improvement in management of unpaid loan accounts: unpaid loans have              returned to the 1998
level (3.5% of loaned funds) after a consolidation in arrears in 1999. Although they        tend to be late, most
loans are repaid eventually (97% of those due in 2000 were paid by the end of 2001).          In addition, unpaid
loans are concentrated both by size and borrower (10 loans account       for half of the unpaid total); most are
loans to cities that should be able to mobilize their own finances to cover               their Tenth National
Development Plan investments.

However, the CPSCL still needs to better manage its cash account.                 During the Ninth National
Development Plan, liquid assets fell from DT 15 million to DT 0.5 million.         It tried to optirnize the cash
account by keeping it at a high level through grant fund management, however          it was forced to consume
its liquid assets when its loan rates were upgraded and municipalities borrowed        heavily at the end of the
Ninth Plan period. The CPSCL borrowed DT 18 million at the             beginning of 2001 to restore its liquid
assets. This will have to be managed carefully over the Tenth Plan by defining        liquid assets according to
a calculation ofneeds for circulating capital.

Recommendations.        CPSCL' s financial projection model must be simplified and validated to become          a
useful internal and extemal tool. As it stands, initial projections show maintenance          or improvement in
profits and the cash account. In addition, CPSCL should:
1. Improve its accounting system to calculate interest by actual date of              settlement    and separate
    interest and principal for unpaid loans, consistent with normal financial    institution procedures;
2. Improve its financial management by employing an assets-liabilities-management                 tool. This will
    allow it to adjust its resources according to use and its tariff structure for investments    outside the PIC
    (as a means of diversifying its services). It would also enable CPSCL to maximize           the benefits and
    limit the costs ofgrant management for the State;
3. Improve transparency by utilizing clients-rating. This will provide useful            infornation to CPSCL
    analysts and supervisory bodies (administrators, oversight and accounting officials)          in the form of
    weighted quantitative data on municipal financial positions. It is easy      to establish with the existing
    data tracking system.

    increases significantly, and should easily meet the dated covenant     ratios. However, the 2002-2006
    projections will be achieved under the following conditions:   (i) the administrative expenses are kept
    under control, (ii) the arrears do not increase more than planned, and (iii) the intermediation margin
    remains superior to 1.5% and increases to more than 2.0% at the end of this period.
    An asset-liability management system has to be implemented   by CPSCL to monitor the liquidity and rate
    risks during this period.

departments, namely CNPCRM, DGCPL,          DGAR and GESCOM. It will also       finance the procurement of
goods (including computer equipment     and accessories) and civil works  for infrastructure subprojects
submitted to the Caisse des Prets et Soutien aux Collectivites Locales  (CPSCL) by local communities or
regional entities. These subprojects  have not been appraised and estimates   for the breakdown of project
expenditures by procurement categories   may vary, since the loan consists  mainly of a line of credit from
the World Bank to the Caisse.

2.       The current procurement procedures     in Tunisia are governed by the Code   des Marches publics.
Four levels ofTender Boards have    authority, each with its own set of thresholds for works, goods, and
consulting services. The National Tender    Board (Commission superieure des     march6s), within the office
of the Prime Minister, will review all tender documents for works valued    at 5.0 millions TND or more,
for goods valued at 2.0 millions or more, and for consulting services  valued at 200,000 TND or more.
Various Department Tender Boards      (Commissions .dpartementales des    marches) review tender
documents valued above 3.0 millions,    500,000 and 100,000 TND respectively      for works, goods, and
consulting services. Regional Tender Boards      (Commissions regionales des marches)    set up in each of the
24 Govemorates have authority for    projects valued above 1.0 million, 200,000   and 50,000 TND
respectively for works, goods, and consulting    services. Local Tender Boards (Commissions      locales des
marches) are set up in larger municipalities,  with an annual budget of more than   2,0 million DT, for all
other projects.   Standard rules apply to all tender boards through the Code des Marches     publics, but
their interpretation may vary from  one board to another.

3.       The Caisse has financial autonomy      but is nevertheless subject to the authority  of the National
Tender Board for the procurement    of larger projects. The Caisse's own   Operations Manual describes the
various procurement methods to be used     and the applicable thresholds: these   were reviewed by the Bank
during project preparation and found    adequate, with a few revisions that should     be incorporated in the
final version.    Ex-post reviews during previous      projects have shown that the Caisse      has adequate
procurement capacity and its staff,    both at the headquarters in Tunis     and in the regional offices, is
competent and familiar with the Bank's   procurement procedures.

4.       Although there is no recent CPAR for Tunisia,    experience on past projects has shown   that by and
large procurement procedures are acceptable,     with a few exceptions, most notably  the stated preference
for national contractors, suppliers and consulting firms often to the exclusion  of international firms. The
Caisse will ensure that its borrowers will adhere with the following modifications    to current practices
(that may not necessarily be in line with the Code des marches publics):

         Interested foreign contractors willbe allowed to participate in NCB.
         No less than 30 days will be allowed   for submission of bids.
         The current system of dual envelopes      for civil works or goods may      be maintained, but both
         envelopes will have to be opened   at the same time and in public.
         Bids for civil works and goods will   be opened in public on the same   day and at the same time as



                                                     - 51 -

         they are due.
 *       Bidders will be allowed to submit their bids either by post sending   or by bringing it personally.
 *       Bids will be evaluated on the price basis and on other criteria stipulated in the bidding documents
         and quantified in monetary terms, no preferential treatment will          be applicable to national
         companies.
 *       The contract will be awarded to the lowest qualified bidder.

 Use of the Bank's Guidelines and Standard Bidding Documents

 5.       Procurement for works and goods in the proposed project will be    carried out in accordance with
the World Bank's Guidelines:ProcurementunderIBRD            Loans andIDA Credits,published in January
 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and January        1999, as well as the
provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The Bank's standard       bidding documents will be used for
all procurement of goods and civil works under International Competitive Bidding       (ICB). National
standard bidding documents may be used for all other procurement of      goods or works. These documents
have been found to be generally acceptable and the Caisse will oversee     their use by its borrowers.

6.       It is not expected that any civil work project will be large enough to warrant  the use of ICB
procedures, although foreign contractors will not be prevented from bidding     on any single project. The
experience of the first two Municipal Development Projects has shown that without        exception the
contracts for civil works were relatively small, with no contract having   ever exceeded the equivalent of
US$ 1.5 million. Sub-projects were furthermore dispersed all over      the country and implemented by a
large number of local or regional authorities. It is expected that the 3rd  Municipal Development Project
will be no exception and that no contract will exceed the equivalent of    US$ 3.0 millions. It would not be
feasible to group individual civil works contracts into large packages   with a view to attract international
bidders.

7.       There is no foreseen need for pre-qualification of bidders, given the simple  nature of the works to
be done. Small contracts for civil works evaluated at the equivalent ofUS$ 150,000       or less will be
tendered based on the standard bidding documents of the Bank for Small       Works. These works will be
carried out mostly under unit rate contracts, but also under lump-sum or fixed-price    contracts, awarded to
the lowest bidder on the basis of quotations obtained from at least three  qualified contractors in response
to local advertisement. The bidding documents shall include a detailed description      of the works,
including basic specifications, the expected completion date, an example     of a contract acceptable to the
Bank, and relevant drawings where applicable.

8.      The Caisse will encourage efforts made to identify small contractors andjobbers,      including
advertisement at the community level, coordination with other governmental and       non governmental
agencies, and information sessions with local associations of contractors.   Utilization of local manpower
will be sought, although this will not be a prerequisite for awarding a contract.

9.       All contracts for goods evaluated at the equivalent of US$ 600,000 or more will     be awarded
following ICB procedures. The Caisse will try to package the acquisition     of goods into large contracts
(more than US$ 600,000), in order to attract the interest of foreign suppliers  for vehicles and computing
and communication equipment in particular. Advertisement for       such contracts will be published on an
as-needed basis in the UN Development Business, as well as in foreign      specialized publications, in
addition to local advertisement. The Caisse will ensure that the most   recent standard bidding documents
of the Bank will be used for such contracts.




                                                    - 52 -

10.      Contracts for goods below the threshold   for ICB may be awarded following      NCB procedures, up
to an aggregate amount of US$ 10 millions.     International Shopping procedures (IS)     will be used for
procuring goods of standard specifications   available off-the-shelf for contracts estimated   to cost less than
the equivalent of US$ 100,000, up to   an aggregate amount of US$ 1.1 million.      This procedure requires
comparison of price quotations obtained    from at least three suppliers from two different   countries.
National Shopping procedures (NS) will     be used for contracts for goods available   off-the-shelf from at
least three capable Tunisian suppliers  for contracts estimated to cost less than  the equivalent of US$
50,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$     400,000.

11.      Procurement for consulting services in   the proposed project will be carried out   in accordance
with the World Bank's Guidelines:Selection     andEmployment ofConsultantsby          World Bank Borrowers,
published in January 1997 and revised   in January 1999, and May 2002. Procurement         of consulting
services will be based on Quality and  Cost Based Selection (QCBS), the Consultants'       Qualifications
(CQ) method and on Selection of Individual     Consultants method, depending on      the scope and nature of
the required consulting services. Single-Source    (SS) selections may be used, provided    they meet the
requirements of paras. 3.8 - 3.11 of the Bank's Consultant Guidelines.

12.      Both the line of credit and technical assistance  and training to the Caisse will make   use of
consultant services. Under the line of  credit, these services will consist of relatively small contracts to
prepare plans and specifications and supervise   the civil works contracts. In the same manner     that the
works will be disseminated across   a large number of local communities and      cannot readily be packaged
into large units, consultant servicesare limited to small contracts. These could     be procured on the basis
of CQ, whereby an invitation is sent to consultants   to express their interest and qualifications  for the
proposed project. The required levels ofqualification     are detailed in the request.

13.      Quality and Cost Based Selection procedures     (QCBS) will be used to select consultants     for the
study, training and technical assistance component    to the Caisse, as well as other agencies   such as
CNPCRM, DGCPL, DGAR and GESCOM.                For consulting contract values above US$       100,000, a call
for expression of interest will be published in UN Development Business, as well       as in one international
and one national publication.

14.      Civil servants may not be selected for  contracts financed under the proposed Loan,      even if they
are currently on a leave of absence, either directly or through a contract with a   national or international
consulting firm for technical assistance, training, or consulting services.

Advertising

15.      As early as possible, a General Procurement        Notice (GPN) will be published in        the United
Nations Development Business (in electronic      format) announcing major procurement       packages for goods
to be procured under ICB procedures and      consulting services valued at US$ 100,000      or more. The GPN
will also be published in the Tunisian   press. The GPN will be updated and        published every year where
there remain major procurement packages.        Specific Procurement Notices (SPN)        will subsequently be
advertised for specific goods procurement      packages subject to ICB procedures        and for all consulting,
contracts values above US$ 100,000.        They will briefly describe the project,      its contents and major
components, as well as the credentials  expected from the bidders. They may       not include any reference to
a system of weights that would be used   to rank the bidders.

16.      Bidding documents shall neither be released,    nor short list of consultants prepared,  before 8
weeks after the GPN has first been published.     SPNs for works and goods will be advertised      in at least
two newspapers of national diffusion.

  Procurement Capacity Building

 17.     Before project effectiveness, the Bank shall carry a procurement seminar aimed at all parties
 involved with the procurement of goods or consulting services for the other beneficiaries, namely
 CNPCRM, DGCPL, DGAR, GESCOM and DGCPL. The objectives of that seminar are (i) to ensure that
 all procurement, whether subject of prior review or not, will be done according to the Bank's Guidelines.
 The modifications to the Tunisian Code des march6s, as discussed above, have been clearly understood
 and will be followed during project implementation.      Following this seminar, the Caisse shall launch a
 series of procurement seminars aimed at its borrowers to inform them, among other things, of the
 Caisse's own requirements for procurement of works, goods, and consulting services. These seminars
 should be followed by a dialogue between the borrowers and the Caisse's regional offices on the actual
 implementation of the updated procurement guidelines.

 Procurement plan

 18.     The Caisse and the DCPDM will prepare a detailed Procurement Plan, based on the project
 components 1.3 and 2 described in Annex 2.

 Procurement Implementation Arrangements

 19.     Primary responsibility for procurement of works, goods or consulting services related to the
 execution of a subproject financed by the Caisse will lie with the local community or its delegated
 agency that will be the recipient of the loan. Since the Caisse can make loans to 260 local communities
 and 24 regional entities, there is a need to ensure that proper procurement procedures will be used in the
 preparation of bidding documents and specifications, bid evaluation and award recommendation, and
contract signing. These procurement procedures will be included in the Caisse's updated Operations
Manual with all necessary details.

20.      The Caisse has agreed that before it confirms its final agreement to a loan to a local community
or a regional entity, it will ensure that proper procurement procedures have been followed. It has also
agreed that it will request an environmental impact study and an economic and financial feasibility study,
showing an ERR (or FRR, as the case may be) of at least 10 percent, for all projects with an expected
cost of one million DT or more. Before it confirms its final agreement to a loan to a local community or a
regional entity, the Caisse shall submit to the Bank for its no objection any subproject whose expected
cost is equal to or greater than the thresholds established for the procurement method to be used or the
need for prior review, as described below.

Procurement Methods and Prior Review Thresholds

21.      The procurement methods and Prior Review Thresholds are listed in Table B: Thresholds for
Procurement Methods and Prior Review for Works, Goods, and Services respectively.

22.      Goods and Works. All contracts following ICB procedures, as well as the first two contracts
under either NCB, Smaller Works, or International / National Shopping procedures, irrespective of the
contract amount, will be subject to prior review. All other contracts will be subject to random ex-post
review during periodical supervision missions by Bank staff.

23.      ConsultingServices, TechnicalAssistance andTraining. All contracts estimated to cost more
than the equivalent of US$ 100,000 with a firm or US$ 50,000 with an individual, as well as all


                                                     -54 -

single-source contracts, will be subject to the Bank's prior  review. Contracts below these thresholds will
be subject to ex-post review by Bank staff during supervision missions.

24.      All other contracts would be subject to post-review and procurement      audit on a random basis by
the Bank. CPSCL will be primarily responsible for preparing the       procurement plan and for monitoring
procurement, including compliance with procedures by municipalities.        As a rule, local consultants will
provide design and supervision of contracts implementation. CPSCL          would be responsible for
maintaining accurate procurement records, including all actions     related to Bank-financed procurement.
This includes advertising, preparation of bids, invitation  to bid, record of bid submissions, bid opening,
evaluation of bids, contract award and performance of the    contracts. CPSCL will maintain procurement
files for review by the Bank's supervision missions. It is expected that    some 15 percent of the contracts
would be subject to prior review, with a total value of US$ 30    millions.

Overall Procurement Risk Assessment

25.      In the previous two Municipal Development Projects in Tunisia,       a problem arose because the
Caisse would only approve a major loan once a municipality had       submitted detailed plans and a budget.
For the municipalities first to submit their projects to the Bank  for its no objection has proven too
cumbersome, intrusive and not applicable. A better course      of action would be to increase the Caisse's
procurement capabilities, so that it can assume greater responsibilities   for project approval.

26.      There is a risk that the Caisse would not take the required steps to  (i) develop a detailed
procurement plan; (ii) hire and/or make available competent     staff to monitor and supervise the
procurement procedures followed by its borrowers; (iii)    cancel a loan if the appropriate procurement
procedures have not been followed to its satisfaction;   and (iv) prepare adequate procurement procedures
for use by all its borrowers, based on the Bank's guidelines   for procurement of works, goods, and
consulting services. These risks are mitigated by updated    version of the Project Implementation Manual
that the Caisse has prepared during project preparation.    Final agreement on all procurement-related
sections of the Caisse's updated Operations Manual     would be accomplished before effectiveness.

Frequency of Supervision Missions

27.      It is proposed that supervision missions be conducted twice     a year and include post review and
audit ofcontracts.

Withdrawals from the proceeds of the loan will be based on the traditional disbursement     methods of the
Bank, using direct payments, requests for special commitments and reimbursement       applications, either
fully documented or using Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) as per applicable     procedures. As projected
by Bank's standard disbursement profiles, disbursements would be    completed four months after project
closure. Disbursements would be made against standard Bank documentation.        Retroactive financing
amounting to Euro 7,600,000 will be permitted under the loan.

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):

All applications to withdraw proceeds from the loan will be  fully documented, except for: (i)
expenditures of contracts with an estimated value of US$200,000 or    less for goods; (ii) expenditures of
contracts with an estimated value of US$100,000 or less for consulting   firms; (iii) US$50,000 or less for
individual consultants training and study tours; and (iv) US$100,000 or  less for sub-loans, which may be
claimed on the basis of Statements ofExpenditures (SOEs). Documentation        supporting expenditures
claimed against SOEs will be retained and will be available for  review when requested by Bank
supervision missions and project auditors. All disbursements will be   subject to the conditions of the
Loan Agreement and the procedures defined in the Disbursement      Letter.


Special account:
At the request of the borrower no Special Account is foreseen under the   proposed loan, as the borrower
plans to submit reimbursement and direct payment applications for expenditures      incurred under the
project.


Financial Management Assessment:

The financial management assessment carried out during project    preparation, indicated that the
accounting and financial management systems of the CPSCL do not       present accountability issues and
meet the requirements of OP/BP 10.02. They can be used to provide inputs      to project accounts and
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) for the project. Improvements      to the systems will be carried out
under the project implementation plan.

Project Implementation




                                                   -59 -

Project Management. Each component will be implemented          by the relevant entity as indicated in the
detailed project description. and overall project coordination   will be assured by the DCPDM in DGCPL,
which is being strengthened with the addition of a Director   and two senior managers. DCPDM will
coordinate implementation of the project in accordance with     the directives of the Steering Committee and
with the Project Implementation Plan (PIP).

Financial Management Arrangements. CPSCL will         be responsible for financial management of all
project funds, including those managed under its   own account and those managed on behalf of the
Government. A management agreement will be established         between the Ministry of Finance and CPSCL
for the financial management of the funds destined for   the institutional strengthening component. The
management agreement will specify the Government's        undertaking to repay the capital and interest of
the subsidiary loan for institutional strengthening,while CPSCL will undertake to keep separate
accounts for each of the implementing agencies. Where      loans to municipalities are concerned, CPSCL
will process payments directly to contractors and third  parties on the basis of payment requests from
participating municipalities. The Financial Director  of CPSCL will maintain project accounts and will
prepare annual Project Financial Statements (PFSs)    and semi-annual Financial Monitoring Reports
(FMRs) in accordance with Bank guidelines for submission       to the Bank. Procedures for accounting and
financial reporting, as well as internal control mechanisms   specific to the Project, will be defined in
writing and incorporated into the Project Implementation Plan. The       main actions to be taken to improve
financial management of CSPCL under the PIP are summarized          below:

*   Organigram.To be updated and formally adopted.
*   Manualoffinancialandadministrativeprocedures.             To be finalized and implemented, including
    procedures to reflect the flow of funds, internal control rules, payment and disbursement procedures,
    the relationship between the CPSCL and external entities     involved in project implementation; and
    reporting procedures and rules.
*   Chartofaccounts. CPSCL's current operational manual          to be updated to commercial accounting
    standards.
*   A computerizedfinancialmanagementsystem            to facilitate production of FMvRs to be generated
    directly by CPSCL and also to enable analyses by components        and categories as well as for
    monitoring and evaluation indicators.
*   Automatic interest calculation. Development of      an automatic system to calculate interest on loans.
*   Internalaudit. Strengthen the internal audit function.

Financial Management Characteristics

Organization of the CPSCL. CPSCL is a public enterprise of a commercial and industrial nature
(EPIC). It is financially autonomous The Finance Director is responsible for finance, budgeting,
accounting and reporting functions. CPSCL's organigram which describes the functions of the various
directorates, needs to be formally implemented.

Financial and accounting policies: CPSCL has an accrual based accounting system. Financial statements
are produced on an annual basis and are subject to external audit. While the financial and accounting
policies are considered satisfactory, the manual of administrative and financial procedures needs to be
finalized and implemented.

Accounting System. The Financial Director of CPSCL is responsible for financial management and
accounting. He maintains the accounting records which enable the issuance of annual financial
statements and semi-annual FMRs. The Financial Director will submit these documents on a timely basis
to the Bank. The overall accounting principles are outlined below:

(a) Records of accounts are maintained under the CPSCL financial management system. These records
reflect detailed transaction flows and provide summaries required for monitoring and evaluation
purposes. Annual financial statements and semi-annual FMRs will be issued based on data from the
records.
(b) Project accounting will cover all sources and uses of project funds. This will include payments
received and expenditures incurred. All project-related transactions will be reflected in the reporting
system. Disbursements made by the World Bank directly and Special Account transactions will be
included in the project accounting system. Counterpart and co-financing funds will be included and
reflected separately in the financial statements and FMRs.

(c) Physical information on key performance indicators that can be readily linked to financial costs will
be maintained as part of the project financial management system. These items will be identified and
indicated in the PIP.

Internal Controls. CPSCL's financial management system includes the following internal control
mechanisms:

(a) Operation of a budgeting system, and regular monitoring of actual financial performance with budgets
and targets;

(b) Operation of simple, clear and transparent financial and accounting policies which govern financial
management and accounting. These policies and procedures will be described in the PIP;

(c) At the transaction level, policies, procedures and systems for ensuring acceptable internal control
mechanisms, such as checking of expenditures, appropriate documentation, levels of authorization,
segregation of duties, periodic reconciliation, physical verification, easy access to supporting
documentation, etc. These policies and procedures are reviewed and updated periodically;

(d) An internal audit function, which needs strengthening; and

(e) A computerized financial management system which will enable the issuance of the annual financial
statementss and semi-annual FMRs.


                                                    -61 -

 Financial Monitoring Reports

FMRs will be prepared by CPSCL and should contain information        useful for CPSCL at the same time as
providing the Bank with information for its purposes, particularly:
*        That project funds have been used for the purposes intended;
*        That project progress is on track; and
*        That expenditures are within budget.

FMRs will be generated from the computerized financial management        system on a semi-annual basis.
These reports will be management-oriented (i.e., summaries    rather than transactional details) and will be
used for project monitoring and implementation. Semi-annual reporting      is consistent with CPSCL's
existing practice, which is geared to its municipal clientswhose resources and reporting capabilities are
severely limited. The FMR format will be designed to meet the    needs of CPSCL and will include the
following three sections:

(a) Financial Statements, including:
     (i)   Summary of sources and uses of funds
     (ii) Uses of funds by project activity
     (iii) Special account statement.

(b) Project progress statements, including output monitoring reports    using contract management
information.

(c)  Procurement management report, including:
     (i)   Contract expenditures report - Goods and works
     (ii) Contract expenditures report - Consultants
     (iii) Procurement management report - Goods and works
     (iv) Procurement management report - Consultants.

Formats of the reports, which will be agreed at negotiations, will be part of the PIP. These reports will
be transmitted to the Bank no later than 45 days after the calendar quarter.

Financial statements will be prepared annually, including: (i) a Statement of Sources and Utilization of
Funds indicating funds received from various sources and project    expenditures; (ii) schedules classifying
project expenditures by components and expenditure categories; (iii)    a Special Account Reconciliation
Statement; and (iv) a Statement of Withdrawals made on the basis     of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).
Audited financial statements will be submitted to the Bank as soon    as possible and not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year.

Audit Arrangements

CPSCL's financial statements are audited by independent auditors     satisfactory to the Bank and have not
been qualified for the past three years. In future, CPSCL  will continue to appoint an auditor acceptable
to the Bank to carry out an annual audit according to the  Intemational Standards of Auditing as issued by
the International Federation ofAccountants, the Bank's Guidelines     (e.g. Financial, Accounting,
Reporting and Auditing Handbook), and specific TORs acceptable       to the Bank. The auditor will express
a professional opinion on the annual project financial statements  including SOEs and the SA balance, and
will submit to the Bank an annual audit report within six  months after the end of each government fiscal
