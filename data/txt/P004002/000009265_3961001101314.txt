MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERULATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPHENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$30 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESI,
FOR THE
ThCHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE
1.      The following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$30 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan would have a term of 20 years including five years grace, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate, and would assist in financing a Technical
Assistance Project for Public and Private Provision of Infrastructure.
2.      Economic Setting gnd Background.  Following a period of adjustment to
severe external economic shocks in the mid 1980s, strong private sector
investment has resumed and is restructuring and diversifying the production base,
substantially enhancing the prospects for sustained and relatively rapid growth.
Large cutbacks in real government spending played a major role in the
government's successful stabilization policies. However, this slowed provision
of supporting infrastructure which is now being outpaced by the recent strong
economic growth. The emerging infrastructure bottlenecks, if unattended, could
threaten prospects for sustained economic growth which holds the key to further
reductions in poverty and improved living standards for Indonesia's people.
Accordingly, the focus of the public sector is now shifting from the management
of expenditure cutbacks to the improved use of existing facilities through close
attention to O&M and the efficient management of a growing level of public
expenditures as well as promoting provision of public services by the private
sector.
3.      The recent pace of economic development has differed markedly from region
to region and from sector to sector, with the most dramatic growth occurring in
the manufacturing sector in West and East Java. This is evidenced by the
proliferation of new factories on the approaches to the major conurbations of
Jabotabek, Bandung and Surabaya, in particular. The manufacturing sector, and
particularly labor intensive industry, is expected to continue to absorb an
increasing share of employment, at higher levels of productivity and income.
However, further rapid industrial growth in the principal urban centers and their
hinterlands will place considerable demands on their infrastructure facilities
and services, notably: electric power, telecommunications and transportation,
together with supporting infrastructure in water supply, drainage and sanitation,
waste disposal and housing. Moreover, without adequate attention to the
environmental consequences of this growth, the financial and social costs to the
business community and population at large are bound to continue to rise
significantly. Already, there are indications, that growth of some chemical
industries is being constrained for lack of environmentally sound arrangements
for wastes disposal.
4.      The government's policy objectives for the 1990s call for a sharper focus
of government spending in four broad priorities: i) recognizing a greater role
for the private sector in economic development; ii) ensuring adequate provision
of basic infrastructure and services to remove constraints on sustained private
sector growth; iii) meeting the needs of impoverished, less developed regions;



* 2 -
and iv) designing and carrying out investments in an environmentally sustainable
and economically efficient manner.
5.      Recent budgetary allocations have been consistent with the above broad
priorities. However, there is still room to improve the efficiency of
expenditures. Improved program and project evaluation and monitoring of public
expenditures within key sectors, including expenditures financed by the private
sector through build, operate and transfer (BOT) schemes, is now an essential and
urgent task. In addition, improved targeting of public expenditures will need to
be complemented by better pricing policies designed to raise revenues, induce
greater efficiency of resource use and improve the equity of public spending and
the quality of the services provided.
6.      With a view to improving the policy planning and evaluation process, the
Government has adopted a guiding framework for infrastructure development (see
Annex 1) which emphasizes: (a) maximizing the efficient use of existing
infrastructure through improved O&i; (b) reducing lead time for expanding
infrastructure networks; (c) promoting transfer of infrastructure
responsibilities from central to regional authorities, state corporations or
private enterprises; (d) improving information flow to policy makers on
infrastructure development needs; and (e) making maximum use of relevant existing
studies in this area.
7.      In the highly centralized and integrated sectors such as power supply and
telecommunications, infrastructure gaps are already reasonably well defined and
remedial measures are underway. In transport and other infrastructure sectors,
the issues are more complex. Whilst impressive improvements in performance and
quality of service of maritime operations have been experienced following the
Government's deregulation initiatives, considerable scope exists for further
improvements, particularly for ports. Measures to improve port efficiency are
therefore a key priority aspect of plans for efficient port expansion. The land
transport system has improved steadily over the past decade through better
planning and increased investments. An action program to improve efficiency
through policy and regulatory reform is being implemented under the Bank-financed
Highway Sector Loan (Ln.3133-IND). A key program issue not yet fully addressed
is planning and evaluation of proposed high capacity roads, particularly on the
approaches to major urban areas. In all of these sectors, there is also an
urgent need to formulate a strategy and create an environment for private sector
participation and to review the environmental impact of the major public and
private sector infrastructure programs now underway.
8.      With a view to mobilizing additional, off-budget investment capital and
management expertise, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) is actively promoting
increased private sector participation in the delivery of public infrastructure
and services and private sector interest in providing public infrastructure and
services has grown considerably in recent years. Private sector involvement in
the energy, telecommunications and road transport sectors is already well
established, and is starting up in the water supply and urban services (solid and
hazardous waste management) sectors. Much remains to be done, however, to define
the framework for private sector participation including public/private joint
ventures and provide an enabling environment and to ensure that potential
efficiency gains in service delivery performance are realized.

9.      Pat Zeriane witb Techical Assistancg-Prolecs.  The Bank's
experience with free-standing technical assistance projects in Indonesia has been
generally good. Five IDA credits were provided from the mid-1960s through the
mid-1980s by which time, much of the needed preinvestment work was being catered
for under project preparation activities of donors and the Government. Project
preparation assistance under these credits was effective 1, in facilitating
investment by the Bank Group and other financing sources which, wich few
exceptions, were appropriate to the economic needs of the time and represented
useful and viable contributions to economic growth. Bank-wide, technical
assistance for institutional development has often proven ineffective because of
a lack of serious commitment by the borrower to the objectives or of adequate
Bank supervision. The institutional development components under free-standing
technical assistance projects in Indonesia, which received less oversight from
GOI and the Bank, were also evaluated as less successful than project preparation
and implementation support related assistance. The impact of policy
recommendations stemming from this institutional development assistance has not
been clearly documented and is uncertain. The recent Study of technical
assistance components of a selection of Bank-assisted projects in Indonesia also
concluded that for the 75% of the financing relating to support for project
preparation and Implementation, technical assistance was largely successful,
though a number of factors including, in particular, the lack of an effective
evaluation system to review consultants' work had impaired the overall impact of
this assistance. Establishment of just such an effective evaluation capability
and system in the National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) is a major task under the
proposed project. Moreover, as indicated in para. 6 above, to demonstrate its
commitment to the objectives of this assistance, GO  has already issued an
appropriate policy framework to guide infrastructure development (see Annex 1).
To ensure adequate supervision, the Bank will allocate sufficient resources.
10.     Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The issue of infrastructure bottlenecks
was first highlighted in the Bank's 1990 Economic Report (No.8455-IND, dated May
4, 1990). Weaknesses in the Government's evaluation system are impairing its
ability to review investment proposals effectively. GO has, therefore,
requested Bank-financed technical assistance to enhance its evaluation capacity
particularly in areas which cut across sectors and cannot be addressed under
existing project activities because they involve, for instance, private sector
participation. BAPPENAS has stressed that the Bank's involvement would help
ensure the technical quality and independence of policy and project reviews.
These technical assistance requirements will involve mainly foreign expenditures
and it is unlikely that other donor financing can be mobilized in line with the
required schedule and flexibility of use to cover the range of sectors and type
of work involved. A series of PPFs would also not be appropriate either, given
that the need is not related primarily to proposed Bank-financed projects in the
near-term pipeline.

Credits to Indonesia by OED (Report No.7156) dated March 10,

11.     Prolect Objectivyes and DescriRtion.  The proposed Infrastructure
Technical Assistance Project would assist the Government, and particularly
BAPPENAS, to applv the framework outlined in para. 6 above. Its basic objectives
are to initiate immediate actions to: (a) assess priorities in current
infrastructure plans for reducing infrastructure bottlenecks; and (b) augment and
enhance pro&ram evaluation capability (including, in particular, in cross-
sectoral linkages and environmental aspects) within BAPPENAS and project
preparation capability in line agencies responsible for key infrastructure
sectors, including projects financed by or jointly with the private sector.
12.     To this end, the loan would provide funds amounting to US$30 million
equivalent to BAPPENAS to finance: (i) Expert Review Panels (ERPs) to review and
evaluate the findings and recommendations of recent and ongoing policy, strategy
and major project preparation studies; (ii) in-house advisory services to
BAPPENAS to help strengthen procedures and methodologies for the evaluation of
investment proposals including BOT and other private sector schemes; (iii) Study
Teams for specific tasks (e.g. institutional performance reviews in the
parastatal sector); (iv) project preparation and engineering design services,
including preparation of bidding documentation, normally to be implemented
through line agencies; (v) conduct of new prefeasibility and feasibility studies
for urgently needed investments--whether identified by completed and ongoing
studies, by ERP panels or by GOI agencies--also normally to be implemented
through line agencies; (vi) equipment and training; and (vii) establishment of a
system for project monitoring and documentation. Studies would include proposed
investments, for example, in high-capacity road links, power generation and
telecommunications services, in which private sector participation could be
sought in a manner which supports the policy interests of the Government and, at
the same time, minimizes the impact on the Government budget. In some cases,
detailed design work would be included as part of preinvestment studies in order
that critical activities, such as land acquisition, can start quickly. Annex 2
provides a full descripcion of the project.
13.     The total project cost is estimated at US$36 million equivalent of which
about US$27.9 million equivalent is expected to be in foreign exchange. The Bank
loan of US$30 million would finance about 90% of total project costs, net of
taxes. Cost estimates uire based on similar contracts presently under
implementation and include: (a) Expert Review Panels - about 1900 person days;
(b) In-House Advisors - about 230 person months; (c) Policy/Institutional Study
Teams - 560 person months; and (d) Feasibility studies and Planning/Engineering
Design work - about 1100 person months. Physical contingencies are estimated at
10% on the cost of equipment and accommodation costs. Price contingencies are
calculated at 6S on local costs and 3.2% on foreign costs for 1991 and
thereafter.
14.     The total project cost and financing plan is shown in Schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B. All
consultant contracts: (a) costing US$200,000 or more; (b) relating to members of
Expert Review Panels; and (c) relating to private sector participation, will be
subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. Retroactive financing
amounting to US$700,000 is provided to meet expenditures made after February 1,
1991 on eligible consultants, contracts for expert panels, in-house advisors and
policy studies prior to loan effectiveness. A timetable of key project



processing events and the status of Bank Loans and Credits in Indonesia are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively.
15.     Agreed Actions.  To underpin the objectives of this assistance, GOI has
already issued a letter (see Annex 1) summarizing its policies guiding
infrastructure development. Agreement was reached at negotiations that
formalizing establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU) will be a condition
of loan disbursements for feasibility studies and planning/design work under the
project. To this effect, a Project Manager has already been appointed by
BAPPENAS and, at negotiations, agreement was also reached on a schedule to
appoint suitably qualified candidates for the other staff positions (Deputy
Project Director; Treasurer/Accountart; Monitoring/Reporting Manager), and GOI
confirmed its intent to finalize appointments immediately. Agreements were also
reached at negotiations on: (a) on the use of standard procurement document
satisfactory to the Bank; (b) the hiring of a firm/entity and use of letters of
appointment, to expedite recruitment of consultants to be selected and to
facilitate the logistical aspects of these services as a means of ensuring timely
project implementation and; (c) disbursement arrangements and project
accounting/auditing and reporting requirements.
16.     Environmental Impact.  Concepts, plans and designs for investment
projects reviewed and developed under the project will fully incorporate
environmental considerations. To this end, environmental criteria would be
included in TORs for all feasibility studies and design work. In addition, the
feasibility studies financed under this project will propose facilities to
dispose of hazardous industrial wastes in an environmentally sound manner.
17.     Benefits and Risks.  The principal benefits of the project will be its
speedy contribution to the formulation of sound investment projects within a
growth-oriented ' 'rastructure development program for the immediate or near
term, and the fas..ioning of appropriate partnerships between the Government and
the private sector in the provision and management of infrastructure systems and
facilities. The project would enhance BAPPENAS' ability to focus on the macro,
crossectoral and strategic issues which need to be addressed in formulating
infrastructure development policies and to set priorities within agreed sector
strategies. As a result, BAPPENAS would be better able to participate
effectively and lead interdepartmental discussions on overall infrastructure
development and sharpen the focus of discussions on priorities and budget
allocations. The emphasis of the project would be on key components of
infrastructure systems which serve the main centers of rapid manufacturing
growth.  These include the major cities of Java, the urban areas which surround
them and the corridors which link them, together with a number of secondary
cities in other regions where infrastructure deficiencies are impairing the
prospects of continued industrial growth. As such, the project would help to
improve the efficiency of public and private investments in the power, railways,
telecommunications, transport, water resources and urban infrastructure sectors.
The proposed project would also provide an opportunity to BAPPENAS and the Bank
to establish streamlined arrangements for the procurement cycle f,'r technical
assistance within existing GOI systems and to monitor their implementation and
impact more effectively. The Project Management Unit to be established to



monitor and coordinate implementation of this project could provide a model for
wider application.
18.     Past excerience indicates that consultants have often not been appointed
expeditiously. To minimize this risk, a Project Management Unit (PHU) will be in
place prior to commencing disbursements on feasibility studies under the Loan.
Establishment of the PMU would also mitigate the risk of inadequate oversight of
supervision of consultants by GOI agencies as experienced in the past. In
addition, and in view of the nature and complexity of many of the policy issues
likely to be addressed under the pro.ject, a clear understanding has been reached
with the Government that experts of a very high calibre will be needed,
particularly for Review Panels as well as the Study Team members that will review
private sector participation in infrastructure development. Also substantial
supervision budget will be provided by the Bank to address potential risks.
19.     Recommendation  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

Pned Tnfrant ittuwp- DptrPlnnMe"  T=b~1n1C8n  hmRm"t.Ann's Pvn4nt,
I refer to your letter of November 22, 1990 concerning the
above  and  wish to confirm that the principles and approach  set
out in the concept paper and the amount of the proposed loan
accurately reflect the Government's intention*.
I would note in this context that the Government recognise
the importance of ensuring that the infrastructure needed to
promote and sustain continued rapld economic growth is developed,
operated and maintained In an efficient and effective manner and
accordingly, that it lays heavy stress on improving further its
capabilities  and  capacity-in the ar*ea  of  policy  formulation,
planing,  program and project evaluation,  and project implemen-
tation. Particular emphasis will be given to tho further develop-
ment of Bappenas as an effective and responsive guidance and
oversight agency.
In pursuing the above goals, the Government Is committed to:
(a) securing the efficient and effective uce of existing
infrastructure, facilities, and services through the
application of soundly-based policies and carefully
managed operations snd maintenanoe;
(b) reducing the lead times between Identifying the need for
new infrastructure capacity and that capacity becoming
available for usel
(a) permitting  the furthei progressive transfer of  respon-
sibilities for infrastructure provision and operation
from central government departments to regional autho-
rities or to state or private enterprices in a manner
which is economically efficient and equitable and which
Is consistent with 4bsorptive capacities;

TECNCL  ASSISTANCE PROJECT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVISION OF INFRASTRUCTURE
TECHNICAL ANNEX
A. Institutional $etting
1.        The National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) was established in
1963 with responsibility for incorporating national development goals into
medium-term (five year) development plans; allocation of resources within the
economy and preparation of the National development expenditure budget;
coordination with donors, mobilization of foreign resources and allocation of
local and foreign-sourced funds to finance the development budget; and monitoring
of major project implementation, etc. The five-year development plans are
indicative in nature, and comprise the targets to be achieved during the plan
period, the macro framework, sectoral policies and programs and an assessment of
resource requirements.
2.        BAPPENAS, which is chaired by the State Minister for Development
Planning, has a vice-chairman, who is also the Junior Minister, and seven
Deputies responsible for groups of economic activity (Economic Development,
Social and Cultural Affairs, etc.). Four (in some cases five) Bureau Chiefs in
charge of sub-sectors report to each Deputy Chairman. Attachment 1 provides an
organizational chart of BAPPENAS. The Chairman, BAPPENAS, reports directly to
the President through the State Secretariat (SecNeg) and as State Minister
reports to the Cabinet through the Coordinating Ministry for Economic, Financial
and Industrial Affairs (EKUIN). This project would largely support the Deputy
for Economic Affairs and four of his five Bureaus (Mining and Power,
Communications and Tourism, Trade and Industry and Business Development and Co-
operatives), who are principally concerned with infrastructure investments. The
project would support BAPPENAS' capacity to review and determine priorities and
allocate resources among competing cross-sectoral and inter-agency planning,
programming and investment proposals related to infrastructure.
B. Project Description
3.        Sub-projects would broadly be divided into four groups:
(a)       Expert Review Panels (ERPs) would be constituted from a pre-qualified
list of individual experts (finance, economics, engineering,
management, legal, etc.). ERPs would mainly be asked to review and
provide opinions on existing reports and policy studies including
output of major policy or sector/cross-sectoral studies, subsectoral
expenditure priorities and financing proposals. ERPs would, in
particular, help oversee the work of study teams reviewing proposals
for private sector participation and pricing policies and projects
with major crossectoral and/or environmental implications. Thus ERPs



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 7
- 17 -
would provide the locus for review of presentations by consultants,
line agencies, private promoters of projects and NGOs involved, and
formulate a consolidated view on issues, policy implications and
development options. ERPs could also be constituted to make
recommendations on particular issues before investment decisions are
taken or for the purpose of getting a second opinion to confirm the
validity of a particular course of action. Pre-selected ERP Chairmen
(local or foreign experts who are recognized and respected in their
field) drawn from a short list of such individuals, would help the
project manager prepare TOR for the individual panels. ERPs are
estimated to provide about 1900 expert days over the project period
and absorb about US$3.3 million equivalent, including all associated
and counterpart support costs;
(b)       In-house Advisers also of expert calibre, would be hired by BAPPENAS
and involved line agencies, to perform specific tasks on agreed TOR
that require longer-term and specialized policy analysis or
expenditure program formulation, or to provide longer-term advice on
administrative and procedural arrangements, e.g. on procurement,
performance monitoring, etc. In-house Advisers would generally be
hired as individuals but some sub-projects may require a team of two
or three advisers. It is not intended that these in-house advisers
substitute for in-house staff or carry out routine bureaucratic
activities. These advisory inputs will, as far as possible, be
fielded only in association with in-house staff released to work
full-time as counterparts. They will be expected to transfer
techniques and methodologies of analysis and process to counterpart
staff without the need for successive contract extensions. TOR will
specifically reflect this requirement. In-house advisers are
estimated to provide about 230 person months at an estimated cost of
US$4.9 million equivalent, including all associated and counterpart
support costs;
(c)       Study Teams would be relatively short-term consultancy assignments:
(i) to prepare sectoral/sub-sectoral strategy recommendations in
support of BAPPENASI preparations for Repelita VI (1994/5-1998/99)
and for mid-course corrections to existing strategies. They would
draw on existing strategy studies and other reports, analysis, etc.
(e.g. for the energy, telecommunications, transportation and urban
services sectors). These studies would be designed and supervised by
the relevant BAPPENAS Bureau; (ii) to evaluate cross-sectoral
linkages related to defined policy issues and investment proposals;
(iii) to prepare proposals for restructuring selected public
enterprises. Such sub-projects would be designed and supervised by
the public enterprise concerned in association with BAPPENAS; (iv) to
review and recommend improvements in pricing policies for key public
infrastructure services; and (v) to advise on arrangements under
consideration by GOI for private sector participation in investment
opportunities, that are linked to or have traditionally been, within
the public sector. All these Study Teams would also have built into
their TOR the counterpart staff and skills transfer requirements as
for (b) above. Study Teams are estimated to provide about 560



ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 7
- 18 -
person-months at an estimated cost of US$11.7 million equivalent,
including all associated and counterpart support costs; and
(d)       En-investment Studies ad               would be traditional
feasibility and project preparation assignments and would be limited
to a few identified priority investment requirements where all
important issues (private/public participation, financing, land,
etc.) have largely been resolved and completion of detailed
engineering could be immediately followed by implementation, whether
public or private. Such sub-projects are expected to be limited and
to be contracted and supervised by the responsible public sector
agency concerned. Total expenditures for this component are
estimated at US$14.0 million equivalent, including all associated and
counterpart support costs;
(e)        auiFaLpmt and Training:  Office equipment (US$200,000) will be needed
to carry out the project. The project would also provide US$500,000
for staff training (excluding on-the-job training) in infrastructure
development policy and management; and
(f)       Project Nonitoring and Administration for which a small Project
Management Unit (PHU) would be established at an estimated cost of
US$1.3 million equivalent. This unit would establish model
monitoring systems for subsequent general use by BAPPENAS and line
agencies for technical assistance activities.
Sub-Project Selection
4.        Outline TOR, implementation schedules and estimated costs will be
submitted to the Bank for prior review. The Bank will expedite its review and
approval process by delegating the Bankes Task Management functions for this
project to the Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI) under arrangements which were
established, and which proved effective, under previous technical assistance
credits to Indonesia.
5.       A representative sample of candidate initial subprojects, which were
selected on this basis and for which TOR have been prepared by BAPPENAS and are
in the Project File, includes:
(a)       advisory services on the restructuring of public enterprises for
divestiture/joint venture;
(b)       advisory services to recommend a financing strategy and pricing
policies for the power sector;
(c)       technical and economic feasibility studies of hasardous and toxic
waste disposal facilities for Jakarta and Surabaya for the
preparation of detailed proposals (technical, financial, and
institutional including, in particular, ownership and management) for
the development and subsequent operation and supervision of the
facilities;



ANNEX 2
Page 4 of 7
- 19 -
(d)       a study to develop general guidelines and criteria to assist
government to seek and evaluate soundly based and mutually beneflcial
proposals for securing effective and efficient private sector
participation in the provision of public infrastructure servLces and,
based on these, more specific model guidelines for a range of
potential types of private sector iLvolvement in the electric power,
telecommumications, water supply and transport sectors;
(e)       an individual *in-house- advisor to assist BAPPENAS and the Ministry
of Communications with the formulation of pollcy, strategy and
programs for the developaent of the transport sector during Repelita
VI and beyond;
(f)       a panel of expert advisers to review and assess the findings and
recommendations of recent and ongoing studies concerning polLcy and
strategy for addressing urban passenger and freight transport needs
In the Jakarta metropolLtan area (Jabotabek) and, based on this
review, to produce succinct and clearly defined recommendations,
including a medium-term action plan; and
(g)       advisory services to assist BAPPENAS to develop and implement simple
systems and procedures, designed to be maintained by line agencies,
for establishing a database on past, ongoing and proposed TA services
(including information on the adequacy and usefulness of the services
and on subsequent follow-up actions) and providing a basis for
monitoring the officiency of TA procurement and executLon;
6.        A matrix incorporating a more extensive list of candidate subprojects
to be undertaken under the project and comprising contracted individuals, expert
review panels, study teams and conventional consulting assignments is illustrated
at Attachment 2.
C. PQrject Iplementation and Management
Prolject Management
7.       As mentioned earlier, BAPPENAS will establish a Project Management Unit
(PMU) under the Bureau Chief for Communications and Tourism (who has been
designated directly by the Chairman, BAPPENAS, to manage the project and will
report directly to him, where necessary). The Project Manager, who is very
familiar with Bank's procedures and practices, will be assisted by a full time,
seconded, GOI officer together with a Monitoring/Reporting Manager and a Project
Treasurer/Accountant. The PMU will be supported by contracted professional and
support staff, as necessary, and satisfactory office space and facilities
including to service ERPs and other advisory services. The project would finance
all contracted support staff, facilities and service contracts necessary to
manage the project efficiently. Management and monitoring and impact evaluation
review systems would be developed, with consultant assistance, for pilot
implementation under the project and general application to technical assistance
activities in Bappenas and line agencies. Agreemnt was reached at negotiations



ANNEX 2
Page 5 of 7
- 20 -
that establishment of the PMU will be a condition of loan disbursements for
feasibility studies and planning/design work under the project.
8.        Bankc Su=ervision:  In view of the range of activities and the need for
flexibility, individual subprojects will be approved through periodic
consultations between GOI and the Bank. As in past technical assistance projects
in Indonesia, the Director of RSI will be authorized to approve subprojects on
behalf of the Bank and RSI will be responsible for coordinating project
supervision. Bank review of subprojects will include procurement plans.
However, in view of the range and nature of technical assistance expected to
financed under the project, considerable inputs are likely to be required from HQ
staff and consultants, particularly in the areas o. private sector participation
including efforts to restructure and divest public enterprises and to review
subprojects in the power and telecommunications sectors. Proposals will be
evaluated by RSI in consultation with Bank staff in Washington and consultants,
as required.
Project Costs and Financing
9.        The overall project cost is estimated at US$36 million equivalent
including local taxes amounting to US$3.0 million equivalent. Detailed costs for
each individual sub-project cannot be closely estimated at this time. However,
major cost categories are estimated as follows at:
u $Milli2n
a)    Expert Revenue Panels                                       3.3
b)    In-House Advisors                                           4.9
c)    Policy/Institutional Study Teams                           11.7
d)    Feasibility, Planning/Design work l                        14.0
e)    Training                                                    0.6
f)    Equipment                                                   0.2
g)    Administration b                                            1.3
These cost estimates reflect costs of similar contracts presently under
implementation. The types of sub-projects selected for financing under the
project and the quality of the inputs necessary will determine the fee and
person-month rates to be used. Allowances have also been made for price
contingencies as follows: 6% on local costs and 3.2% on foreign costs for 1991
and thereafter. The project will finance approved sub-projects on a first come
first served basis as they are prepared for implementation with the proviso that
sub-projects under para. 9 (d) above will be limited to US$11.9 million
equivalent of Bank financing. An understanding to this effect was reached at
negotiations. The Bank Loan of US$30 million equivalent would finance about 91%
of total estimated project costs net of taxes. GOI's share in project costs will
mainly be in kind in the form of counterpart staff and in facilities and services
Al     excluding taxes and contingencies

Vt     Contracts for support services to the P W

provided to manage and implement the project. These are difficult to estimate
since, apart from BAPPENAS' own staff time and services, the project would, as is
usual with BAPPENAS activities, draw heavily on staff time and services from the
line Departments and Agencies.
Procurent and Disbursement
10.     Technical assistance provided under the project will be procured in
accordance with Bank guidelines as follows: (i) ERPs will be constituted for each
selected review from a pre-qualified list of local and international experts
identified by BAPPENAS and agreed by the Bank. This list can be supplemented
from time to time in consultation with the Bank. Individual fee levels and
overhead expenses will be negotiated to reflect the nature and length of the
assignment and level of expertise required. The Bank will assist BAPPENAS to
identify suitably qualified candidates, if requested; (ii) In-house Advisers and
Advisory teams would also be constituted in a similar manner, but with possible
candidates for each assignment being identified by BAPPENAS and involved sector
agencies and a candidate or team being selected from an agreed short list. Fee
levels and overheads would also be negotiated for each such sub-project; (iii)
Study Teams would be procured from short lists of at least three, and no more
than six, reputable consulting firms with sector experience. These short lists,
based on the type of work required and the associated TOR and Letters of
Invitation, would be agreed with the Bank; and (iv) Feasibility Study and
Engineering consultancies for project preparation will also be procured from a
short list of at least three, and no more than six, reputable firms with proven
experience in the type of work involved. TOR and Letters of Invitation for these
assignments will be submitted to the Bank for prior approval.
11.     In order to expedite the procurement process and enable the Bankes
supervision resources to concentrate on policy and technical aspects of sub-
projects, prior procurement reviews will be reduced to a minimum as described
above. Ajreement was reached at negotiations that a simple letter of appointment
will be used for short-term consultants including ERP members, in particular.
All sub-projects for ERPs, Advisers and Study Teams will follow the procedures
described in para 3 (a) and (b) above. Consulting contracts costing US$200,000
equivalent or fifteen person/months or less will be subject to post review by the
Bank. All consulting contracts costing more than US$200,000 equivalent as well
as consulting contracts related to ERPs and to private sector participation will
be subject to prior review by the Bank. Model documentation acceptable to the
Bank will be utilized for the Letter of Invitation and for Consultants'
Contracts. Total cost of the computers and office equipment would be US$200,000.
Therefore they can be procured either following local competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to the Bank and through prudent shopping on the basis of
price quotations from at least three suppliers.
12.     The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed against 100% of the total
costs of all contracts procured under the project, net of taxes, for consultant
services and for training, 100% of the ex-factory cost or CIF cost of imported
items and 65% for equipment procured locally. In order to facilitate

disbursements, a Special Account would be opened in Bank Indonesia by the
Ministry of Finance. The account would be maintained in US$ and an initial
deposit of US$3.0 million (equivalent to four months estimated average eligible
expenditures) would be made to this account. Disbursements under the project for
contracts below the value of US$100,000 equivalent would be made on the basis of
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs). All documentation in respect of SOE
disbursements will be maintained in the PMU and will be subject to periodic
sample review by the Bank. All payments for contracts above this threshold would
be supported by full documentation. To the extent possible, all payments would
be channelled through the Special Account. However, disbursements against
expenditures in respect of contracts involving foreign currency payments could,
at GOI request, also be made under IBRD direct payment procedures. subject to a
minimum of US$100,000 per application. AgreeMent was reached at negotiations on
the above arrangements.
Prolect Renorting. Accounts and Audits
13.     The P1U will prepare and submit quarterly progress reports on an agreed
format to the Bank on the status of the project. This report will be the main
instrument for monitoring project accomplishments and will include the proposed
pipeline of sub-projects, their preparation and approval status, procurement
status of approved sub-projects, and implementation status of contracted sub-
projects. The PMU will also include in this report status of implementation of
main findings, recommendations and proposed action, etc. of each sub-project
after completion.
14.     The PMU will maintain separate project accounts in a form satisfactory
for annual audit. These accounts, including the Special Account will be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and will include opinions
on all expenditures including those made against SOEs. The PMU will submit the
audited accounts to the Bank not later than six months after the close of each
fiscal year commencing with FY91/92. AgXeement was reached at negotiations to
the above accounting and auditing arrangements.
