MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
FOR A SOUTH SHABA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to the
Republic of Zaire for SDR 3.5 million (US$4.4 million equivalent) on
standard IDA terms to help finance a South Shaba Agricultural Development
Project is submitted for approval.  An amount of up to SDR 1.7 million
(US$2.1 million) of the IDA credit would be on-lent to the Agricultural
Credit Bank (BCA), for a period of 20 years including six years of grace,
at a variable interest rate calculated to allow BCA a spread of 6 percent.
Cofinancing for the project would be provided by the International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) for the equivalent of US$7.6 million.
2.       Background.  Zaire's natural resources, climate and size allow a
wide range of crops to be grown, making agriculture the largest sector of
the economy, with a huge potential for development. It provides direct
employment and support to 70-75% of the active population, and to an
additional 10% employed in agro-industry, although it contributes only 35%
of GDP and 9% of export earnings. Rural per capita income, about $100, is
among the lowest in Africa. In 1983 the Government, which had previously
sought to control the pricing and marketing of agricultural products, freed
producer prices and abolished local authorities' rights to intervene in
marketing or to require production of specific crops, although
liberalization has still to be uniformly applied throughout the coun'ry.
Production of the major food crops (maize, cassava, paddy, groundnuts, and
grain legumes) increased between 1981-85, reversing a 15-year negative
trend. Despite this growth, food imports increased (especially rice,
wheat, meat and fish). Export crop production stagnated or fell, except
for sugar. This disappointing performance stems from a variety of factors,
including: (i) inadequate resources devoted to the sector; (ii) lack of
production and marketing credit; (iii) weak agricultural institutions; and
(iv) difficult transport conditions. These issues are being addressed in
the context of our dialogue on macro-economic and sector adjustment issues.
Action has been taken to strengthen sectoral planning and resource
management capabilities, supported by the Technical Assistance Project
(Credit 1244-ZR), of 1982.
3.       Project Area.  The project will be carried out in the southern
part of the Shaba region in southern Zaire, an area in food deficit because
of its large urban population but with good potential for increased food
production, and conditions which make it possible to overcome the above
constraints.  The project area coincides with the mining area, and includes
three major towns, Lubumbashi, Kolvezi and Likasi. Two-thirds of the 1.5
million population is urban; the rural population of 585,000 is composed of
about 100,000 farm families. South Shaba has a tropical climate with a
single six-month rainy season. The average family cultivates about 1.3 ha
of maize with small areas intercropped with beans. There are a few dairy
farms and cattle ranches; about 150 farms over 5 ha, with an aggregate area



-2-
of some 18,000 ha, account for 40X of the project area's maize output.
South Shaba benefits from favorable conditions for agricultural development
not found elsewhere in Zaires a relatively thriving economy based on
mining; a large urban market; a developed central transport network and
acces9 to suppliers in neighboring countries; a dynamic medium- and large-
scale farm sector; a smallholder population responding to market forces and
willing to pay for inputs and extension services; active non-governmental
agencies supporting smallholder agriculture through training, extension and
input supply; and favorable agro-ecological conditions.
L   4    Proiect Objectives.  The project was originally Identified and
prepared on behalf of IFAD. It contributes to the Government's program to
achieve food self-sufficiency, especially in deficit areas, and to increase
income and economic activity in rural areas. Its objectives are to
increase food production to supply the mining are i with an additional
85,000 tons of maize, to increase production of beans, cassava and
groundnuts, to increase rural Incomes, and to develop a framework of
sustainable support services for agriculture not dependent on government.
The project is highly innovative9 as it will be executed mainly by existing
local non-governmental organizations, which already provide support
services to the rural population of South Shaba. A key feature of the
project would be to maintain and develop their existing mechanisms of full
cost recovery for services to farmers, thus enhancing the sustainability
and affordability of development actions, and minimizing the charge on
public finances.
5.       Prolect Description.  The project would be implemented over five
years and would include: (a) supply of agricultural inputs: improved seeds,
fertilizer and tools; (b) reinforcement and expansion of agricultural
extension and input supply by NGOs, to improve and diversify agricultural
production, related training, and radio broadcasts for extension and market
information; (c) support of agricultural research and development, with a
concentration on farming systems, agricultural diversification, biological
pest control, and animal traction; (d) short and medium-term credit to
smallholders and to community associations, for agricultural inputs, animal
traction, village infrastructure and equipment; (e) medium-term credit to
medium-size rural enterprises and farms for agricultural equipment, farm
infrastructure and trucks for marketing; and (f) rehabilitation and
maintenance of rural roads.
6.       The project would be coordinated by a project mansgement unit
reporting to the Ministry of Agriculture, and Implemented by (a) community
and non-governmental organizations active in the area, selected in
agreement with IDA and IFAD, including in particular the Center for
Execution of Community Programs (CEPC) and Shalamo (an association of
smallholders); (b) the National Seed Bureau (BUNASEM), (c) the Agricultural
Credit Bank (BCA) and the Union of Credit Unions for Development (UCPD),               t
(d) the national Applied Research and Extension program (RAV), and (e) the
national Office des Routes for rural roads. The total project cost of
US$13.3 million, net of tax and duties of US$0.6 million which would be
borne by farmers and other final beneficiaries, includes US$10.3 million
foreign exchange. It would be financed by IFAD (US$7.6 million), IDA
(US$4.4 million)* farmers (US$0.6 million) and Government (US$0.7 million).

A cost breakdowo is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methode of
procurement and disbursement, together with the disbursement schedule, are
in Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank
Group Operations in Zaire are in Schedules C and D respectively. A map is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6382-ZR is dated April 6, 1987.
7.       Rationale for IDA involvement.  This innovative project supports
an Important part of the Bank strategy for Zaire by seeking ways to develop
agriculture which place minimal demands on central government, In this case
by working through local NGO9. It will strengthen a system of sustainable
non-governmental extension and input aupply, ond test a replicable model of
partnership between public and private agencies. It will strengthen the
newly established agricultural credit mechanism, and support the move
towards liberalized interest rates for agricultural credit which Government
is undertaking in the context of its macro-economic adjustment program.
8.       Actions Agreed.  Conditions of effectiveness are: (i) full
establishment of the project unit; (ii) signature of contracts for project
implementation between the Government and CEPC and Shalamo; (iii) appoint-
ment of a financial and administration advisor to the project unit;
(iv) establishment by BCA of a branch in Shaba, with adequate management
and facilities; (v) signature of an agreement between the Department of
Agriculture and the Office des Routes for the road component; (vi) sig-
nature of a subsidiary loan agreement with BCA; and (vii) meeting
effectiveness conditions for the IFAD loan (there is one special condition
additional to those of the credit, signature of a subsidiary loan agreement
with UCPD). A Coordinating Consultative Comaittee, consisting of the
project agencies, will meet at least quarterly. The project unit will
prepare annual work programs for each participating agency, for approval by
IDA: that for the first year has been approved. Work programs for the NGOs
will promote the participation of women in extension and their access to
credit. Government has stated its intention of enforcing its
liberalization policies so that farmers are not subject to enforced
cropping patterns, and that agricultural commodities can be priced,
marketed and transported freely. The Government will onlend up to SDR 1.7
million (about US$2.1 million) to BCA for 20 years Including six years
grace, at an interest rate of 6 percentage points per annum less than its
lending rate for agricultural credit. BCA will lend at its current rate of
30 percent per annum until December 31, 1987. Thereafter it will charge
rates set, in discussion with IDA, with the objective of attaining real
positive interest ratess inflation is currently about 40-50 percent per
annum. In the context of its maero-economic adjustment program, Government
is progressing towards a market determined Interest rate policy for
agricultural credit. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
9.       Justification.  Directly quantifiable economic benefits would be
derived from increased production of maize, beano, cassava and groundnuts,
giving an overall economic rate of return of 56 percent.  Unquantifiable
benefits include (i) the improved quality of life for the rural population
derived from improved communications, village infrastructure, and
appropriate processing facilities, (ii) reduction in urban unemployment,
(iii) the reorientation of the Government extension service in the region
from its present policing role to a constructive one of supporting
agricultural activities; (iv) improved nutrition, better soil and labor
productivity, and reduced erosion, from the promotion of agricultural
diversification and Animal traction; and (v) development and strengthening
of community organizations.



- 4 -
10.      Risks. The main risks are connected with the number of
organizations associated with the project, which will require effective
coordination by the project unit. The Government contribution to project
financing has been minimized so as to reduce risks associated with
provision of b4dgetary funds, a major problem for project implementation in
Zaire. The limited experience of the NOOs in extension and input supply
may create problems, which technical assistance under the project and an
associated project preparation advance have been designed to modify.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
