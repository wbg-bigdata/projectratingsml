MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Zaire -
South Shaba Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 1790-ZR)
Attached is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on Zaire - South Shaba Agricultural
Development Project (Cr. 1790-ZR) prepared by the Africa Regional Office. The Borrower did not
complete Part II.
The project's core was support to NGOs already providing farmers in Shaba with extension
advice plus fertilizer and inputs to increase production, above all of maize. The technical package was
well suited to Shaba's soils and climate. Maize yields were expected to more than triple. The maize
market was also well developed. A prosperous mining area with over a million urban consumers
guaranteed effective demand for incremental production. Key access roads in the area were to be
rehabilitated and their maintenance improved. Through support to a local research station, the project
was also to introduce new disease-resistant cassava in an area where disease had wiped it out. Relying
on NGOs to transfer technology and inputs meant that Government's role would be minimized. Finally
the project was to be self-financing. The thousands of small farmers expected to benefit from extension
advice and new inputs, would pay the NGOs in full, after selling their output in the thriving maize
market. This was a promising and innovative project.
The project failed because by 1993 the essential elements of state structure were lacking.
Hyperinflation-over 2,150 percent in 1991-destroyed the formal credit system and marketing
arrangements. The breakdown of law and order in Shaba forced project implementation-and Bank
supervision-to a full stop. The cumulative impact of Zaire's corrupt public institutions threatened the
entire undertaking. Project management was unsatisfactory at the outset and deteriorated. The project
authority, headed by a senior civil servant, attempted to award a large fertilizer contract to a sub-
optimal bidder. Funds were misappropriated at several levels in the bureaucratic hierarchy. What had
been designed as a small and "light" project management unit, overspent its budget by 258 percent,
accounting for a fifth of IDA-financed disbursement. Incompetent expatriate consultants had to be
replaced in mid-stream. The initial recipients of two contracts for rural road repairs proved incapable.
In 1990, the Army occupied the project research station, stopping production of the vigorous new
cassava cuttings. In 1990/91, the National Fertilizer Service borrowed but did not return, so much
fertilizer that maize production decreased substantially. The state agricultural bank lent to some large
borrowers at rates less than half current inflation. And, in the PCR's language, some of the "amateur"
NGOs were unable to fulfill their "major new managerial responsibilities."
The outcome of the project is rated as unsatisfactory, institutional development as negligible,
and sustainability as uncertain. The PCR is of inadequate quality.
No audit is planned.

SOUTH SHABA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(IDA Credit 1790-ZR and IFAD Loan 200-ZR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the South Shaba Agricultural
Development Project in Zaire for which Credit 1790-ZR in the amount of SDR 3.5 million
(US$4.4 million equivalent) and IFAD Loan 200-ZR in the amount of US$7.6 were approved on
May 5, 1987. The IDA Credit became effective on May 2, 1988. Disbursements were suspended
on June 17, 1993 in view of the persistent non-compliance with covenants of the Development
Credit Agreement (DCA), in particular failure to reimburse the Bank for balances on the Special
Accounts, absence of counterpart funding, and lack of security in the Shaba region, impeding
satisfactory project implementation and supervision. Moreover, Zaire was declared in non-accrual
status on November 15, 1993. The Credit was closed on December 31, 1994, the undisbursed
balance in the amount of SDR 0.48 million (US$0.66 million equivalent) was canceled effective
the same date'. The last disbursement took place on December 1, 1993. The IFAD Loan did not
become effective until October 15, 1988, because the loan agreement had to be amended due to
the unclear legal status of one of the project beneficiaries, the Federation of Credit Unions for
Development (UCPD), following the withdrawal of a major group of shareholders.
Disbursements were suspended in December 1991, as a result of Zaire falling in arrears with
IFAID. The loan was closed on December 31, 1994, at which time the undisbursed balance of
SDR 2.1 million was canceled.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture and Environment Division, Country
Department III of the Africa Region.  The country situation has prevented a satisfactory
completion of the project and project activities have been at a virtual standstill since 1991. No
supervision mission has been able to visit the project area since 1992. The PCR is therefore based
only on the Staff Appraisal Report, the DCA, supervision and project reports and correspondence
between the Bank .nd the Borrower. Copies of the PCR were sent for comments to the
International Fund for Agricultural Development and the Borrower on January 20, 1995.
There was a delay in credit closing because of Government's inability to justify payments made from the Special
Account.

SOUTH SHABA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(IDA Cr. 1790-ZR and [FAD Loan 200-ZR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.    The Shaba region in south-eastern Zaire is a major mining region. At the time of project
preparation in 1986, the development of the mining sector had led to the rapid growth of urban
and peri-urban centers and subsequently to an increased need for food imports, as the traditional
agricultural production systems were unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for food. The
food deficit for maize alone was 60,000-70,000 tons in 1985, part of which had to be imported
from Zambia. Major constraints faced by the agricultural sector at the time included weak
Government services (and the inexperience of NGOs), the inadequate supply of inputs, lack of
credit and serious marketing constraints due to an inadequate rural infrastructure and market price
distortions.
Project Objectives and Description
2.    The main objectives of the project were to (i) increase food production (especially of
maize); (ii) promote agricultural diversification; and (iii) improve rural incomes and living
standards. At full development the project was to increase maize production by 85,000 tons. To
achieve these objectives, the project was to support the improvement and expansion of input
supply and extension services to about 38,000 smallholders and provide technical, management
and credit support to smallholder associations and about 50 medium-scale farms. Besides the
reintroduction of cassava to the Shaba region and the expansion of beans and other legumes, the
project was also aimed at promoting tree planting and animal traction and assisting with the
improvement of rural roads and village infrastructure. The project's main innovation was to
support local NGOs to provide cost-effective agricultural services (agricultural extension, rural
credit and infrastruciure) on the basis of full cost recovery rather than using the traditional project
approach or strengthening existing services. The project was to strengthen on-going NGO
programs and develop farmer organizations to ensure sustainability and to minimize demands on
Government resources.
Implermentation
3.    The IDA Credit became effective on May 2, 1988, after a delay of six months, while the
WFAD Loan did not become effective until October 15, 1988. The main reason for the latter's
delay was the need to waive a Condition of WFAD Loan effectiveness, linked to the uncertain legal

status of one of the project's executing agencies (Federation of Credit Unions for Development,
UCPD).
4.    Project implementation took  place against the backdrop  of a macro-economic
environment, which had already been unsteady since the mid-1980s, when the project was
appraised, and which deteriorated significantly during execution. Not only did the Government
abandon its adjustment program in the early 1980s, but the political upheaval and social unrest
which followed the decision to make way for democratic elections in 1990 introduced an
atmosphere of uncertainty which erupted in riots in late 1991 and again early in 1993. Inflation,
fueled by the uncontrolled acceleration of money supply, increased rapidly towards the end of the
project (from 90 percent in 1986 and 1987 to 2,150 percent in 1991). In the absence of
Government action, the monetary system collapsed in 1991 and thc liquidity in the banking system
dried up, rendering inaccessible what little counterpart funds had been allocated to the project.
5.    During the mid-term review in 1991, it became apparent that project design was no longer
suited to the prevailing conditions. The NGOs that had been supported under the project were
found to be unable to handle a much larger number of farmers than they had done hitherto,
causing management problems. Moreover, repayment of inputs that had been provided on credit
to farmers by project NGOs dropped seriously (from 80 percent in 1988/89 to 35 percent in
1991/92) and the value of the credits that were repaid was rapidly eroded by galloping inflation,
seriously undermining the basis on which project sustainability was founded. The mid-term
review mission therefore recommended a concentration on extension activities for the entire
South Shaba sub-region as part of the relatively successful Pilot Extension Project (Cr. 2096-ZR),
rather than focusing only on selected areas covered by participating NGOs. It was also agreed
that the project would no longer provide credit and inputs to participating farmers. A new work
program was drawn up on this basis but the rioting in the Shaba region in October 1991 and the
subsequent poor security situation interrupted its implementation. Following the suspension of
disbursements by IFAD in December 1991, the project administrator placed all contractual staff
on leave without pay and project activities ground to a halt. Even though the project continued to
prepare work programs for 1993 and 1994, field activities were seriously curtailed due to the lack
of counterpart funds.
6.    The adaptive research program, which was to be carried out by the Applied Agricultural
Research and Extension Service (SENARAV), was seriously affected by the withdrawal of
USAID support for SENARAV in 1990 following the occupation of the main maize research
station by the Zaire army, for billeting purposes.
7.    Original costs for the roads component were seriously underestimated, and only a small
part of the program could therefore be carried out. No road maintenance was performed in the
absence of counterpart funds.
8.    Actual project costs are estimated at US$9.3 million (US$13.9 million estimated).
Financing was provided by the Government in the amount of US$0.1 million (US$0.7 million
estimated), EFAD in the amount of US$5.2 million (US$7.6 million estimated) and IDA in the
amount of US$4.0 million (US$4.4 million estimated).



Evaluation Summary                                                                v
Resu.lts
9.    The project fell far short of its objective to increase maize production by 85,000 tons. By
credit closing, only an incremental production of 25,355 tons had been achieved (35 percent).
Moreover, the project's design proved to be over-ambitious for the participating NGOs to
implement and eventually floundered because of the poor macro-economic and political
environment. The restructuring of the project in 1991/92 following the mid-term review, which
limited the project focus to extension services and abandoned the provision of credit to farmers,
came too late to have a decisive impact on project results. More importantly, farmers had grown
accustomed to receiving inputs from extension workers and were now obliged to obtain these
from a practically non-existent private sector. Combined with the effects of the demonetization of
the economy and the suspension of project activities in 1992, this led to a decrease in the average
maize yield (from 3.2 tons per ha to 2.7 tons per ha). The impact of the roads component was
limited since only a part of the program had been carried out and funding for maintenance did not
materialize. In the absence of adequate information on production costs and prices, no detailed
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) analysis was carried out. Based on the model provided in the
Staff Appraisal Report and the information available from progress reports through 1991, the
ERR is negative.
Sustainability
10.   It is clear that most, if not all, progress achieved earlier under the project was
subsequently undone as a result of the poor macro-economic political and social environment and
that therefore the few project results that existed are not sustainable.
Lessons Learned
11.   The main lessons learned from this project are:
(a)   While the use of successful local NGOs might appear attractive for channeling
development initiatives, due attention must be paid to their proven management
ability and their willingness to adapt to new and increased responsibilities. In the
case of the South Shaba NGOs participating in the project, the new resources
brought in under the project were a strong motivation for accepting the project
conditions on paper, without having proven capacity to make best use of them.
(b)   Agricultural credit, even when repayment is envisaged in kind, cannot be
administered on a sustainable basis in a deteriorating macroeconomic environment.
(c)   There are few viable alternatives to strengthening existing agricultural services and
introducing a unified management system to obtain a major impact on agricultural
growth.

1.    Project Identity
Project name:      South Shaba Agricultural Development Project
Credit number:     1790-ZR
Country:           Zaire
Region:            Africa
Sector:            Agriculture
Sub-sector         Research and Extension
2.    Background
2.1.  The Shaba region in south-eastern Zaire is a major mining region. At the time of project
preparation in 1986, the development of the mining sector had led to the rapid growth of urban
and peri-urban centers and subsequently to an increased need for food imports, as the traditional
agricultural production systems were unable to meet the rapidly increasing demand for food by
miners. The food deficit for maize alone was 60,000-70,000 tons in 1985, part of which had to be
imported from Zambia.
2.2.  At the time of appraisal, the area benefited from a healthy economy based on an active
mining sector; an urban population of one million constituting a critical market for food crops; a
well developed urban transportation network and access to suppliers in neighboring countries; a
dynamic medium and large scale farm sector; some farmers willing to pay for extension services;
and active non-governmental organizations (NGOs) supporting smallholder agriculture through
training, extension and input supply with full cost recovery.
2.3.  Major constraints faced by the agricultural sector included the weakness of Government
support services and the inexperience of NGOs, the inadequate supply of agricultural inputs,
including fertilizers, seeds and tools, and serious marketing problems due to lack of credit, an
inadequate rural infrastructure and market price distortions created both by imports of subsidized
maize from Zambia and by the resale of free maize meal distributed to employees of the local
mining companies.

3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1.   The main objectives of the project were to (i) increase food production, especially maize;
(ii) promote agricultural diversification; and (iii) improve rural incomes and living standards. At
full development, the project was to increase maize production by 85,000 tons. To achieve these
objectives, the project was to support the improvement and expansion of input supply and
extension services to about 38,000 smallholders and technical, management and credit support
was also to be made available to smallholder associations and about 50 medium-scale farms.
Besides the reintroduction of cassava to the Shaba region and the expansion of beans and other
legumes, the project was also aimed at promoting tree planting and animal traction and was to
assist with the improvement of rural roads and village infrastructure. In the institutional area, the
project was to strengthen NGO programs and develop farmer organizations to ensure
sustainability and minimize demands on Government resources.
3.2.   The project was to be implemented over a period of five years and included the following
components:
(a)   supply of agricultural inputs (improved seed, fertilizer and tools);
(b)   reinforcement and expansion of agricultural extension by NGOs to improve and
diversify agricultural production and related training;
(c)   support of agricultural research and development with a concentration on farming
systems, agricultural diversification and animal traction;
(d)   medium-term  credit to medium-scale farms and smallholder associations for
agricultural machinery, farm infrastructure, animal traction, village infrastructure
and equipment and trucks for marketing;
(e)   rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads; and
(f)    establishment of a small PMU to finance, coordinate and monitor development
activities by existing organizations.
3.3.   A small Project Management Unit (PMU) was to be responsible for overall project
management, coordination, training, monitoring and evaluation and financial control for all
components, excluding agricultural credit provision. Responsibilities for carrying out project
activities were as follows: non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for input supply, extension
services and credit approval and recovery; the National Seeds Service (SENASEM) for the supply
of improved seeds; the Applied Agricultural Research and Extension Service (SENARAV) for
research and development; the Agricultural Credit Bank (BCA) and the Federation of Credit
Unions for Development (UCPD) for the provision and recovery of medium term agricultural
credit; and the Roads Office (OR) for supervision of the rural roads work. A Coordinating
Committee (CC) under the chairmanship of the regional governor was to be established to bring
together all executing agencies and coordinate activities.

4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1.  The project was prepared by the Food and Agricultural Organization/Investment Center
(FAO/IC) and IDA for the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). It was
designed to test an alternative to the ineffective Government support services to farmers, using a
format which had been developed by two local NGOs, under which a promotional technical
package of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers and agricultural extension was provided on credit,
and such credit was to be recovered at the time of harvest. The project was designed to build on
this experience and, through other NGOs, provide similar services to a greater number of farmers
in the areas surrounding the major mining towns of the Shaba region.
4.2.  While the project appraisal report did not envisage any unusual risks in implementation,
the unreliability of Government counterpart funding, the limited experience of local NGOs and the
effects of market distortions created by imports of subsidized maize were all identified as
presenting a potential threat to successful project implementation. While each of these elements
contributed to the difficulties encountered by the project, there were other two key factors which
were underestimated. The first was the impact of charging relatively small and amateur NGOs
with major new managerial responsibilities for agricultural development well beyond the levels to
which they had been accustomed. The second was the way the macroeconomic environment
changed abruptly during the course of project implementation, which had a direct impact on
project sustainability. The formula for project sustainability was based on a relatively sound
operational arrangement. Funds advanced to NGOs as grants were to be on-lent in the form of
input credits and extension services to maize growers in the project area. Repayment was to be
obtained in kind in bags of maize, the number to be agreed with farmers at the beginning of the
planting campaign. The proceeds of the sale of maize by the NGOs, who benefited from
increased prices following storage, were to be deposited in their individual accounts with the
Agricultural Credit Bank. They were to be released in support of future project operations in
agreement with project management. As annual inflation started to reach triple and quadruple
digit levels, the basis upon which long-term sustainability had been founded was broken as the
value of recovered credit was eroded rapidly, thereby reducing in real terms the amount of credit
available for the following seasons. Moreover, credit became extremely difficult to recover both
because of the effects of inflation, even over short periods, and because farmers began to see the
new project resources mobilized by the NGOs as money received from the Government and from
outside donors, for which repayment was not perceived to be as important as when the NGOs
operated only with their own modest funds.
5.    Project Implementation
A.    General
Macro-Economic Environment
5.1.  Project implementation took place against the background of a macro-economic
environment which was already unsteady during the mid-1980s, when the project was appraised,
and which deteriorated significantly during the project life. Not only did the Government abandon
its adjustment program in the late 1980s, but the political upheaval which followed the decision to



4                                              Part 1: Project Review from the Bank's Perspective
make way for democratic elections in 1990 introduced an atmosphere of uncertainty and
insecurity, which finally erupted in riots in late 1991 and again in early 1993. Inflation, fueled by
the acceleration of money supply, increased rapidly towards the end of the project, running at 90
percent in 1986 and 1987, 83 percent in 1988, 104 percent in 1989, 82 percent in 1990 and 2, 1 50
percent in 1991. In the absence of Government action to stabilize the economy, the monetary
system collapsed in late 1991 and the liquidity in the commercial banking system dried up. What
little Government funds were allocated to projects could only be mobilized with great difficulty,
and by the time they were mobilized, their value had been seriously eroded by inflation. During
riots in Shaba in October 1991, which followed those in Kinshasa in September 1991, the project
headquarters were spared but the installations of one NGO in Likasi were completely gutted.
During subsequent civil unrest in January 1993, equipment was stolen from project headquarters.
Effectiveness
5.2.   The IDA credit was not declared effective until May 2, 1988, a delay of six months. The
main reasons for this delay were administrative and related to the signing of the Presidential
decrees ratifying the IDA credit and 1FAD loan agreements. The IFAD loan agreement had to be
amended prior to effectiveness because of the unclear status of UCPD, one of the main project
beneficiaries, following the withdrawal of a major group of shareholders. This delayed
effectiveness for the IFAD loan until October 15, 1988.
Procurement
5.3.  In general, procurement was slow, especially for fertilizer. The purchase of one lot of
3,085 tons of fertilizer was greatly delayed because of disagreement between Government and
IDA on the award, with Government reluctant to award the contract to the lowest bidder because
of minor questions on the technical and financial specifications of the bidder. IDA insisted that
the difference between the lowest and the second lowest bid warranted going back to the lowest
bidder for clarification, which Government eventually did.
Disbursements
5.4.   After a large initial lag, which resulted from delays in effectiveness of the IFAD loan and
slow project start-up, disbursements picked up in 1989, eliminating the lag by late 1991. IFAD
disbursements were suspended in December 1991 following the failure by the Zaire Government
to properly service IFAD debt. Shortly prior to this, as part of a broader decision to reduce
exposure on externally funded imprest accounts in a volatile climate,  IDA requested the
repayment of the balances of both the IDA and IFAD special accounts held by the BCA in
Kinshasa in amounts of US$54,907.99 (IDA credit) and US$143,670.04 (IFAD loan). In spite of
repeated reminders from IDA and specific interventions by the Prime Minister and the Minister of
Agriculture and Rural Development, the BCA failed to transfer the outstanding credit balances to
IDA or IFAD.  It appears that there were severe irregularities on the part of the BCA
management during the weeks following the September 1991 riots in Kinshasa, and all foreign
currency reserves disappeared. After persistent threats to suspend disbursements, beginning in
July 1992, due to poor project performance, lack of Government commitment and the impact of
the WFAD suspension on project implementation, and failure by Government to reimburse the
balances on the IDA and WFAD special accounts, IDA suspended disbursements for the credit on



Part I- Project Review from the Bank's Perspective                                     5
June 17, 1993. The last disbursement took place on December 1, 1993 but the undisbursed
balance in the amount of SDR 0.48 million (US$0.66 million equivalent) was not canceled until
December 31, 19942. Disbursements under the IFAD Loan were suspended in December 1991,
as a result of Zaire falling in arrears with IFAD. The IFAD Loan was closed on December 31,
1994, at which time the undisbursed balance of SDR 2.1 million was canceled.
Project Costs and Financing
5.5.   Actual project costs are estimated at US$9.3 million (US$13.9 million estimated).
Financing was provided by the Government in the amount of US$0.1 million (US$0.7 million
estimated), IFAD in the amount of US$5.2 (US$7.6 million estimated), and IDA in the amount of
US$4.0 million (US$4.4 million estimated). Project costs were less than estimated because of
serious delays in project start-up, compounded by IFAD's decision to suspend disbursements in
December 1991. Actual costs for road rehabilitation and maintenance were much higher than
estimated because the design team had underestimated the amount and type of work needed and
as a result only a part of the program was carried out. Other costs were lower than appraised due
to the relatively lower level of activities (e.g. extension activities and the credit component).
B.    Individual Project Components
Agricultural Inputs
5.6.   The project was to provide improved seeds, fertilizer and tools to participating farmers as
part of the technical package (colis promotionnel). These inputs were provided free of charge to
participating NGOs, who sold them to farmers. The funds thus generated were to serve as a
revolving fund to finance subsequent extension activities. The project distributed inputs valued at
US$3.5 million to farmers (including 6,934 tons of fertilizer against 9,310 tons planned and 356
tons of maize versus 887 tons planned). The farmer was charged the full cost of the package,
including an overhead charge to cover the cost of extension services. Performance on repayment
of credit was acceptable during the first two years of the project (about 80 percent), but
subsequently declined to 35 percent in 1991 and 1992, as a result of surging inflation and political
instability.
5.7.   Performance of the component was in part negatively affected by delays in procurement
and the borrowing of fertilizer stocks by the National Fertilizer Service (SENAFIC) from the
project. These stocks were not returned in time and as a result, little fertilizer was available for
the 1990/91 planting season. Moreover, the project was unable to secure sufficient quantities of
improved seeds from the seeds farms in the area.
5.8.   The supply of agricultural inputs on credit was abandoned following the mid-term review
in 1991, because of repayment problems and also partly because farmers felt that the extension
agents were focusing their efforts more on obtaining credit repayment than on providing technical
advice, which undermined their relationship. It is possible that this led, in part, to the subsequent

decline in average maize yields (from 3.2 tons per ha to 2.7 tons per ha), although other factors
also played a role, such as the collapse of the banking system, weather, etc.
Reinforcement and Expansion of Agricultural Extension
5.9.  During the first year of implementation, due to preoccupation with effectiveness
conditions and delays in procurement of inputs, only one NGO participated. The second NGO
which had been selected at appraisal decided not to participate during the first year and to
continue using its own resources, because it feared that sufficient project resources would not be
available during the first year to carry out the agreed program. Selection procedures for further
NGOs were rigorous and it was not until the third year of the project that three further NGOs
were accepted to participate in the project.
5.10. In view of the problems encountered and the poor performance of the project up until
1991, the mid-term review recommended concentration of project activities on agricultural
extension activities for the entire South Shaba sub-region, rather than focusing on the areas now
covered by project NGOs, and integrate these with the relatively successful ongoing Pilot
Extension Project (Cr. 2096-ZR). It was also agreed that the project would no longer provide
inputs on credit to participating farmers. An orientation workshop was held in August 1992, to
which all agencies and programs involved in agricultural extension were invited. A work program
was drawn up and agreed on. However, the rioting which erupted in the Shaba region in October
1991 and the subsequent poor security situation and uncertainty among project staff and
participants regarding continued donor support, interrupted the implementation of the program.
Following the suspension of disbursements by IFAD in December 1991, the project administrator
placed all contractual staff on administrative leave and project activities came to a standstill. Even
though the project continued to prepare work programs for 1993 and even 1994, it is uncertain
how much was achieved after the last IDA supervision mission in June 1992, considering that no
counterpart funds were made available.
Agricultural Research and Development
5.11. The adaptive research component, to be carried out by SENARAV, was to focus on: (i)
biological control of the cassava mealy bug and introduction of tolerant clones; (ii) farm testing of
improved maize varieties and fertilization; and (iii) farming systems research.  SENARAV
undertook several farm level trials of the impact of fertilizer, varietal choice, planting dates and
intercropping for maize, soybeans, beans and cassava. Multiplication plots for disease resistant
cassava were established. Demand for these varieties was so high that quantities were stolen from
the multiplication plots established on local seed farms. The research and development program
was affected by the withdrawal of USAID support for this service in Shaba, following the
occupation of the main maize research station by the Zaire army for billeting purposes and border
surveillance. The impact of the trials which were carried out using project funding were limited,
due mainly to weak SENARAV support, which was dogged by frequent staff changes.
Agricultural Credit
5.12. The project was to finance two lines of credit to meet the financial needs of different
groups (one line in the amount of US$2.1 million through the BCA to benefit NGOs, commercial



Part 1: Project Review from the Bank's Perspective                                7
traders and medium-scale farmns, and a second line in the amount of US$0.4 million through the
UCPD to benefit small holders). Five medium-term loans were made by the BCA to medium- and
large-scale clients, at an interest rate of 50 percent per annum. This rate was not periodically
adjusted to ensure a positive interest rate as requested by IDA supervision missions and as
specified in the credit agreement. Because of the deteriorating macro-economic environment, and
the ensuing rapidly increasing inflation, this rate quickly became negative. Surprisingly enough,
three of the five loans were paid back early. The other two loans were only partially repaid. In
1990, the uncommitted part of the BCA managed line of credit was reallocated to the roads
component because it was felt that BCA had sufficient own resources for lending to maintain its
lending program, while the roads component had insufficient funds allocated.
5.13. The UCPD lent almost its entire credit line for 1990 to one large scale borrower at
unrealistically low interest rates, in contradiction to its agreement with the project. This loan was
only partially repaid. The mid-term review mission of June 1991 endorsed the decision of the CC
to drop UCPD from the project.
Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Rural Roads
5.14. This component aimed to improve access to markets for farmers and delivery of inputs to
farmers by the project. During appraisal, a total of 815 km of roads had been selected for priority
action under the project. Start-up of this component was slow. The Roads Office (OR) was
responsible for supervising the implementation of this component and was provided with a vehicle
by the project and reimbursed for salaries and allowances of road engineers. It quickly became
apparent that the appraisal team had been too optimistic in its assessment of the amount of
rehabilitation work needed and its cost. The work program was therefore significantly scaled
back in 1988. Only 274 km of roads instead of 815 km would be part of the maintenance
program and only 284 km of roads instead of 300 km would be rehabilitated.
5.15. The appraisal report called for manual rehabilitation of the roads, but inspection by a joint
OR/project staff mission concluded that degradation had advanced to such a stage that this would
no longer be feasible. However, after this inspection the project went ahead and awarded two
contracts for manual rehabilitation in August 1989 and paid an advance to the companies selected.
These contracts were canceled only after intervention by the regional governor. Contracts for
mechanical road rehabilitation were subsequently awarded to two companies, which completed
the works by 1992. A June 1992 supervision mission found the roads and bridges in satisfactory
condition, but in urgent need of maintenance. Since road maintenance was to be funded by
Government and no counterpart funds were available, it is unlikely that any maintenance on the
rehabilitated roads has been performed.
5.16. In 1992, responsibility for supervising the roads component was passed from the OR to
the newly created National Rural Roads Service. Since funding for the roads component had by
that time been exhausted, this had no positive impact on the project.
PMU
5.17. Project management was weak from the onset and was therefore unable to provide the
leadership needed to follow-up with the participating executing agencies. Contacts with NGOs



8                                               Part I Project Review from the Bank's Perspective
were insufficient, which resulted in: (i) failure to ensure full cost recovery; (ii) different prices
being charged for input packages by different NGOs; and (iii) lax financial discipline. Moreover,
no mechanism was developed to maintain the value of credit repayments in the face of rapidly
increasing inflation. Because of loose intemal financial controls, there was misappropriation of
funds by project staff. Moreover, in 1990, the Minister of Agriculture appropriated Z 14 million
from the project and failed to reimburse this amount despite repeated requests from IDA. In
addition, inputs (especially fertilizer) and equipment were lent to other govemment agencies but
not retumed or returned only after long delays.
5.18. The project was to provide two man-years of long-term technical assistance for
administration/financial management and two man-years of short-term consultancies. Three man-
years of long-term technical assistance were used for the position of financial advisor, in addition,
several short-term consultancies were used for training. The performance of long-term technical
assistance was poor. Two early incumbents had to be replaced.
5.19. Because of the PMU's weak links with the Coordinating Committee (CC), the latter only
convened regularly, albeit less times than agreed upon, during the initial two years of the project.
After 1990, the CC became less important in project implementation.
6.    Project Results
6. 1.  The project fell far short of its objective to increase maize production by 85,000 tons. By
credit closing only an incremental production of 25,355 tons had been achieved (35 percent).
Moreover, the project's design proved to be over-ambitious for the participating NGOs to
implement and eventually floundered because of the poor macro-economic and political
environment. The restructuring of the project in 1991/92 following the mid-term review, which
focused the project on providing extension services only and abandoned the provision of credit to
farmers, came too late to have a decisive impact on project results. More importantly, the farmers
had grown accustomed to receiving inputs from extension workers and were now obliged to
obtain these from a practically non-existent private sector. Combined with the effects of the
demonetization of the economy and the suspension of project activities in 1992, this led to
decreases in farm yields. The impact of the roads component was limited since counterpart
funding for maintenance did not materialize.
Economic Rate of Return
6.2.  In the absence of adequate information on incremental production and costs, no detailed
Economic Rate of Retum (ERR) analysis was carried out. Based on the model provided in the
staff appraisal report and the information from progress reports through 1991, the ERR is
negative.

7.    Project Sustainability
7.1.  It is clear that most, if not all, of the few project accomplishments achieved under the
project have been undone by the socio-economic events identified above and that they therefore
are not sustainable.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1.   Design of several project components was weak, especially the roads component, which
affected project implementation. In particular the Bank underestimated the risk of insufficient
counterpart funding.  Most of the Bank's supervision until 1992 was undertaken from the
Resident Mission in Kinshasa. Following the relatively successful start-up of the National Pilot
Extension Project and a country-wide initiative to consolidate on-going project efforts, the mid-
term supervision mission recommended, and project management agreed, to consolidate the
extension activities of the South Shaba Project with those of the pilot project. Unfortunately, this
initiative came too late to affect overall project results.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1.   Shortages of counterpart funding plagued the project since its inception. The Borrower
was unable to comply with requests from IDA to increase project funding to agreed levels, which
ultimately led to severe problems in project implementation. Also, the Borrower's inability to
reimburse the project on time for funds, equipment and inputs that were borrowed, undermined
extension activities.
10.   Consultants' Performance
10.1. The project provided for long-term technical assistance for the strengthening of financial
and administrative management. Experience with long-termn technical assistance was poor. Two
expatriate financialUadministrative advisors succeeded each other during the first two years and
were replaced by a third advisor. In spite of staying in post for two more years, the latter
provided little training to project staff and he was required to return on a short-term consultancy
to finalize the 1991 accounts.
11.   Project Relationships
11.1. The project relationships were good. All IDA supervision missions were carried out
together with the Borrower and on many occasions with a representative from IFAD, which
contributed to a good mutual understanding of problems by all parties and a willingness by the
Borrower to take decisions when needed (staffing, etc.).

12.   Documentation
12.1. The PCR is based on incomplete information because no recent field visit was made by
Bank staff and no project completion mission could be fielded. The Borrower did prepare a
project completion report, however, which was informative but lacked a rigorous analysis of
events affecting project implementation. The document is available from project files.
