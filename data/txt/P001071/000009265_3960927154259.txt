INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
MEHORANDUH AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A
SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed IDA
credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 6.9 million (US$ 9.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms and would help finance a Socio-Economic Development
Support Project consistent vith ongoing structural adjustment operations.
Additional funds would be provided by the Technical Assistance Fund of the
African Development Fund (US$1.9 million), Canadian International
Development Association (US$0.8 million), the Government of Guinea (US$0.5
million), and NGOs and local communities (US$ 1.2 million).
2.        Background.  The regime which took office in Guinea in April 1984
inherited a country which was in acute economic crisis. Guinea is one of
the poorest countries in the world. Per capita income in this country of
5.6 million inhabitants (1986) is less than US$300 (1986). Living standards
are uniformly poor, as reflected in key social indicators: life expectancy
is 41 years, infant mortality is approximately 160 per thousand, more than
80 percent of the population lacks access to safe water, and 80 percent of
the population is illiterate.
3.        In an effort to reverse the longstanding detulioration of the
economy and redress financial imbalances, the new leaders launched a far-
reaching stabilization and adjustment program in late 1985. This program
was supported by an IDA structural adjustment credit, and other
international financing. Based on a drastic reduction of the public sector
deficit, the program centered on reducing the state's role, by reducing
controls and encouraging a free-market economy. Specific measures to meet
these broad objectives were designed to: (i) correct the serious
overvaluation of t'-; currency; (ii) establish a new, reliable, banking
system to replace the defunct state banks; (iii) introduce institutional
reforms to promote private sector savings and investment; (iv) decontrol
prices; (v) liberalize internal and external trade; (vi) reduce the scale
and improve the efficiency of the public sector by lowering public
employment and withdrawing from commercial and industrial activity; and
(vii) reorient public investment toward supporting the directly productive
sectors.
4.        A second phase of the reform program, was started in 1988, again
with IDA and other international support. In this second phase, the
Government is pursuing an adjustment strategy aimed at achieving sustained
growth of income over the medium term. At the same time, the Government
realizes that growth of per capita income is a necessary but not sufficient



2
condition to alleviate poverty. Its 1988 Declaration of Development Policy,
prepared as a basis for the Second Structural Adjustment Program, sets forth
the Government's determination to achieve growth with equity, to develop
policies and programs to improve the incomes and access to basic services by
low-income households, and to assist those groups directly affected by the
reform.
5.        The Government has adopted a number of transitional measures
during the Structural Adjustment process in order to cushion its adverse
effects on vulnerable groups in urban areas. These includet (i) addition,i
payments to civil servants to partially compensate for increases in the cost
of living resulting from the devaluation and other adjustment measures; (ii)
continued payment on a temporary basis of salaries to civil servants who
benefited from transitory reserve status; (iii) voluntary departure bonuses
with access to loans at favorable conditions for civil servants with
bankable projects; (iv) advisory services to the retrenched civil servants;
and (v) labor-intensive work programs to create employment in Conakry funded
in part through the first Urban Project financed by IDA.
6.        A National Poverty Task Force (NPTF) was established by the MPCI
under the aegis of UNICEF in 1987 to make, with the support of UNDP-financed
consultants, an overview of the social sectors. In April 1988, the NPTF
produced a report containing a poverty profile of the country, the tentative
identification of vulnerable groups in rural and urban sectors and proposals
for a series of projects in the areas of basic education, primary health
care, nutrition, employment generation, and micro-credit schemes. As a next
step, the Government intends to establish a National Commission on Social
Policy at the ministerial level, to oversee the development of policies that
will achieve the objectives mentioned above, and to reinforce the Ministry
of Planning and International Cooperation to enable it to develop effective
socio-economic policies and programs to improve the access to employment and
basic services of the poor segments of the community. The proposed Project
will support these actions.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA's important role in the
recovery program puts it in a leading position vis-a-vis the donor community
in supporting the Government's action to alleviate poverty in a manner
consistent with the structural adjustment policies. Additionally, IDAts
involvement through this Project will provide the financial and human
resources necessary for an efficient coordination of Government and Non-
Government social actions which might otherwise tend to be under-funded and
fragmented. The Project comes at a crucial time in the adjustment process.
8.        Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the Project are:  (i)
strengthening the capacity of the Government in the areas of social policy
design, coordination, and implementation; (ii) strengthening the capacity of
the Government to identify target poverty groups and to monitor the
evolution of living conditions of households throughout the adjustment
process and afterwards; and (iii) implementing a priority social action
program, based on specific sub-projects aimed at upgrading the living
conditions of the poor and disadvantaged groups;



3
9.        Prolect Description.  The Project will support the implementation
of: (i, a program of social policy studies to be conducted within the MPCI
to strengthen the Government's capacity to design, coordinate, and implement
a comprehensive social policy consistent with the Structural Adjustment
Program; (ii) a permanent household survey to identify target groups and to
monitor changes in the living conditions of the population; and (iii) a
Pilot Program of Socio-Economic Development which will finance, essentially
through NGOs, priority projects, directed at the most vulnerable groups in
order to mitigate the social costs of adjustment while growth gradually
resumes.
10.       Project Management.  The Project will be managed by the MPCI, and
will be integrated into the organizational structure of the Ministry. The
Minister will appoint a socio-economic advisor, who will be Secretary of the
National Commission on Social Policy, and Coordinator of the Project. He
will monitor the several components of the project, administer project
funds, ensure the timely participation of the various divisions of the MPCI
that will carry out portions of the project, will ensure coordination with
sectoral ministries carrying out poverty-oriented programs, and will be
responsible for coordination with and among donor agencies. The Pilot
Program will finance NGOs atd, exceptionally, public agencies, that will
carry out grass-roots interventions that meet agreed criteria and have been
approved by IDA. The Pilot Program will be managed by a Pilot Program
Management Unit (PPMU) to be establisheJ within the MPCI. The ministry will
be assisted in carrying out the three main segments of the Project by
internationally recruited advisors, one of whose main functions will be to
train Government managers.
11.       Non-governmental Organizations.  Non-governmental Organizations
have been chosen as the primary implementing agencies under the Pilot
Program, given their administrative flexibility and ability to maintain
close contacts with low-income groups of the population. There are
presently a large number of NGOs, both national and international, working
in Guinea. However, some of the national NGOs do not have extensive
experience in project design, implementation and supervision. Consequently
cooperative arrangements between national and international NGOs and between
national NGOs and foreign voluntary organizations will be encouraged.
12.       Project Benefits:  In the short term, the Project will provide,
(i) technical support to strengthen the Government's capabilities in social
policy planning; (ii) a statistical base on the level and evolution of
household living conditions; and (iii) experience in designing and
implementing actions that will improve the access of poor and disadvantaged
groups to increased employment opportunities and basic social services. In
the medium term, the Project will lay the basis for: (i) refined targeting
of vulnerable groups; and (ii) the development of a comprehensive social
policy consistent with efficient growth-oriented economic policies.
13.       Pro3ect Risks:  The first risk of the Project is that there may be
delays in implementing the project arising from the inexperience of the
government staff that will manage the project. A second risk is that pilot
projects selected may not be in conformity with the act'on programs of line



4
ministries, since such programs are still qt an early stage of development.
A third risk is that implementation and coordination dirficulties may occur
as a result of the complexity of the Project. A fourth and final risk is
that one or more of the NGOs implementing sub-projects may not manage
project funds efficiently.
14.       The first risk would be countered by providing experienced
advisors to key project managers, whose main assignment would be to help
develop the abilities of those managers. The second risk would be minimized
by involving the line ministries concerned in the approval of sub-projects.
The third risk would be reduced by appointing a Socio-Economic Policy
Advisor and giving a strong project coordination function to the office of
the Minister of Planrning. The fourth risk would be reduced by applying
appropriate procedures for the selection and supervision of RGOs and by the
careful drafting of sub-project agreements, while recognizing that unduly
close supervision may impede the work of the NGOs, whose principal advantage
lies in their flexibility and ability to reach their beneficiaries through
imaginative and unbureaucratic actions.
15.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
