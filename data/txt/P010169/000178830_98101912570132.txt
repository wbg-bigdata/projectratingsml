PAKISTAN
IRRIGATION SYSTEMS REHABILITATION PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
1.01      Pakistan's irrigation, drainage, and flood protection systems are
deteriorating because of an accumulation of deferred maintenance.  This has
been evidenced by: breaching of flood protection bunds during the 1973 and
1976 floods, frequent breaching of canal banks; and, clogging of canals and
surface drains with sediment and debris. This situation has been documented
in many reports such as: (a) "Pakistan: Flood Rehabilitation Program
Credit", Report No. 304a-PAK, World Bank (February 20, 1974); (b) "Operation
and Maintenance of Flood Protection Works in Pakistan", Inter-Departmental
Group (June 1978); (c) "Revised Action Progranm (RAP) for Irrigated Agricul-
ture", Water and Power Development Authority (May 1979); and (d) "An Economic
Analysis of Level and Structure of Irrigation Water Charges", a recent
publication by Pakistan's Institute of Development Economics.
1.02      The possibility of strengthening the operation and maintenance (O&M)
capability of the Provincial Irrigation Departments (PIDs) on a project basis
was discussed in general terms by Government of Pakistan (GOP) officials
and an IDA Agricultural Review Mission in December 1979. National Engineering
Services, Pakistan (NESPAK) was engaged by GOP to prepare a feasibility report
for the project. NESPAK's draft report (Marclh 1981) served as the principal
reference document for an IDA appraisal mission that visited Pakistan in June
1981. This report is based upon the findings of that mission comprising
Mr. W. Fairchild, Miss G. Lituma, and Messrs 14. Artaza, C. P. Cheng,
J. Mohamadi, and R. Reynolds (IDA), and Mr. W. Sikorski (Consultant).
Mr. R. Anson (IDA) also assisted in the economic analysis.
General
1.03      The Islamic Republic of Pakistan covers an area of about 197 M ac
in the four Provinces of Baluchistan, North Wast Frontier (NWFP), Punjab
and Sind. The population is estimated at 80 M and increasing at a rate of
3% per annum (p.a.). About 74% of the population resides in the rural areas.
Average per capita income is about US$ 300 p.a. 1/ and is growing at an annual
rate of about 3%. About 30% of the population is estimated to have an annual
income below US$ 150 per capita, which was the estimated absolute poverty
level for FY 80.
1.04     Agriculture is the single largest sector in Pakistan's economy.
It accounts for about 30% of the GDP, employs about 55% of the 23 M labor
force, and provides about 70% of the nation's export earnings. In FY 80,
agricultural exports exceeded by over US$ 550 M the value of agriculture-
related imports of fertilizer, pesticides, machinery, wheat, edible oil,
tea, etc.

Agricultural Performance and Policies
1.05      Agricultural production grew substantially in the late 1960s,
averaging about 6% per year. This growth slowed to little over 2% annually
in the early to mid-1970s. A series of adverse developments caused this
disappointing performance: political turmoil during 1971 and 1972, and a
succession of floods and droughts during the period 1973-76. Institutional
factors also contributed to this poor showing, mainly, weaknesses in agri-
cultural supporting services, and worsening terms of trade for agricultural
products. A major factor preventing higher agricultural production has been
the, uncertainty of irrigation water supplies, coupled with inefficiencies
in the irrigation system. Agricultural production, however, increased from
2.5% annually in FY 78 to 7.3% in FY 80. Much of this recovery could be
attributed to favorable weather conditions, however there are signs that
improvements in GOP's price support policies, and increased supply of fer-
tilizer are beginning to take effect.
1.06      During the last three decades, GOP-s agricultural policies have
stressed: (a) large water sector projects (Tarbela and Mangla Dams, link
canals, and salinity control and drainage projects); (b) food and input
subsidies (wheat, edible oil, tubewells, water charges, fertilizer and
pesticides); and, (c) support pricing policy. However, some essential
requirements for agricultural production such as field oriented research,
training and extension programs, water management, and operation and main-
tenance of the existing irrigation system were severely neglected. This
unbalanced approach, even though accompanied by substantial investments, was
a major factor in retarding agricultural growth during the late 1960s to mid
1970s. Recently, however, GOP began to revise these policies by reducing
subsidies, encouraging private sector investment in areas such as input
distribution, concentrating on funding efficient agricultural extension and
research services and improving water management at the farm level. Also
GOP has become increasingly aware of the deterioration of its existing
irrigation infrastructure. Consequently, projects to rehabilitate the
irrigation system have the highest priority in the country s development
program for the agriculture sector.
Physical and Demographic Features
1.07      Climate.  Climate is arid to semi-arid and subtropical.  The
temperature in most cultivable areas allows for all-year cultivation, with
temperatures reaching as high as 45-C in May and June. Rainfall varies
seasonally and annually and is strongly influenced by monsoon currents
(June through September) from tropical depressions originating in the Bay
of Bengal. Annual precipitation is less than 150 mm over much of the
Indus Plain, whereas pan evaporation varies from 1,250 mm to 2,800 mm,
making irrigation a necessity for agricultural production. Even so, hejvy
rainfall does occur during some monsoon seasons causing substantial flood
damage to property and crops, and loss of human lives. In 1973 and 1976,
floods caused damage in excess of US$1,800 M, which prompted two IDA Flood
Rehabilitation and Restoration Projects (Cr.466-PAK and 683-PAK).



1.08     Water.  Total annual rainfall in the Indus Plain's culturable canal
commanded area (cca) is about 25 maf with about 50% effectiveness. The total
annual Indus River inflow is about 150 maf. Qtiality of this surface water
is excellent for irrigation with total dissolvEd solids (TDS) running between
100 to 200 ppm in the upper basin and 150 to -;50 ppm in the lower Indus.
There are vast amounts of groundwater underlying the Indus Plain. To a depth
of 40 m, 47% of the Indus Plain has groundwater with TDS of less than 1,000
ppm and 69% less than 3,000 ppm. 1/ Fresh groundwater (FGW) pumpage (160,000
private and 10,000 public tubewells) amounts to about 33 maf annually. The
"Revised Action Programme for Irrigated Agriculture" (RAP) 2/ estimated that
an additional 11 maf is recharged annually to F1GW zones and is available for
pumpage. Of the approximately 200 maf of water available to the Indus Plain,
only about 67 maf is available to crops because of unavoidable losses and poor
water management (see Plate I-Indus Plain and ]'eshawar Vale Water Balance). A
recently approved On-Farm Water Management Project with IDA and International
Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) financing is to improve water manage-
ment along selected watercourses in Pakistan.
1.09      Soils.  The soils of the Indus Plain are generally deep river
alluvium deposits of a calcareous nature. About 85% of the soils' texture
is moderately coarse to moderately fine and are well suited to irrigated
agriculture. The pH generally runs from 8 to 3.5 with nitrogen, phosphorous
and organic matter being generally low and potassum in ample supply. As
shown in Table 1.1, some 78% of these soils have been classified as having
Class I or II capability.

1.10      A 41.3 M ac soil salinity survey of the Indus Plain, which was com-
pleted in 1980 by WAPDA's Research and Survey Organization, found substantial
improvement in surface and profile salinity as compared to information from
a similar survey made in the early 1960s. Much of this improvement can be
attributed to the leaching effect of additional water supplies delivered to
1/   Water with TDS less than 1000 ppm is generally considered acceptable
quality for irrigating crops; whereas water up to 3000 ppm has been
successfully utilized for crop production in Pakistan when appro-
priately mixed with good quality surface supplies.

the irrigated areas. The 1980 survey determined that about 62% of the irri-
gated soils in the Indus Plain were salt free, 11% saline, 3% sodic and 24%
saline sodic. Soil salinity in the lower basin is more of a problem where
only 38% of the soils in Sind and Baluchistan are salt free. However, the
survey found over 80% of the saline sodic soils contained gypsum in the pro-
file and would be readily reclamable by leaching. Therefore, much;of the
soils appearing in Land Class III and IV in Table 1.1 could be easily up-
graded through a program of leaching and appropriate management practices.
1.11     Land Use.  Culturable canal commanded area that can be irrigated for
at least one full cropping season, includes about 34.5 M ac of land of which
5 M ac is classified as culturable waste. An additional 20 1M ac of cultivated
land are watered by rain (barani), flood moisture (sailaba), isolated irriga-
tion systems, and groundwater and about 28 M ac are in range and forest
lands. The remaining 119 M ac are made up of deserts, mountains and open
water. Table 1.2 gives more details on land-use.

1.12.     Farm Size.  As shown in Table 1.3, in 1972 the majority or 68% of
the 3.76 M farms in Pakistan are under 12.5 ac, but they cover only 30% of the
total 49 M ac of farmland. Another 29% of the farms in the size category of
12.5 to 50 ac occupy 46% of the total farmland, and the remaining 3% of farms
over 50 ac in size occupy 24% of the total farm:Land. The Land Reform Act of
1972 limited holdings of irrigated land to 150 ac and this was further reduced
in 1977 to 100 ac.

Agricultural Production
1.14      Crop Production and Yields.  Wheat, rice, cotton and sugarcane are
the major crops. Wheat grows in the dry season (rabi, mid-October to mid-
April) in both irrigated and barani areas. Rice and cotton are grown in the
wet season (kharif, mid-April to mid-October). Sugarcane is mainly planted
or ratooned in the spring and harvested 10 to 12 months later. About 74% of
the wheat and sugarcane production and 60% of the cotton come from Punjab
and 47% of the rice is produced in Punjab and an equal amount of rice in Sind.
Table 1.5 gives a summary of FY80 yields and production for the major crops.

1.15      Crop yields should be quite high in Pakistan because of the exten-
sive irrigation systems, favorable climate for year-round cropping, and
generally good soils. However, due mainly to constraints described in paras
1.05 and 1.06, crop yields are far below their potential with wheat and rice
yields of about 0.6 mt/ac, cotton 0.1 and sugarcane 15.0 (Table 1.5). Based
upon a 1977 Leading Farmer Survey, RAP estimated that reasonable and obtain-
able crop yields for wheat should be 1.38, rice 1.50, cotton 0.28, and sugar-
cane 28.0 mt/ac. These potentials are attainable through improved delivery of
irrigation water, water management, extension services and input supplies of
seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides. In most cases, crop yields are not affected
by any single factor, but rather by a combination and interaction of several
factors. However, production constraints are mostly water related.
1.16      Cropping Intensities.  Cropping intensity and cropping pattern vary
with climate, soils and particularly the availability of water. According
to RAP, the highest annual cropping intensity (141%) is in the NWFP's mixed
cropping zone and the lowest (65%) is in Sind's rice-wheat zone, which reflects
soil salinity and flooding constraints. The average annual cropping intensity
in the Indus Plain is about 100%, whereas a reasonable target for cropping
intensities would be 130% to 150%.
Agricultural Inputs and Services
1.17      Fertilizers.  Currently, fertilizer distribution is handled by
both public and private sectors. Recently, fertilizer off-take rates have
grown at about 20% annually and reached about 1,080 M nutrient mt in FY 81.
Although a depressed off-take prevailed immediately following the sharp



- 7 -
February 1980 fertilizer price increase, it rezovered during rabi season
1980/81. Under the Fertilizer Import Credit (Cr. 1068-PAK) GOP has agreed
to:  (a) increase domestic production of nitro3enous and phosphorous fer-
tilizer to 1,050,000 and 178,000 nutrient tons, respectively, by FY84, which
would meet about 75% of the domestic requiremeat; (b) improve the efficiency
of the distribution system; (c) strengthen the role of the private sector in
both production and distribution; and, (d) phase out all fertilizer subsidies
by FY86.
1.18      Seeds.  During FY79, only about 6% of the required wheat, rice and
cotton seed was met with certified seeds. To improve the situation, GOP and
GO Provinces have launched an IDA assisted Seed Industry Development Project
(Cr. 620-PAK) with a target to meet 86% of the total certified seed require-
ment by FY83.
1.19      Plant Protection.  In February 1980, the responsibility for pesti-
cides distribution was transferred from the Extension Service to the private
sector and the government subsidy on pesticides in Punjab and Sind was
abolished. Withdrawal of pesticides subsidy in Baluchistan and NWFP is to
be completed by 1983.
1.20     Extension Service.  Each Province has an agricultural extension
system, although their operation to date has teen quite ineffective. To
improve the effectiveness of current extension programs, IDA has recently
funded two projects to introduce the Training and Visit (T&V) System in
Punjab (Cr. 813-PAK) and in Sind (Cr. 922-PAK).
1.21      Agricultural Credit.  Agricultural credit in Pakistan is provided
from a variety of sources, including the Federal Bank of Cooperatives (FBC),
the four Provincial Cooperative Banks (PCB), the Agricultural Development
Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) and Commercial Banks (CB). The FBC, PCB and CB
provide mainly short-term credit and limited cEmount of medium-term credit.
ADBP provides mainly medium and long-term creclit. During FY80, agricul-
tural credit amounted to Rs 2.3 billion of which about 45% was financed by
CBs, 30% by ADBP and the balance 25% by the PCBS. In 1978, IDA approved the
Fourth Credit for ADBP (Cr. No.957-PAK) for US$40 M, with IFAD financing an
additional US$30 M. This credit is to mainly finance investments in minor
irrigation, mechanization, and on-farm development.
II. IRRIGATION SYSTEMS ANI) RELATED O&M
2.01      Irrigation began in Pakistan about 3,000 years ago.  Now irrigation
is undertaken on about 75% of the cropped area (Table 1.2) which generates
about 90% of the Nation's total agricultural production. Primarily because of
inadequate funding for maintenance, the irrigation system is now in a seriously
deteriorated condition.

Irrigation Facilities
2.02      Indus Irrigation System:  The Indus Irrigation System (34.5 M
ac cca) is the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world. It
comprises the Indus River and its major tributaries, three major storage
reservoirs, 1/  19 barrages/headworks, 12 link canals, 2/ 43 canal commands
and some 89,000 chaks (para 2.04). The total length of the canal system is
about 58,500 km with watercourses, farm channels and field ditches running
another 1.6 M km in length (see Plate II - Indus Irrigation System).
2.03      Water from the river channels is diverted by barrages and head-
works into the main canals. 3/ The first controlled all-year irrigation
began in 1859 with completion of the Upper Bari Doab Canal from Madhopur
headworks on the Ravi River. Generally, the hierarchical canal system runs
from main canals to branch canals, distributaries, and minors. Table 2.1
gives a summary of data on canal channels broken down by Provinces.

Works in Pakistan." NESPAK, March 1981 (cca adjusted
on basis of RAP data).
2.04      In each canal command, the lowest order command is called a chak.
These chaks vary in size from 200 to 700 ac (average about 400 ac), each
covering about 20 to 50 farms (average about 35 farms). Flow into the chak
distribution system, which is called a watercourse, is governed by an open,
free flowing outlet (mogha) designed to pass a discharge that self-adjusts
in proportion to flows from the parent channel. Normally, moghas outlet
from distributaries and minors. Generally discharges from moghas vary from
one to three cusecs, however, there are instances where over 5 cusecs are
delivered. The distribution of water within a chak is by a time rotation
called "warabundi" with each farmer holding a specific period in proportion
to the size of his holding.
1/ Tarbela has 9.3 maf live storage, Mangla 5.9, and Chashma 0.7.
2/ Marola-Ravi link has the largest design capacity of 22,000 cusecs.
3/ Rohri in Sind is the largest of the 43 canals and commands about 2.6 M ac.



- 9 -
2.05      Generally, the design criteria of the canal system have evolved to:
(a)  fit the availability of water supplies in the river;
(b)  meet the objective of bringing to maturity the largest possible
acreage of crops with the minimum consumption of water; 1/ and
(c)  operate at a low cost and with a linmited number of technical staff.
This design has resulted in low cropping intensities (para 1.16) and low
yields (para 1.14). However, with the urgent demand to increase crop produc-
tion to meet the domestic requirements of a rapidly increasing population
(para 1.05) and a need to aid balance of payments through international sale
of exportable surpluses, flows in excess of designed capacities are now
being carried in many of the canals, especial:y in Sind Province. 2/ This has
placed great stress on the system and has increased significantly the risk of
failure. These larger flows have been made possible by an improved system of
barrages and the storage in Mangla and Tarbela reservoirs.
2.06      Until about 20 years ago, the extensive groundwater resource under
tihe Indus Plain (para. 1.08) was viewed more as an hazard of waterlogging than
an asset available to yield additional water for crop production. The first
large scale salinity control and reclamation p)roject (SCARP I) was started in
1959 and involved installation of 2,069 public tubewells(TW), of one to five
cusecs discharge capacity. As of June 30, 1930, WAPDA had installed about
11,000 operating public TWs in the fresh grouadwater (FGW) zones and about
1,300 in saline groundwater (SGW) zones. TabLe 2.2 shows SCARP implementation
progress through June 30, 1980. Normally public TWs in FGW discharge into the
upper end of the watercourse and become part Df the warabundi.

2.07      Noting the operation of SCARP TWs and the financial returns of
supplementing surface water supplies with groundwater, farmers in the late
1950s began installing and operating smaller private TWs of one cusec or
smaller discharge capacity. It is now estimated that about 160,000 private
TWs have been installed with a total annual pumpage of about 26.0 maf, which
exceeds by about three times public TW pumpage of about 7.9 maf.
2.08      Irrigation Outside the Indus Plain:  According to RAP (Table 1.2),
there are about 5.5 M ac of irrigated land outside the Indus Basin cca. This
area, most of which is supplied by private irrigation systems, is in widely
scattered parcels, and receives water supply from various sources such as open
wells, TWs, lift pumps, karezes, springs and smaller diversion schemes. Most
of the minor civil canals and lift irrigation schemes are operated by PIDs and
are located in NWFP (110,000 ac cca) and Baluchistan (220,000 ac cca).  Water
supply available for such schemes is extremely variable by location and by
season. Because of the scattered nature of these schemes, O&M is more costly
and poses a more difficult problem as evidenced by the highly deteriorated
state of these facilities, some of which are inoperable at the present time.
Drainage Facilities
2.09      The drainage system needs in the irrigated areas of Pakistan com-
prises both surface and subsurface facilities. Except for rice area commands,
subsurface drainage would be required ultimately for all irrigated areas where
the water table is less than 5 feet. GOP has attempted to meet such subsurface
drainage through SCARPs plus a very limited tile drainage program where appli-
cable (example Khairpur II, Cr. 648-PAK).
2.10      The flat topography and lack of well developed natural drainage
system in the Indus Plain, creates a surface drainage problem, which has been
compounded by the construction of roads, railways, flood embarkments, and
irrigation distribution networks that obstructed natural drainage flows. The
ccas which are subject to frequent rainstorm flooding are located near the
Himalaya's foot hills in the upper portion of the Bari, Rechna, and Chaj Doabs
in Punjab and in the lower reaches of the Indus Plain close to the sea coast
in Sind. Also local surface drainage problems are encountered in NWFP. The
cities of Lahore, Karachi, Jhang, Sukkur, and Rawalpindi have major stormwater
drainage problems. Over the years a large network of surface drains has been
constructed in Punjab's doabs and more recently construction of Phase I of the
Left Bank Outfall Drain in Sind provides some relief from rain flooding in the
tail reaches of the Rohri and Nara canal commands. Table 2.3 gives a summary
of the major characteristics of existing surface drains.

Flood Protection Facilities
2.11      Extensive flood losses in Pakistan 'para 1.07) occur from three
major categories of floods; rain flooding, hiLl torrents, and major rivers.
See para 2.10 for description of the system oi- surface drains constructed
to mitigate the damages of rain flooding.
2.12      A severe and largely intractable flood problem is caused by hill
torrents on intermittent streams that drain hilly or foothill areas in zones
of low annual rainfall. Intensive rainstorms occasionally occur in steep and
barren catchment areas, causing severe flash floods and depositing large
quantities of coarse sediments. Regions most affected are the eastern slopes
of the Kirthar and Suleman Ranges (Baluchistan and Sind), Peshawar Valley
(NWFP) and Nallah tributaries of the Chenab and Ravi Rivers (Punjab). Because
of the infrequency and localized nature of hiLl torrent flooding, few flood
protection measures have been installed to alLeviate this problem.
2.13      Major river flooding associated witl1 the Indus River and Punjab
tributaries represents the greatest flood hazard to Pakistan. To reduce
major river flood damage, an extensive bund system has been installed along
the Lower Indus River in Sind which is entireLy confined by bunds, except
where high ground is near. the river. In Punjab and NWFP, bunds have been
constructed at high hazard locations and in a3sociation with barrages. The
total length of front-line bunds along the major rivers is about 4200 km

2.14      Priorities for the planning, design, construction or rehabilita-
tion of flood protection facilities are estabLished by the Federal Flood
Commission (FFC) based upon recommendations of PIDs. These priorities are
generally in line with the 1978 National Flood Plan. 1/ A flood forecast-
ing and warning program is jointly operated by the Pakistan Meterological
Department (PMD), WAPDA, police, GO Punjab, aad GO Sind. This program was
recently upgraded through a World Meterological Organization/UNDP/PMD Flood
Forecasting Project.
1/ "1978 National Flood Plan" (October 1979) was prepared for FFC by
NESPAK/Harza from funds provided by the 1976 Flood Damage Restoration
Project (Cr. 683-Pak).

Problems Associated with Existing Facilities
2.15      Canals.  Because of the increasing demands for irrigation water,
many of the canals are carrying quantities of water well in excess of their
design capacities and beyond the limits of safe operation (para 2.05). Most
canals are now operating with inadequate or no freeboard, berms have been
eroded away, operating road widths are inadequate, outside embankments have
deteriorated, sedimentation has severely reduced the capacity in many minors
and distributaries, and some hydraulic structures need repair.
2.16      Canals breach on many occasions.  A notable example was a breach
in the Rohri canal in 1978 when the canal was closed for 10 days for repairs
with no water deliveries during that period to the 2.6 M ac cca. Most of the
earthwork and repairs are done with labor intensive methods with inadequate
attention to required compaction.
2.17      The Indus canal system carries a substantial sediment load which
ranges from about 50 to 300 ppm of fine and medium sands. Even though the
canals are theoretically designed to carry this sediment for proportional
evacuation through the watercourse moghas and eventual deposition on the
irrigated lands, a significant amount is deposited in the canal channels.
This problem is particualrly serious in distributaries and minors flowing
less than 1000 cusecs and located in the mid and lower reaches of subsystems.
Sediment deposition in the distributaries and minors may occur in any reach
or throughout their entire lengths. However, the net effect in all cases
is to raise the water flow line in the channel resulting in additional with-
drawals of water for water courses in the upper reaches with corresponding
reductions in deliveries to water courses in the lower reaches of distribu-
taries and minors. This phenomenon has been well documented in RAP-s expanded
agricultural economics survey of 2,000 farmers in 400 watercourses. This
survey indicated that the value of crops produced was substantially lower in
tail end watercourses than was the case of watercourses situated along the
mid or upper reaches of such systems. To rectify the sediment problem, the
normal maintenance procedures by PIDs calls for a special maintenance program
to remove the accumulated sediment. Because of inadequate funding and time
limitation of perennial canal closure (maximum 15 days in January of each
year), the sediment problem has gone generally unattended in recent times.
2.18      SCARP Public Tubewells.  Since FY 75, SCARP TW pumping capacity
has been declining at a rate of about 4.6% annually because of tubewell
failure, decline in groundwater levels, reduction in specific capacity
(blockage of TW screens and gravel packs) and pump breakdowns. Because of
inadequate operating budgets to finance ever increasing energy costs, pumps
are now being operated at about 35% of installed capacity. Another major
problem is that a formalized operational program has not been developed to
integrate canal and TW water. The organization responsible for canal and TW
operations are parallel with no cross links for operational coordination
below the Regional Chief Engineer. No public TW operating criteria have
been developed reflecting crop water requirements and tubewell schedules.
The only operational criteria calls for TW pumpage for the full period of
the warabundi so that distribution is equitable. Public TW operators
pose a particularly difficult problem. Operators are frequently absent



- 1 3 -
from TW stations. Initially, TWs are equipped with protective devices to shut
off the motor when electrical supply problems are experienced. Pumps are to
be restarted only by the operators, but becau3e of their frequent absences
many of the protection devices have been disabled by disgruntled farmers,
which has resulted in a high incidence of burned out motors.  Preferential
arrangements between the operator and some farmers are not unusual. Attempts
to discipline operators have generally been uasuccessful because of a powerful
operators' union.
2.19      Surface Drainage:  The older surface drains were designed with
rule-of-thumb criteria ranging from one to four cusecs per square mile. This
inadequate capacity has been further aggravated by such man-made obstructions
as roads, railways and canals. Because of inadequate maintenance, most of
these drains have become clogged with sedimenL and weeds. Interviewed
farmers in RAP's expanded agricultural economLcs survey repeatedly indicated
that slow removal of excess storm water was a major problem constraining
increased crop production.
2.20      Flood Protection Bunds:  Numerous G3P and IDA studies and reports I/
have shown that failure of flood protection blinds has invariably been associ-
ated with breaching rather than overtopping. Breaches are a direct result of
inadequate maintenance associated with rain cuts, wave wash, stream erosion,
damage caused by vehicular or animal traffic, and holes made by burrowing
animals and tree roots. Experience has indicated that bunds constructed with
manual/donkey techniques are more prone to breaching than those constructed
with heavy earth-moving equipment. Labor intensive measures are characterized
by greater volume of larger clods and air pockets, and corresponding substan-
dard compaction. For example, none of the bu:id reaches restored with heavy
equipment following the 1973 and 1976 floods were breached during subsequent
high flood flows in 1976 and 1978 respectively.
Current O&M Funding
2.21      Inadequate funding for O&M has been the major cause for the accumula-
tion of deferred maintenance and resulting prTblems affecting the irrigation,
drainage, and flood protection facilities deszribed in para 2.15 to 2.20.
Normally such funding should be fully met in the Non-Development Budgets (NDB)
supported by financial resources generated within each Province. Because of a
shortfall of NDB funding, GO Provinces and GOP have included certain deferred
maintenance items, described as rehabilitatioa, in the Provincial Annual
Development Programs (ADP). Further, to alleviate the funding problem, GOP
has assumed the rehabilitation of flood proteztion works as a Federal respon-
sibility and included it in the Federal ADP. 2/

Restoration Project (Cr. 863-PAK), and "National Flood Protection Plan
1978" prepared for Federal Flood CommissiDn by NESPAK/Harza.
2/  Funding for rehabilitation of flood protection works in the Federal
ADP is Rs.  350 M for FY 1982, which is the approximate level called
for in the 1978 National Flood Plan.



- 14 -
2.22      There have been a number of attempts to assess the optimum level
of O&M activities to be funded in the Provincial NDBs.  One such study was
undertaken for RAP where the required budgetary allocation for canal O&M
expenditures was estimated at about Rs 14 per ac. 1/ Taking RAP's recom-
mendation, but expressed in 1981 prices, the required level of O&M allocation
per ac for canal and drainage system in Punjab, exclusive of establishment
charges, would be in the order of Rs 400 M as compared to the Rs 87 M allo-
cated for FY 81.
2.23      Table 2.5 gives a summary of Provincial NDB allocation to PIDs
for O&M. In Punjab, the significant increase in allocation since FY 77 went
mainly to establishment and TWs. Generally, NDB allocations have met PIDs
requests for establishment and TW O&M, even though TWs are operated at only
about 35% of capacity. The shortfall in NDB funding has been adjusted
to the detriment of O&M for canals, surface drains, and flood protection
works where such allocation is about 45 to 60% of PIDs request. This
phenomenon reflects PIDs priority to keep its establishment intact and the
necessity to pay the energy cost associated with public TW operation. The
rapidly accelerating cost of public TW operation will be-exacerbated in the
future by envisioned increases in energy costs and the addition of public
TWs to the system, e.g., approximately 900 in the FGW in FY83. The dete-
riorating situation for canal O&M funding would be difficult to reverse
unless GOP and GO Provinces: (a) initiate a TW transition program for
transferring TWs in the FGW zones to the private sector for operation,
maintenance, and replacement; and, (b) increase water rates to finance
required O&M. Both of these policy actions were recommended by RAP and
generally accepted by GOP. GOP made a noteworthy start to improve the
Provincial NDB in FY 82 by providing, for the first time, Rs 100 M to Punjab
and Rs 50 M to Sind to supplement the PIDs' O&M budget. All four Provinces
have been increasing water charges over the past several years and they added
another 25 percent increase for FY82. Also efforts are being made to
improve the collection rate of water charges which at present are somewhat
low. The current average water rate in Pakistan is about Rs 30 per ac per
crop season.

2.24      Even though the major constraint to an effective O&M program is
funding, there appears opportunity to improve record keeping, advance program
planning, independent inspection and review, and better utilization of the
establishment and equipment. A considerable portion of O&M instructions to
the field offices are in form of circulars and letters from the Secretaries
and Chief Engineers that need updating and collating. O&M manuals are gen-
erally old and do not reflect recent changes in the system and opportunities
to utilize new technologies and equipment (para 2.26). As an example, the
Punjab 'Manual on Irrigation Practices" was written in 1963, however the Sind
"'Bund Manual" is an excellent document, which was revised in 1978. Rest-Houses



- 16 -
are still being maintained along the main irrigation canals at intervals of
about 10 miles, which was the travel distance that a Chief Engineer and his
entourage could travel by camel during the early period of the system.
Generally, PIDs' highly integrated organization along regional lines does
not adequately provide for specialization required in functional areas of
planning, construction and O&M.
Execution of Works
2.25      The traditional method of executing works is either by earth moving
equipment, maintained and operated by PIDs' Mechanical Circles, or by labor
intensive methods by private contractors. Currently, little irrigation-relat-
ed civil works requiring heavy earth moving equipment is undertaken by private
contractors. The only significant source of non-PID heavy equipment available
for such work belongs to Mechanized Construction, Pakistan (MCP), a GOP char-
tered and owned corporation. Because of management and financial problems,
MCP has come upon hard times and PID officials have been unwilling in recent
times to engage MCP to undertake civil work contracting. PID equipment is
used for large schemes involving considerable earthwork and drainage excava-
tion work. This approach is reflected in the composition of Provincial equip-
ment fleets, administrative arrangements for execution of works and in the
quality of completed works. Equipment fleets are composed almost exclusively
of heavy machinery working in ad hoc groups formed to suit the size of the
project and time allocated.  The quality of equipment work is generally satis-
factory, although the compaction of embankment is limited to that provided by
movement of equipment with little use of compactors. Labor intensive methods,
employed by small private contractors, rely on human and animal input and the
use of hand tools. At the current level of supervision there is little com-
paction of soil placed in embankments, in spite of requirements of PIDs'
specifications. The equipment inventories include only one mechanical hand
compactor. Inadequate compaction during construction and repair of berms
and side slopes of canals and bunds, and toe of embankments increases the
likelihood of failures and need for frequent and repeated repairs.
Equipment and Maintenance Facilities
2.26      The PIDs' equipment fleets have improved considerably in recent
years through acquisitions under IDA projects (Cr. 466 and 683-PAK) and other
purchases. However, these fleets have substantial deficiencies in compaction
equipment, equipment maintenance units and transport, medium-sized earthmoving
machines, miscellaneous equipment required for improved quality and efficiency
of labor intensive methods, agricultural type tractors with attachments for
small jobs, specialized maintenance equipment, concrete mixers, mobile light-
ing and communication equipment. Specialized equipment, such as small drag-
lines and dredgers, is also needed for removal of sediment from operating
canals. Equipment required for improved soil compaction by labor intensive
methods is normally beyond the financial resources of petty contractors.
Another area of equipment need is the replacement of items nearing the end
or past their economic life; e.g., all draglines in Punjab PID are over 20
years old.
2.27      The PIDs' workshops and stores are generally old and have mostly
antiquated machine tools; e.g., some machine tools in Punjab workshop are



- 17 -
about 50 years old. Additional machine tools are needed to service modern
earthmoving equipment and vehicles. Some workshop buildings are inadequate
and are in need of substantial repairs; e.g., Sind workshops at Kotri and
Jamshoro, which were built about 30 years ago to service construction equip-
ment working on nearby barrages. Baluchistan and NWFP require new workshops
to service their increasing and far-ranging equipment fleets.
2.28      The procedures used for procurement, storage, and issuance of spare
parts need considerable improvement. Due to insufficient storage space and
inadequate disposal program, which have resulted in large inventories of
outdated and unusable materials and spares, the storekeepers experienced
difficulties in taking delivery and handling spare parts procured under the
1976 Flood Restoration Project (Cr. 683-PAK). Due to deficient inventory
control methods, the spare parts stores frequently experience excessive
supplies of slow-moving spares and shortage of fast-moving spares.
2.29      Another area which needs improvement is preventive maintenance of
equipment, as well as a program for recording and monitoring data relating
to equipment maintenance, operation and repairs. There is need for improved
feed-back of data from the field to headquarters for recording and cost-
accounting of equipment use.
2.30      A shortage of foreign exchange has been a continuing problem for
PIDs in the timely procurement of equipment and spares. Also, the local
currency cover, which runs about 90% of the CIF price of heavy equipment, of
which 65 percent is customs, taxes and duties, has proven to be a heavy
burden for PIDs in light of their limited ADP and NDB funds.
III. THE PROJECT
3.01      The proposed project, which is highly divisible, would finance a
three-year (FY 83-85) time-slice of a rehabilitation program. It would be
implemented in all four Provinces. The project would provide for rehabili-
tating approved surface irrigation and surface drainage systems that have
badly deteriorated because of deferred maintenance. Rehabilitation of
public and private tubewells and closed subsurface drains would be excluded.
Required equipment and related facilities, as well as technical assistance,
training, and Federal coordination would be financed by the project. Gen-
erally, rehabilitation of flood protection facilities would not be included
in the project since this work is appropriately covered in the Federal An-
nual Development Program (ADP) administered ty the Federal Flood Commission.
However, equipment funded by this project would be employed on flood pro-
tection works.
Objectives
3.02      The Project's objectives would be to:
(a) increase agricultural production by (i) providing a more
reliable water supply by reducing risk of failure in the
irrigation network, and (ii) reducing crop losses resulting
from rain flooding by improving the surface drainage system;



- 18 -
(b) provide a more equitable irrigation water supply to all
farmers by increasing deliveries to watercourses in the tail
reaches of minors and distributaries through a program of
silt removal from selected channels;
(c)  strengthen the capability of the PIDs  O&M programs so as to
improve efficiency of system operations, and assure continued
maintenance of installed facilities; and
(d) serve as a Phase I model of a larger and continuing program
of a similar nature that could be replicated in future projects.
Civil Works  (Base Cost US$59.6 M)
3.03      System Rehabilitation (Base Cost US$59.0 M).  The need for system
rehabilitation is urgent and required on most reaches of canals and surface
drains (paras 2.15-2.20). The project would provide earthwork, stone pitch-
ing, and repair of hydraulic structures for about 14,000 km of canals, as
well as cleaning and resectioning about 3,500 km of surface drains.
3.04      In the case of the Indus system, canal rehabilitation would be
limited to present operating or design capacities, 1/ whichever is greater.
The major quantity of such earthwork would relate to: (a) raising the height
of the canal bank to obtain required operating freeboard; and (b) widening
the canal bank to improve safety of operation. Also, hydraulic structures
would be repaired, however in the Indus system these repairs would be in line
with existing capacities. All rehabilitation work would meet the existing
specifications of PIDs, which are satisfactory to IDA. Typical rehabilitated
cross-sections for main canals, branches, distributaries and minors are shown
in Plates III and IV. Designs for canal reaches to be rehabilitated would
clearly indicate the maximum water surface level as basic reference datum.
Assurances have been obtained from GOP and GO Provinces that design and
construction of rehabilitated schemes would be in line with PIDs- specifica-
tions and that the integrity of the minimum designed free board in the
rehabilitated channels would be maintained.
3.05      Provincial specifications for earthwork compaction would be enforced.
Small compacting equipment provided by the project would be made available on
a rental basis by PIDs to private contractors employing labor intensive tech-
niques. Generally, labor intensive methods would be employed on waterlogged
and congested areas, schemes with short leads, and minors and smaller distri-
butaries and this work would amount to about 60% of the earthwork. When
substantial quantities of earthwork with long leads, or underwater exca-
vation are involved, the work would be carried out by heavy earthmoving
1/   Present operating capacity is defined as the maximum quantity of water
now conveyed by a facility, whereas design capacity is defined as the
capacity to which the facility was constructed in line with PID speci-
fications and for which detailed designs were prepared prior to appraisal
(June 30, 1981).



- 19 -
equipment. It is estimated that about 30% of the earthwork relating to
canal rehabilitation, and nearly all of the surface drainage rehabilitation,
or in total about 40% of all civil works, wouldl be done by equipment.
3.06      Accumulated sediment, particularly ia dis-ributaries and minors
has reduced the conveyance capacities of the channels.  This has resulted in
inequitable water deliveries, where upper reach watercourses receive more
water and lower reach watercourses receive les3 water than planned deliveries
(para. 2.17). Even though equitable water deliveries is a prime objective in
operating the Indus Irrigation System, the PIDs have had difficulty in remedy-
ing this situation because: (a) labor intensive methods can be employed only
during the 15 day closure of perennial canals for the annual January inspec-
tion; and, (b) specialized equipment has not bsen available that could remove
the sediment while the canals are operating. En some areas of Sind, farmers
are donating their labor to regularly clean their minors. This is a logical
and inexpensive arrangement to mobilize considerable manpower and would be
encouraged in this project. Where required to achieve better equity in
deliveries, PIDs in designing canal rehabilitation work would also consider
changes in mogha design, as well as "bushing anad staking" to improve channel
cross section characteristics.
3.07      Rehabilitation of the drainage systems primarily involves earthwork.
Most of the drains are badly clogged and require clearing and cleaning. Vir-
tually all of this work must be done by dragli-nes. Small and medium capacity
draglines would be provided by the project to supplement the existing equipment
fleet for doing this work.
3.08      Annex 1, Tables 8-11 list the proposed canals and surface drains
to be rehabilitated under the project. From taese and other eligible schemes,
PIDs would select priorities for each year's program of work. During negoti-
ations, agreement was reached on schemes on which rehabilitation work would
be initiated during FY83. Proposed schemes to be rehabilitated during FY84
and 85 would be included in the consolidated Annual Project Work Plan and
Provincial Annual Work Plan (paras 5.02 and 5.03) for review and approval of
IDA.l/ In planning and carrying out the rehabilitation program, PIDs would
exercise care to assure the rehabilitation of zomplete systems or subsystems
during the project period. PIDs would use the following guidelines in
identifying priorities for rehabilitating scheines in the Indus system:
(a) systems or subsystems of canals (consisting of main canals,
branches, distributaries, and minors and structures requiring
repair) that are located in areas of high cropping intensities
and higher value crops and need urgeat rehabilitation because
of high risk of canal breach (for example, canals that are
operating with little freeboard, weak banks and dowels, weak or
no berms, inadequate road width and outer slope, eroded inner
slopes and silted bottoms);
1!   Such list would designate those schemes tD be funded by IDA and those to
be funded by USAID (para. 4.07). USAID dasignated schemes would be
reviewed and approved by USAID.



- 20 -
(b) systems or subsystems of canals that have inequitable deliveries
because of large sediment deposits in channels of minors and
distributaries;
(c) systems or subsystems of canals in which farmers, under PID
supervision, would donate labor for removing silt from the
distributaries and minors; and
(d) surface drains that are located in highly developed agricul-
tural areas and have lost most of their water carrying capa-
city through sediment deposition and cannot remove the ex-
cessive water from rainstorm and irrigation effluents at a
desired rate.
The maximum civil works investment cost per ac of cca (June 1981 prices) for
rehabilitating Indus Irrigation System schemes should not exceed Rs 175 in
Punjab, Sind, and Baluchistan, and Rs 200 in NWFP. 1/ Schemes not within
these per ac costs would be rehabilitated only following consultation
with IDA, and if an economic analysis by PID showed an economic rate of
return greater than 15%.
3.09      Canal systems or subsystems outside the Indus System to be rehab-
ilitated under the project would meet the following criteria:
(a) commanded area would not be less than 250 ac;
(b) scheme would benefit at least 25 farm families;
(c) dependable and available storage in supply reservoir should
not be less than 2.5 ac/ft per cropped ac; whereas the mini-
mum flow from supplying streams should provide a minimum of
one cusec during the period of critical crop water require-
ment for each 125 ac cropped; and
(d) rehabilitation costs for (i) existing commanded area should
not exceed Rs 700 per ac; and (ii) incremental commanded
areas should not exceed Rs 2,000 per ac.
Schemes not meeting the water duty in (c) above and maximum permissible
rehabilitation cost per ac in (d) above could be included in the project,
following consultation with IDA, if an economic analysis by PIDs shows an
economic rate of return for the project greater than 15 percent. Assurances
have been obtained from GOP and GO Provinces that the criteria to be followed
in selecting schemes would be satisfactory to IDA and that such schemes
selected for each years rehabilitation program would be submitted to IDA for
review and approval.
1/   Based upon economic analysis of selected systems/subsystems (para 7.08).
This maximum cost criteria (Rs/ac) would ensure the economic viability
of rehabilitation work without necessity of preparing an economic analysis
for each scheme.

These targets would be accomplished during the three-year project period.
The PIDs indicated these targets are well within present capacities when
supplemented by the equipment provided by the project. Cost estimates and
designs are available currently for some of the schemes and PID officials
committed that cost estimates and designs for the first year's construction
program would be completed by June 30, 1982.
3.11      Workshops and Warehouse Facilities (Base Cost US$0.6 M).  The
equipment repair facilities in all four Provinces require improvements (para
2.27). The project would provide for repairs and additions to the Jamshoro
and Kotri workshops in Sind, and Peshawar in NWfFP. In addition, the project
would provide for three new small workshops located in D.I. Khan in NWFP and
Quetta and Sibi in Baluchistan. The estimated cost of these facilities are
shown in Annex 1, Tables 7.
Equipment (Base Cost US$28.8M)
3.12      The PIDs equipment fleets are not properly balanced for work to be
undertaken. These fleets are practically devoid of light and miscellaneous
equipment required for small and medium size jobs, removal of sediment from
operating canals, and for improving the efficiency and quality of labor in-
tensive operations. In addition, replacements are urgently needed for equip-
ment which is at or nearing the end of economic life (paras 2.25 and 2.26).
The project would provide financing to alleviate these deficiencies. The
lists of the proposed new equipment, spares, and machine tools for the four
Provinces are shown in Annex I, Tables 12-14. Small equipment for improving
labor intensive work is shown under the item light compacting equipment and
miscellaneous without detailing in order that E'IDs engineers, who so far have
had little experience in the use of such equiprient, would have an opportunity
to further review and analyze this equipment requirement prior to procurement.
The spare parts and assemblies for new equipment are estimated at 15% of the
value of new equipment, which would cover approximately the requirements for



- 22 -
4,000 working hours. To prevent over-ordering of slow moving spares and
ensure a balanced inventory, the acquisition of these spare parts should be in
at least three annual lots. Provision is made for acquisition of spare parts
for existing equipment. Also, the project would provide workshop equipment
and machine tools for all four Provinces, as well as a car and office equipment
for the Federal Coordinating Cell.
3.13      PIDs have a program for renting heavy equipment to qualified private
civil works contractors. This program would be encouraged to strengthen the
private civil works industry (para 4.05).
Technical Assistance (Base Cost US$3.0 M)
3.14      The Project would provide the following technical assistance (see
paras 5.07, 5.08 and 5.14 and Annex 1, Table 15 for detailed estimate of
costs);
(a) an expatriate specialist in warehouse operation and an
expatriate expert in equipment preventive maintenance and
repairing (about 36 man/months at about US$10,000 per m/m
including firm-s overhead, housing and travel);
(b)  two expatriate specialists to strengthen PIDs  0&M programs
and procedures (about 66 man/months at about US$10,000 per
m/m including firm-s overhead, housing and travel);
(c) local supervisory consultants (about 594 man/months at about
US$1500 per m/m including firm-s overhead, travel, housing
and support staff) to assist the Ministry of Water and Power
and PIDs in monitoring project progress and quality of work,
equipment, budgeting control, processing reimbursement ap-
plications, preparing reports and annual work programs; and
(d) qualified local organization to carry out an independent evalu-
ation of the project and assist PIDs in monitoring the project.
Training (Base Cost US$0.3 M)
3.15      The project would provide the following training:
(a) about 25 study tours to both technically advanced and developing
countries with comparable irrigation, surface drainage, and
flood protection facilities;
(b) in-country and on-the-job annual training on O&M programs and
procedures for about 900 officials and staff personnel with
the rank of Assistant Engineer and above;
(c) in-country and on-the-job training for staff members with
equipment workshop and warehouse responsibilities.



- 23 -
The appropriate technical experts (para 3.14) would assist the PIDs in develop-
ing and conducting the training programs (see Annex 1, Table 16 for detailed
estimate of training costs).
Supervision and Administration (Base Cost US$O,1M)
3.16     The project would provide funds for limited staffing of a Federal
Coordination Cell under the direction of the Chief Engineering Advisor located
in the Office of the Secretary of the Ministry of Water and Power (see para.
5.02 and detailed estimates of costs in Annex L, Table 17). PID staffs
involved in project supervision, administration, and engineering would be
funded as part of PIDs- establishment costs.
IV. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, AND PROCUREMENT
Cost Estimate and Schedule of Expenditures
4.01      Total project cost for the implementation period (July 1982 to June
1985) is estimated at about US$118.1 M equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of about US$32.1 M or 27%. Estimates are based on April 1982 prices
and include about US$10.8 M in taxes and duties. The cost of civil works is
based on: (a) recent costs of petty contracts at field sites; and (b) actual
cost of operating and maintaining PID equipment excluding depreciation.
Physical contingencies are assumed to be about 10% of technical assistance
and training. Physical contingencies not included for: (i) civil works
because of the highly divisible nature of the -:roject; and, (ii) equipment
because about 10% included for miscellaneous equipment items. Price contin-
gencies (%) are estimated as follows:
FY82     FY83      FY34     FY85      FY86
Foreign Costs        8.75       8.0      7.5       7.5       7.0
Local Costs         13.00      11.0     10.0       9.0       8.5
Estimated project costs, detailed in Annex 1, are summarized in Table 4.1.

Financing
4.02      The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 35.5 M (US$40 M) would finance about
47% of the foreign exchange cost, and about 33% of the local cost, or about
37% of the total project cost net of taxes and duties. It is expected that
the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) would cofinance an
additional US$45 M, which would fund 53% of the foreign exchange cost and
about 37% of the local cost or an additional 42% of the total project cost
net of taxes and duties. GOP and GO Provinces would finance the remaining
US$33.1 M equivalent, including taxes and duties from their budgetary
resources, which would amount to 28% of the total project cost. Approval
of the project's PC-Is by ECNEC and meeting all conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of USAID funding would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 4.2.

Procurement
4.03      Civil works and equipment would be procured for the project.
Procurement for civil works would be carried out by the PIDs. Equipment
and spares to be financed by USAID would be procured following USAID pro-
-cedures.
4.04      Because civil works would be seasonal and scattered over a wide
area, international competitive bidding (ICB) would not be practical.
Therefore, the project's civil works would be carried out in the following
manner: (a) local competitive bidding (LCB) by private contractors for about
65% of the earthwork, of which about 90% would be carried out by labor
intensive methods and about 10% by equipment working separately or in com-
bination with labor; (b) force account 1/ using PIDs' equipment for about 35%
of the earthwork; (c) force account for repair and replacement of hydraulic
structures; and, (d) LCB for construction of equipment facilities. LCB would
follow Provincial procedures, which are satisfactory to IDA. LCB contract
documents exceeding Rs 2.0 M would be sent to IDA for prior review to letting.
Force account rates for use of PIDs' equipment would be negotiated with IDA.
These rates would be based upon estimated actual operating costs, which would
exclude depreciation of equipment and spares as such items are provided by
the project.
4.05      There is need to encourage and strengthen the private civil works
contracting industry in Pakistan (para 2.25). Therefore, during the first
year of project implementation (FY83), about 1D% of the earthwork (Rs 8.0 M)
requiring equipment would be tendered using LCB procedures. To qualify as
a bidder for these tenders, a contractor would be required to have equipment
under his control that could complete at least 25% of the earthwork as
scheduled. The contractor would then be able to rent the additional required
equipment from PIDs following existing procedures (para 3.13). Assurances
have been obtained from GOP that the Federal Coordinating Cell (para 5.02),
assisted by the supervisory consultants (para 5.07), would review the first
year's operation of this program to strengthen the private civil works
contracting industry and prepare a report by September 1, 1983 of their
findings and recommendations for review and conment by IDA.
4.06      Procurement of equipment and spares would follow USAID procedures.
The Federal Coordinating Cell would liaise with PIDs to ensure that by June
1, 1982 specifications would be prepared and cDnsolidated for project related
equipment and machine tools. These specifications would then be made availa-
ble to USAID for its consideration. To facilitate the orderly procurement
of spares, and to minimize the possibility of Dver or under ordering of some
items, major spare orders would be placed in a minimum of three annual and
approximately equal lots. Bidders on equipment should include a suggested
list of spares required for the first two years of equipment operation. All
bids for spares should remain valid for one year. Procurement schedule and
breakdown of equipment, spares, and machine toAls to be procured are included
in Annex 1, Tables 12 to 14 and Annex 2, Tables 1 and 2.
1/   Carried out departmentally by PIDs following Provincial procedures.



- 26 -
Disbursements
4.07      Disbursements of the IDA credit would be made for:  (a) 70% of the
cost of civil works on schemes designated for IDA financing; and (b) 100% of
the cost of supervisory consultants and evaluation program. Disbursements
for (b) would be made against full documentation; whereas disbursement for
(a) would be made against statement of expenditures for all force account
work and completed contracts below Rs 300,000. For contracts of Rs 300,000
or more full documentation would be required. PIDs, assisted by the super-
visory consultants would be responsible for the initial preparation of IDA
reimbursement applications and these would be submitted to the Federal
Coordinating Cell. Following review by-the Cell, these applications would be
forwarded to IDA for reimbursement. Normally, reimbursement application
should cover accumulated reimburseable costs of Rs 500,000 or more. When
properly verified, reimbursement may be requested for civil works for partially
completed schemes undertaken by force account and contracts in excess of
Rs 300,000. The Cell would maintain consolidated budget control for the
project. It is anticipated that final disbursement for the project would be
made by December 31, 1985, about six months after the end of project implemen-
tation. Estimated IDA disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 1, Table 18.
This schedule is patterned after the disbursement profile of the 1976 Flood
Damage Restoration Project (Cr. 683-PAK), a comparable water sector project,
which was fully disbursed within 36 months of initiation of project work.
Accounts and Audits
4.08      PIDs and Federal Cell would be subject to normal GO Provinces and
GOP expenditures control and auditing procedures, which are considered satis-
factory. Project accounts would be maintained separately and in a readily
identifiable form by PIDs. The Federal Coordinating Cell would consolidate
the accounts from PIDs. Accounts would be audited separately from overall
accounts by an independent auditor on a timely basis. Assurances have been
obtained from GOP that (i) accounts would be audited annually and separately
by an independent auditor satisfactory to IDA (ii) copies of unaudited annual
project accounts would be sent to IDA for review not later than six months
after the end of each fiscal year, followed by certified copies of the audited
accounts and auditor-s report within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year;
and iii) the auditor's report would include, inter alia, a statement that
funds disbursed against statements of expenditure had been used for the
purposes for which they were provided.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
Institutional Arrangements
5.01      The Federal Ministry of Water and Power would be responsible for
project coordination between the Ministry and each of the PIDs, as well as
among the PIDs. The PIDs would be executing agencies for the project.



- 27 -
5.02      Federal Coordinating Cell.  By July 31, 1982, the Ministry of Water
and Power would organize a Federal Coordinating Cell in the office of the
Chief Engineering Advisor to ensure the effective implementation, coordination
and supervision of the project (see Organizational Chart - Plate V). This
Cell would be headed by a senior officer (Chief Engineer or equivalent rank)
designated as Project Coordinator, who would report directly to the Chief
Engineering Advisor. He would be assisted by an accountant, appropriate
support staff, and Supervisory consultants. The Cell's major responsibili-
ties would be: (a) general supervision and monitoring of project activities;
(b) preparing consolidated specifications of equipment, spares, and machine
tools (para 4.06); (c) reviewing program to strengthen private civil contract-
ing industry and prepare report to IDA by September 1, 1983 (para 4.05);
(d) reviewing PIDs annual Work Plans 1/ to determine consistency with project
targets and Implementation Schedule (Annex 4) and preparing consolidated
Annual Project Work Plan for submission to IDA by March 31 of each year;
(e) reviewing IDA reimbursement applications as prepared by PIDs and submit-
ting them to IDA; (f) reviewing PIDs' Quarterly and Annual Progress Reports
and preparing consolidated project reports for submission to IDA within 60
days of end of each reporting period; (g) preparing Project Completion Report
within six months of the completion date of the project; and (h) reviewing
PIDs' accounts, maintaining consolidated accounts for the project and arranging
for required audit (para 4.08).
5.03      Provincial Irrigation Departments.  PIDs would be responsible for
implementing this project, which would mainly include: (a) selecting schemes
to be rehabilitated based upon agreed criteria (para 3.08 and 3.09); (b) prep-
aring plans and detailed design for schemes to be rehabilitated in line with
agreed specifications (para 3.04); (c) executi ng required civil works and
project facilities; (d) preparing specifications for all project related
equipment, spares and machine tools by April L, 1982; (e) operating and main-
taining systems; (f) monitoring of project progress and maintenance of separate
accounts for the project; (g) certifying quantity and quality of completed
project work; (h) preparing IDA reimbursement applications with the assistance
of the supervisory consultants; (i) preparing Quarterly and Annual Progress
Reports for the project and submitting them to the Federal Coordinating Cell
within 30 days of the close of each reporting period; and (j) preparing an
Annual Provincial Project Work Plan by March 1. of each year to be included in
the Cell's consolidated Annual Work Plan and t:o serve as basis of allocation
for the project in the succeeding year's Provincial ADP. Such Annual Work
Plan would include, among other things, an annual O&M Program of Work (para.
5.10), and a list of proposed schemes to be rehabilitated, as well as a
designation of anticipated source of external financing (para. 3.08).
1/   Annual Work Plan as referred to in this project would include, among
other things, the following documents pepared by PIDS: (i) annual
project request for inclusion in the Provincial ADP; (ii) description
of schemes to be rehabilitated; and (iii) annual O&M Program of Work
(para 5.10).



- 28 -
5.04      Each Provincial Irrigation Department is headed by a Secretary.
He is assisted by the secretariat staff in his office and a number of Chief
Engineers who supervise field operations in the various regions. Regional
commands are further subdivided into Circles, Divisions, Sub-Divisions and
Sections under the respective jurisdictions of Superintending Engineers,
Executive Engineers (Xen), Assistant Engineers, and Sub-Engineers (see PIDs
Organizational Charts, Plates VI to IX). Generally, the Division or Sub-
Divisional Officer in charge of the canal is entrusted with the O&M of drains
and flood protection works within his jurisdiction. However, Sub-Engineers
and their staff (mates, gauge readers and beldars) are assigned to a reach
of a canal, flood protection bund, or drain. During flood season, staff
assigned to canals and drains are reassigned to duties of flood watching
and fighting. To take care of revenue work in Punjab and NWFP, a Canal
Collector is attached to every Regional Chief Engineer. The Canal Collector
is assisted by Deputy Collectors, Zilladars and Patwaris. In Sind and
Baluchistan, assessments of water charges and land revenues are entrusted
to the Provincial Revenue Department.
5.05      To facilitate project implementation, each PID Secretary would
designate a Chief Engineer as the Provincial Project Coordinator. This
officer would monitor project progress within the Department, assist the
Secretary of the PID in carrying out responsibilities described in para 5.03,
and coordinate PID's activities with the Federal Coordinating Cell.
5.06      The Federal Flood Commission (FCC), established in early 1977
following the two disastrous floods of 1973 and 1976, is chaired by the
Chief Engineering Advisor of the Ministry of Water and Power. FFC's chief
function is to administer the overall flood protection program through
the Federal Annual Development Program (ADP). Rehabilitation of flood pro-
tection facilities would not be financed in this project (para 3.01). How-
ever, certain equipment procured under this project would be used by PIDs
in rehabilitating, operating, and maintaining flood protection facilities.
Cooperation and coordination between FFC and this project should be good
with the Federal Coordination Cell reporting to the Chief Engineering Ad-
visor, who is also Chairman of FFC.
5.07      Technical Assistance.  The project would provide about 594 man/
months of local supervisory consultants plus supporting staff as follows:
Profession                No.              Man/Months
Project Manager            1 (part-time)        9

This team of supervisory consultants would report to the Project Coordinator
in the Federal Coordinating Cell and would assist the Cell and PIDs in car-
rying out their responsibilities. Terms of Reference of the supervisory
consultants are included in Annex 3. Services to be performed by these
consultants include: (a) review plans and desi-gns for civil works to assure
compliance with agreed criteria and specifical:ions; (b) spot check civil
works during construction and check all completed works to determine quantity
of work completed and if quality meets PIDs- specifications (c) assist PIDs
and Cell in preparation of IDA reimbursement applications; (d) make an
evaluation of the efficiency of equipment usage and maintenance, and quality
of construction work for inclusion in Project Completion Report; and (e)
assist the Cell in: (i) preparing report on strengthening the civil works
contracting industry (para 4.05); (ii) montori.ng progress of project to
determine status of project in relation to Implementation Schedule (Annex
4); (iii) preparing consolidated Quarterly and Annual Progress Reports and
Project Completion Report; (iv) preparing consolidated Annual Project Work
Plan; and (v) maintaining centralized budget control.
5.08      The project would provide about 102 man/months of expatriate
consultants to assist PIDs in strengthening: (a) workshop and warehouse
operations; and (b) O&M programs and procedures as relate to civil works.
Two specialists would be appointed by GOP (about 18 man/months each) to
assist PIDs in warehouse operation and equipment preventive maintenance
and repair. Their major duties would include introducing appropriate tech-
nologies and procedures for workshop and warehouse operations, equipment
preventive maintenance, and monitoring equipment operations, repairs, and
maintenance as well as implementing a program of organized staff training
for workshop and warehouse personnel. Similarly, two O&M specialists would
be appointed by GOP (about 33 man/months each) to assist the PIDs in im-
proving O&M programs and procedures. Specifically, they would assist each
PID in undertaking a review and analysis of ongoing OMI activities with a
view to preparing an O&M Program of Work which would indicate the nature and
amount of work required to adequately and appropriately operate and maintain
all facilities assigned to the PID and related requirements of manpower and
financial resources. An O&M Program of Work for each PID would be completed
by March 1 of each year be included in each Province's Annual Project Work
Plan (para 5.03). In addition, these specialists would assist the PIDs in
developing and carrying out an O&M training program for their officials and
staff.
5.09      Assurances have been obtained from GOP that it would employ suitably
qualified consultants for the assignment described in paras 5.07 and 5.08 and
in accordance with time schedules (expatriate experts by December 31, 1982)
and terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA and in accordance with the prin-
ciples and procedures described in the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing Agency" as published
by the Bank in August 1984. As a condition of effectiveness, GOP would enter
into an agreement with a local firm for supplying the Supervisory Consultants.



- 30 -
Operation and Maintenance
5.10      GO Provinces would provide PIDs with a phased increase of funds
(see Table 5.1) to carry out an accelerated and improved O&M program on the
irrigation, surface drainage, and flood protection systems so as to ensure
the effective operation and sustained maintenance of the facilities. Each
year during the project period, PIDs would prepare an Annual Provincial Work
Plan (para 5.03), which would include a section detailing the O&M Program
of Work. This section would specify the type of activities proposed to be
undertaken over the whole system and would identify segments of canals, drains
and bunds to receive special maintenance, including reaches to be desilted
and related requirements of manpower, equipment and financial resources.
5.11      Annual O&M activities would be carefully monitored, analyzed and
evaluated by PIDs with the objective of improving management and implementing
procedures. Items to be analyzed and reviewed include: maintenance, priori-
ties, frequencies and schedules; and work procedures and controls. Inspec-
tion procedures, reports and follow-up also would be reviewed. In addition,
the organization, management control, review process and control and communi-
cation channels would be looked at. To assist in formulating and evaluating
the annual O&M programs, the project would provide several expatriate experts
in O&M irrigation system management (para 5.08).
5.12      Table 5.1 summarizes current and an estimated target of incremental
funds required for O&M of canal, surface drainage, and flood protection bunds
but exclude funds needed to operate and maintain public TWs. Activities
which are expected to be emphasized with increased O&M funds are: special
repair of canal banks, desilting of canals, cleaning surface drains and a
better supply of required materials for these activities. Increase in
permanent staff and labor would be kept to a minimum. Equipment would be
emphasized, especially for activities which should be accomplished in a very
short time as necessitated by system operations. Activities and estimated
amount of work proposed to be carried out with targeted level of O&M funds
are included in Annex 5, Tables 1-5.

The substantial increase in O&M required in Punjab reflects the current
depressed funding for canal O&M that has resuLted mainly from large expend-
iture for operating public TWs (Rs 316M in FY81). Assurances have been
obtained from GOP and GO Provinces that all nacessary effort would be made
to secure legislative approval to reach, in real terms, the above FY85
targeted level of funds for PIDs- O&M activities for the surface irrigation,
surface drainage, and flood protection facilities, or levels appropriately
modified, in agreement with IDA, based on revised O&M needs as reflected in
the annual O&M Programs of Work (paras 5.08 and 5.10).
Monitoring and Evaluation
5.13      Monitoring.  PIDs would have the responsibility of collecting,
reviewing, and monitoring information regarding the physical and financial
aspects of the project. They would prepare Quarterly and Annual Progress
Reports and submit to the Cell within 30 days of the end of the reporting
period. This program would provide project management with early warning
signals regarding current and/or potential implementation problems and the
status and progress of the project as related to the envisioned Implementation
Schedule (Annex 4).
5.14      Evaluation would concentrate on assessing the impact of the pro-
ject-s major components on: greater assurance of water deliveries, improved
equity of deliveries, and increased effectiveness of drainage rehabilitation,
as well as farmer's response to project improvements. The evaluation would be
carried out by an independent unit. The experience and capability of WAPDA-s
Alluvial Canal Observation Project (ACOP) appears to make it a satisfactory
organization to undertake such work. The project evaluation would be based
on inputs and information collected by the PIDs and supplemented by ACOP's
own data collection program. ACOP would arrange, as appropriate, assistance
from other organization for the required economic and financial analysis.
ACOP would prepare a program of work for this evaluation and submit it
through the Federal Coordinating Cell for the review and approval of IDA and
USAID by September 30, 1982. Also, ACOP would prepare biannual progress
reports and a final Project Evaluation Report to be submitted to the Cell and
to IDA within two and four months respectively of the close of each reporting
period. In addition, the supervisory consultants would evaluate the effi-
ciency of equipment usage and maintenance, arLd the quality of construction
work.
5.15      Both monitoring and evaluation activities would be under the super-
vision of the Federal Coordinating Cell.  AsEurances have been obtained from
GOP that the Cell would undertake evaluation on terms and conditions satis-
factory to IDA. It is expected that the Cell, would contract with WAPDA-s
ACOP by December 31, 1982 to undertake the project evaluation work.
Implementation Schedule
5.16      Project implementation is scheduled for three years, FY83-85 (see
Implementation Schedule, Annex 4). Construct:ion of rehabilitated civil works



- 32 -
would be distributed in a three-year time slice with a 10 percent annual in-
crease in work accomplishment envisioned. This workload is well within the
existing capacities of PIDs, which would be supplemented by equipment to be
provided under the project. Funding in the NDB for O&M of canals, drainage
and flood protection facilities would be increased to meet the FY85 targeted
funding envisioned for O&M, or levels appropriately modified in agreement
with IDA as reflected in the annual O&M Program of Work to be prepared by
PIDs (para 5.10-5.12). Procurement of equipment would be accomplished mainly
during the first two years of the project. Spares would be procured in a
minimum of three approximately equal annual lots to assure the timely acqui-
sition of required spares. Expatriate consultants would be appointed by GOP
within the first three months following project effectiveness and appointment
of supervisory consultants would be a condition of effectiveness (para 5.09).
VI.  PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND PRICES, FARM INCOME AND COST RECOVERY
Agricultural Impact
6.01      The project would increase agricultural production by reducing the
risk of failure and improving the reliability and distribution of water
supplies of the irrigation systems through the rehabilitation of selected
irrigation and surface drainage subsystems commanding about 9.4 M ac in all
four Provinces. To assure sustained and continued project benefits from a
safe, efficient, and effective system's operation, the project would provide
technical assistance to strengthen PIDs institutional capacity and their
ability to implement an accelerated O&M program.
6.02      Due to inadequate maintenance of canals and drains, farmers now face
an irregular and unreliable supply of irrigation water and inundation of crops
(para 2.19). Based on review of PID's records of the 45 canals during the
period July 1973 through December 1977, it was determined that on average,
about 7% of the cca suffered annual interruptions of canal water supplies due
to canal breaks and closures for emergency repairs. However, PID officials
indicated that probably no more than 40% of the breaches were reported by
field staff because of a desire to keep reported breaches to a minimum for
public relations and professional considerations. This under-reporting was
verified by field visits of the appraisal mission. Consequently, it is
estimated that about 12% of the cca on an average annual basis is adversely
affected by breaches and canal closures. These interruptions occur throughout
the year but they are more frequent during the kharif season.
6.03      It is expected that "without the project" the system-s deteriorat-
ing condition would continue with the acreage adversely affected by branches
increasing from 12 to 15% of the total cca by FY88. To a lesser extent, the
unreliable and inequitable distribution of water supplies would continue to
have an unfavorable production impact on a larger portion of the cca. Although
there is no firm data showing the production impact of the system-s deterior-



- 33 -
ation, available information 1/ suggests that without the proposed project
improvements, it is reasonable to expect a moderate decrease of about 2 to 5%
in both yields and cropping intensities relatLve to present levels. In
Baluchistan, the yields would decrease up to !0%. It is expected that "with
the project" the cca adversely affected by breaches would be reduced to about
2% annually.  Available information suggests -hat a large portion of the cca
would also benefit from moderate production increases due to the system's
improved reliability and distribution of water supplies. Experience in other
irrigation projects in Pakistan indicates that the project's proposed improve-
ments should induce some increased input utilization and lead to improved water
distribution, especially to watercourses locaLed at the tail end of minors and
distributaries. Even though no increase in total water supply is envisioned
because of the project activities in the Indu3 System (Punjab, NWFP, and
Sind Province), the combined effect of these improvements would result in
modest increases of about 2 to 5% for both yields and cropping intensities.
However, in Baluchistan, it is expected that rehabilitation of small irriga-
tion schemes would result in an increase in water supply, which would increase
the current yields by about 30% and annual cropping intensities from the
current 25% to about 40%.
6.04      The estimated present and projected future production levels of the
main crops at full development (1988) are summarized in Table 6.1. Tables 6
and 7 in Annex 5 provide additional details on yields, cropping intensities,
input requirements, and selected financial crop budgets.

Marketing and Pricing
6.05      Pakistan-s marketing arrangements vary by commodity, and to a lesser
extent by Province. Current marketing and milling facilities are considered
adequate to handle the project's expected incremental inputs and outputs. GOP
has an ongoing program to expand storage capacity, especially for foodgrains.
6.06      Currently about 60% of Pakistan's wheat production is for on-farm
consumption. The remaining production is marketed about equally in the public
and private sectors. In the public system, the Provincial Food Directorates
and Pakistan's Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation buys grain at
fixed prices from producers and private traders. Although grain prices fluc-
tuate seasonally and regionally within the private system, this variation is
narrowed because of GOP's pricing policies. GOP aims to reach wheat self-
sufficiency in the mid-1980s and to be a net exporter of wheat by the end of
this decade. Approximately 50% of Pakistan-s paddy production is consumed
on-farm, whereas about 85% of the marketable surplus, mainly Basmati quality,
is exported through the State-owned Rice Export Corporation of Pakistan.
Producers sell most of their paddy to husking mills, which are primarily
privately operated. Cotton and sugarcane are sold, either directly or through
an intermediary, to ginneries and mills. Ginned cotton is partly consumed
domestically with the rest exported by the Pakistan Export Corporation. In
areas where there is no sugar mill, sugarcane is often processed by the
farmer into gur. Other project outputs would be absorbed through farm family
consumption and local and domestic urban markets. With anticipated increases
in real income of about 3% p.a., project induced production, not exported,
should be absorbed readily by the domestic market.
6.07      Most agricultural prices in Pakistan are influenced by GOP's inter-
vention through import/export controls, taxes, consumer/producer subsidies,
and fixed procurement prices. To encourage use of agricultural inputs, and
to compensate for procurement prices, which are lower than international
prices, GOP has provided heavy subsidies on fertilizer and other agricultural
inputs. However, in the spring of 1980, GOP announced a reorientation of its
agricultural price policies. These policies are aimed to reduce input subsi-
dies, to provide adequate incentives to producers through periodic and approp-
riate output price adjustments, and to transfer responsibility from the public
to the private sector for appropriate marketing operations. Measures taken
during FY81 include: (a) 50% increases in retail prices of fertilizer; (b)
25% increase in margins allowed to fertlizer dealers other than cooperatives,
and a nearly 50% increase for cooperatives; (c) privatization of the import
and distribution of pesticides, and the elimination of the pesticides subsidy
in Punjab and Sind and in the other two Provinces over the next three years;
(d) increases in crop support prices during FY81 ranging from 9% to 29%.
Further, GOP has increased support prices of cotton and rice for FY82 and the
Agricultural Price Commission is currently reviewing the price of fertilizer
and prices of other major agricultural commodities with the view of recommend-
ing adequate price readjustments for FY82. At the same time, GOP continues
to emphasize its current policy of ensuring adequate and timely support of
key agricultural inputs and services.

Water Charges
6.08      A fundamental objective of the proposed project is to ensure the
safe, efficient, and effective operation of the irrigation system on a sus-
tained and continuous basis through the rehabiLitation of selected schemes
and providing an adequate and properly funded O&M program. Historically all
improvements to the system, and recently a portion of O&M costs, have been
financed by GOP. Even so, inadequacy of funds for O&M has caused a serious
deterioration over the entire system.
6.09      A major reason for the inadequacy of O&M funds is the low level of
water charges, which since the mid-seventies have supplied revenues totaling
about 70% of O&M expenditures, even though these expenditures have been quite
inadequate (paras 2.21-2.24). Water charges in Pakistan are imposed on acre-
age basis and vary with the crops grown each season. Currently water charges
represent only about 6% of the net per acre income of crops. Though rates vary
substantially among crops, this variation has little relationship with the
consumptive crop water requirement. Hence current water rates have little
effect on the mix of crops grown by farmers.
6.10      Under current water conditions there is little or no flexibility
in adjusting irrigation water supplies to meet crop water requirements. Water
supplied through the system fluctuate in response to variations in river flows
and are subject to extreme curtailment or cut-Dff of service when canals break
due to poor maintenance or need to be closed for emergency or annual repairs
(paras 2.15 and 2.16). Therefore, farmers' efforts to maximize returns from
their land and labor are stymied by constraints of water availability and
severe inefficiencies in the water distribution system. In such circumstances
water rates have serious limitations as instrunents for optimizing water
utilization. However, this project should significantly reduce some of the
inefficiencies in individual subsystems/schemes to be rehabilitated and to
some extent over the entire irrigation system through improvements in the
annual O&M program. Since there is evidence of considerable water being
wasted during deliveries to farms and fields 1/, it appears that significant
increases in water rates would result in improved water utilization by indi-
vidual farmers and at the same time provide required funds to adequately
finance an appropriate level of O&M expenditures. Pakistan Economic
Development Institute in its recent study, "Structure of Water Charges in
Pakistan" 2/ has attempted to determine an adequate level of water charges.
After assessing the value of water and farmers ability to pay, it concluded
that water rates should represent 12 to 15% of net per acre income which
would imply an increase over current rates of 100 to 150% in real terms.
6.11      In recent years, GOP and IDA have held continuous dialogue on
the subject of water charges; including current discussion relating to the
1/   Improvements within individual watercourses envisioned in the recently
approved Pakistan On-Farm Water Management Project (Cr. 1163-PAK).

proposed Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL). Also, this issue has been dis-
cussed between GOP and IMF as part of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agree-
ment. During these discussions, GOP manifested its intention to introduce a
phased increase in water charges in order to cover the full O&M costs of the
irrigation facilities. However to achieve an adequate level of O&M funding
for canals, surface drains, and flood protection works, while at the same time
not causing undue disruptions in other priority activities funded in the NDB,
it would be imperative for GOP and GO Provinces not only to increase water
charges but also to initiate a TW divesting program for transferring public
operation of TW in the FGW zones to the private sector (para 2.23). Since
the mid-1970s, an increasing proportions of O&M funding has been directed
to public TWs O&M (see Table 2.5), even though the TWs are operated only
at about 35% of installed capacity. The accelerated increases in public
TW O&M costs would be exacerbated in the future because of envisioned
increases in energy costs and additions of new units to the system. Under
a certain set of assumptions, Annex 5, Table 9 shows the estimated Provin-
cial O&M funds that would be required to operate and maintain about 10,275
currently operating TWs as well as about 900 new TWs in the FGW zones sched-
uled to be transferred from WAPDA to PIDs in FY83 and the 340 TWs that
WAPDA officials estimate would be added annually in the SGW zones beginning
in FY83. Consistent with RAP recommendations, and IDA discussions with
GOP as part of SAL, it was assumed in this program that TWs operation would
be increased from the current 35 to 60% of installed capacity. Under such
a scenario, the total requirement for TW O&M costs during FY85 would be
Rs 1,026.0 M or an increase of about 150% over FY81. Such increase would be
extremely difficult for GOP Provinces, especially Punjab and Sind to finance.
6.12      Consistent with RAP's recommendations and recent discussions of
GOP with IDA and IMF, GOP has initiated a study for a SCARP Transition
Program 1/ with the view to recommending an accelerated plan of action for
TW divesting in the FGW zones. Therefore in the O&M projections prepared
as part of this project, it is estimated that GOP and GO Provinces would
start a TW divesting program during FY84. Thus, public TWs O&M financial
requirements would increase through FY85 to about Rs 800 M (in constant
1981 currency values) and would decrease significantly thereafter and level
out about Rs 400 M during FY90-92. However, if the divesting program for
TWs in the FGW zones is not initiated, the estimated annual TW O&M cost in
real terms by FY92 would increase by about Rs 800 M to about Rs 1,200 M.
The flow of funds required for O&M of irrigation works based upon the above
assumptions are detailed in Annex 5, Table 9 and summarized in Table 6.2 for
the project period.

6.13      Based on the O&M estimates in Table 6.2 and assuming:  (a) water
charges were to be increased at a minimum rate of 25% per year (10 to 15% in
real terms) 1/; and, (b) GOP and GO Provinces start a TW divesting program of
at least 12% per year by FY84, such water charges would represent a constant
portion of the funding for the accelerated O&M expenditures during the
life of the project. Assuming continued divesl:ing of TWs at 12% annually and
based upon the estimated target levels of O&M ifunding in Annex 5, Table 9, it
would be possible for GO Provinces to reduce substantially the increases in
water charges after FY85 and still achieve a positive cash flow by FY92 of
such revenues in meeting estimated O&M funding requirements. Such a financial
program would enable full O&M recovery through water charges and/or other
appropriate financial arrangement, such as drainage assessments, in line
with existing covenants in other IDA financed projects) (i.e SCARP-Khairpur,
SCARP-VI, and SCARP Mardan). Assurances have been obtained from GOP and
GO Provinces that: (i) SCARP Transition Project preparation study as ini-
tiated by GOP would be completed enabling discussions with IDA by July 1,
1983 on the study's findings and recommendations, and program to implement
recommendations; and (ii) water charges would be periodically increased in
real terms at levels sufficient to cover an increasing portions at an agreed
stepped-up O&M program of the irrigation system so as to achieve a full O&M
recovery through water charges and/or other me:hod of appropriate financial
arrangements in line with existing covenants in IDA financed projects (SCARP-
Khairpur (Cr. 648-PAK) Sind, SCARP VI (Cr. 754--PAK) Punjab, and SCARP-Mardan
(Cr. 877-PAK) NWFP, and by 1992 for Baluchistan.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUST:[FICATION
7.01      The project aims to increase agricul:ural production and farm
incomes on existing irrigation subsystems and small irrigation schemes which
1/   Water rates have been increased 25% annuaLly in Pakistan in three out
of the last four years.



- 38 -
have deteriorated due to inadequate maintenance and repair. The emphasis
on rehabilitation is appropriate in light of Pakistan's financial problems
since benefits from the project would be expected to flow from the first
year following commencement of investments. About 900,000 to 1,000,000
farm families would have their income supplemented because the project
would provide: (a) a greater assurance of irrigation water for crop produc-
tion by reducing the risk of canal failure and (b) reduced rain flooding
damage to crops through improved surface drainage. Also the project would
provide a more equitable irrigation water supply to all farmers within a
system/subsystem by increasing deliveries to watercourse located in the
tail reaches of minors and distributories. This would be achieved by empha-
sizing silt removal activities in these reaches. The project should help
to reduce regional imbalances since project beneficiaries are widely spread
throughout the country. The main benefits arising from the project are
summarized below:
Benefiting farm families                  700,000 to 800,000
Benefiting command area                   9.5 M ac
Increase in per capita income             5 to 20%
Increase in farm employment               15 M mandays/year
Employment and Distributive Effects
7.02      Overall direct employment effect would largely arise from increase
in input utilization on land already cropped. At full development, employ-
ment would increase from about 195 M mandays currently to 210 M mandays per
year, which is equivalent to approximately 62,000 additional full time jobs.
Construction of the civil works would create a total of about 8 M mandays
of employment during the course of the project implementation, primarily
for unskilled labor. The value added in agriculture plus the increase in
input requirements should also generate indirect employment opportunities
for farm families with excess family labor and for landless families.
7.03      By removing sediment from minors and distributaries, the project
would bring about a more equitable distribution of irrigation water which
would tend to decrease income disparities within a subsystem/system. How-
ever, since all direct benefits of project works would come from increased
farm productivity, the distribution of benefits would largely follow the
existing pattern of land ownership and to some extent location of farmers
in the irrigation distribution system. Thus, two-thirds of intended bene-
ficiaries would be small farmers operating less than 12.5 ac and with
estimated per capita income below Pakistan's average per capita income of
US$300. In addition, improved distribution of water supplies provided by
project activities should generate relatively higher production benefits
for farmers on tail-end watercourses along minors and distributaries.
Normally, such farmers tend to have lower than average incomes than do
other farmers with comparable holdings and operations.
Direct Foreign Exchange Effect
7.04      Based on projected 1990 international prices, expressed in January
1981 currency units, the annual gross foreign exchange value of incremental
production of tradables is estimated at about US$266 M in PV terms. Most of



- 39 -
this would be derived from the production of cotton, wheat and rice. After
adjusting for foreign exchange costs of traded recurrent inputs of about
US$36 M (PV) the project identifiable direct foreign exchange impact would
total about US$230 M (PV).
Environmental Impact
7.05      The project is expected to have a beneficial environmental impact
through decreases of flooding from canal and clogging drains and reduction
in breeding areas for mosquitos.
Assumptions of the Economic Analysis
7.06      To assess the benefits of the rehabi:Litation works to be carried
out by the PID-s, the project area has been divided into five sub-areas
using representative subsystem/schemes. They are based on Pakistan's varied
agro-climatic conditions and type of rehabilitation work proposed to be
undetaken on a specific subsystem or small scheme. The agricultural assumption
used for the economic analysis are presented in Tables 6 and 7, Annex 5.
Proposed rehabilitation work were analyzed on i:hree different levels: sub-
system, Province, and project (see Table 7.1, and Annex 5, Table 10).
7.07      The economic analysis is based on the following assumptions:
(a) Project life and phasing. The life of rehabilitation works
would be 20 years, although the proposed level of O&M
activities would ensure a longer working life. As each
individual system, subsystem would be implemented in three
years build-up of benefits were estimated at 40%, 70%, 90%,
100% in the first to fourth year fol:Lowing commencement of
rehabilitation works. Project full development would be
attained by 1988.
(b)  Prices.  For internationally-traded goods, prices were derived
from the Bank's projected world market prices expressed in
June 1981 currency values. Appropriate adjustments were
made for freight, handling, processing and quality differences.
Local costs and locally valued benefits were expressed in
border rupees, through application oi appropriate conversion
factors, the principal ones being the Standard Conversion
Factor of 0.9 and a Construction Conversion Factor of 0.85.
Given the regional differences in Pakistan-s labor market and
the limited availability of information, the analysis used on
overall weighted average water rate for rural unskilled labor.
To account for market seasonality of labor demand the market
wage rate for unskilled rural labor was adjusted by a con-
version factor of 0.8 during slack period; during peak
employment period economic wage rate was assumed to be equal
to the financial wage rate. Year - specific prices have been
used for inputs and outputs over 1982-1990, after which 1990
prices were assumed to remain unchanged. Prices used in the
analyses are shown in Annex 5, Table 8.

(c) Benefits. Incremental crop benefits are based on the assump-
tion presented in paras 6.01-6.04. Yields and cropping
intensities "without the project" are assumed to decrease
by about 2 to 5% over a four year period; "with the project",
these agricultural parameters are expected to increase in the
range of 2 to 5% over a similar build-up period. In the case
of Baluchistan Province, the increased water supplies provided
by the project would lead to a significant increase in yields
and cropping intensities (about 30 and 60%, respectively).
(d) Economic Project Costs. Rehabilitation costs per subsystem/
scheme are based on preliminary PID estimates for possible
schemes to be rehabilitated under the project, and incre-
mental O&M costs on PID-s and mission estimates accounting
mainly for greater emphasis on desilting operations and
special repairs of canals, drains and bunds. A construction
and O&M conversion factor of 0.85 and a capital goods con-
version factors of 0.70 was applied to reflect the assumed
weighted average share of unskilled labor, and tradable
and non-tradable items.
(e) Farm Production Costs. Production costs includes all incre-
mental input requirements (see Table 7, Annex 5). Total farm
labor, including family labor, was assessed according to the
economic wages discussed in (b) above. Adjustments were made
in the crop production costs streams to reflect realistically
the staggered occurrence of costs and accrual of benefits
relating to farm activities.
7.08      Based on the assumptions summarized in para 7.07, and on the
analysis of specific subsystems/schemes, the provincial economic rates of
return (ERR) range from 22 to 65%, with an overall project average exceeding
50% and a net present value of about Rs 4,400 M.  Annex 5, Table 10 presents
a summary of the projects economic results according to subsystem, Province,
and project. As would be expected for rehabilitation projects, especially
those that involve deferred maintenance activities, the high ERR's show that
rehabilitation works are justified in all areas proposed to be benefitted by
the project. The variations in ERR are mainly due to variations in agro-
climatic zones and availability of irrigation water. In general, ERR-s tend
to be higher for areas where the system is in the greatest degree of deteriora-
tion and where water supplies are most unreliable and unevenly distributed
(Punjab and Sind Provinces). In addition, higher returns are also observed
for areas with higher value crops grown during the kharif season (for example,
cotton in Sind Province).
Project Risk and Sensitivity Test
7.10      The overall scope and phasing of the project is in line with
expected GOPs and GO Provinces allocations for the project. However as
experienced in other projects in Pakistan, financial constraints are possible
in one or all four Provinces, which would necessitate adjustments in the



- 41 -
proposed targets during project implementation. Since the project is highly
divisible (para 3.01), this situation could be readily accommodated through
(a) reduction in the number of subsystems/schemes to be rehabilitated under
the project or (b) extension of the project implementation period. If these
changes were to occur, they should affect costs and benefits in similar pro-
portions, leading to a corresponding reduction in the project-s net present
value (NPV), with minimum changes in the overaLl ERR.
7.11      As in the case of similar rehabilita:ion projects elsewhere, invest-
ment costs are small relative to the total flow of incremental benefits and
recurrent costs over the project life. Therefore, the economic viability of
the proposed rehabilitation works is less sensitive to changes in the cost
of rehabilitation works than to changes in the assumptions concerning the
project's benefits. Switching values (benefits; and costs) for a set of
adverse conditions on the principal benefit var-iables are illustrated in Table
7.1. The most critical variable is the size oi' the benefitted area. Even so,
if the base case benefitted area is cut in hall', the project's ERR would be
34%. Assuming a simultaneous and significant decrease in both area benefitted
and "with the project" yields, the project-s ERR still would be about 26%.
These sensitivity tests show that the ERR's for each subsystem/scheme under
a set of adverse assumptions ensure that the project would remain viable in
all areas proposed to be rehabilitated under the project. There is some risk
of selecting certain sub-optimal subsystems/schemes meeting the agreed criteria
because of the variability in conditions of individual subsystem/schemes.
These variables would affect (a) effectiveness of the O&M program in keeping
the risk of canal failure to a minimum while inproving the irrigation water
delivery, and (b) optimum timing of rehabilitat:ion for any particular scheme.
Nevertheless, if the accelerated O&M program proves successful in improving
effective irrigation water supplies, the projected benefits would be greater
than assumed. Moreover, the cost ceiling criteria (paras 3.08 and 3.09) for
rehabilitating subsystems/scheme provide a safety factor to ensure that all
subsystems/schemes included under the project remain economically viable.

1/ Crop budgets are based on the major crops and on projectionsof financial prices (to 1990).  The input/output assumptions are based on
RAP's survey of 2,000 farmers and on mission estimates. The first four crops refer to Punjab, Sind, and NWF Provinces. The last
crop budget (wheat) refers to the higher yields assumed for Baluchistan. For further details on cropping patterns and yields for
each subsystem/scheme, see Table 6 in Annex 5.
2/ Input requirements for future without project are assumed to remain the same as present, even with the assumed decrease in yields.
3/ Includes payment to family labor (at the prevailing market wage rate).
4/ Excludes payment to family labor. Budgets assume that on average about 90% of labor requirements are provided by family labor.

1/ Based on Tables 1-5, Annex 5 (Includes distribution, surface drainage and flood protection facilities)
2/  Assumes 13% during 1982, 11% 1983, 10% 1984, 9% 1985, and 8.5% thereafter
3/  Based on 10,275 operating TWs (1982) and 900 to be added in 1983 with assumed individual TW annual O&M of Rs 54,100 (1982),
Rs 58,500 (1983), Rs 69,300 (1984), and Rs 82,800 thereafter to achieve increased operating capacity from current 365
to 60% in 1985 and thereafter
4/ Assumes 12% annual divesting rate of TWs in FGW beginnig in 1984
5/  Based on 1,300 operating TWs (1981) in SGW and same assumptions as in 3/
6/  Assumes addition of 340 TWs annually in SGW beginning in 1983, with a total of 4700 TWs (WAPDA's estimate) to be installed
through 1992
7/  Same as 2/ with 3% annual real increment added for increased cost of electricity
8/  Assumes SGW O&M financed through drainage assessments with water charges increasing at a normal rate of 25% through 1985
and 10% thereafter
9/  Assumes all irrigation system 0&M to be eventually financed through water charges with nominal rate of increase of 25%
through 1985, 20% in 1986, and 15% thereafter
10/ Additional cost of Rs 2,683 M in 1992 if TWa in FGW are not divested -- increase in annual water charges at 25% nominal
rate would be required to give positive cash flow for surface and FGW supplies in 1991 and entire system in 1992.

1/ The subsystem/scheme ERR differs from the provincial returns because of a
variation in the investment cost per acre benefitted used for the aggregate
analysis.
2/ A 12% discount rate is assumed to be the Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC)
for Pakistan.
3/ Switching value is the percentage change in the specific stream (benefit or
cost) that reduces the NPV to zero at a rate equal to the OCC.
