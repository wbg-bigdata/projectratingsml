                  any amount of the Loan has not been used for the
                  purpose of the Project in which case the amount

                  indirectly, the acquisition of portions of the
                  Collateral and (2) the remaining amount of the
                  Collateral, less: (A) any amounts which have been
                  previously prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.08
                  (a) (ii); and (B) any amounts which would have
                  been subject to such prepayment but for the
                  provision of the following sentence. The
                  provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if
                  the Borrower establishes, to the satisfaction of
Page  5
                  the Bank, that the amount of such Collateral so
                  released has been or will be used to support
                  further debt or debt service reduction activities
                  of the Borrower.
          (iii)   The pledge of the Collateral shall have ceased to

                  behalf of the holders of Collateralized Fixed
                  Rate Notes, in which case the amount of the Loan
                  subject to prepayment shall be the amount of the
                  proceeds of the Loan then withdrawn from the Loan
                  Account in respect of Specific Collateral less
                  any amounts thereof which have been previously

                  Agreement.
