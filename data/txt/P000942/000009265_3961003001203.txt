MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO  TE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 12.6 million, the equivalent of US$18.1
million, on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to help finance an Environmental
Resource Management Project. Additional grant financing would be provided by the Global
Environmental Trust Fund (GET) and the Governments of Denmark and the United Kingdom.
The Vice President, Africa Region, has approved the GEP component of the project, subject
to the Board's approval of the IDA-financed project.
2.    BagkgrQ1mv. A growing concern for environmental issues led the Government of
Ghana to initiate the preparation of a National Environmental Policy Statement and a national
Enviromental Action Plan (EAP). In formulating the plan, the Environmental Protection
Council (EPC), a Government agency established in 1974, secured the active collaboration of
a wide range of individuals and institutions in Ghana and the donor community, including the
World Bank. In the process, EPC generated widespread awareness of the importance of the
issues involved and a consensus about the need for effective action. The EAP has been
completed and has been approved by the Committee of PNDC Secretaries. The major
environmentat problems identified in the EAP include soil degradation and soil erosion,
deforestation and forest degradation, and degradation of the natural and built environment in
the coastal zone. In addition, problems associated with industrial and mining activities and
rapid urbanization, notably water and air pollution, are becoming increasingly serious. The
strategy for addressing these environmental problems is based on implementation of programs
by sectoral agencies, with EPC having responsibility for environmental policy formulation,
monitoring and coordination.
3.    h       Object bivesim. The primary objective of the project is to strengthen the capacity
of both government and people to manage environmental resources. The project therefore
focuses on improving resource management capability through reorganizing and strengthening
the institutions involved in environmental resource management, in particular the
Environmental Protection Council and its Technical Secretariat (EPCT). The project would
also aim to develop environmental management skills in sectoral and local goverment
agencies through staff training, leading to the establishment of effective inter-sectoral
networks dealing with environmental issues. The development of the management system
would be supported by the provision of an improved environmental information system in
order to provide a better understanding of environmental relationships, and early warning of
environmental pollution or degradation, coupled with public awareness campaigns. Other
project objectives are to assist the users of environmental resources to invest in the
maintenace of environmental assets through adoption of improved practices for the
sustainable use of those resources. In particular the project would support the introduction of
improved land management practices through community involvement in the planning and
implementation of measures to minimize land degradation. Specific attention would be paid
to the fragile ecosystems in the coastal wetlands through the recognition of five sites under the



-2
Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat (the
Ramsar Convention), and tbe establishment of a system for their management and future
development.
4.    prject   cripion. The project is designed to support the implementation of the
EAP based on: (i) the inter-sectoral nature of many environmental concerns; (ii) the fact that
many areas of Government are to be decentralized to District Assemblies; (iii) the need to
ensure that communities are involved in decisions about the use of environmental resources;
and (iv) the fact that significant portions of the EAP are to be implemented through planned
or on-going sector-specific projects supported by IDA or other external aid agencies,
particularly in the forestry, urban, industrial and energy sub-sectors. The project would use
capabilities in existing agencies, including NMOs, rather than attempting to create capabilities
within a central agency with respons;bility for all environmental matters. Progress with
policy, plannr;g, legislative and institutional actions related to land resource management,
forestry and wildlife, water management, marine and coastal ecosystems, human settlements,
and pollution control wIll be monitored.
5.    The project would be implemented over five years and would include three main
components: (1) Develmen of an Enviromental Resource Management System through:
(i) Institutional support to the Technical Secretariat of EPC (EPCITS) to enable the Council
to undertake its coordinating, monitoring and regulatory functions, at central and regional
levels; (ii) Human Resource Development, including post-graduate education and training
programs in environmental management, for staff of EPCM  and sectoral agencies at central
and district levels; (iii) Environmental Education based on public awareness campaigns; and
(iv) Development of a national environmental information and monitoring system, providing
information on environmental quality, topography, land use, climate, land suitability and land
tenure. (2) Land Resources Management would support a pilot project for development of
methodologies to minimize land degradation through the planning and sustainable mangement
of land by communities and farmers. The pilot project would train rural sociologists and
technical staff within MOA and NGOs in: methods of raising community awareness of land
degradation; simple diagnostic surveys to determine degradation problems; identification of
technical solutions that are acceptable to communities; and the lay-out of necessary works in
the field. A land management fund would be used to provide incentives for farmers to adopt
improved land management practices in the short term, until the long-term benefits become
apparent. One objective of the pilot program would be to finalize criteria for use of the fund
and the mechanisms for its management. (3) Coastal Wetands MU   would provide
for the demarcation and management of five coastal wetland sites, the Muni, Sakumo, Densu
Delta, Songor, and Anlo/Keta lagoons, that are recognized as sites of international importance
as habitat for migratory waterfowl. Inventory and monitoring of the ecological and socio-
economic conditions of the sites would be coupled with public education programs and studies
to identify forms of development that would be compatible with preserving the ecological
integrity of the sites. Extal funding for this component would be provided by the GET.
6.    The total cost of ths project is estimated at US$35.9 million, with a foreign exchange
component of US$21.1 million (59 percent of total costs). About 60 percent of total project
costs would be for development of the Environmental Resource Management System, about
18 percent for the pilot Land and Water Management program, and about 22 percent for the
Coastal Wetlands Management program. The IDA credit would be for US$18.1 million, or
50 percent of project costs. GET grant funds for the Coastal Wetlands Management program



-3 -
would amount to US$7.2 million, or 20 percent of project costs. Grant funds for technical
assistance and training would be provided by the Overseas Development Administration
(ODA) of the United Kingdom and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA),
and the Government would contribute 10 percent of project costs, excluding duties and taxes.
The breakdown of costs and finncing is shown in Schedule A. The proposed procurement
arrangements and the disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C
and D respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 10691-GH,
dated September 16, 1992, is being distributed separately.
7.    Ptojst  Mplemantation. The inter-sectoral nature of many environmental concerns
and the diverse information required for effective management mean, inevitably, that a
mumber of agencies have to be involved. These include the EPC/TS, agencies in the
Ministries of Local Government, Lands and Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Transport
and Communications, and research and university agencies. However, in each of the
agencies, project funding would be used to support clearly defined activities that lie within the
present mandate of each agency. To simplify project management arrangements, project
activities would be grouped according to project objectives or outputs. 1ach group of
activities would be overseen by a Project Operations Committee, under the overall supervision
of a Project Coordination Committee.
8.    EPC/m has a key role to play in project implementation and the coordination of
project activities. A Senior Program Officer would be a member of each of the Project
Committees to assist with the coordination of the activities overseen by the respective
committees and facilitate the disbursement of project funds to implementing agencies.
EPC/TS would be responsible for a single Special Account and for disbursement applications
to IDA. In order to formalize project-financed linkages, Memoranda of Understanding would
be drawn up between EPCiTS and the other implementing agencies that would specify the
schedules and costs of provision of services and products by each agency and the payments
and equipment to be provided by EPCITS for these services and products. Project
implementation arrangements would be further strengthened by the agreed strategy for
provision of technical assistance, based on functional linkages and the creation of institutional
links.
9.    Project Sustainability. The project has a strong human resource development focus,
that would increase the capabilities of key agencies to plan, implement and monitor the use of
environmental resources in a sustainable manner. The incremental recurrent costs due to the
project would amount to US$2.3 million ia the final year of the project. Government's
contribution to these costs would increase from US$0.4 million in the first year of the project
to US$1.5 million in the fifth year, that is, from about 50 percent to about 70 percent of
incremental recurrent costs. The development of an environmental resource management
system will take time, so the project should be seen as the first phase in a longer-term
institutional development program.
10.   Lessons fro   evious IDA QDgertions. lere has been no IDA lending in Ghana
specifically for environmental operations, but much of previous IDA lending for sectoral
projects has had an impact on the environment through its effect on agriculture, forestry,
minig, industry, and urban development. Experience with these lending operations shows
the need: (i) to involve communities in the planning and implementation of sustnable



-4-
resource use; CiH) to provide a focus for the management of environmentally related matters;
(ii) to agree on procedures to achieve effective coordination; (iv) to improve environmental
management sdills at district as well as central levels; (v) to provide training and support to
implementing agencies for procurement and disbursement; and (vi) to sustain stable macro-
economic conditions. This is consistent with conclusions drawn from world-wide experience
that is presented in the Progress Report for Fiscal 1991 on the World Bank and the
Environment.
11. Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed project is consistent with the Bank
strategy to assist with the implementation of the EAP by developing the institutional capability
for policy making and coordination, and by providing support for the implementation of
environmental protection pregrams on a sectoral basis. Tbis would protect the environment,
improve the sustainability of agriculture and reduce the adverse environmental effects of urban
and industrial development. By assisting to put in place the necessary mechanisms for
environmental policy formulation, planning and monitoring, it would complement on-going or
planned activities financed by IDA and other donors in: agriculture (adjustment lending and
extension, research and livestock projects), forestry, water, urban development, mining,
energy, transport and education projects. It would also help to focus donor assistance for
eavironmental concerns in an integrated manner, as evidenced by GEF participation in project
financing mad the willingness of both ODA and DANIDA to finance elements of the project.
12.   Ageed Actions. During negotiations with Government the following assurances and
agreements were obtainedi:
Conditions of Project Irfectiveness. (i) The Deputy Directors of EPC/TS and the Project
Financial Controller would be appointed; (ii) the agency contracting to provide specified
equipment and services to the Survey Department would be identified and selected, following
IDA procedures; (iii) terms of reference and procedures for the operation of the Remote
Sensing Applications Unit (RSAU) within the University of Ghana would be finalized and the
Head of the Unit would be appointed; (iv) the Land and Water Management Unit would be
established in the Ministry of Agriculture and the staff of the Unit would be appointed;
(v) Government would establish an Environmental Resource Management Project Account and
would pay an initial amount of US$100,000 equivalent into the account; (vi) bilateral
agreements between the Government of Ghana and the Governments of Denmark and the
United Kingdom and the Global Environment Trust agreement would be effective.
Conditions of Disbursement. (i) Signature of the contract between the Survey Department and
the agency selected to provide the specified equipment and services for that component.
Other Assurances. (i) Government's incremental contributions would be provided for all
project activities in line with agreed operational plans. Government would also comply with
the audit, review and reporting requirements of IDA; Di) Memoranda of understanding would
be drawn up by March, 1993, between EPC/TS and other implementing agencies setting out
schedules and costs for provision of agreed services or products by each agency; (iii) a human
resource development plan for EPC/TS would be prepared by January, 1994; (iv) the resuts
of studies and investigations of development options financed through the project would be
reviewed by the Project Operations Committee and IDA. The use of the Investment Support
Fund for identified developments within the coastal wetlands would be managed under terms
of reference agreed with IDA; (v) a communications strategy for public awareness programs



-5 -
would be prepared by EPC/rS by June 1993, and reviewed by IDA; (vi) criteria to monitor
enviromuental quality and the location of sampling sites, acceptable to IDA, would be
established by EPCITS by June 1993. Threshold values would be established by December
1993 and reviewed annually; (vii) the Principal of the Survey School would be appointed on a
full-time basis. Qualified staff of the Survey Depatment would be identified as instructors, to
the equivalent of two full-time staff, by June 1993; (viii) core staff of RSAU would be
appointed by March 1993. Nomenclature and classification for land use mapping would be
prepared and reviewed by IDA, by June 1994; (ix) formal boundary descriptions of the five
coastl wetland sites would be completed by June 1, 1993, and the legal instrument
designating the boundaries of the Ramsar sites would be prepared, reviewed by IDA, and
approved by December 31, 1993; (x) the results of annual monitoring of ecological and socio-
economic conditions in the coastal wetlands would be reviewed in April of each year, staring
in 1994; (xi) the detailed design and management of the education and research center at
Songor would be agreed by July 1995; and (xii) annual work program for all implementing
agencies would be prepared by June of each year and reviewed with IDA.
13.   Eviromnental Aspects. The primary objective of the project is to improve the
management of environmental resources in Ghana and to introduce programs for the
conservation or sustainable use of those resources. The project would, therefore, have
beneficial effects on the environment.
14.    Pegc Obtive Categatrim. The primary objective of the project is to improve the
management of environmental resources by Government at central and district levels, by
communities and by individuals. Through the implementation of programs for more
sustainable use of environmental resources by individuals and communities, the project would
result in long-term improvement in rural living standards and reduction in poverty.
15.   Priect BenTfi. Ihe project would support Government's strategy for the sustainable
use of the environment as set out in the National Environmental Policy and would assist with
the implementation of important aspects of the Environmental Action Plan. It would,
therefore, improve the management of environmental resources by both Government and the
people. By improving the availability of information it would provide a better understanding
of the environmental implications of courses of action, and early warning of environmental
pollution or degradation. The project would also promote the management of environmental
resources by communities in the coastal wetlands and elsewhere. Project benefits also include
the preservation of ecosystems in the coastal wetlands. Project-financed studies would lead to
the identification of development options that are compatible with maintaining the ecological
integrity of environmentally sensitive areas and provide insights into the environmental
implications of planned development strategies at national, district and local levels.
16.   Economic rate of return calculations for the project are not meaningfil as the main
components do not lend themselves to conventional rate of retnm analysis: many of the
benefits cannot be quantified and assumptions depend on whether the analysis is based on a
national or global accounting stance. The pilot nature of the Land and Water Management
component means that economic analysis is not appropriate.
17.   Ri&. A slowing down of the pace of economic recovery that led to shortfalls in
operational funding would adversely affect the project, but Government's commitment to
conservation and sustinable use of the environment is clearly expressed in the National



-6 -
Environmenta Policy. Another risk relates to the effectivene. of the environmental
management system but the project ic designed to strengthen management processes. There
are also risks related to the development of the environmental information system, but the key
role played by users of te information in managing the program and the arrangements for
twinning implementing agencies with foreign agencies with International experience reduces
these risks. Risks are associated with the program of land and water management, as it
involves Innovative approaches, but the pilot nature of the program minimizes these risks, as
it allows for staff training and the development ox appropriate methodologies and their
application on a limited scale. Government has formally declared its intention to recognize
the five coastal vetland sites under the Ramsar Convention, but there is a risk of delay in
issuing the legal instrment. However, project funds would be available to undertake the
necessary survey and demarcation of boundaries.
18.    ,=MM%nAt&o. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve it.

GEIANA - IMPLEMWNTATION ISSUES
1.     Wile Ghana's overall disbursemet performance coetinues to compare favorably with other
counties in the Region, disbursements oan investment lending have been declining since FY89. Ana
inaceased focus on impleenctation, omplemented with actions to address generic as well as project issues,
resulted in a reversal of the trend in FY91. Key actions taken to improve perforance included a Country
Implementation Review in May 1991, which led to a breakthrough in the simplification of procurement
procedures and the approval process, and follow-on sector implementation reviews. The Resident
Mission's supervision capacity was strengthened, and its portfolio monitorng activities increased. Intensive
supervision and md-term reviews were ud to redesign slow-moving projects in accordance with Bank
policy.  The mpding  political changes in the country have, however, deflected attention from
implementation issues, especially in procurement-related activities, resulting in a slowdown of
disburs nts in FY92. Notwithstanding, discuions continue at both project and higher levels of
govrnment to resolve the problems. Cument plans include a CIR next year. The staus of project which
are particularly slow-disbursing is discussed below.
2.     Cocoa Rehabilitation (FY88). To address the administrative problems that had led to slow
implementation, prect administration has been tightened, clear working relationships between
implementing agencies have been established, and mechanisms have been put in place to monitor progress.
However, difficulties with procurement produrs and cost increases in the roads component have caused
coninued delays i implementation. Following a mid-term review in March 1992, action has been taken
to edesign the project and reallocate credit funds.
3.     Mining Sector Rehabilitation (FY88). The SGMC rehabilitation component has been lagging
substntially owing to slow decision maldng on joint ventuing and rehabilitation of the mines. Efforts are
continuing to downsize SGMC and to activate the joint venturing of the mines. Furthermore, the urgency
for divestiure action is being stressed to improve SGMC's operations.
4.        F     (FY89). Implementation problems included weak project management, shortage of
professional staff, and Govermnent uncertainty about the likely effectiveness of the technical assistance
program. Actions bave been taken to enhance staff training, seek approval for an increase in incentive
packaes, and restructre the technical assistance program. As a result of the nud-term review in January
1992, implementation procedures have been simplified and action taken to realocate prceeds.
5.     RumlFinrnce (FY89). Although disbursements improved in FY92, drawdown on the credit line
is still slower than expected owing to problems of high interest rates, high credit risk perception by both
lenders and borrowers, and significant delays by the project implementation unit. The June 1992 mid-term
review proposed several actions to accelerate disbursements including ways to eliminate delays in the
processing of claims from participating financial institutions.
6.     Water Sector Rehabilitation (FY90). There has been significant progress in resolving financial
issues (tariff rates were increased in February 1992), and steps have been taken to address institutional
problems. The key issue of shortage of qualified senior management staff, however, remains unresolved.
Technica recomndauons have been submitted to the Provisional National Defence Council buta decision
is not expected until after the elections in November 1992. After a two-year delay, physical
implPementation of the project is now on track and disbursements are expected to pick up at the end of the
engineerg design stage in May 1993 when the rehabilitation process begins.
