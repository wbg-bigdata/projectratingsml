MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on - proposed loan to
the Kingdom of Thailand for US$50 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The loan would help finance a third highway sector project and
would be for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.          Background.  Thailand successfully developed a substantial network
of major highways (now comprising some 46,500 km) through the period of its
first four development plans (1965-1981). Increasingly, the challenge has
become one of providing for the maintenance and upgrading of the network.
Expenditures for these purposes under the Fifth Plan (1982-1986) were about
30% of the highway expenditures. Under the Sixth Plan (1987-1991), the
proportion has risen to about 35%. Originally, the Government expected to
borrow from external public sources about $200 million for road expenditures
under the plan. However, with the addition to the highway investment program
of further road improvement works, the Government has increased its 5-year
development plan from US$998.6 to US$1478.5 million equivalent and projected
external borrowing has been raised to about US$480 million. The Bank,
together with OECF/ADB, was asked to meet part of the increased financing
needs.
3.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project follows the Bank's
two h'Xhway sector projects, appraised in February 1987 and May 1988, and
would continue the Bank's long-standLng support for the Department of Highways
(DOH), a mature institution capable of planning and executing road programs.
Experience gained in previous operations is continuously being applied in
subsequent operations. Together with its past and present role in railways,
inland water transport and ports, and proposed involvement in the transport
and other infrastructure needs of the Government's Eastern and Southern
Seaboard programs, the Bank's continuing sector financing represents a major
effort to help improve intermodal investment planning in transportation,
increase existing capacity utilization, and improve efficiency and cost
effectiveness of freight and passenger transport. The proposed level of
lending is considered appropriate to continue the Bank's role in securing
important sector policy improvements related to road investment planning,
efficiency of resource allocation, road maintenance, road traffic safety and
vehicular air and noise pollution.
4.          Proiect Objectives.  The main objective of the proposed project is
to assist the Government in sustaining an efficient road transport system and
achieve the goals of its Sixth Development Plan including: (a) protection of
past investments in the highway sector by rehabilitation and strengthening of
paved highways and improving the maintenance system, as well as strengthening
the institutional capacity of the highway authority; (b) reduction of road
transport costs and improvements in the services over the national and



- 2 -
provincial roads system to facilitate dispersal of industrial and other
economic activity away from Bangkok to smaller cities and rural areas;
;c) improvements in road traffic safety; and (d) reduction of the
environmental impact of road transport.
5.          Project Descrigtion.  The project would support the Government's
1987-1991 five-year program for national and provincial roads, focusing on the
appropriate balance between investment and maintenance allocations. Specific
sub-programs include: (a) rehabilitation/strengthening of paved national and
provincial roads; (b) construction/improvement of provincial roads;
(c) implementation of DOH's highway maintenance system; (d) training for DOH
staff; (e) road traffic safety; (f) increased efforts at reducing the
environmental impact of vehicular air and noise pollution; and (g) further
development of the road trar.sport industry. Transportation is the leading
cause of air and noise pollution in urban areas. The Department of Land
Transport (LTD) has formulated a technically adequate action program to
strengthen compliance with prescribed emission and noise standards.
Implementation of this program requires further coordination with other
Government agencies, which will be facilitated by the project through
development of interagency action plans, satisfactory to the Bank. The
recently completed Bank-financed trucking industry study as well as the
ongoing inter-city and rural bus transport study provide a good foundation for
improving efficiency in the road transport industry. An action plan for that
purpose would be developed and agreed with the Bank under the project.
A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in Thailand are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8330-
TH dated April 25, 1990, is being distributed separately.
6.          Agreed Actions.  Agreements have been reached on:  (a) the level
and composition of DOH's 1987-91 program including estimated budget
allocations to ensure adequate road maintenance; (b) the financing plan for
the program; (c) an annual review of program implementation and its continued
financing; (d) the priority of maintenance and rehabilitation over new road
construction during periods of resource constraints; (e) the arrangements and
timetables for completing action plans for road traffic safety, vehicular
emission and noise pollution control and road transport industry efficiency
and their subsequent implementation; and (f) reconfirmation of the & .ection
criteria for the road works to be included in the investment program.
7.          Benefits.  The major benefit of the program would be to secure
adequate upkeep of the national and provincial highway network. Although the
condition of the highway network in Thailand is generally fair, many of the
roads need asphaltic overlays and resealing, without which they will
deteriorate over the next few years and their subsequent rehabilitation would
eventually cost a multiple of the present repair cost. The proposed project
would also continue the Bank's support of DOH programs to improve traffic
safety and increase the efficiency of road transport. The minimum economic



return for subprojects to be included in DOH's Sixth Plan is 12%, equal to the
opportunity cost of capital in Thailand.
8.          Riiks.  The project poses no undue risks from an investment or
enviromental point of vie-. On the contrary, ti.e project's focus on road
traffic safety and air and noise pollution should be beneficial.
9.          Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
