THIRD HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower:         Kingdom of Thailand
Amount:           US$50.0 million equivalent
Terms:            20 years, incluuing a five-year grace period, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate.
Project
DescriRtion:     The basic objectives of the proposed project are to assist
the Government in sustaining an efficient road transport
system and to continue to support the goals of its Sixth
Development Plan including: (a) protection of past
investments in the highway sector by concentrating on
rehabilitation and maintenance; (b) reduction of road
transport costs and improvements in the transport services
over the highway system which would, among other things,
facilitate transfer of industrial and other economic
activity away from Bangkok to smaller cities and rural
areas; (c) improvements in road traffic safety; and (d)
improvement in environmental control of vehicular air and
noise pollution. The loan provides supplementary finance to
the Department of Highways (DOH) 1987-91 program, which was
appraised under the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH,
approved December 15, 1987). The bulk of the loan would
continue financing components of DOH's 1987-91 road
development plan. Specific subprojects to be financed under
the loan would be selected on the basis of agreed-upon
criteria and procedures. Most of the loan proceeds would be
used on civil works for rehabilitation and betterment of
roads, while other items would include training, equipment
and consultant services for road traffic safety, air and
noise pollution control, and road transport industry
efficiency, part of which will be implemented by the
Department of Land Transport (LTD).
Risks:            The project poxe6 no unusual risks.

TRAILAND
THIRD HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1        Despite large transport sector investments over the last twenty
years (particularly in road infrastructure), Thailand's rapid economic
development continues to put severe and increased strains on the country's
transport system. The proposed Third Highway Sector Project provides
further support to the Royal Thai Government's expanded Sixth Development
Plan (1987-1991) for national and provincial roads to cater to these
increased demands.
1.2        Today, all provinces are interlinked with a good interregional and
interprovincial transport network and transport services have penetrated the
majority of previously remote rural areas. The country's transport system
is multimodal and a competitive transport industry has developed. Road is
the dominant mode with about 80% of all freight ton-km and 90% of all
passenger-km. In 1988, the public road network consisted of approximately
161,800 km. Of these, 16,700 km were national, 33,200 km provincial (Table
1.1) and 111,900 km rural.
1.3        The Department of Highways (DOH), under the Ministry of Transport
and Communications (MOTC), is a mature and efficient institution and by far
the most important road agency. It is responsible for all national and
provincial roads, which account for almost 80% of total road expenditures
(Table 1.2). The 73 provinces and municipalities, under the Ministry of
Interior (MOI) and assisted by a number of central government agencies,
chiefly the Accelerated Rural Development Department (ARD) and the Public
Works Department (PWD), are generally responsible for rural roads.
1.4        The Goveriiment's goals for the transport sector focus on improved
eff'cieney through increased utilization of assets, increased self-reliance
of state enterprises, and privatization. Specific highway subsectoral goals
include a proper balance between investment, rehabilitation and maintenance
expenditures, reduced road traffic congestion, increased road traffic
safety, improved environmental controls of vehicular emissions, and a more
efficient road transport industry.
1.5        The proposed project would be the Bank's 23rd transport sector
project since assistance to the sector started in 1950 with a railway loan.
Of the previous 22 loans amounting to a total of US$744.65 million, eleven
loans of US$549.6 million (74% of total) have been for highways, five loans
of US$120.30 million (16%) for ports and v-aterways and six loans of US$74.75
million (10%) for the railways (Table 1.3).
1.6        Past highway projects have been successfully implemented by DOH,
often on time and below budget. The Project Completion Report (No. 4476)
for the Fifth Highway Project (Loan 870-TH) shows a higher economic rate of
return of the project than forecast during appraisal (20% vs 16%) despite
some cost overruns and delays due to steep price rises from late 1973 and



- 2 -
lack of adequate price adjustment provisions in contracts. The Project
Completion Report (No. 6205) for the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 1519-TH)
indicates that all project objectives were achieved. Although there was a
slight cost underrun, traffic growth was also less than expected resulting
in an economic rate of return of the project of 20%, which was less than the
29% forecast during appraisal, but still fully satisfactory. Together, the
two projects achieved important institution building and development of
local consultauts and contractors. The Project Performance Audit Report
(No. 8447) for the Provincial Roads Project (Loan 2035-TH) specifically
recognizes DOH's strong performance in carryin- out its road program. The
Second Provincial Roads Project (Loan 2311-TH) has been substantially
completed with only minor implementation delays.
1.7        Bank support for the Government's Highway Development Plan (1987-
1991) was started under the Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH, approved
on December 15, 1987) and continues under the Second Highway Sector Project
(Loan 3008-TH, approved on December 13, 1988). After a somewhat slow start,
caused by temporary shortages of construction material leading to rebidding
of certain contracts, work is now accelerating under both loans.
1.8        The proposed third highway sector loan together with the previous
two loans and other foreign financing (para. 2.5) would complete the
financing plan for the Government's 1987-91 Road Development Plan. In
addition, the project continues to strengthen the policy dialogue with the
Government, as it will address ways to improve the efficiency of the road
transport industry. It will also widen the support for increased road
traffic safety (para. 3.4) started under Loan 2894-IH and for reduction in
air and noise pollution (para. 3.7) started under Loan 3008-TH. Because of
these recent loans, the present appraisal report is abbreviated and focuses
on the additions to the development plan.
II. DOH PROGRAM (1987-1991)
2.1         DOH's five year expenditure program 1987-1991 (Table 2.1), which
is the basis for the highway sector projects strikes a balance between
maintenance and rehabilitation on the one hand and upgrading and new
construction on the other, while taking into consideration available financial
resources. DOH regards the program as fixed with regards to its total
physical targets but flexibility is provided for adjusting annual targets in
line with changes in fiscal and economic conditions and also for adjusting the
time required to achieve the targets. It is presently expected that the
program, designated for 1987-1991, will require an additional two years to
compieLe !Ls ta'gts. ThG proposed loa., is bascd on:
(a)   DOH'S development plan covering the period 1987-1991,
subject to annual updating and review;



- 3 -
(b)   agreed criteria, procedures and related organizarional
arrangements for selection, engineering and implementatior.
of individual subprojects included in DOH's work program;
and
(c)   appropriate measures to address selected sectoral issues
concerning road traffic safety, vehicular emission and noise
pollution and road transport industry efficiency.
During negotiations the level. composition. and final time-frame of this
orogram would be reviewed and agreed upon.
A. Program ComDonents and Description
2.2         DOH's actual and estimated expenditure levels are central to
defining the framework of the Bank's involvement in the sector. The
evaluation of DOH's highway expenditure program for 1987-1991 is presented
below and detailed in Table 2.1.

The program is considered realistic, gi-en DOH's record in preparation and
implementation of work programs, the Bureau of the Budget's current outlook on
public revenues, the National Economic and Social Development Board's (NESDB)
assessment of -riorities among and within the sectors, the Ministry of
Finance's (MOF) current prospects for external borrowing, and MOTC's views on
previous and projected funding allocations and taking expected extensions into
account.
2.3         Given the age structure, pavement condition and increasing traffic
volumes on the network, future DOH budgets will be concentrated on
maintenance, rehabilitation and capacity expansion of existing routes rather
than on construction of new routes. The 1987-91 highway program reflects
these realities and continues the efforts towards maintenance and
rehabilitation begun in the Fifth Development Plan (1982-1986).
B. Road Development Plan
2.4         DOH's Sixth Road Development Plan accounts for some 50% of DOH's
highway expenditure program for the plan period. Under the Plan, summarized



- 4 -
below and detailed in Table 2.2, DOH is carrying out the following:
rehabilitation of some 6,800 km of paved roads; capacity increase through
construction of additional lanes for about 870 km of congested roads, some of
which will be operated as toll roads; a safety program through improving
conditions in about 400 hazardous road section_.; construction of interchanges
in about 11 locations; construction of some 350 km of new road links; and
upgrading 3,200 km of gravel roads to bitumen standard. The physical targets
are consistent with resource projections and implementation capacity.

C. Financing Plan
2.5         The Government's budgetary allocations make up about 68% of DOH's
planned investments. The remaining funds required would be obtained from
foreign sources, including IBRD, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, and would be applied
mainly to capital expenditures under the development plan. The table below
summarizes the financing sources for the development plan during 1987-91.

2.6   Should DOH, in the future, have to meet its highway requirements with
less budgetary resources than those presently planned, reduction in the
overall size of the program would first be effected by reducing the new
construction and pav4ng components through postponement or scaling down of
subprojects. To ensure the program's continued relevance and adequacy,
agreements were reached during negotiations regarding (i) the financing plan
for the program; (ii) an annual review of program implementation; and (iii)
the priority of maintenance and rehabilitation over new construction of roads
during periods of resource constraints.
D. Institutional Improvements
2.7   To ensure smooth execution of the DOH program and efficient management
of the sector, specific action programs were developed during the preparation
of the Bank's Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH). These programs are now
under implementation with measures being taken to: (i) utilize the pavement
management system nationwide; (ii) complete introduction nationwide of DOH's
equipment revolving fund systew; (iii) strengthen DOH's training system; (iv)
control truck overloading; and (v) improve road safety. These programs will
continue under this project, as will the environmental action program aimLed at
improving existing vehicular air and noise pollution control measures agreed
under the Second Highway Sector Project (Loan 3008-TH). In addition, the
existing action programs for road traffic safety and vehicular emission
control will be further developed and a new action program will be designed to
improve road transport industry efficiency (paras. 3.1-3.9 and Annexes 1-3).
III. SELECTED SECTOR OBJECTlVES
A. Road Traffic Safety
3.1   Road traffic accidents are a serious and increasing socioeconomic
problem in Thailand. Accident records are, however, neither accurate nor
complete. Records for 1987 show that road traffic accidents caused 8,723
fatalities and another 612,461 persons were injured. Although the problem has
been recog..ized for several years comprehensive, coordinated and effective
measures for accident prevention have yet to be taken. Studies 1/ carried out
since 1982 have identified causes and proposed countermeasures but litcle has
been implemented of the recommendations, apart from an extensive program of
"blackspot" elimination (road improvements, traffic signals and signs,
guardrails, bicycle lanes, pedestrian bridges), which DOH is presently
carrying out at a cost of some US$12 million (under the Highway Sector
Project). Furthermore, the National Safety Council of Thailand (NSC), in a
joint affort w5th th      c    Ro-'d ar.d Traffic RPcearch institute (WITT, is
about to start preparing an action plan to improve the road traffic accident
data system (collection, storage, processing and analysis of records) and
initiate traffic safety r_cearch in Thailand.
/ Traffic Law Enforcement and Road Safety Study, 1982 (ADB financed)
Traffic Safety Plan for Roads in the Kingdom of Thailand, 1985 (JICA).



. 6 -
3.2   Much more is needed, however, if tangible results are to be achieved.
Work on elimination of nblackspotsu and improvement of the road t:-affic
infrastructure and environment needs to be continued. Although the laws and
regulations affecting traffic safety are considered relatively adequate, their
enforcement needs to be strengthened.  The experienice with vehicle tesding and
with driver training, testing and licensing needs to be reviewed and
recommendations for improvements prepared. Road safety awareness campaigns
need to be designed and targeted. Finplly, the action plan for an accident
data rystem, to be prepared with the a:,jistance of the Swedish VTI, needs to
be imp'lemented.
3.3   One of the greatest problems in efforts to improve road traffic safety
is the poor coordination among the many government and ion-government agencies
concerned with the various aspects of safety. The organization in Thailand
which coordinates traffic safety activities is NSC, which is concerned with
public safety in general and handles road traffic safety through one of its
five sub-committees. NSC is nct yet, however, a formal government agency and
those taking part in its activities do so in addition to or in direct
connection with their professional work. The aim should be to develop NSC
into an active and effective policy making and coordinating body with its own
full-time secretariat with multidisciplinary staff and a special budgat.
3.4   The project would include an action plan, an outline of which appears
in summarized form in Annex 1, to serve as a guide towards the preparation and
subsequent implementation of a national road traffic safety program. It would
include strengtnening of vehicle inspection and enforcement of safety
standards and driver training as well as the general promotion of the use of
safety features such as seat belts and helmets.  During this preparatory
phase, the project would assist in financing support for safety improvement
activities such as civil works (for "blackspot" elimination), equipment (for
accident data collection, storage and processing, vehicle testing and
inspection, traffic management, law enforcement and education) and for
consultancy services as and if requir'd to develop And initiate the program.
During project appraisal, the series of activities forming the basis for the
action plan were discussed. The action plan would be further developed by the.
agencies concerned with and responsible for each activity or subactivity and
coordinated by the Traffic Safety Council within NSC into a comprehensive and
consistent plan. During negotiations, an agreement was reached that the
action plan would be submitted to the Bank for comment and completed by
December 30, 1990.
B. Vehicular Ermission and Noise Pollution
3.5   Vehicular air and noise pollution has become an increasingly serious
problem in Thailand through a combination of the rapidlv increasing vehicle                 m
fleets and poorly maintained engines. The problem has taken on crisis
proportions in Bangkok in the last few years but is also increasingly
worrisome in other urban areas.



3.6   The Office of the National Environment Board (ONEB), which monitors
ambient air quality in various locations in and around Bangkok and in other
urban areas, has established acceptable levels for major emission pollutants
(e.g. HC, CO and black smoke) and the Cabinet has approved the corresponding
guidelines. It is now up to the implementing government agencies to establish
the necessary regulatory instructions and provide the necessary resources to
monitor and enforce compliance with the approved emission and noise standards.
3.7   In order to address these concerns and to achieve maximum compliance
with the established standards, it is necessary to develop and adhere to an
inter-agency action plan, an outline of which appears in summarized form in
Annex 2 and which would be among the priority activities of the proposed
project. The action plan should be further developed by the agencies
concerned with and responsible for each activity or subactivity and
coordinated by ONEB into a comprehensive and consistent plan. During
negotiations, an agreement was reached that the action plan would be submitted
to the Bank for comment and completed by December 31, 1990.
C. Road Transnort Industry Efficiency
3.8   The trucking and bus services in Thailand are normally considered
adequate and quite competitive at least on major routes. This does not mean,
however, that the industry cannot be further improved. Indeed, recently
completed and ongoing studies of both trucking and bus services have
established a long list of recommendations aimed at cutting through
bureaucratic obstacles to more efficient operations. It is important that
these recommendations be carefully considered and that a phased action plan be
developed, which takes into account the difference in political acceptability
of the various recommendations while working towards an economically sound
system.
3.9   The action plan, an outline of which appears in summarized form in
Annex 3, would be a major focus of the proposed project. The action plan
would be further developed by the agencies concerned with and responsible for
each activity or subactivity and coordinated by MOTC's Office of the Permanent
Secretary into a comprehensive and consistent plan. During negotiations, an
agreement was reached that the action plan would be submitted to the Bank for
comment and completed by December 31, 1990.
D. Road User Charges
3.10 According to a DOH Study on Road Revenues and Expeaditures 1977-1986,
Government expenditures on road works have been covered since 1979 by reveniues
collected from road user charges levied. An analysis of revenues collected in
the form of road user charges indicates that the greatest proportion is
collected by the Excise Duties Department, which is responsible for oil and
fuel tax collection, which amounts to about half of total revenues collected.
Of this, gasoline tax accounted for 59%, diesel tax 33%, and other taxea 8%.
An update of revenues collected up to 1988 is given in Table 3.1.



8 -
3.11  In terms of user costs, as opposed to user charges, the charges levied
on motorcycles and automobiles are more than sufficient to cover road use.
However, the charges levied on trucks, particularly heavy trucks, are
insuff-cient, allowing these vehicles to pay less than the actual cost of road
use, in effect creating a Government subsidy for truck use.  Proposals have                  -
been made to increase license fees for heavy trucks to cover their road usage
costs, but because of political sensitivity related to the raising of truck
charges, the increases have not yet taken place. This matter will be
addressed as part of the action plan for improving road transport industry
efficiency (para. 3.9).
VI. BANK PARTICIPATION
A. Objectives
4.1         The Government maintains a policy of protecting past investments
in roads by emphasizing maintenance and rehabilitation. The Government has
also recently taken actions to develop and implement three comprehensive
action programs for further improvements in: (a) road traffic safety; (b) the
environment by reducing pollution due to vehicular emissions and noise; and
(c) the efficiency of road transport of freight and passengers. The proposed
loan, a logical continuation of the Bank's involvement in the '-ctor, will
assist Government in these efforts.
4.2         The main objective of the highway sector projects is to assist the
Government in further improving the overall efficiency of the highway sector.
Together with Loans 2894-TH and 3008-TH, the proposed loan would support DOH's
highway development plan for interurban (national and provincial) roads which
aims at:
(a)   improving the quality of interurban roads (by focussing on
maintenance and rehabilitation);
(b)   relieving congestion (by improving capacity);
(c)   improving road traffic safety;
(d)   reducing environmental pollution from vehicle emissions and
t-affic noise; and
(e)   improving policies on road transport and road use.
P.  Description of Bank Financed Components
General
4.3         The project includes:  (a) specific subprojects of DOH's road
development plan selected annually on the basis of procedures and economic and
technical criteria already agreed under Loan 2894-TH; and (b) equipment,



- 9 -
technical assistance, studies and training to assist in the preparation and
implementation of the three action programs (para. 4.1). Work programs of the
development plan are defined in terms of annual expenditures and physical
targets and described in Chapter III. Components to be financed under the
project would include rehabilitation/improvements of interurban roads and
bridges; measures to improve road safety; measures to reduce air, and noise
pollution and measures to improve road transport industry efficiency.
Road and Bridges Rehabilitation/Imxrovements
4.4         Roadworks.  The works will be carried out in various parts of the
country where: (a) pavements are seriously deteriorated; and (b) earth and
gravel roads need upgrading by simple methods such as bituminous surface
treatment.  Works will be designed and carried out in accordance with
star.dards acceptable to the Bank and would include improvements of side and
crnss drainage, widening, and strengthening of pavements and shoulders.                    -
Pavements will be strengthened by bituminous overlays designed on the basis of
observed and measured existing condition and traffic volumes and estimated
loadings projected for the next seven years.- Works will be carried out on
existing alignments.
4.5         Bridgeworks.  The works will be carried out on bridges in various
parts of the country that have become bottlenecks for one or more of the
following reasons: (a) severe load limitations because of low initial design
loads or advan,ed structural deterioration; (b) width restrictions; or (c)
hazardous hydrological conditions. Works would be designed to agreed
standards and would comprise as required, rehabilitation, strengthening,
widening or full replacement.
4.6         Design and SuRervision of Road and Bridgeworks.  Some 2,200 km of
roadworks and 1,200 m of bridges need to be designed under the project. About
one third of these works will be designed by DOH's own staff and the
remainder, requiring some 750 staff-months, by local consultants. Supervision
of road and bridge works will be carried out by DOH staff supplemented by 700
staff-months of local consultants and some 100 staff-months of foreign
consultants for overall coordination.
Road Traffic Safety
4.7         Traffic safety was first addressed under Loan 2894-TH and is being
given increased importance by the Government and in the media. The road
safety component would assist Government in expanding ongoing efforts and in
preparing NSC's comprehensive action program and its subsequent implementation
for improving road traffic safety (para. 3.4), as further outlined in Annex 1.
2/   Traffic loadings for 15 years are also checked and the initial (7 year)
thickness determined such that the additional pavement thickness
required for carrying the traffic from yea~r 7 through year 15 is within
a practical range for asphaltic concrete overlays.



- 10 -
The project would provide funds for civil works, equipment and consultancy
advisory services.
4.8         Civil Works.  The works would be a continuation of measures taken
under Loan 2894-TH to:  eliminate known blackspots b- improving horizontal and
,-ertical geometry, lengthen sight distances, improve road surface friction,
improve existing and erect new traffic signs and signals and guard rails,
separate traffic streams (including pedestrian overpasses) and improve traffic
management at intersections. The works will be desligned and implemented by
DOH.
4.9         Equipment.  To enhance accident reporting and analysis, the Police
Department (PD) needs specialized equipment for data collection, storage and
processing as well as equipment for enforcement of traffic regulations (for
instance for speed measurements, communications, measurements of alcohol
consumption and mobile static and dynamic weighbridges). LTD also needs
equipment for, inter alia, vehicle testing and inspection. A list of
equipment will be agreed with the Government when review of needs has been
carried out as part of the preparation of NSC's action program.
4.10        Advisory Services.  The advisory services would assist NSC and
concerned agencies to develop and start implementing the action program and
train staff as required for those purposes. Terms of reference would be
agreed as and when the need for services is identified in the process of
developing and implementing the action program. It is estimated that expert
assiftance would require some 20 staff-months of foreign and 25 staff-months
of local experts' assistance.
Reduction of Air and Noise Pollution
4.11        The component would assist Government in controlling air and noise
pollution within agreed standards and especially ONEB in the preparation of
the comprehensive action program and its implementation as further outlined in
Annex 2 (para. 3.7). The project would provide funds for procurement of
equipment and consulting (advisory) services as outlined below.
4.12        EquiRment.  To expand ongoing efforts to enforce pollution
standards, LTD and PD need specialized equipment for m3nitoring pollution and
inspecting vehicle emissions and noise generation. A list of equipment will
be agreed when review of needs has been completed as part of the preparation
of ONEB's action programs.
4.13        Advisory Services.  These services would assist ONEB and concerned
agencies to develop and implement their respective action programs and train
staff for implementation. Terms of reference would be agreed as and when the
need for services is identified in the process of developing and implementing
the action program. It is estimated that some 15 staff-months of local and 30
staff-months of foreign experts' assistance would be required.



- 11 -
Road Transgort Industry Efficiency
4.14        The component would provide for advisory services to assist MOTC
and concerned agencies to develop and star': implementing an action program for
improving road transport industry efficiency as recommended in recent studies
and further outlined in Annex 3 (para. 3.9). This would include the drafting
of changes in rules and regulations for road user charges, vehicle weight and
dimensions, vehicle types and axle configurations, privatization of certain
services, and the review and possible revision of the road transport act and
other related regulations. Terms of reference would be agreed as and when the
need for services is identified in the process of developing and implementing
the action program. It is expected that about 30 staff-months of local and 15
staff-months of foreign experts' assistance will be required.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
4.15        The foreign exchange component for civil works is estimated at
about 50% assuming that execution will be mostly by local contractors as has
been the case in recent years. For consultancy services the foreign exchange
component is estimated at about 30% for design, 50% for supervision and 70%
for technical assistance.
4.16        The proposed loan of US$50.0 million together with the previous
two highway sector loans would finance about 13% of the total cost of
US$1,474.9 million of DOH's 1987-91 development plan. The first table below
summarizes the cost of the various components to which the Bank loan would be
applied (details in Table 4.1) and the second table summarizes the same cost
by type of expenditure (details in Table 4.2). The allocation shown is
tentative and funds could be transferred between categories if year-to-year
needs change.

D. Implementation of Bank Financed SubDrojects
4.17        As for the previous two highway sector projects, Loans 2894-TH and
3008-TH, the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) will be
responsible for executing most of the project through its Department of
Highways, while its Department of Land Transport (LTI)) will execute parts of
the components for road traffic safety and vehicular emission control. Work
on the three action plans (Chapter III) wolild be carried out by the respective
agencies concerned and coordinated by the Traffic Safety Council, ONEB and the
Office of the Permanent Secretary of MOTC, respectively.
4.18        DOH and LTD will submit annually a list of subprojects to be
agreed with the Bank. All subprojects of civil works for roads and bridges to
be financed under the project (except for minor works related to road traffic
safety) will be included in DOH's annual budget. Civil works subprojects
would have a minimum economic rate of return of 12%. During negotiations, it
was agreed that the evaluation methodology used under the previous two highway
sector projects would not be changed without consultation with the Bank and
that no road work would be implemented for which the economic return is less
than 12%.



- 13 -
4.19        Project supervision will be coordinated with ADB and OECF with
regards to the overall implementation of the civil works pzogram. The
Supervision Plan will be prepared during the start-up mission for the project
and is expected to require st-bstantial specialist input, above the normal
engineering and economic stalf resources, in particular, for assisting with
the implementation of the three action plans. In total, it is expected that
some 36 staff-weeks of supervision effort would be required during the project
period, including the normal engineering and economic staff resources, with a
somewhat heavier concentration at the beginning of the project implementation.
E. Procurement of Bank Fiianced Subxroiects
4.20        Procurement would be carried out as shown in the table below:

4.21        Except for minor works like those for road traffic safety
(estimated to cost less than US$0.3 million each with an aggregate total value
of US$10 million), civil works financed by the Bank would be carried out under
contracts procured on the basis of ICB procedures in accordance with Bank
guidelines.



- 14 -
4.22        Prequalified contractors will be allowed to bid on any contract or
group of contracts for civil works but will be eligible for awards only up to
the value of works for which they are prequalified.  Prequalification will be
carried out annually with invitations issued in accordance with the Bank's
guidelines.
4.23        Small civil works contracts exempt from ICB procedures
(para. 4.21) will be procured under LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Interested foreign contractors will be allowed full participatio.t and will not
be required to register the firm in the provinces where they want to place
bids.
4.24        Procurement of all civil works contracts of US$4.0 million and
above will be subject to prior review by the Bank, which is expected to cover
70% of estimated total contract values.
4.25        Equipment will be procured on the basis of ICB except for minor
items or groups of items estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per contract,
up to an aggregate amount for all contracts not to exceed US$1.0 million,
which may be procured on the basis of international and lonal shopping by
obtaining at least three quotations from foreign and/or local suppliers.
Items should be grouped to the extent possible. Procurement of equipment with
contracts estimated to cost US$200,000 and above will be subject to prior
review by the Bank, which is expected to cover 80% of estimated total contract
values. In the evaluation of bids, domestic price preference may be granted.
4.26        Consultants will be employed in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for use of Consultants. All contracts will ba subject to prior
review by the Bank.
F. Disbursements
4.27        Disbursement from the loan will be made against applications based
on contracts for subprojects eligible for Bank financing as follows:
(a)   Civil Works.  50% of total expenditures;
(b)   Goods.  100% of foreign expenditures; 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory cost); and 80% of local
expenditures for other items procured locally; and
(c)   Consultant Services and Training.  100% of total
expenditures.
4.28        To facilitate disbursements, the project would use the
Government's established inte:nal revolving funds system which enables the
Controller General's Department to advance funds from its own resources to
line agencies for expenditures in both local and foreign currencies. When
project expenditures under the internal revolving fund reach $50,000, the
Controller General's Department will batch the withdrawal applications and
submit these to the Bank for reimbursement.  Disbursements for civil works and



- 15
equipment contracts costing less than US$100,000 per contract and disbursement
for training would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOE).
4.29        A schedule of estimated disbursements (Table 4.3) has been
prepared on the basis of a tentative implementation schedule prepared by DOH.
The projected disbursement profile for the proposed Bank participation in the
program is broadly in line with DOH's current performance. It is expected
that loan disbursements will be completed in about four years because the
review and approval of contracts has been streamlined to reduce delays. The
Closing Date of the loan will be December 31, 1994.
G. Monitoring and Auditing
4.30        Most contract administraticn under the proposed loan would be the
responsibility of DOH and LTD. These agencies would keep records of all
procurement documents (including bids and proposals and their evaluation and
contract awards), and official decisions on each agreed subproject showing
accumulated expenditures, monthly payments and other administrative data and
would prepare regular reports with this information as instituted under the
Highway Sector Project (Loan 2894-TH). The Bank would reserve the right to
inspect and review the documentation maintained on individual contracts by the
agencies and be sent copies of documents on request.
4.31        The annual consultations on the highway program and budget and on
the action programs would provide the major opportunity for reviewing progress
of the development plan for national and provincial roads and the
implementation of the proposed project. Monitoring and supervision of the
proj-ct will focus on the following:
(a)   The evolution and subsequent confirmation of the annual
programs and their financial and physical targets for the
road development and maintenance programs;
(b)   The progress made in pursuing the institutional and sectoral
objectives of the project included in the action programs
for road traffic safety, pollution control, and road
transport industry efficiency; and
(c)   The progress of implementation of Bank-financed subprojects.
Also, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(a)   the implementing agencies would keep separate accounts for
the proposed project;
(b)   the project accounts, including documentation for statement
of expenditures (SOEs), would be audited annually by
independent auditors acceptable to tne Bank; and



- 16 -
(c)   the detailed audit reports would be submitted to the Bank
within nine months after the end of each fiscal year. In
addition, the implementing agencies will prepare and furnish
to the Bank, within aine months after completion of the
project, a completion report on the execution and initial
operation of the project.
H. Proiect Environmental ImRact
4.32        The road works in the three-year plan are nor expected to have any
adverse environmental effects. Before approval, DOH subjects each road
project to an environmental assessment with regards to encroachment,
impairment, erosion and siltation, aesthetics, noise and vibration, pollution,
hazards and construction problems. Works are mostly improvements of roads and
bridges, including improved side and cross drainage, widening and
strengthening of shoulders and pavements, overlays on old pavements, and
bituminous surfacings on gravel roads, all of which will improve conditions
along the road through reducing dust and noise and erosion because of
flooding. As most works will be carried out on existing alignments,
requirements for additional land are minimal and no resettlement is expected
to be needed. In addition, the pollution control component would directly
contribute to improving air quality and reducing noise pollution in the
country and particularly in Bangkok.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
