REPUBLIC OF THE COTE D'IVOIRE
THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:           Republic of the Cote d'Ivoire
Amount:             US$250.0 million
Terms:              20 years including 5 years grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Loan Description:   The loan would be the third in support of the
Government's comprehensive program of structural
adjustment. This third phase of the program is
described in the Government's Statement of Development
Policy - 1986 (including a specific and dated program
of monitorable actions, Annex V-A, pages 19-26) to the
Bank. The principal objectives of this program of
basic policy changes are to improve resource allocation
and to reorient productive activities in the direction
of comparative advantage in order to generate
self-sustaining export-led growth, to reduce the
disparities in incomes between rural and urban areas,
and to reestablish internal and external financial
equilibria. To achieve these objectives, detailed
action programs would be implemented over the next
eighteen months, consisting of: (i) consolidating
achievements under SAL I and II with respect to the
improvement of macro-economic management and policy
making within an established medium-term framework;
(ii) restructuring current expenditures in line with
the requirements of the above program and improving
public investment programming with respect to size,
composition and project portfolio; (iii) continuing the
rehabilitation of the para-public sector; (iv)
increasing domestic saving mobilization and improving
financial intermediation; (v) intensifying the
adjustment process in agriculture; (vi) generalizing
incentive reforms in the manufacturing sector; and
(vii) improving energy sector policies and efficiency.
The foreign exchange provided by the loan would be used
to finance essential imports.
Estimated
Disbursements:      The loan would be disbursed in two tranches, a first
tranche of US$100.0 million upon effectiveness and a
second tranche of US$150.0 million after a performance
review to be held in December 1986.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED THIRD STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF THE COTE D'IVOIRE
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Third Structural Adjustment Loan to the Republic of the Cate d'Ivoire for
the equivalent of US$250 million to support the Government's program of
structural reforms designed to achieve sustainable growth with financial
equilibrium. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, with interest at the standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        In the Report No. 1147-IVC "Ivory Coast:  A Basic Economic
Report", circulated in May 1977 and published in 1978 under the title
"Ivory Coast: The Challenge of Success", the Bank presented an in-depth
analysis of the country's economic performance during its first fifteen
years of independence. The evolution of the economy during the second half
of the seventies was reviewed in a special annex to the SAL II President's
Report (Loan No. 2332-IVC). More recently, several economic missions
visited the C6te d'Ivoire to review economic developments since the
beginning of the eighties and to examine the medium and long-term policy
alternatives facing the country. The findings of these missions are
reflected in the present report. 1/
3.        With a GNP per capita of US$710 in 1983, the CSte d'Ivoire ranks
second behind Zimbabwe among non-oil exporting developing countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa, well ahead of its neighbors within the West African
Economic Community. Its population of 9.5 million is growing at a rate of
4 percent per year, of which 1 percent is due to net immigration. Since
independence in 1960, the country has enjoyed a remarkable degree of
political stability which, combined with favorable resource endowments and
a steady inflow of cheap labor from neighboring Sahelian countries, has
been conducive to rapid economic development. The last Party Congress held
in October 1985 clarified the procedures for an orderly transfer of power,
in which the President of the National Assembly would become the interim
President for a period of up to 60 days, pending the calling into session
of a special Party Congress for the expressed purpose of choosing a
Presidential successor.
1/ A full-fledged Economic Report is presently being discussed with the
Gover.ment and will be circulated to the Board shortly.



- 2 -
4.        During the decade extending from the mid-sixties to the mid-
seventies, the development of the Cote d'Ivoire was characterized by rapid
economic growth and by profound structural changes within a relatively
stable external environment. Between 1965 and 1975, GDP grew at a real
average annual rate of 7.7 percent. This period of rapid growth and
structural change was achieved without major internal or external
macroeconomic imbalances.
5.        By contrast, during the second half of the seventies, the economy
of Cote d'Ivoire experienced a rapid succession of external shocks,
including a coffee and cocoa boom from 1975 to 1977, a rapid deterioration
in the market conditions for these commodities from 1977 to 1979 and a
sharp increase in import prices in 1979. At the same time, macroeconomic
and sectoral policies pursued by the Government progressively deteriorated.
Following the rapid increase in Stabilization Fund (CAISSTAB) revenues
generated by the boom in coffee and cocoa prices, the Government embarked
on an overambitious public investment program mainly directed toward large
projects with high unit costs and low economic returns. When Stabilization
Fund revenues started to dwindle after 1978, the Government relied on
foreign borrowing and on domestic money supply expansion to finance its
investment program, leading to a rapid acceleration of domestic inflation.
The resulting intensification of import competition was met by quantitative
import restrictions in industry, which led to a growing anti-export bias in
the sector and further aggravated the discrimination against agriculture
resulting from inadequate adjustments in producer prices, especially for
export crops other than cocoa and coffee.
6.        Fueled by the rapid expansion of public investment, GDP grew at a
real average annual rate of 7.6 percent between 1975 and 1980. The result-
ing pattern of growth led to a strong expansion of the sectors linked with
the increase in urban demand, and to a marked slowdown in export crop
output growth. The associated import growth contributed to a fundamental
deterioration of the trade balance. As a result, the goods and services
balance, which had remained steadily in surplus between 1965 and 1975,
turned into a deficit starting in 1980.
7.        The overexpansion of economic activity, together with the
negative external shocks experienced after 1978, contributed to a rapid
deterioration in internal and external financial equilibria. Internally,
public savings declined rapidly. Combined with the continued expansion of
public investment, this led to a sharp increase in public sector deficits.
As a result, medium- and long-term debt outstanding increased from 17.8 to
35.2 percent of GDP between 1975 and 1980. The current account deficit
went from 8.2 to 17.4 percent of GDP over the same interval and the
increase in foreign capital inflows to the public sector was not sufficient
to offset this deterioration. By 1980, the overall deficit had reached
7.7 percent of GDP, and the Cote d'Ivoire had exhausted its official
reserves.



PART II - THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROCESS: 1980-1985
Launching the Structural Adjustment Process
8.        Faced with a rapid deterioration of the economic and financial
.situation, the Government launched at the end of 1981 a structural
adjustment program with the objectives of stabilizing the economy,
improving macroeconomic management and laying the foundation for a
resumption of growth in the medium to long term. This program was
supported by two Structural Adjustment Loans from the Bank and by an EFF
and two stand-by programs with the Fund.
9.        The structural adjustment program was based on two major
components:
(a) a series of immediate policy actions with the objective of
stabilizing the economy and correcting the most obvious
deficiencies in the system of economic incentives; and
(b) a reassessment of development strategies in the productive
sectors with the objective of implementing comprehensive policy
reforms aimed at restoring self-sustained growth over the longer
term.
10.       Under the first component, the Government applied a set of
stabilization measures, including:
(a) a tightening of domestic credit to the public and parapublic
sectors;
(b)  an interest rate policy designed to encourage domestic resource
mobilization and to limit transfers abroad;
(c) a sharp reduction in public current and capital expenditures in
real terms;
(d) a reform of the parapublic sector to reduce its burden on public
finances and to improve its efficiency; and
(e) producer price increases for cash and food crops.
11.       Concurrently, as part of the second component, the Government:
(a) improved the institutional efficiency of macroeconomic
management;
(b) rationalized public investment programming;
(c) improved the external debt management system;



- 4 -
(d) designed and introduced the first stage of a comprehensive reform
of the system of industrial incentives aimed at reducing
protection, increasing efficiency and eliminating the anti-export
bias in the sector; and
(e) initiated the design of a comprehensive reform of the
agricultural incentive system, including producer prices, input
subsidies, and the external trade regime.
Performance of the Economy
12.       Between 1981 and 1985, the Ivorian economy showed a good response
to the structural adjustment program. Stabilization measures were strictly
pursued even though slippages did occur in 1982 and 1983 as a result of
exogenous factors, including an increase in real rates of interest in
international financial markets; lower than forecast domestic oil output; a
decline in external terms of trade in 1981 and 1982; and a severe drought
in 1983. Starting in 1984, the Government intensified the stabilization
program with good fiscal and balance of payments results. However, the
structural adjustment process so far has not achieved the change in
relative prices of tradeable and non-tradeable goods required to reallocate
resources towards production for exports. 2/
13.       After registering a slightly positive growth in real GDP of
1.2 percent in 1981, the Cote d'Ivoire economy suffered three consecutive
years of recession. Between 1981 and 1984, real GDP declined by
4.0 percent per year on average, translating into a cumulative drop of
21.4 percent in GDP per capita over the same interval.
14.       On the supply side, agricultural value added, after essentially
stagnating in 1931 and 1982, dropped by 11.0 percent in 1983 and remained
at the same depressed level in 1984 as a result of the drought experienced
during the 1983-84 agricultural campaign. In 1985, with the return of
normal rainfall patterns, agricultural value added recovered by an
estimated 9.0 percent, regaining the output levels achieved prior to the
drought. Industrial and services value added were negatively affected by
the contraction of domestic demand over the same period. Between 1981 and
1984, industrial value added declined by 33.5 percent and services value
added by 8.0 percent in real terms. In 1985, however, both sectors
witnessed a slight turnaround in conjunction with an increase in private
consumption.
15.       On the demand side, total domestic demand declined by a
cumulative 18.9 percent between 1981 and 1984. The impact was particularly
severe on private investment, which declined by a cumulative 65.1 percent
2/ Taking 1981 as a base, the index of the relative price of tradeable
and non-tradeable goods was estimated to be 98.0 in 1984.

during the period, partially due to the phasing out of investments in the
oil sector. As a result, the share of private investment in GDP declined
from 14.4 percent in 1981 to 5.4 percent in 1984. Over the same interval,
public investment was cut by a cumulative 39.2 percent in real terms, and
its share in GDP consequently declined from 9.7 percent in 1981 to
6.9 percent in 1984, compared to 15.2 percent in 1978. In 1985, public
investment was cut by a further 28.3 percent in real terms, while private
investment recovered by an estimated 5.7 percent in real terms, the first
such increase since 1981.
Government Finance
16.       The drastic measures taken since 1981 to reduce public
expenditures, together with a sharp increase in CAISSTAB revenues, led to a
major improvement of the public finance situation over the 1981-1985 period
(Table 2). On the one hand, between 1981 and 1985, Government consumption
expenditures were cut by 19.9 percent in real terms as a result of the
implementation of a wide range of cost-reducing measures, in particular a
freeze on public salaries, reductions in fringe benefits for civil
servants, a freeze on some grade promotions, and sharp reductions in the
number of daily paid workers and in technical assistance personnel. On the
other hand, Government receipts remained practically constant in real terms
between 1981 and 1984, as the sharp increase in CAISSTAB revenues was
offset by the decline in the tax to GDP ratio. Combined with a cumulative



- 6 -
53.1 percent reduction in public investment between 1981 and 1985, these
led to a contraction in the Government deficit to GDP ratio from
13.1 percent in 1981 to 5.2 percent in 1984, and to a surplus equivalent to
1.5 percent of GDP in 1985.

17.           The Government succeeded in reducing the loss to GDP ratio of the
para-public sector from -0.9 percent in 1981 to an estimated -0.5 percent
in 1985 (Table 3). At the same time, the ratio of Government transfers to
public enterprises with respect to GDP, after increasing from 3.0 percent
in 1981 to 6.7 percent in 1984, declined to 5.0 percent in 1985. Overall,
the financing requirements of the parapublic sector decreased from 6.1
percent of GDP in 1982 to 2.8 percent in 1985, largely as a result of the
reduction in fixed capital investment since 1982.

Balance of Payments
18.         Between 1981 and 1985, the goods and services balance improved
dramatically, from a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP in 1981 to a surplus of
13.9 percent in 1985 (Table 4). This evolution was essentially the result
of the reduction in imports due to the expenditure-reducing effects of the
stabilization program. Between 1981 and 1985, imports of goods and
services declined by a cumulative 16.0 percent in real terms, while
exports of goods and services increased by only 1.3 percent per year in
real terms.

19.         Until  1983, the improvement in the goods and services balance did
not translate into a corresponding improvement of the current balance,
whose deficit remained at about 13 percent of GDP, mainly due to the
increase in interest payments on external public debt. Net capital inflows
to the public sector, after reaching a record US$852 million in 1982,
declined abruptly to US$42 million in 1983, reflecting increased
difficulties experienced by the Government in mobilizing fresh money from
private financing sources. As a result, the overall balance of payments
deficit widened considerably. Since 1983, the current balance situation
has shown a dramatic improvement, going from -13.3 percent of GDP to
+3.6 percent in 1985. The increase in net capital inflows to the public



-8-
sector made possible by the rescheduling of external debt reinforced the
improvement in the trade balance, and the overall balance showed a surplus
of 5.0 percent of GDP in 1985.
External Debt
20.             Between 1981 and 1984, medium and long-term debt outstanding
(excluding IMF) increased from 51.4 to 73.6 percent of GDP (Table 5). As
of December 31, 1984, medium and long-term debt outstanding mounted to
US$4.8 billion, of which 58.9 percent was due to private financing sources.
The share of principal repayments on private debt in total repayments
amounted to 89.4 percent, and the share of interest payments on private
debt in total payments to 74.1 percent. Based on the amount of debt
outstanding as of December 31, 1984, the Cote d'Ivoire's existing external
debt obligations (including IMF) will amount to more than US$1.0 billion a
year until 1989. This highlights the need to design a coherent medium-term
financial strategy, based on debt relief, the mobilization of new
resources, or a combination of both. It also highlights the need to
proceed with a strategy of public sector retrenchment and to rely on the
private sector as the primary engine of growth in the economy.

Assessment
21.       The structural adjustment process encountered some difficulty in
gaining momentum through 1983 as previous excessive Government borrowings
left little manoeuvering room and unforeseen exogenous factors complicated
the task. However, starting in 1984, the Government moved to intensify its
adjustment efforts, such that on balance, the record of the 1981-1985
stabilization period is positive. The Government has succeeded in
restoring internal and external macroeconomic equilibria, largely through
the expenditure-reducing effect of the stabilizarion program. At the same
time, a series of measures have been implemented to initiate the
restructuring of the economy. Key parapublic enterprises in the
agricultural sector have been rehabilitated. Producer prices for
agricultural products other than coffee and cocoa have been adjusted at
regular intervals in line with world prices. In early 1985, the Government
implemented the first phase of a comprehensive reform of the system of
industrial incentives, covering about 60 percent of manufacturing value
added in the country.
22.       Despite the progress achieved in the past four years, the task of
restructuring the economy of Cote d'Ivoire is by no means over. Many of
the actions so far taken must now be extended and broadened so as to ensure
that structural changes firmly take root. The challenge is greatest in the
productive sectors where policies to improve the relative price of
tradeables versus non-tradeables, to redress rural-urban terms of trade, to
increase rural incomes and to encourage private investment are critical to
the resumption of sustained growth over the medium term. The SAL III
program, conceived as a step forward in the medium term plan of structural
adjustment, seeks to consolidate and strengthen the policy reforms
undertaken in the context of SALs I and II in order to meet this challenge.
PART III - THE MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK AND THE SAL III PROGRAM
Introduction
28.       In its Statement of Development Policy - 1986 (Annex V-A), the
Government of Cote d'Ivoire presents the reform measures it intends to
apply in the framework of its structural adjustment program. This program
aims at achieving sustained growth of GDP led by the expansion of exports,
based on a systematic exploitation of areas of comparative advantage, an
increase in the overall savings ratio, and an increase in the share of
private savings and investment in GDP. This implies Government's
acceptance of its role as the residual source of investment in the economy,
and a shift from the public to the private sector as the main engine of
growth over the medium term. The Government also recognizes that its
structural kijustment program must be supported by a coherent medium-term
financial strategy (see Part IV).



- 10 -
29.       The Government's action program comprises two main areas:
(a) Macroeconomic Policies
- Medium-Term Framework
- Macroeconomic and Financial Coordination
- Public Investment
- Current Expenditures
- Public Enterprises
- Financial Sector
(b) Sectoral Policies
- Agriculture
- Industry
- Energy
The Government's action program in each of these areas is discussed more
fully in what follows. The main actions are also summarized in matrix form
(Annex V-B). The Statement of Development Policy - 1986 contains a
specific calendar of monitorable actions (Annex V-A, pages 19-26).
The Medium-Term Framework
30.       The Government recognizes that the period of crisis management
and emergency ad hoc measures to stabilize the economy has now passed and
in its Statement of Development Policy - 1986, explicitly commits itself to
adopt a medium-term framework to ensure consistency between macro and
sectoral objectives, strategies, and policy instruments. This medium-term
framework will be developed in the context of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, to
be completed by mid-1986 for presentation to the National Assembly.
31.       The Adjustment Strategy.  In its Statement of Development Policy,
the Government has reiterated that the development strategy for C^ote
d'Ivoire over the medium term will revolve around the following basic
themes:
(a) ar. export-oriented growth strategy along the lines of comparative
aiv;mtage based on a progressive opening up of the economy to the
pressures of market forces;
(b) a re-orientation of the public sector towards the types of
activities for which it is best suited (supportive role to
production and exports) in order to allow the private sector to
play a leading role in directly productive activities; and
{c) a strategy to alleviate the debt burden over the medium term,
thereby freeing resources for a return to a growth path which
would restore international creditworthiness and raise per capita
incomes.



- 11 -
32.       In designing this strategy, three key constraints should be taken
into account:
(a) first, the pace of the economic expansion will need to remain
compatible with a rate of domestic inflation that does not exceed
the rate of inflation among C6te d'Ivoire main trading partners.
The Government will therefore need to maintain a tight control
over the growth of monetary aggregates, especially since the
Franc zone arrangements rule out the use of the nominal exchange
rate in correcting for a drift in the purchasing-power-parity
relationship. Within this overall constraint, expansion of
credit to the public/semi-public sector will need to be
restrained in order to avoid any crowding-out of private sector
investment;
(b) second, the evolution of the public investment program and of
public current expenditures will need to remain compatible with
the necessity of amortizing the external public debt; and
(c) third, the pattern of economic growth will need to remain
compatible with the equilibrium of the external accounts over the
medium-term. To this end, the Government will need to provide an
adequate level of incentives to the production of tradeables for
exports, essentially by generalizing reduced protection levels in
industry and by reversing the existing discrimination against
agriculture in the system of incentives.
33.       The 1986 Economic Program.  In 1986, GDP is expected to grow by
2.8 percent in real terms.  This should result from the anticipated
performance of industry and services value added (which are estimated to
grow by 5.4 percent and 4.3 percent respectively) in response to the rapid
pick-up in domestic demand. By contrast, agricultural value added should
only grow by a moderate 1.5 percent given that the results of the 1984-85
cocoa-coffee campaign were unusually high in relation to previous levels.
34.       The Government's fiscal targets for 1986 are expected to be
compatible with a manageable public sector deficit, estimated at
0.9 percent of GDP. Domestic and import tax revenues are expected to
increase by 10.3 percent in nominal terms as a result of the expansion of
economic activity, partially compensating for the anticipated drop in
CAISSTAB receipts to 22.6 percent of Government revenues versus
31.1 percent in 1985. Public capital expenditures are estimated to decline
by 11.1 percent in nominal terms by comparison with 1985, as the



- 12 -
34.8 percent 3/ increase in nominal fixed public capital formation is more
than offset by the reduction in net lending and other transfers.  The small
public sector deficit is expected to be financed without increasing net
public sector borrowing, mainly as a result of the sharp reduction in the
amount of domestic arrears that are left to be repaid in 1986.
35.       At the same time, despite a reduction in the surplus of the goods
and services balance from 13.9 percent of GDP in 1985 to an estimated
7.6 percent in 1986 due to a domestic demand-induced increase in imports,
the overall balance is estimated to show a surplus estimated at 0.9 percent
of GDP in 1986, compared to 5.0 percent in 1985. Gross foreign borrowing
requirements of the public sector are estimated to reach US$885 million in
1986. This implies a financing gap estimated at US$350 million in 1986,
which will need to be filled through rescheduling of existing debt,
injections of fresh money, or a combination of both.
36.       The Bank's Medium-term Projections.  The Bank has prepared, using
a macroeconomic policy model for Cote d'Ivoire, a Base Case scenario
simulating the evolution of the economy under conditions of structural
adjustment. This scenario is based on a set of monetary, fiscal and
incentives policies designed to achieve self-sustained growth over the
medium-term while satisfying the overall objectives and key constraints
identified above (paras 31-32). Table 6 presents the projections of the
key economic variables and performance indicators for the Fifth Plan period
(1986-1990). Figure 1 illustrates the trends in selected macroeconomic
indicators.
37.       These projections are based on three critical assumptions.
First, the yearly increase in credit outstanding from the Central Bank to
the Goverment is assummed to remain within 20 percent of the previous
year's increase in fiscal receipts, in line with BCEAC regulations, and the
rediscount ceiling for private sector credit with the Central Bank is
calibrated to yield a rate of domestic inflation in line with the projected
rate of international inflation taking into account an expected revaluation
of the French Franc vis-a-vis the US dollar. Second, the Government is
assumed to constrain the growth of public consumption and of public
investment to a target rate of 3 and 2.5 percent per year in real terms,
respectively between 1986 and 1990. These targets are considered to be
compatible with investment in infrastructure in support of the expansion of
the productive sectors, and the adequate funding of recurrent expenditures
associated with existing and projected investments. Government transfers
to public enterprises are assumed to be reduced to within 0.7 percent of
3/   After a cumulative decline of 61.4 percent in real terms since 1982,
the public investment growth rate for 1986 was set at 35 percent.
This figure includes a catch-up effect from the artificially low
levels of 1985 and the impact of investments undertaken in the context
of the Bank's Second Highway Sector Loan.

GDP by 1990 from 5.0 percent In 1985, while the share of the public
enterprises operating surplus in GDP is assumed to reach 2.8 percent by
1990 compared to 1.3 percent in 1985. Third, the scenario assumes the
generalization of the industrial incentives reform and the implementation
of a comprehensive reform of agricultural incentives, including a tariff
and export compensatory payment scheme for food crops and diversification
export crops. Coffee and cocoa domestic producer prices are assumed to be
raised by 2 percent per year in real terms between 1986 and 1990.
38.       The Base Case scenario assumes that, in the absence of further
rescheduling after 1985, the financing gap of the public sector would be
filled by fresh money from private commercial sources. In practice, the
question to be resolved by the Government and its financial partners is the
extent to which this financing gap will be filled by rescheduling existing
loans, by injections of fresh money, or through a combination of both.
This question is taken up in Part IV.
39.       The Base Case indicates a GDP growth rate of 3.0 percent per
annum on average between 1986 and 1990, representing a decline of about
1.0 percent per year in GDP per capita over the interval. The achievement
of this growth rate will essentially depend on the growth of the productive
sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing. This in turn will depend on
the continuation of public finance discipline to free the domestic
resources required for the financing of private investment in support of
growth in the productive sectors.
40.       The Base Case leads to a stabilization of the public finance
situation over the medium term. This outcome is made possible by the
containment in the growth of current and capital expenditures, the
reduction of Government transfers to public enterprises, and the increase
in fiscal receipts induced by the expansion of GDP. Moreover, the
projections lead to a stabilization of the balance of payments situation
over the 1986-1990 Plan horizon. This result would be achieved essentially
on the response of the economy to the incentive reforms applied in the
productive sectors, and in particular by a rapid expansion of
diversification export crops output and of manufactured exports. The
external debt profile under the scenario shows a sharp increase in the debt
service ratio during the critical 1986-1989 period, when it remains above
33 percent in the absence of further rescheduling. However, the scenario
leads to a decline in this ratio starting in 1989, when reductions in net
borrowing during the stabilization program begin to lower debt service.
41.       The tightness of the Base Case scenario highlights the inherent
trade-off between growth and debt amortization faced by the authorities
over the remainder of the decade. In this context, demand management
policies which would attempt to foster GDP growth beyond the potential
supply response of the productive sectors would lead to unsustainable
internal and external disequilibria. In particular, while a higher GDP
growth profile could be temporarily achieved through a more rapid expansion
of the public investment program, this would result in a widening public
sector deficit and increased borrowing requirements abroad, leading to



- 17 -
higher debt service payments in the future and further delaying the
restoration of creditworthiness. At the same time, the expansion of the
public investment program could crowd out private investment and therefore
result in a progressive weakening of the longer-term growth potential of
the productive sectors.
42.       The Base Case scenario is only one of several possible
alternatives and is used to illustrate the narrow path upon which Cote
d'Ivoire must embark if it is to successfully complete the structural
adjustment process. This Base Case is subject to a number of downside
risks, including lower than expected international prices for coffee and
cocoa, increases in interest rates on public debt, as well as the
sensitivity of agricultural output to year-to-year variations in climatic
conditions. The Government could counter such negative factors through a
combination of tighter monetary and fiscal policies, and the further
intensification of incentive reforms in the productive sectors.
Macroeconomic and Financial Coordination
43.       In its Letter of Development Policy - 1986, the Government
recognizes the necessity of achieving a greater coherence between
macroeconomic and sectoral objectives, targets, policy instruments and
institutional coordination.
44.       Since 1981, the Government has taken initial steps to improve
macroeconomic management and coordination.  In 1982, a Committee for
Financial Coordination and Investment Control was set up to produce
economic and financial indicators needed to assess performance under the
financial recovery program. Since then, the BSIE and the BGF have been
determined on a year-by-year basis in the context of a macroeconomic
envelope compatible with resource availability. Now that the stabilization
phase is largely completed, the public expenditure programming process
needs to be geared toward the medium term. In its Letter of Development
Policy - 1986, the Government commits itself to:
(a) prepare a Five-Year Plan covering the period 1986-1990 in line
with the objectives and the requirements of the structural
adjustment program;
(b) prepare the 1987-89 Schema-Directeur and the 1987-89
Loi-Programme in conformity with the structural adjustment
program;
(c) prepare the 1987 BGF and the 1987 BSIE in line with the
Schema-Directeur and the Loi-Programme; and
(d) strengthen planning and public expenditure programming
capabilities in particular through the proper funding of
institutions in charge of macroeconomic coordination and the
adoption of sound project selection criteria.



- 18 -
45.       The Government intends to review with the Bank the 1986-1990
Plan, the 1987-1989 Schema-Directeur and Loi-Programme and the 1987 BSIE
and BGF before the release of the second tranche (September 1986).
Satisfactory preparation of the above in conformity with the requirements
of the structural adjustment program would constitute a condition of second
tranche release.
Government Investment
46.       Since the beginning of the structural adjustment program in 1981,
the Government has attached top priority on bringing the level of the
investment program in line with available resources, and improving its
composition.
47.       Between 1975 and 1978, the Government investment program
increased fivefold in nominal terms, from CFAF 54 billion to CFAF 257
billion. In 1981, the Government investment program amounted to
CFAF 272 billion, or 11.7 percent of GDP. Since 1981, the Government has
taken drastic steps to reduce the size of its program, improve its
composition and eliminate projects of dubious economic merit. Between 1981
and 1985, the Government investment program was reduced by two-thirds in
nominal terms (from CFAF 272 billion to CFAF 88 billion). Between 1983 and
1985, the share of agriculture in Government investment increased from 25.5
to 34.7 percent. Within agriculture, investments linked with the sugar
program were progressively phased out, and their share consequently
declined from 5.9 to 2.0 percent. Over the same interval, the share of
investment in export crops other than sugar increased from 4.9 to
10.0 percent of the total, essentially reflecting the expansion of the
rubber program. In 1986, the finalized BSIE amounts to CFAF 115.7 billion
or 3.4 percent of GDP, 4/ of which CFAF 37.9 billion, or 32.8 percent of
the total, is allocated to agriculture.  The share of buildings and public
works increases from 46.6 percent in 1985 to 53.7 percent in 1986,
essentially in response to the start-up of catch-up investments under the
Highway Sector Program financed by the Bank.
48.       In parallel, the Government decided to improve the project
appraisal methodologies used in the preparation of investment projects by
the technical Ministries. More specifically, the Directorate of Planning
prepared, with support from the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan
(loan no. 2059), project appraisal manuals which were issued in mid-1985.
49.       Having largely succeeded in bringing Government investment to a
level compatible with available resources and in improving its composition,
the Government now intends to reinforce several elements of the investment
4/   Overall public investment (including Government and public
enterprises) amounts to CFAF 201.5 billion in 1986, or 6.0 percent of
GDP.

programming process. In particular, in its Letter of Development Policy -
1986, the Government commits itself to:
(a) ensure the dissemination of appropriate project appraisal
methodologies to the technical ministries with a view to
institutionalizing their use (December 1986);
(b) reinforce project identification capability within the various
technical ministries, with the objective of improving the
existing project pipeline (December 1986);
(c) establish, within the Directorate of Planning, a unit responsible
for managing the project cycle and for ensuring proper monitoring
of ongoing investment projects (First Semester 1986).
Current Expenditures
50.       Since 1981, the Government has attached an equally high priority
to improving its control over current expenditures. Between 1975 and 1981.
current expenditures increased nearly threefold in nominal terms,
equivalent to a 9.4 percent increase per year in real terms. Most of this
increase originated from the growth of social services, in particular
education and housing, whose share of total current expenditures increased
from 48.0 percent in 1975 to 52.3 percent in 1981.
51.       Between 1981 and 1984, however, current expenditures were reduced
by 7 percent in real terms, and their share of GDP declined from 18.1 to
16.4 percent. This favorable evolution resulted essentially from a series
of austerity measures implemented in the framework of the stabilization
program (para 16).
52.       Having largely succeeded in bringing the leve'l of current
expenditures under control, the Government now intends to initiate a
restructuring process, in particular by placing relative emphasis on the
adequate funding of the economic services that are essential for the
management of the economy, as well as the funding of the expenditures
linked with the policy reforms implemented under the structural adjustment
program, in particular the export compensatory payment scheme. The
Goverzment also intends to restructure personnel expenditures in the
context of a comprehensive reform of the civil service.
Public Enterprises
53.       Since the beginning of the structural adjustment program in 1981,
the Government has implemented a broad program of public enterprise sector
rehabilitation aimed at reducing the burden of the parapublic sector on
public finances and at improving the efficiency of public enterprises.
This program was structured around three main objectives: (i) improving
the monitoring and management of the sector at the Government level;
(ii) rationalizing the relationships between the Government and individual



- 20 -
enterprises; and (iii) improving financial and technical management at the
enterprise level.
54.       With respect to the first objective, the Public Enterprise
Control Directorate at the Ministry of Finance introduced in 1982 a ;ystem
of synoptic tables (tableaux de bord) designed to monitor key financial and
performance indicators on a quartely basis. This system, which was first
introduced in the transportation and telecommunications subsectors, was
subsequently extended to cover the 31 most important public enterprises in
the country. With respect to the second objective, the Government
introduced three types of instruments, depending on the type of activity
and the financial situation of the enterprises. A system of "Annual Action
Programs" was implemented for entities of the agricultural sector which
perform non-commercial activities and for which productivity objectives
cannot be adequately quantified. A system of "Program-Contracts", was
initiated, starting with SOTRA in the transport subsector. Similarly, a
system of "Management Performance Follow-ups" was implemented for
enterprises in the non-competitive sector which do not require budgetary
support, such as ONT in the Telecommunication sector. With respect to the
third objective of improving public enterprise efficiency, management
audits were performed for a total of 15 enterprises. 5/ These audits led
to the preparation of rehabilitation plans for 10 enterprises.
55.       The program of action implemented in the framework of the
structural adjustment program led to a substantial amelioration of the
consolidated operating results of the public enterprise sector. Between
1982 and 1985, the consolidated net operating surplus of the sector
increased from CFAF 12.6 billion, or 0.5 percent of GDP, to CFAF 41.6
billion, or 1.3 percent of GDP. Among individual enterprises, reductions
in operating deficits were particularly marked in the case of SODESUCRE
(from CFAF 9.0 billion in 1982 to reach equilibrium in 1985) and SIR (from
CFAF 32.5 billion to CFAF 13.5 billion). At the same time, operating
surpluses increased rapidly in the case of PALKINDUSTRIE, from CFAF 6.9
billion in 1982 to CFAF 14.3 billion in 1985.
56.       Efforts to further reduce the burden of the parapublic sector on
public finances and to continue to increase the efficiency of public
enterprises will be intensified in the framework of the structural
adjustment strategy. In particular, yearly targets will be established for
the reduction of overall Government transfers to public enterprises and for
the increase in the net operating surplus of the sector, as well as a set
of yearly targets for the increase in operating surpluses or the reduction
in operating deficits of key enterprises. Preliminary targets suggest a
reduction in overall Government transfers to public enterprises from an
estimated 5.0 percent of GDP in 1985 to a target 0.7 percent by 1990, and
5/   RAN, PALMINDUSTRIE, SATMACI, CIDT, SODESUCRE, SODEPRA, SODEFOR,
MOTORAGRI, SIVENG, SOTRA, SETU, SICOGI, SOGEFIHA, ONT/OPT and SIR.



- 21 -
an increase in the net operating surplus of the sector from 1.3 percent of
GDP in 1985 to 2.8 percent in 1990.
57.       In the framework of its Letter of Development Policy - 1986, the
Government commits itself to:
(a) reduce transfers from the Government to the parapublic sector by
30 percent in real terms in 1986 (December 1986);
(b) strengthen the financial monitoring of the parapublic sector at
the central Government level, as well as improve in the
accounting procedures at the enterprise level (synoptic tables
for 31 enterprises) (December 1986);
(c) implement and follow-up management audits for EECI, SODEPRA and
MOTORAGRI (December 1986);
(d) implement rehabilitation plans for SIR, EECI, SODESUCRE, ONP and
ONT (December 1986);
(e) establish Program-Contracts for at least four enterprises, namely
PALMINDUSTRIE, EECI, ONT and PAA (December 1986). These
institutions are being rehabilitated in tne context of Bank
lending operations; and
(f) improve bidding and budgetary procedures in the parapublic sector
(December 1986).
58.       The reduction of transfers to the parapublic sector will be
closely monitored at the level of the major loss-making entities and
globally through the synoptic tables prepared quarterly. Satisfactory
progress in the reduction of Government transfers to the parapublic sector
would be a condition of second tranche release (December 1986).
Financial Sector
59.       The Co^te d'Ivoire has mobilized most domestic savings through
fiscal mechanisms rather than through financial intermediation, but tax
yields have grown slowly and are unlikely to provide major net increases.
Although there is room for additional tax revenues through comprehensive
fiscal reform, this would initially only compensate for the elimination of
certain taxes and duties and the increases in tudget outlays which are
needed to achieve the agriculture and industry incentives reforms.
External resources will also be scarce, given the already high burden of
external debt. It is therefore important to expand domestic savings, to
improve mobilization of financial savings, and above all to allocate them
to the most productive uses.
60.       The Statement of Development Policy - 1986 envisages the
implementation of a number of measures which are needed to increase



- 22 -
domestic savings mobilization and improve their allocation. These include
(i) phasing out the tax on interest payments on bank loans (taxe sur les
prestations de services or TPS); (ii) the introduction of instruments to
develop the capital market; and (iii) the establishment of a system of
export credit and of an export credit guarantee scheme.
61.       Over the years, the fiscal needs of the Government and the ease
of collecting the TPS through the banks have led to a steady rise in its
rate from 10 percent in 1970 to 25 percent, adding substantially to the
cost of credit and limiting its access for many enterprises. Furthermore,
while the TPS can be deducted from the value added tax (VAT), this is not
possible for all borrowers (e.g. individuals, small enterprises, or
exporters), so the incidence of the tax is unequal across economic
activities. The VAT itself is not uniformally applied as the transport and
service sectors are currently not subject to the tax. The TPS has become
an important source of revenue, but as its economic impact is negative, it
should be phased out. Concurrently, the VAT should be extended to the
transport and services sectors which would compensate for the fiscal loss
resulting from the elimination of the TPS.
62.       In view of the need for increased mobilization of domestic
resources, a domestic capital market needs to be established within the
regulatory framework of ECEAO control system. In the first instance, four
types of instruments could be developed, while the stock exchange is
reactivated: (a) Treasury bills of different maturities (ranging from 6
months to 3 years), which could be publicly issued and freely traded; (b)
long term obligations, to be issued by banks and large enterprises; (c)
shares in public enterprises to be sold to the public, in the context of
the policy of privatization; and (d) mutual funds to be managed by banks.
The Government is to issue, or revise the legislation needed to establish
the above instruments in consultation with BCEAO. It will also take the
appropriate steps for the establishment of a scheme for housing credit to
be supported by a proposed Bank-financed Urban Development Project.
63.       Resuming and sustaining the growth of exports is the central
element in ensuring the success of Cote d'Ivoire structural adjustment
process. Payment for Ivorian exports is often uncertain, particularly in
regional markets, and exporters have difficulty obtaining bank credit for
their activities because of this risk. In 1981, a detailed study of the
justification, organization and financing of an export credit insurance
agency was carried out. The Government endorses the main findings of this
study, which should be updated with particular focus on evaluating the
costs and financing, mainly by enterprises, of such a system, and drafting
statutes for setting up the insurance institution which could become
operational within a year.
64.       Additional instruments to support exporters would include a
central bank rediscount facility for export credits, export pre-financing
credit and rediscountable medium-term suppliers' credits. The above
mentioned study established such needs, but requires revision to determine
the exact conditions for their financing. At present, the Cote d'Ivoire



- 23 -
exports a small amount of capital equipment (agricultural equipment, truck
trailers, irrigation pumps) in the regional market. Capital goods exports
could be developed further in the future; in order to facilitate this, a
feasibility study is needed to design a system of rediscount for
medium-term suppliers credits which would enable Ivorian entrepreneurs to
offer competitive financial conditions to both local and foreign buyers.
65.       In its Statement of Development Policy - 1986, the Government
commits itself to:
(a) reduce, and eventually phase out the TPS on interest payments
with a minimum initial reduction of 5 percentage points in 1986
(June 1986);
(b) complete a study of the modalities of extension of the VAT system
to the transport and services sectors (December 1986);
(c) complete a study on the reactivation of the capital market, and
in particular on the legislation needed to develop instruments
for mobilizing savings (December 1986);
(d) establish mechanisms for export prefinancing credit and export
credit insurance (December 1986); and
Ce) initiate a feasibility study for a system of refinancing of
medium-term suppliers credits (December 1986).
66.       Satisfactory progress in the implementation of financial sector
reforms including initial reduction (a minimum of 5 percentage points) of
the TPS on interest payments (June 1986) would constitute a condition of
second tranche release. This would be followed by the progressive
elimination of the TPS on interest payments over the next five years.
Policy Actions at the Sectoral Level
Agriculture
67.       Over the past two decades, agriculture has provided the main
impetus for growth in the Ivorian economy. The past expansion of the
sector resulted mainly from a combination of several favorable factors,
including abundant availability of fertile land, high immigration of
productive and cheap labor from neighboring Sahelian countries, relatively
favorable international prices and market prospects for major agricultural
exports, and a stable political and economic environment combined with
considerable technical assistance support.
68.       Since the beginning of the eighties, the agricultural sector has
been undergoing a critical transition, as the extensive development pattern
followed in the south is progressively reaching its capacity while further
expansion in the north will require the adoption of labor-saving
technologies. However, because of past policies, agricultural incomes have



- 24 -
remained too low to promote the development of an agricultural
middle-income group capable of generating substantial increases in
productivity. The lack of improved agricultural practices is particularly
marked in cocoa, coffee and foodcrop production, while in the Northern
Savanna zone, where cultivation is amenable to mechanization, farmers still
use mostly manual methods.
69.       The key challenge now facing the agricultural sector is to
maintain its contribution to GDP growth and exports in the face of
diminished prospects for its three main cash crops, namely coffee, cocoa,
and timber. To meet this challenge, the Government has decided to move in
three areas. First, there is considerable scope for area expansion and
productivity growth of diversification export crops with a high comparative
advantage, namely rubber, oil palm, coconut and pineapples in the forest
region and cotton in the savanna. 6/ Second, there is also scope for
continued expansion of a variety of food staples ranging from yams,
plantains and cassava to cereals such as rice, maize and sorghum. In
promoting food crop production, however, a delicate balance will need to be
achieved between the legitimate concerns for food security and the
relatively higher cost of most of these crops in terms of domestic
resources by comparison with diversification export crops. Third, the
contribution of coffee and cocoa to foreign exchange earnings needs to be
optimized, taking into account the membership of the CSte d'Ivoire in the
International Coffee Agreement on the one hand and the dominant position of
the country on the international cocoa market on the other hand.
70.       Since the beginning of the adjustment program in 1981, the
Government has taken several steps to support the development of the
agricultural sector along the lines mentioned above. The measures
implemented by the Government concentrated essentially on (i) initiating a
price and incentives reform in the rural sector; and (ii) reviewing and
reforming the most important public enterprises in the sector.
71.       Between 1981 and 1984, producer prices for major crops were
increased by amounts ranging from 25 to 35 percent in nominal terms. As a
result, rural/urban terms of trade started to improve beginning in 1983.
Concurrently, the Government implemented a new pricing formula based on
farmgate-equivalent world price in the rubber sector, and subsidies on the
price of cotton to local processing firms were abolished. In the context
of the Bank Financed Fifth Oil Palm Development Project (October 1985), the
Government liberalized transfer pricing arrangements between PALMINDUSTRIE
and the local processing company. Between 1981 and 1984, consumer prices
for bread, rice and palm oil were increased substantially to bring them in
line with world prices. At the same time, starting with the 1984/85
6/ Despite the comparative advantage observed for cotton in the past,
recent developments in the world market have led to uncertainties with
respect to the medium-term prospects for this crop.



- 25 -
campaign, fertilizer subsidies for cotton farmers--the major users--were
phased out in conjunction with an increase in the producer price of cotton.
For the 1985-86 campaign, the Government increased coffee and cocoa
producer prices from CFAF 375 to CFAF 400 per kilo, translating into a
stabilization in real terms.
72.       The Government launched management audits for seven agricultural
public enterprises, namely PALMINDUSTRIE, CIDT, SODESUCRE, SODEFOR,
SODEPRA, MOTORAGRI and SATMACI, and proceeded to pay off the arrears of
PALMINDUSTRIE, CIDT and SATMACI by the end of 1983. These management
audits laid the foundation for the preparation of restructuring programs
for these entities. The restructuring program of PALMINDUSTRIE has been
successfully implemented. The restructuring program of CIDT, involving the
financing of CIDT's cotton activities from its own resources and
improvements in cost accounting, is being implemented. The restructuring
program of SODESUCRE is presently being prepared by the Government. The
restructuring program of SODEFOR has been prepared and is being implemented
in the framework of the Second Forestry Project (FY85). The rehabilitation
programs for SODEPRA and MOTORAGRI are being finalized, and a comprehensive
reassessment of SATMACI's objective and field operations is being carried
out ir the context of the preparation of a national extension improvement
project.
73.       At the present stage of development of the C6te d'Ivoire,
agriculture will provide the mainstay of an export-led growth strategy,
both directly through the expansion of diversification crops and indirectly
through its contribution to the development of an agroprocessing sector
oriented toward export markets. In order to succeed in this strategy, the
Government is determined to change rural-urban terms of trade in favor of
the rural sector so as to generate the boost in rural incomes necessary to
foster technological change and to unleash the potential for productivity
growth. The profound change in the structure of incentives implied by this
strategy will be achieved both by increasing protection in favor of
agriculture and by reducing protection in the industrial sector. 7/
74.       In support of this medium-term strategy, the Government intends
to implement, in successive stages, a far-reaching program of policy
reforms based on two essential elements:
(a) a comprehensive reform of the system of agricultural incentives,
including producer prices, input subsidies, and the trade regime;
7/   At current exchange rates, a net effective protection coefficient of
unity translates approximately into a 1.20 effective protection
coefficient across the board in the agricultural sector, compared with
an interim target of 1.40 in the industrial sector, to be
progressively reduced to a target 1.20 over the longer term.



- 26 -
(b) a broad package of supporting actions including adequate funding
of priority operations, expansion of the public investment
program in the sector, upgrading of support services, and
restructuring of the institutional environment of the sector.
75.       The comprehensive reform of the system of agricultural
incentives, to be implemented in successive phases in the framework of the
medium-term adjustment strategy, will be based on the following principles:
(a) for all food crops and for all export crops with the exception of
coffee and cocoa, the system of import tariffs, import
restrictions, and export taxes will be thoroughly revised in
order to achieve a target net effective protection of at least
unity across-the board;
(b) for all crops, input subsidies will continue to be progressively
removed and the full import tariff will be progressively charged
on the purchase of agricultural implements; and
(c) for coffee and cocoa, the level of export taxes will be adjusted
in order to maximize the contribution of these two crops to
foreign exchange earnings.
76.       The application of these principles will imply on the one hand a
gradual evolution from a system of administered prices toward a system
where prices are set freely in the framework of a liberalized import
regime, and on the other, increasing reliance on trade incentives rather
than on domestic subsidies to achieve the level of effective protection
targeted under the program. The proper phasing of the required policy
measures will be critical to the success of the medium-term strategy. In
this respect, three major considerations would be taken into account by the
Government. First, the extent of the policy reforms will vary considerably
among crops, given the wide variation in initial conditions concerning the
trade regime, producer price policies, and the incidence of input subsidies
and of transfer pricing arrangements. Second. the relative speed of the
policy reforms among the various crops will be further influenced by the
social implications of price changes for sensitive products such as rice
and, to a lesser extent, palm oil. Third, each phase of the reform will
have to be carefully implemented in order to avoid a negative fiscal impact
which would impair the capacity of the country to amortize its external
debt and regain international creditworthiness. This is particularly the
case for producer price decisions in the coffee and cocoa sector, which
have to take into account international prices, the position of Cate
d'Ivoire on international markets for these two commodities, the imperative
of debt service, and the need to improve rural incomes.
77.       The design and implementation of a comprehensive package of
supporting actions are integral components of the medium-term strategy to
be pursued in the agricultural sector, notably adequate funding of field
operations and of input supply for the main agricultural agencies. A
coffee sector rehabilitation program is being prepared in conjunction with



- 27 -
ongoing support measures to improve cocoa quality, development programs to
accelerate the rate of growth of the rubber sector and to rehabilitate and
expand the coconut sector, a national program to upgrade extension
services, in particular through the introduction of the Training and Visit
system, a national program for agricultural research, and a program for the
improvement of food crop marketing. In the forestry sector, a National
Forestry Plan targeted for completion in mid 1986 will address the alarming
rate of deforestation and its potential ecological consequences.
78.       In parallel, the institutional environment of the sector will be
restructured, in particular through the rehabilitation of BNDA, SODEPRA and
MOTORAGRI, and through the improvement of the efficiency of regional
development agencies, in particular SATMACI and SODEPALM.
79.       In its Statement of Development Policy - 1986, the Government
commits itself to implement, in the framework of the Fifth Five-Year Plan,
a comprehensive development strategy for the agricultural sector
essentially geared towards the expansion of exports. The first phase
consists of a broad range of incentive reform measures with supporting
actions, including:
(a) an increase in coffee and cocoa prices in real terms for the
1986-87 campaign, to be determined in the light of the evolution
of world prices, coupled with the implementation of the first
phase of a coffee rehabilitation program, the expansion of the
cocoa quality upgrading program, and the completion of a study on
the merit and implications of introducing a producer price
differential in favor of coffee relative to cocoa;
(b) the phasing out of export taxes and application of the VAT system
for palm oil and its derivatives, sugar, cotton and its
derivatives, natural rubber, coconuts, coprah and their
derivatives, and fresh pineapples;
Cc) the introduction of a tariff and export compensatory payment
scheme for key diversification crops (rubber, oil palm, cotton,
coconut and pineapples) with the objective of reaching a level of
net effective protection of at least unity;
(d) the implementation of a program for the phased elimination of
subsidies on food crop seeds;
(e) the periodic review of consumer prices for rice and flour, and of
the producer price of paddy, with a view to introducing
adjustments in import tariffs for these products aimed at
achieving or maintaining a target net effective protection of at
least unity;
(f) the implementation of a comprehensive rehabilitation program for
the sugar industry;



- 28 -
(g) the adequate funding of agricultural support services, regional
development agencies, and research institutions in 1986 and 1987;
(h) the implementation of the first phase of a program of supporting
actions, including the preparation of a development piogram for
coconut and for rubber, the finalization of a national agronomic
research program. of a seed multiplication program, and of an
extension services improvement program; and
(i) the definition of a financial restructuring program for BNDA
based on the recently completed management audit.
80.       Satisfactory progress in the implementation of the program of
agricultural reforms and supporting actions would be a condition of second
tranche release. This would include specifically:
(a) an increase in cocoa-coffee prices in real terms, to be
determined in the light of the evolution of vorld prices
(August/September 1986);
Cb) a tariff and export compensatory payment scheme for
diversification crops (December 1986);
*c) the elimination of export taxes on diversification crops (June
1986); and
id) a plan of action to arrest the projected decline in coffee output
(December 1986).
Industry
81.       Since independence, the industrial sector has been one of the
most dynamic sectors in the Ivorian economy.  Between 1965 and 1980,
industry grew at an average annual rate of 10.7 percent in real terms,
while the share of industrial exports in total exports increased from 22.6
to 31.6 percent.
82.       The proliferation of quantitative import restrictions after 1975,
combined with the distortive impact of the 1973 tariff, resulted in a
growing anti-export bias in the sector which limited its long-term growth
potential, at a time when the most obvious opportunities for import
substitution and for exports to the protected markets of the CEAO zone had
been exploited. The long-term growth potential of the sector was further
limited by the presence of disincentives to the creation of interindustrial
linkages, which resulted from the escalation of the tariff schedule and
from tariff exemptions on intermediate inputs granted to priority firms
under the Investment Code.
83.       Between 1980 and 1984, industrial output declined by 7.5 percent
per year in real terms. Over the same interval, private non-oil investment
declined by a cumulative 70 percent in real terms, down to only 5 percent



- 29 -
of GDP in 1984. This crisis revealed the. fundamental weaknesses of the
Ivorian industrial structure and highlighted the need for a fundamental
reorientation of the industrial development strategy.
84.       In the framework of the First Structural Adjustment Loan, the
Government and the Bank launched a far-reaching dialogue on the key policy
issues facing the future development of the industrial sector in the C5ote
d'Ivoire. In this connection, the Government decided to fundamentally
reorient its industrial policy in favor of an outward-oriented strategy
based on a rapid expansion of exports. This strategy, to be implemented in
successive stages in the framework of the structural adjustment program, is
essentially based on a comprehensive reform of the system of industrial
incentives and on the restructuring of the institutions in charge of
industrial promotion. More specifically, the strategy comprises five
essential elements:
(a) a comprehensive tariff reform, with the objective of harmonizing
effective tariff protection around a target level of 40 percent
across the board, and subsequently of reducing net effective
protection of the sector to unity;
(b)  the phasing out of quantitative restrictions and of "valeurs
mercuriales" 8/, and their replacement by temporary import
surtaxes that are gradually declining over a period of five
years;
(c) the establishment of an across-the-board export compensatory
payment scheme designed to neutralize the bias against exports
induced by tariff protection;
(d) the revision of the Investment Code, in particular the abolition
of tariff exemptions on the purchase of intermediate inputs by
priority firms, and the revision of certain fiscal measures
pertaining to industry, in particular the extension of the
value-added tax system to the first processing stage of
agricultural raw materials; and
(e) the restructuring of the institutional environment of the sector,
in particular the establishment of an industrial projects
appraisal unit within the Ministry of Industry and the
establishment of an industrial promotion bureau.
In the framework of the Second Structural Adjustment Loan, the Government
implemented the first phase of the industrial reform, covering about
60 percent of manufacturing value added in the country (March 1985).

85.       In the context of the Statement of Development Policy - 1986, the
Government commits itself to:
(a) generalize the tariff reform to the entire industrial sector
(September 1986);
(b) completely remove quantitative restrictions and "valeurs
mercuriales" in the industrial sector, and replace them by
temporary import surtaxes declining over a maximum period of five
years (September 1986);
(c) generalize the export compensatory payment scheme to the entire
industrial sector (September 1986); and
(d) establish an industrial survey system to monitor 9/ the impact of
the reform on industrial enterprises (September 1986).
86.       Satisfactory progress in generalizing the reform of the system of
incentives in the industrial sector (September 1986) would be a condition
of second tranche release.
Energy
87.       Overall, energy self-sufficiency in the Cote d'Ivoire was
achieved in the early 1980s. Since 1983, however, several factors have
changed sector prospects. These include:
(a) uncertainties in oil production following the 1983 peak;
(b) the discovery of natural gas which diversifies further the
country's energy base and investment options;
(c) the recurrence of severe droughts leading to a reassessment of
the balance between hydroelectric and thermal power; and
(d) the deterioration in the efficiency of the three main public
entities of the sector-the oil refiner-y (SIR), the electric
utility company (EECI), and the national oil company (PETROCI),
and in the financial situation of SIR and EECI.
88.       Although the sectoral deterioration is explained to a large
extent by the combination of unfavorable climatic conditions and economic
clrcumstances and the relatively disappointing results of offshore
petroleum exploration efforts, the following structural weaknesses have
9/   A Bank-financed Industrial Restructuring and Development Project (Loan
No. 2617) is assisting industrial enterprises adjust to the new policy

been identified: a weak policy-making and planning capability within the
existing institutional framework, the narrow subsector focus and short-term
perspective of sector investment programming, inadequate incentives for oil
exploration, low capacity utilization of SIR and the ill-defined role of
PETROCI, and a distorted energy pricing policy underpinned more by ad-hoc
financial considerations than economic efficiency.
89.       The Government is designing an action program to enhance the
efficiency of the energy sector, by optimizing investments and improving
incentives for private sector hydrocarbon exploration, reducing subsidies
to loss-making entities, and rationalizing energy pricing policy.
90.       The Government has sought Bank advice on the most efficient way
of improving the institutional framework for policy-making and planning in
the sector. It is addressing the most pressing problem--coordination of
gas project studies--by the establishment of a Gas Committee representing
the Ministries of Mines and Industry, PETROCI and EECI. It has also
requested technical assistance for both the Ministry of Mines and the
Ministry of Industry.
91.       Since 1983, the Government has been negotiating with the
Phillips-led international Consortium the conditions under which the
Consortium would develop the recently discovered gas. Although the
Consortium's exploration permit expired in December 1985, an agreement is
still possible if suitable terms can be negotiated for lcag range gas sales
contracts with the main Ivorian customers, EECI and SIR. While
negotiations are still underway, the Gas Committee is coordinating the
preparation of a project to reduce the lead time for gas development.
Moreover, a study will be undertaken to prepare an optimal long-term
investment program to ensure timely commissioning of additional capacity to
meet projected demand. In the meantime, new investments during 1986-87
would be kept within ceilings agreed upon with the Bank.
92.       The Government is very keen to expand the country's hydrocarbon
reserve base. It is currently assessing the need for (i) the introduction
of desirable changes in the contractual framework to give companies the
alternative of signing "Seismic Option" contracts, which do not require a
commitment to drill costly wells in deep waters before seismic surveys
justify the expenditure; (ii) the establishment of a progressive tax system
to encourage the development of small marginal oil and gas fields, pressure
maintenance and enhanced oil recovery projects; (iii) a provision to permit
companies to consolidate profits and losses in different blocks for tax
purposes which would spur further investments by existing consortia; and
(iv) a reassessment of PETROCI's corporate role.
93.       A recently completed Bank-financed study reviewed alternative
options to improve the viability of the refinery (SIR) and identified a
series of immediate improvements in the areas of crude oil procurement,
financial control and ex-refinery pricing. The study's major conclusion is
that the refinery could become economically viable if (i) it is run on a
commercial basis and without external interference; and (ii) it could



- 32 -
improve its rate of capacity utilization through exports to neighboring
countries or processing agreements. The Government is implementing
measures identified in the areas of crude procurement and financial control
so as to improve the prospects for the economic viability of the refinery
and intends to improve the management of the refinery through provision of
technical assistance from an experienced oil company.
94.         The Government aims at restoring financial equilibrium of EECI
over the near term and is seeking Bank advice on the long run development
of a financially autonomous power sector. As part of the SAL III program,
the initial phase of a financial restructuring program for EECI will be
adopted and implemented. The ultimate aim of such a program will be to
ensure future expansion of EECI without public budget support. With
respect to PETROCI, the Government has decided to focus the company's role
on representation of the Government's commercial interests in petroleum
exploration and development. In effect, this will mean: (i) shifting some
of PETROCI's mandated tasks (e.g. monitoring of oil companies activities,
exploration promotion work, contract negotiations) to the Ministry of
Mines; and (ii) transfering to SIR responsibilities which do not pertain to
petroleum exploration/production, particularly the responsibility for crude
procurement. A study will be undertaken to analyze
organizational/staffing/financial implications of such a restructuring and
to set clear long-term objectives for the company in order to avoid its
future interference in policy-making and its over-reaching into areas not
consistent with its role. The study will also look into PETROCI's possible
role in the development and distribution of natural gas.
95.       The Government agrees that SIR management improvements will
require that ex-refinery prices be set at import parity (the exact
reference price formula would, however, provide for a smoothing of
day-to-day fluctuations in international prices and the exchange rate).
Government also recognizes that the transfer price of gas to be paid by SIR
and EECI should be set within a range determined by the economic cost of
gas to Cote d'Ivoire (including a depletion premium) and the opportunity
cost of alternative energy resources to its users. Moreover, it intends to
replace the interim and ad hoc adjustment of electricity rates by a tariff
policy based on long run marginal costs corresponding to a least cost power
development plan.
96.       In its Statement of Development Policy - 1986, the Government
commits itself to:
(a)  improve sector coordInation;
(b) adopt an investment program for 1986 and 1987 in conformity with
the Loi Programme and prepare a longer-term investment program in
the sector (September 1986);
(c) carry out a management audit of EECI and commence a study to
redefine the corporate role of PETROCI (April 1986);



- 33 -
(d) implement the financial rehabilitation program of EECI (June
1986);
(e) carry out a rehabilitation program for SIR including a revised
ex-refinery pricing policy and management reform (June 1986);
(f) define a gas-user price policy; and
(g) revise electricity tariff policy based or. long run marginal cost
(December 1986).
97.       Satisfactory progress in the implementation of the program of
energy sector reforms would be a condition of second tranche release. This
vould include in particular:
(a) a long-term investment program (September 1986);
(b) rehabilitation programs for EECI and SIR (September 1986); and
(c) appropriate pricing policies (para 94) for energy based products
(December 1986).
PART IV - THE SAL III PROGRAM IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
FINANCIAL STRATEGY: A CONCERTED APPROACH
The Medium-Term Financial Strategy
98.       The Ivorian economy, mortgaged for several years to come, faces
certain trade-offs, the most important of which concerns the decision of
balancing the requirements for achieving a moderate growth rate against the
necessity of amortizing the external debt. In its Statement of Development
Policy - 1986, the Government presents the broad dlrections of a carefully
calibrated medium-term financial strategy based on:
(a) an estimation of its external financing requirements in the light
of the structural adjustment program and in particular the
necessity of achieving a moderate growth rate;
(b)  a restructuring of the existing debt in order to allow for a
feasible debt service profile over the critical 1986-89 period;
(c) a close coordination of its medium-term financial strategy with
the Bank and the Fund; and
(d) the necessary consultations with the London and Paris Clubs with
support from the Bank, the Fund and other principal financial
partners.



- 34 -
99.       Financial Requirements.  The financial situation outlined in
Table 5 underscores the seriousness of the debt burden and highlights the
key indicators of creditworthiness on which the Government will need to
focus. These are:
(a)  an improvement in the ratio of medium and long term debt
outstanding to GDP;
(b)  a decline in the share of commercial debt to total debt
outstanding; and
(c)  a decline in the debt service ratio from the current 35 percent
range towards the more manageable target of 20 percent.
100.      The financial requirements of the Base Case scenario outlined in
paras 36-42 imply gross foreign borrowings (excluding IMF) of
US$3.9 billion or about US$770 million per annum over the 1986-1990 period.
Table 7 shows the gross disbursement profiles by type of lender under the
Base Case.  The disbursement profile for concessional sources of financing
is derived assuming that new commitments remain constant in real terms over
the 1986-1990 period. The disbursement profile of suppliers credits
follows the evolution of imports.

101.      The projected disbursements by type of lenders leave a financing
gap estimated at about US$1.25 billion over the 1986-1990 period, or
approximately US$250 million per year over the period.  These inflows will
need to be provided either through reschedulings of debt falling due,
injections of fresh money, or a combination of both. As shown in Table 8,
these financial requirements are compatible with:
(a) a lessening of the external debt burden, with the ratio of medium
and long term debt to GDP declining from 70.3 percent in 1985 to
a more reasonable 43.0 percent in 1990;

(b) a declining share of commercial debt in total debt outstanding
from 57.8 percent in 1985 to 32.4 percent in 1990;
(c) a declining debt service ratio from 36.9 percent estimated for
1986 to a more creditworthy 27.3 percent in 1990; and
(d)  a moderate growth scenario of approximately 3.0 percent per annui
in real terms over the 1986-1990 period in conjunction with the
Government's rigorous program of structural adjustment.
102.      Given the prospects for a substantial improvement in the key
creditworthiness indicators over the medium term, and the coordinated
efforts of the Government, the Bank and the Fund, a degressive multi-year
rescheduling (MYRA) by the London Club covering principal payments due over
the period 1986-89 (excluding already rescheduled debt and involuntary
lending in the context of the last rescheduling) seems assured. The London
Club has already agreed in principle to a degressive four-year MYRA
covering the 1986-89 period, the modalities of which are currently being
negotiated. At the same time, a MYRA in the context of the Paris Club is
being considered favorably in the light of Bank and Fund efforts to
establish a common view of the medium term with the Ivorian Government.
These reschedulings are expected to bring the debt service ratio to just
below 30 percent over the critical 1986-89 period, and to less than
20 percent by 1995. This combination of MYRAs would set the stage for a
resolution of Cote d'Ivoire's debt overhang. The willingness of lenders to
come forward with additional financial support will depend critically on
the Government's ability to pursue the structural adjustment process.
Given the Government's record since 1981, it is reasonable to assume that
such support will be forthcoming.
103.      Role of the Bank.  The policy dialogue between the Government and
the Bank has helped ensure that the attention of the economic decision
makers remains focussed on the fundamental structural problems facing the
economy. Moreover, the pattern of a series of loans has allowed for an
orderly and evolutionary development of policy with the opportunity of
periodically taking stock of the progress achieved. The Bank's SALs, by
providing the basis for a systematic and coordinated approach to the
resolution of the principal macroeconomic and sectoral problems of the
economy, have complemented the focus of traditional project lending. The
results of the SAL process to date also underlines the potential benefits
of developing further sector policy lending vehicles for continuing the
policy dialogue at the sectoral level.
104.      The successive SALs form only one part, although a crucial one,
of the support that the Bank has provided to the structural adjustment
program. Other components include project and sector/sub-sector loans,
economic and sector work leading to policy recommendations, and technical
assistance. A substantial part of the lending and economic programs is
geared to the realization of the objectives of structural adjustment, most
notably in the fields of industrial policy, energy and agriculture. The
Bank's supporting activities also include special economic studies, staff



- 37 -
advisory assistance (e.g. on the design of the industrial sector reforms
and the use of planning tools), an ongoing Technical Assistance Project and
a number of technical assistance packages built into the design of
individual projects. The Bank will continue with this comprehensive
approach to structural adjustment in the coming years, and will seek to
broaden and deepen the process by concentrating increasingly on sectoral
and sub-sectoral issues.
105.      The Project Completion Report dated July 18, 1984, on SAL I and
the related Program Performance Audit Report (Report No. 5741 of June 28,
1985) supported the Ivorian strategy aimed at restoring the balance in the
major components of the economy while simultaneously reestablishing the
foundations for sustained growth. Both reports highlighted the
achievements of the Government in regaining control over the investment
budget and resource allocation, as well as enhancing the quality of project
planning and execution. The Audit Report noted the importance of the
intensity and openness of the continuing policy dialogue in the success of
the structural adjustment program. Furthermore, the Report drew some
important lessons for the SAL -program, including the necessity of close
coordination with the IMF, the application of second tranche conditions to
the essential thrust of the program and the design of realistic medium-term
scenarios to underpin the program.
106.      During the preparation of SAL III, the policy dialogue between
the Government and the Bank has continued to be close and fruitful.
Furthermore, by emphasizing the development of a medium-term framework, the
dialogue has ensured that a coordinated approach to the resolution of the
principal macroeconomic and sectoral problems of the economy is followed.
More importantly, results of the continuing dialogue on the medium-term
framework and its quantification have formed the basis for the critical
support to be provided by the international financial community, including
members of the London and Paris Clubs.
107.      At the request of the Government, the Bank had assisted the Cote
d'lvoire in its relations with commercial banks and, in particular, had
supported with the IMF its presentation to the London and Paris Clubs in
the context of the 1985 debt reschedulling. Strengthening aid coordination
and addressing the debt problem with commercial banks and other financial
partners in a more systematic way is a vital part of the Government's
current program. The substantial financial assistance to be provided in
1986 through SAL III (and project lending) mandates an increasingly active,
if not lead role in mobilizing commercial banks support in the context of
the upcoming multi-year reschedulings of Cote d'Ivoire external debt. At
the invitation of both Government and the London Club Steering Committee,
the Bank is present at the ongoing MYRA negotiations, assisting both
parties to reach a satisfactory agreement.
108.      Bank-Fund Coordination.  As in the case of the first two SALs,
the Bank has closely coordinated with the IMF in the preparation of the
proposed third SAL. The Fund negotiated a SDR 66.8 million one-year
stand-by arrangement covering the mid-1985 to mid-1986 period. The program



- 38 -
was approved by the IMF's Executive Board in June 1985. This program
includes targets for the fiscal deficit and the external current account
position as well as performance criteria for payment of the public sector
arrears, credit expansion and gross external borrowing. It aims at further
reducing external and internal imbalances over the short and medium term.
The proposed Third SAL and the current IMF program are mutually supportive
and the fiscal implications of the SAL program are consistent with the IMF
performance targets. The proposed SAL is geared to improving the economic
setting and institutional base for long-term growth resumption, in
particular in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. However, certain
areas are of particular importance to both institutions, such as the
limitation of public investments, the restructuring of current
expenditures, the reduction of Government transfers to the parapublic
sector, and the rehabilitation of loss-making public enterprises. The Bank
staff has liaised very closely with the IMF staff on these topics in order
to reinforce the respective actions of both institutions.
109.      During the preparation of the proposed SAL, close cooperation
between the Government, the Fund and the Bank ensured consistency between
stabilization and structural adjustment measures. The Fund mission, which
reviewed the stand-by program, overlapped with the Bank's SAL III
preparation mission which discussed with the Government inter alia the
financial policies contemplated in 1986 in the context of the revised
medium-term projections. These projections covering the period 1986-1990
and outlined in PART III are consistent with the views of both institutions
and the Government as they must be if the coordinated medium-term financial
strategy is to successfully evolve.
Creditworthiness
110.      At the end of 1984, Cote d'Ivoire had $4.8 billion in medium and
long-term debt outstanding. Service payments (excluding INF) amounted to
$0.7 billion of which 80 percent were to the private institutions. 10/ In
December of 1983, CSte d'Ivoire requested the rescheduling of the country's
medium and long term obligations falling due in the 13-month period
beginning December 1, 1983. At the Paris Club meeting in May 1984,
official creditors agreed to refinance Cote d'Ivoire's commercial credits
guaranteed or insured by participanting Governments and loans from these
Governments with an original maturity of more than one year and contracted
before July 1, 1983. 11/ Moreover, in July 1984, an agreement in principle
10/ Including suppliers credits, bonds and commercial banks.
11/ The agreement provided for the consolidation of 100 percent of
principal and 50 percent of interest falling due from December 1, 1983
to December 31, 1984, to be repaid in nine years, including four
years' grace.  The agreement included a good will clause regarding the
rescheduling of debts falling due in 1985.



- 39 -
was reached between the Ivorian authorities and a Steering Committee
representing commercial banks to reschedule the principal component of Cote
d'Ivoire debt falling due in the 25-month period from December 1983.
Tranche A, covering December 1983-December 1984, provided for a
rescheduling of 100 percent of principal payments falling due in this
period. Tranche B, covering January-December 1985, provided for a
rescheduling of 90 percent of principal falling due in calendar year 1985.
and became effective in March 1985. 12/ The disbursement of the "new
money" (US$100 million) agreed upon with the commercial banks in the
context of the 1984-1985 rescheduling--the first such agreement in Sub
Sahara Africa--was completed in April 1985. In June 1985, official
creditor members of the Paris Club agreed to reschedule or refinance 100
percent of principal and 50 percent of interest falling due in 1985 on
insured credits and official loans with original maturities of more than
one year and contracted prior to July 1, 1983. In addition, negotiations
with external creditors not represented by the Paris and London Clubs, who
extended suppliers' credits to Cote d'Ivoire and are represented in the
so-called Abidjan Club, have also been completed. Debt relief in 1984 from
all sources amounted to US$531 million. For 1985, debt relief obtained
from the London, Paris and Abidjan Clubs is estimated at US$452 million.
111.      Debt service obligations are likely to stay high over the coming
years. Based on the growth scenario outlined earlier, the debt outstanding
and disbuw:sed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from about
70 percent in 1985 to about 43 percent in 1990. As discussed earlier
(paras iO1 and 102), the debt service ratio, assuming no new reschedulings
and gross capital inflows of about $770 million per annum, is projected to
remain in the 35 percent range until 1989 before dropping to about
27 percent by 1990.  The debt service ratio would drop to just below
30 percent over the critical 1986-1989 period and to less than 20 percent
by 1995 under a combination of four-year MYRAs with the London and the
Paris Clubs. This achievement will require continuity and rigor in the
pursuit of the structural adjustment process and in external debt
management policy.
Social Costs of Structural Adjustment

freeze on wages, together with the effects of the world recession combined

banks and other financial institutions (excluding international
financial institutions) with an original maturity of more than one
year, contracted before November 30, 1983. These amounts were to be
repaid in 8 years, including a 3-year grace period with an interest
rate averaging LIBOR plus 1 and 7/8 percent. The 10 percent of
principal that was not rescheduled under Tranche B is to be paid
according to the original schedule.

with other adverse factors during 1981-84, led to a sharp decline in per
capita income (Table 9) and to cuts in Government social expenditures. The
drop in per capita income mainly affected the urban population while the
agricultural producer price increases implemented since 1981 helped to
improve real rural incomes relative to real urban incomes. Nevertheless,
both urban and rural per capita GDP declined over the structural adjustment
period 1981-1985, in absolute terms.

113.      In terms of employment, the impact of structural adjustment and
stabilization has been rather severe on the modern sector. Employment in
the primary sector, which grew at 4.1 percent per annum in 1975-1980, did
not grow in 1981-1985. In the modern sector, the respective annual growth
rates were 9.3 percent and -8.9 percent which indicates that this was
indeed the sector bearing the brunt of the Government's austerity measures.
It explains, in fact, why urban incomes dropped faster in absolute terms
than rural incomes. The informal urban sector performed best of all with
respective employment growth rates of 13.4 and 9.5 percent. As a result,
from a close to full employment economy in 1980, the Cote d'Ivoire
registered in 1985 an estimated unemployment rate of about 15 percent.
114.      The structural adjustment strategy pursued by the Government is
expected to lead to a gradual redistribution of income in favor of rural
households over the next decade. Between 1986 and 1995, rural household
incomes are projected to grow by 4.7 percent and 6.9 percent per year in
the North and in the South, respectively, compared to 4.1 percent per year
for urban household income. This evolution reflects the shift in the
internal terms of trade in favor of the rural sector implied by the
producer price policies assumed under the Base Case. As a result, the
share of rural households in total household income is projected to
increase from 34.2 percent in 1986 to 38.3 percent in 1995. Within rural
households, the share of Southern households is projected to increase
gradually from 68.6 percent in 1986 to 72.3 percent in 1995. as a result of
the higher economic opportunities offered by rural activities in the South.



- 41 -
115.      Government strategy would also lead to a continuous increase in
per capita disposable income in the rural sector, with increases in the
North expected to be more rapid (4.6 percent per year) than in the South
(3.5 percent per year) as a result of the virtual stagnation of population
growth in the former region. In the urban sector, per capita disposable
incomes continue to decline at the rate of 2.5 percent per year over the
1M86-1990 period as the rate of economic recovery does not keep pace with
the rate of growth of urban populetion, estimated to reach 6.2 percent per
year over the period. However, between 1990 and 1995, the Government would
succeed in arresting the decline in urban per capita disposable incomes,
both as a result of the acceleration of GDP growth and of the gradual
reduction in the rate of growth of the urban population projected over the
period.
Risks
116.      In 1985, the Cote d'Ivoire finds itself with a successful
stabilization behind and the prospect of sustainable growth ahead. The
Government continues to put in place many of the policies designed to bring
about a fundamental change in the economy. This strategy hinges on
appropriate actions in four main policy areas: trade, investment, resource
mobilization and income distribution. However the actions in these areas
have to be balanced against two other considerations, namely the likelihood
of growing unemployment in the urban areas and the continued decline,
albeit much more slowly, in per capita consumption.
117.      During the next phase, the Government's structural adjustment
program faces the fol hwing risks:
(a)  the volatility of CAISSTAB surpluses may upset the financial
equation;
(b)  Co^te d'Ivoire may not get adequate support from the international
financial community;
(c)  private investment may remain sluggish; and
(d)  the cost of stabilization in the form of increased unemployment
largely in urban areas and slow increasing real incomes may lead
to pressures on the Government to weaken stabilization policies.
118.      CAISSTAB Surpluses.  The medium-term prospects outlined in this
report are derived on the basis of certain assumptions concerning cocoa and
coffee export receipts, which in combination with producer price policies
for these crops determine CAISSTAB surpluses. Factors which threaten the
stability of CAISSTAB revenues include the vagaries of the weather, the
volatility of international prices of cocoa and coffee, exchange rate
fluctuations and general economic conditions in the industrialized
countries. The risks of shortfalls in CAISSTAB revenues, when these
revenues underpin an agreed-upon financial strategy over the medium term,
are not inconsenquential. Failure to take them into account would create



- 42 -
financial disequilibria which could seriously impair creditworthiness. The
medium term must cherefore be analyzed conservatively, as it has been done
by the Bank (paras. 36-42), the Fund and the Government.
119.      Support from the International Financial Community.  Cote
d'Ivoire prospects for future commercial borrowing appear to be improving.
The 1984-1985 reschedulings through the London Club were successful and
added approximately US$100 million in fresh money. More recently, a
successful B-loan operation was mounted in connection with the Second
Higlhway Sector Loan (Loan No. 2581) and with wide geographical
participation in the syndication. The fresh money in this operation
amounted to US$32 million and signalled an improved perception of
creditworthiness on the part of commercial banks.  The Government's overall
good record of macroeconomic management, its recent efforts to mobilize
external support through a concerted approach, the favorable response to
date of the international financial community as evidenced by the imminent
conclusion of MYRAs in the context of the Paris and London Clubs, augur
well for a resumption of voluntary lending over the medium term.
120.      Recovery of Private Investment.  Another major risk concerns the
response of private investment to the adjustment process. An inevitable
consequence of stabilization policies is the low level of private
investment in the productive sectors. Depressed domestic demand, the
difficulties of the Cote d'Ivoire banking system, high real interest rates
for non-preferential borrowing, and the lack of equity funds are the major
issues facing the recovery of private investment. The current steps to
restructure the financial sector and to revamp incentives in the industrial
sector assume great importance in this process. In addition, the
stabilization and restructuring process should lay the groundwork for a
progressive increase in private investment by decreasing the public
sector's demand for funds and by shifting output incentives in favor of
tradeables and exports. The revival of private investment is, in the final
analysis, dependent on the confidence of entrepreneurs, both local and
foreign, in the Government's resolve to pursue the objectives of the
structural adjustment program.
121.      Trade-off Between Growth and Stabilization.  CSte d'Ivoire
development strategy hinges on export growth and fiscal and monetary
discipline as the basis for sustained growth under realistic conditions for
external debt amortization. Thus, the growth rate is expected to be modest
in the 1986-1990 period with prospects of only marginal improvements in
employment creation and real incomes. A major risk facing the Government
is increasing pressure to resort to a high growth strategy to alleviate
these problems by abandoning stabilization policies earlier than desirable
and without laying a sufficiently solid foundation for sustainable growth.
122.      On balance, while these risks are serious, they do not appear
insurmountable. Although sustained efforts will be necessary to attain the
structural adjustment targets, they are, nevertheless, feasible provided
that the Government continues with its policies. Similarly, while Cote
d'Ivoire's external debt position is likely to remain constraining in the



- 43 -
forseeable future, the external resources to be made available to the
economy should provide sufficient room for Cate d'lvoire to implement its
medium-term adjustment program effectively while reducing at the same time
its debt burden. A moderate revival of private investment in the medium
term is feasible provided public investment does not encroach on private
resources and the financial sector performs its role more efficiently.
While there could be pressures to abandon stabilization policies to promote
growth for the alleviation of social hardship, the Government's resolve
reduces this risk considerably.
PART V - THE PROPOSED LOAN
A. The Loan
123.      The proposed loan is the third in a series of loans supporting
the Government's structural adjustment efforts initiated in 1981. The main
developments of the program have been described in this report. A Letter
of Development Policy (Annex V-A) from the Minister of Economy and Finance,
dated April 30, 1986, sets out the major elements in the program and the
new policy actions envisaged for 1986.
124.      The proposed loan of US$250 million would finance about
11 percent of Cote d'Ivoire's total merchandise imports. The loan is
designed to continue Bank support for the structural adjustment program
through 1986 and 1987 and to trigger a more concerted and forward-looking
support from the international financial community in the context of Cate
d'Ivoire's medium-term financial strategy. The loan amount is appropriate
in the light of the quality of the program and the size of the Bank's
lending program for the CSte d'Ivoire.
125.      The proposed loan would finance all goods to be imported into the
C6te d'Ivoire except for goods financed by other sources and a specific
list of excluded items such as military or para-military items and luxury
goods. Counterpart funds would be deposited in a Project Account opened
with Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement (CAM), which will be in charge of the
disbursement of the local currency counterparts; as under previous SALs,
the Government has agreed to allocate the counterpart funds to finance
expenditures directly related to the SAL III program.
Disbursement, Procurement and Administration
126.      The satisfactory administrative arrangements made for SALs I and
II would be continued, with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the
CAA, bearing the main responsibility for administering the proposed loan.
The loan would be disbursed against only foreign expenditures, with
retroactive financing permitted up to US$25.0 million of expenditures made
up to 90 days before the signing of the Loan Agreement. Bank financing of
foodstuffs and petroleum product would each be limited to an aggregate
amount equivalent to not more than US$75.0 million. The CAA would be



- 44 -
responsible for assembling requested supporting documentation collected
from the commercial banks. This documentation would include copy of the
invoices and evidence of payment and of shipment. In order to facilitate
disbursements, a Special Account would be established at the BCEAO in the
name of CAA into which the Bank would make an initial revolving deposit of
US$25.0 million. The Special Account would be replenished monthly or
whenever the Special Account is reduced by one-third. The minimum
withdrawal Ppplication size will be US$1 million.
127.      Bank financing will be limited to imports procured from Bank
member countries, Switzerland and Taiwan. All purchases, both public and
private, under contracts amounting to US$5 million or more would be
procured through ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. Certain commonly
traded commodities may be purchased through price quotations available from
organized international commodity markets. Imports by the prirate sector
for contracts of less than US$5 million equivalent would be in accordance
with standard commercial practices.  Expenditures for goods procured under
contracts of less than US$25,000 equivalent would not be eligible for Bank
financing.  For small contracts between US$25,000 and US$200,000
equivalent, full documentation including invoices will be retained for
periodic examination by Bank staff and withdrawal applications would be
consolidated and accepted on the basis of written statements from the CAA
which would include the country of origin, a description of goods, date and
currency in which payment was effected, the commercial bank involved and
the final beneficiary. For all contracts above US$200,000, full
documentation would accompany withdrawal applications.
Monitoring
128.      Monitoring of performance under SALs involves essentially  e
complementary and inter-related activites: a more general monitoring of
the progress on implementing the overall program and the tranche release
conditions. The conditions for release of the second tranche of US$150
million include:
(a) completion of the preparation of a Plan compatible with the
objectives of the structural adjustment program, in terms of both
its strategy and its targets (September 1986) (para. 45);
(b) satisfactory preparation of the 1987-89 Schema-Directeur and
Loi-Programme, the 1987 BSIE and BGF (September 1986) (para. 45);
(c) satisfactory progress in reducing Government transfers to the
parapublic sector (December 1986) (para 57);
(d)  satisfactory progress towards reduction (a minimum of
5 percentage points) in the level of TPS (June 1986) (para. 65);
(e) satisfactory progress in the implementation of the program of
agricultural reforms and supporting actions, which would include
specifically (para. 80):



- 45 -
(i) a real increase in cocoa-coffee prices (August/September
1986);
(ii) a tariff and export compensatory' payment scheme for
diversification crops (cotton, oil palm, pineapple, rubber
and copra) (December 1986);
(iii) tne elimination of export taxes on diversification crops
(June 1986);
(iv) a plan of action to arrest the projected decline in coffee
output (December 1986);
(f)  satisfactory progress in generalizing the reform of the system of
incentives in the industrial sector (September 1986) (para. 85);
(g)  satisfactory progress in the implementation of the program of
energy sector reforms, which would include in particular
(para. 96):
i)  a long-term investment program (September 1986);
(ii) rehabilitation programs for EECI and SIR (September 1986);
and
(iII) appropriate pricing policies for energy based products
(December 1986).
PART VI - BAK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE COTE D' IVOIRE
129.      Since 1968, when Bank Group operations in the Cote d'Ivoire
started, lending has expanded rapidly and now includes fifty-three
operations totalling US$1,503.0 million, including US$14 million from the
Third Window, and an IDA credit of US$7.5 million. Of these, nineteen have
been for agriculture, supporting cotton, cocoa, rubber, forestry, oil palm
and coconut development, and rural development in the North-East Savannah
and Center-West regions. There were six road projects and two highway
sector projects. The remaining twenty-six loans were for education,
telecommunications, the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system, water supply,
urban development, petroleum exploration and development, power
distribution, tourism development, small- and medium-scale enterprises, a
regional cement project, a regional railway project, structural adjustment
and related technical assistance and most recently, for an Industrial
Finance and Development and a Health and Demographic project. IFC has
supported textile, fertilizers, flour milling, development banking, and
agricultural plantation operations in the country. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank Group operations. In general, implementation of
Bank projects has been satisfactory and has improved substantially over the
past five years. The disbursement ratio has risen from 15.2 percent in



- 46 -
1977 to 37.2 percent in 1982. The 1983 Cote d'Ivoire disbursement ratio of
33.1 percent compares very favorably with the Bank-wide average of
23.4 percent and with ratios for comparable countries such as Tunisia
(15.5 percent), Cameroon (24.9 percent) or Kenya (16.2 percent) for the
same year.
130.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Cote d'Ivoire's medium-term
objectives of restructuring the Ivorian economy by placing more reliance on
market forces and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. These
objectives also include increasing domestic savings and reorienting a
financially restrained public investment program to support and sustain the
supply response to policy reforms. The main vehicle for the Bank's policy
dialogue with the Government has been the structural adjustment lending
(SAL) program. Two SALs have so far been approved, and the proposed loan
would be the third. The success of the SAL program has highlighted the
need to develop sector policy lending vehicles to complement, at the
sectoral level, the policy dialogue.
131.      Agriculture, infrastructure and industry are the key sectors for
Bank project lending with the accent being placed on improving the
management of projects. In agriculture, the emphasis will be on
diversification crops, promotion of exports, reform of the extension and
research services and credit directly oriented toward the producers
themselves. In industry (including financial intermediation), it will be
on enhancing the private sector's responsiveness to the new policy
environment. Infrastructure projects under preparation will focus on
rehabilitation of ailing public enterprises and on maintaining existing
capital assets. Projects for education, urban development and energy may
supplement these efforts.
132.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and
sector work undertaken recently includes studies of the agricultural,
energy and industrial and financial sectors. Topics likely to be covered
in the future include a review of the public investment program.
133.      This is the fifth loan to Cote d'Ivoire to be presented to the
Executive Directors this fiscal year. The Bank Group's share of the
estimated total external debt is expected to rise from the present
18.9 percent to about 35 percent by the late nineteen eighties. Its share
of total debt service payments is projected to increase from about 13.5
percent at present to about 20 percent by 1990.



- 47 -
PART VII - RECOMMENDATION
134.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

INTRODUCTION
1.        Since 1980 the economy of the Ivory Coast has experienced the
combined effects of a series of unfavorable circumstances.
Externally, the world economic crisis led to a general fall in
the import demand of many countries and to a decline in raw material and
basic commodity prices. Combined with the rise in the U.S. dollar and in
real international interest rates, this generated large deficits both in
the Ivory Coast's balance of payments and in its public finances. At the
same time, limitations have appeared on the country's capacity to borrow
from international commercial banks.
Internally, the severe drought of 1983 sharply cut agricultural
production and the potential for hydroelectric generation. Moreover, oil
production fell short of expectations. This forced the Government to
reduce public investment and this in turn helped to bring down GDP and slow
the grovth of real per capita income. The net impact of these negative
internal and external economic circumstances reduced the resources
available to service the external debt.
2.        In this difficult context the Ivorian Government in 1980 launched
a financial rehabilitation and economic restructuring program with the
following goals:
(a) Short-term:
to improve the public finances and external payments
situations.
(b) Medium- and long-term:
-    to restore public savings;
-    to achieve sustained growth as the basis for durable
external and internal financial equilibria and for income
growth.
Short-term actions. Budgetary and monetary measures were taken to:
-    control the expansion of credit;
-    increase Government revenues;
-    control the growth of public expenditures;
-    improve the structure of external debt.
Long-term actions. The principal long-term measures taken were the
following:



- 62 -                      Annex V-A
Page 3 of 26
(a) In macroeconomic management:
-    improvement of the macroeconomic forecasting and management
instruments in order to introduce greater coherence into the
implementation of government actions;
-    improvement in the management tools available to Government
for the public and parapublic sectors so as to reduce the
overall cost of their activities, enhance their efficiency
and maximize returns on their investments;
-    a variety of measures designed to reduce and gain better
control over operating expenditures while bringing them more
into line with needs;
-    measures to correct the cost, price and incentive
distortions in the economy with the objective of reorienting
productive activities;
-    redressing the real income balance between the rural and
urban areas.
(b) In agriculture:
-    raising producer prices;
-    reduction of fertilizer subsidies;
-    measures to redress and rehabilitate certain large
parapublic enterprises in order to improve their efficiency;
-    creation of organizational structures geared specifically to
rural development;
-    implementation of measures, particularly the creation of
structures and the launching of programs, designed to
improve conditions for the marketing of agricultural
preducts.
(c) In industry:
A comprehensive reform of the industrial incentives system so as
to encourage equally production for export and for the domestic market, to
foster sectoral integration, and to enhance the efficient growth of output.
This reform comprised:
-    institution of a system of import tariffs and export
subsidies designed to harmonize the rates of effective
protection of the various branches of industry around an
average rate of about 40%;



- 63 -                      An,uex V-A
Page 4 of 26
-    abolition of the quantitative restrictions on imports and
their eventual replacement by surtaxes declining over 5
years;
-    implementation of a revised Investment Code, which abolishes
the exemption from import duties on intermediate inputs,
goods, introduces a subsidy on Ivorian value added, and
encourages small and medium-sized enterprises and investment
outside Abidjan;
-    amendments to the Tax Code to improve the economic
environment.
Since 1981 the Government has been supported in this
stabilization and restructuring effort by the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank:
-    with respect to the short-term, through an EFF and two
Stand-By Arrangements concluded with the IMF in 1981, 1983
and 1985;
-    with respect to the longer-term, through two Structural
Adjustment Loans, concluded with the World Bank in November
1981 and July 1983.
3.        In the financial area these Government measures have yielded
satisfactory results, thus:
-    the consolidated public-sector deficit before debt
amortization has been reduced by 8.4 points, from 12.2% of
GDP in 1980 to 3.8% in 1984;
-    the deficit of the parapublic sector has been reduced from
6.1% of GDP in, 1982 to 4.5% in 1984 (although the share
covered by public transfers increased over the same period
from 5.3% to 6.4% of GDP);
-    during the same period, the current account deficit in the
balance of payments was reduced by 13.3 points, from 16.1Z
to 2.8% of GDP, thanks to a substantial increase in the
trade balance surplus;
-    external debt rescheduling agreements for 1984 and 1985 have
been concluded with public and private creditors in the
context of the Paris and London Clubs;
-    domestic credit has been limited in accordance with
agreed-upon targets;
-    in the framework of the West African Monetary Union (UMOA),
foreign currency commitments have been reduced.

Page 5 of 26
4.        Progress in the area of structural adjustment, however, can only
be ful'y assessed over the medium and long term. Nevertheless, certain
tangible results have already been achieved.
In the area of macroeconomic management, the Inter-Ministerial
Committee for Economic and Financial Coordination has acted to improve the
control of economic management. This has been reflected in the
restructuring of the investment program towards the priority sectors and in
quality improvements to the project portfolio, a substantial effort in the
restructuring of current expenditures, and tighter control of debt
management.
The Government has substantially strengthened financial control
of the parapublic sector and has initiated rehabilitation programs for the
major parapublic enterprises, including fulJ restructuring in some cases.
In agriculture, the Government has taken a number of measures
designed to strengthen the bases for the sector's growth. These measures
have begun to bear fruit in the following areas:
-    food production;
-    rehabilitation of the palm oil sector;
-    continued expansion of cotton cultivation.
The Government is continuing to examine appropriate medium-term
strategies for coffee, cocoa and diversification crops.
In industry. the Government has implemented the first phase of
its reform of the incentives system, based on a progressive reduction of
the protection accorded to the sector and the abolition of incentives that
constrain exports.
5.        The combination of financial stabilization and structural
adjustment measures, in conjunction with the favorable results of the
1984/85 crop year, helped to improve the 1985 financial situation and to
stimulate economic activity. Nevertheless, conscious of the continuing
fragility of internal and external economic equilibria over the medium
term, the Government has decided to pursue, in conjunction with a
continuation of the stabilization program designed to alleviate the
external dabt overhang, a policy of strengthening the structural adjustment
process with a view to restoring self-sustained growth.
To that end, the Government has decided to draw up a Development
Plan defining the goals to be achieved and the measures to be applied, so
as to ensure coher2nce of sectoral strategies and macroeconomic equilibria.



- 65 -                      Annex V-A
Page 6 of 26
The following are the main goals currently being pursued:
(a) Short-term:
-    continued action to reduce the public-sector deficit;
-    limitation of the current account deficit to the level
achieved at the end of 1984;
-    resorption of an appreciable portion of the public-sector
arrears;
-    application of the surpluses achieved in 1985 to meet the
needs of the medium-term financial strateby.
(b) Medium- and long-term
General goals:
-    restoration of the conditions for sustained growth at a
moderate annual rate of 4X over the coming years;
-    real growth of per capita income over the next decade.
Tnese general goals will be achieved through:
-    export-oriented growth, on the principle of long-term
comparative advantage, as the basis for restoring external
equilibria, particularly that of the balance of payments;
-    retrenchment of the public sector to facilitate the
restoration of domestic equilibria. This will include, in
particular:
balancing of the public-sector accouults;
control of the growth in public investment;
acceleration in the rate of private investment in
productive activities;
-    reduction of the debt overhang in the medium term so as to
free the necessary resources for the sustained growth of
agricultural and industrial activities.
6.        For its structural adjustment program to succeed, the Government
needs to develop a medium-term financial strategy that will enable it to
mobilize support from the international financial community, both private
and public. In this connection, the Government sees the need for
coordinating the financial support from the various external sources.



- 66 -                      Annex V-A
Page 7 of 26
To that end, the Government intends:
(a) to organize a consultation with the Ivory Coast's major financial
partners, during which it will report to the donors on the
progress of its structural adjustment program and on the projects
it proposes to implement in ordtz to achieve self-sustained
growth in the Ivorian economy;
(b) to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank on the main elements of its medium-term strategy,
the economic and financial projections associated with this
strategy and the resulting financing needs over the coming years;
(c) to estimate its financing needs for the next few years in order
to reduce the debt service burden to an acceptable level and to
release the necessary funds required to finance essential
investments for modernization particularly in tLe agricultural
sector; and
(d) to invite those donors that wish to participate in the Ivory
Coast's economic expansion to determine the scope of their
commitments for financing investments that meet their eligibility
criteria.
7.        In order to achieve its long-term goals, the Government has
decided to intervene primarily in the following areas:
(i) Macroeconomic Management
Cii) Agriculture
(iii) Industry
(iv) Energy
I.   MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
8.        The Government has decided to continue its efforts to improve
macroeconomic management, through specific measures in the areas of:
(a) macroeconomic and financial coordination;
(b) public investment;
(c) current expenditures;
(d) public enterprises;
(e) financial sector.
A.  MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL COORDINATION
9.        The Government intends to strengthen macroeconomic and financial
coordination as well as its medium- and long-term forecasting tools. These
actions are vital to the formulation of a coherent development strategy and
more particularly for the programming of public investments, the



- 67 -                      Annex V-A
Page 8 of 26
determining of overall current expenditures and the defining of the
external debt constraints. Measures will be taken to:
(a) improve the meuhods used to prepare current-year accounts and
annual economic forecasts, through:
-    the identification of significant economic data;
-    the processing of these data, by improving the methods
currently used to prepare short- and medium-term
projections;
(b) develop medium- anid long-term forecasts;
(c) make available the means for analyzing financial flows;
(d) strengthen the capacity for institutional coordination.
B.  PUBLIC INVESTMENT
10.       The Government will continue to improve public investment
programming and project selection, by:
(a) retaining the key role of the Schema-Directeur in determining the
overall amount of public investment in light of medium-term
trends in the macroeconomic variables;
(b) strengthening the role of the Loi-Programme in determining the
distribution of that overall investment figure among the various
sectors of economic activity;
(c) establishing project appraisal methods and procedures and
disseminating these throughout the public sector;
(d) improving the programming and monitoring of investment projects,
by:
-    strengthening project identification capacity;
-    setting up a unit responsible for monitoring ongoing
projects and ensuring their efficient implementation.
C.   CURRENT EXPENDITURES
11.       The Government has decided to tighten its control over the level
and trends of current expenditures and to further restructure these
expenditures.



- 68 -                      Annex V-A
Page 9 of 26
(a) Monitoring of current expenditures
The Government will tighten its control over current expenditures
by setting effective budgetary priorities between and within the
various sectors of the administration; these priorities will be
set during the formulation of the Finance Laws. The Government
intends to give priority to:
-    necessary expenditures for government units in charge of
macroeconomic management;
-    expenditure items supporting its structural adjustment
program.
(b) Review of current expenditures
The Government will implement a program of prioritizing current
expenditures, particularly in the area of personnel expenditures,
as part of the Civil Service reform. It will also tighten
personnel management controls in the national public
establishments.
D.  PUBLIC ENTERPRISES
12.       The Government intends to continue and to intensify the
reorganization of the parapublic sector in order to enhance its ef'iciency.
In particular, it proposes to implement the following measures:
(a) gradual reduction in Government transfers to the parapublic
sector as a whole and to the major deficit-running enterprises in
particular;
(b) tightening of financial control of the sector, through:
-    the implementation of a program to review accounting
procedures and to provide accounting assistance to
enterprises whose situation with respect to the preparation
of financial statements and whose accounting organization so
require;.
-    the development of the system of financial synoptic tables
(tableaux de bord financiers);
(c) continuation of management audits and implementation of their
recommendations;
(d) conclusion of 3-5 year Contrat-Plans with certain public
enterprises;
(e) improvement of public contracting procedures, particularly
through:



- 69 -                      Annex V-A
Page 10 of 26
-    the delegation of appropriate powers for public contracts
awarded by certain public enterprises;
-    the standardization and relocation of controls upstream of
the contract award process;
(f) improvement of budget appropriation and budget execution
procedures, through:
-    the periodic monitoring of budget execution on the part of
enterprises receiving Government transfers;
-    the conclusion of special agreements with enterprises whose
fiscal year differs from that of the Government in order to
allow them to make regular budget entries for new
allocations and to proceed to a phased disbursement of such
allocations in keeping with their cash-flow requirements.
E.   FINANCIAL SECTOR
13.       The Government intends to stimulate savings formation and improve
financial intermediation in general in order to mobilize domestic savings
and to revitalize private investment. The Government intends to achieve
these objectives through the following actions:
(a) Development of financial markets
In order to gradually lay the bases for the development of
financial markets, the Government intends to introduce the
following financial instruments:
-    Treasury notes with varying maturities (6 months to 3
years), for sale to banks and financial institutions and to
the public through banks;
-    long-term bonds to be issued by banks and major enterprises;
-    shares in public enterprises lor sale to the general public,
as part of the privatization policy;
-    new investment funds consisting of investment securities
portfolios, to be managed by banks.
(b) Fiscal measures
The Government will take measures to effectively speed up
reimbursement of Value Added Tax to exporters. In view of the
high real rates of interest faced by private investors, the
Government intends to reduce and gradually eliminate the services
tax (TPS) on bank interest.



- 70 -                     Annex V-A
Page 11 of 26
(c) Establishment of a housing credit system
The Government is considering the establishment of a fund to help
finance low-cost housing.
(d) Establishment of an export credit insurance system
Studies of the export credit insurance and financing needs of
industrial enterprises were started in 1980 and followed by
studies of the organization, financing and operation of a credit
insurance agency in the Ivory Coast. These studies will enable
the Government to set up a system of export credit insurance.
(e) Other financial mechanisms
In order to enhance the competitiveness of Ivorian industrial
enterprises vis-a-vis their foreign counterparts, the Government
proposes to study other financial mechanisms, such as:
-    export pre-financing;
-    rediscountable supplier's credits (export and local);
-    marketing prospection insurance.
II. AGRICULTURE
14.       The Government will continue to give topmost priority to the
development of the agricultural sector, which has in the past provided the
main engine of growth in the economy, in particular through the expansion
of coffee, cocoa, and timber exports.
However, given the constraints bearing on the future growth
prospects for these traditional products, the Government considers that a
lasting recovery of agricultural growth calls for a medium-term strategy
based on greater diversification of agricultural activities as well as the
optimal use of traditional sources of growth. Diversification of exports
will be based on more intensive exploitation of the Ivory Coast's natural
comparative advantages. Special emphasis will be placed on expanding
diversification crops, restoring cocoa productivity, rehabilitating coffee
production potential and pursuing food self-sufficiency.
The Government plans to continue its efforts to redress the
internal terms of trade in favor of the rural sector and increase real
incomes in the countryside by raising incentives, increasing public and
private investment in agriculture, and improving the efficiency of the
sector's institutions. Through these measures, the Government intends to
modernize the means of production, boost productivity, promote the
development of a young and dynamic farmer class, and achieve better
distribution of population throughout the national territory.



- 71 -                      Annex V-A
Page 12 of 26
15.       The Government has decided to apply the following measures with
respect to both cash crops and food crops:
(a)  Incentives policy:
-    progressive increase in real terms of coffee and cocoa
producer prices.
-    for products other than coffee and cocoa, international
prices will serve as a yardstick, adjusted where necessary
to take account of the impact of the industrial tariff
reform on agricultural production costs, and with a view to
achieving a minimum effective protection level of 20
percent. This will imply the liberalization of imports for
the products in question and the introduction of a system of
tariffs and appropriate export compensatory payments.
Import tariff levels may be adjusted over time in order to
maintain minimum producer prices in certain cases and to
avoid undesirable fluctuations in consumer prices for the
most sensitive products.
-    continuation of the program to phase out input subsidies, on
a selective basis, in order not to discourage the adoption
of new technologies.
(b) Investment policy and strengthening of support structures for
agriculture:
-    significant and regular increases in public and private
investment in agriculture, both in absolute terms and in
relation to other sectors. The Government will encourage
the establishment and modernization of small and medium
agricultural enterprises and the direct participation of
young farmers, particularly as regards food and perennial
crop production;
-    rehabilitation and improvement of the efficiency of the
agricultural public enterprises and support institutions;
-    adequate financing of agricultural development support
services. Priority will be given to support services that
have the greatest impact on production, whether because of
the number of farmers affected or because of the nature of
the activities involved, specifically extension and
supervision agencies (including, where appropriate,
subsidized agricultural inputs), research institutes and the
seed propagation and distribution program;
-    the preparation of longer-term investment and rehabilitation
programs in the areas of agricultural extension, agronomic



- 72 -                     Annex V-A
Page 13 of 26
research, seed production, input supply and sales, and
marketing of food crops.
A.   COFFEE AND COCOA
16.       Coffee and cocoa are currently the Ivory Coast's major
agricultural export crops. Their growth must therefore be maximized in
order to achieve the objectives of accelerating economic growth and of
raising farm incomes, subject to the constraints imposed by the evolution
of world demand.
(a) The price policy to be pursued by the Government will lead to a
gradual increase in producer prices in real terms for these two
crops.
(b) The restoration of the profitability of coffee relative to cocoa
by offering appropriate incentives is considered vital to the
recovery of coffee production.
(c) The investment program adopted by the Government will result in:
-    intensification of the coffee planting and rehabilitation
program;
-    continued increases in the production and productivity of
cocoa plantations;
-    improvement in the quality of these two products (in the
specific case of cocoa, through implementation of the
findings of the recent pilot operation).
B.   OTHER CASH CROPS
17.       Other cash crops will be developed and diversified.  Priority
will be given to the development of oil palm, coconut, cotton, rubber and
pineapples with the objective of reducing the excessive dependence of
export agriculture on coffee and cocoa. The Government intends to achieve
this objective through a policy of price incentives and rational
investments.
(a) Incentives policy:
-    As a general rule, for products purchased direct from
farmers, such as palm fruit bunches, latex, coconuts and
their derivatives, seed cotton and pineapples, and for
processed products, such as palm oil and its derivatives,
natural rubber, copra oil and cotton fiber and cotton seed,
prices at the various levels for each product category will
be determined with reference to international prices
adjusted to take account of the impact of the industrial
tariff reform on agricultural production costs, and with a



- 73 -                     Annex V-A
Page 14 of 26
view to achieving a minimum effective protection level of 20
percent. This will imply the liberalization of imports for
the products in question and the introduction of a system of
tariffs and appropriate export compensatory payments.
Import tariff levels may be adjusted over time in order to
maintain minimum producer prices in certain cases and to
avoid undesirable fluctuations in consumer prices for the
most sensitive items.
As regards raw palm oil, the selling price to local industry
will be freely negotiated between trading partners under the
free trade regime.
In the case of sugar, the objective will be the
implementation of a rehabilitation program of the sugar
industry aimed at ensuring the financial equilibrium of
SODESUCRE while inputing to SODESUCRE all of the costs borne
by the sector.
(b) Investment policy:
-    preparation and execution of a rubber program, similar to
the second oil-palm plan;
-    further studies on the coconut program;
-    expansion of cotton-growing in the savanna region, through
plantings in new regions, particularly the northeast, and
increased productivity in areas already cultivated;
-    preparation of expansion programs for other diversification
crops, such as fruits and vegetables.
C.   FOOD CROPS
18.      The Government will give special priority to raising food-crop
production and improving marketing arrangements. The object will be not
only to achieve national food self-sufficiency (in conjunction with the
efforts being undertaken with respect to stockraising, fishing and fish
farming), but also to obtain yields high enough to allow processing and
export. Through this policy, the Government intends to keep a generation
of young and trained farmers on the land, using modern production methods
that should bring in incomes equal to, if not greater than, those earned in
the urban sector. To that end, the Government has decided to improve the
conditions of production, marketing and processing of food crops.
(a) Under the price policy applicable to the food-crop sector,
international prices will increasingly be taken into account in
setting prices for rice, wheat flour and other products traded
abroad, while ensuring that any resulting price increases do not
have excessive repercussions on the purchasing power of Ivorian



- 74 -                      Annex V-A
Page 15 of 26
consumers. In the case of rice, an additional objective of the
policy governing prices at the marketing and processing stages
will be to decrease the unit subsidies for the purchase and
processing of rice through official channels.
(b) Substantial investments will be made to reinforce support
programs for food-crop development. This investment policy will
be implemented through the following specific actions:
For rice:
-    continuation of the rice production effort;
-    implementation of a rice production, processing and
marketing action program;
-    definition of the roles of the official and traditional
sectors, taking into account their respective costs and
benefits, and implementation of an appropriate action
program.
For other food crops, such as yams, plantains, cassava, maize and
sorghum:
-    introduction of improved varieties;
-    improved supply of inputs, in particular fertilizer,
pesticides and herbicides;
-    intensification of agricultural extension activities;
-    modernization of the Ivory Coast's food-crop agriculture
through the construction of small dams and the supply of
farm machinery;
-    improvement of food-crop processing and marketing operations
through more efficient distribution channels and new
marketing outlets.
D.  FORESTRY RESOURCES
19.       As part of the next Five-Year Plan, the Government has decided to
formulate a long-term development strategy for the savanna and forest
regions. As regards the management of the country's forestry resources,
the Government, following a diagnostic study, will provide guidelines under
a National Forest Plan which is now being prepared.
These guidelines will relate particularly to the conservation of
existing resources (reserved forests), incentives for replanting, regional

sector, soil conservation, and land tenure problems. The Government will
draft legislation aimed at resolving the land tenure problems specific to
this sector.
III. INDUSTRY
20.       The Government has decided to pursue the industrial reform
undertaken as part of its structural adjustment program and to generalize
it progressively in order to achieve an effective protection of 40 percent
across-the-board for the entire manufacturing sector.
The following measures will be implemented:
(a) The customs tariff put into effect on March 12, 1985 will be
applied to all manufacturing activities not yet covered by the
reform. Degressive surcharges will be introduced wherever
necessary to help enterprises affected by the reform to adjust to
reduced levels of tariff protection. In the case of fertilizers,
insecticides and pesticides, the application of this new tariff
will be accompanied by measures designed to offset its impact on
agricultural products;
(b) Remaining quantitative restrictions will be replaced by
degressive import surtaxes;
-c) Reference import prices, and subsequently minimum levies, will be
abolished except in certain special cases;
(d) The export subsidy system will be extended to the entire
manufacturing sector. It will be kept at the same level as
effective protection on domestic sales.
21.       The Government will take appropriate measures to ensure that the
subsidy syscem instituted is run efficiently, in particular to avoid
bottlenecks and red tape, so that the subsidies due to approved exporters
are paid promptly.
22.       The Government will set up a permanent monitoring system to
measure the impact of this reform on individual enterprises, on the
different manufacturing subsectors and on production as a whole, together
with its tax and budgetary repercussions.
23.       The Government will give a new impetus to small and medium-sized
national enterprises with the objective of satisfying the domestic market,
generating employment, increasing the density of the country's industrial
network and regionalizing industry.

IV. ENERGY
24.       In recent years the energy sector has been affected by a number
of factors, including:
-    the uncertainty surrounding the future of oil production;
-    the recent discovery of natural gas reserves;
-    the combined effect of the economic recession and successive
years of drought, which has depressed both consumption
growth and the availability of electric energy;
-    the deteriorating financial position of the sector's leading
enterprises. The drought, the resultant return to heavy
dependence on imported fuel oil for electric power
generation, and unscheduled invLstments, such as the
installation of four gas turbines, have resulted in
financial disequilibria for EECI (Energie Electrique de la
Cote d'Ivoire). At the same time the losses experienced by
SIR (Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage) for several years-and
which have recently worsened because of the increase in the
dollar-have been a drain on the Government budget.
The combined effect of these factors has highlighted the
fragility of the sector's institutional infrastructure and has demonstrated
the need for comprehensive strategies, particularly in the area of
investment.
In this context, the Government has decided to reorient its
energy policy t-urough the following actions:
(a) Definition of an investment program
The program will take into account:
-    demand trends;
-    the optimal energy choices;
-    the financial constraints facing the country;
-    the limits imposed by the self-financing capacity of
sector enterprises.
In particular, this program should enable the Government to take
the necessary steps to ensure that EECI's generating capacity is adequate.
Also, given the high exploration and development costs in the hydrocarbon
sector, the Government intends to strengthen incentives for private-sector
investment.



- 77 -                      Annex V-A
Page 18 of 26
(a) Improvement of the efficiency of sector enterprises
The Government plans to:
-    prepare a financial rehabilitation program for EECI,
that will enable this entity to achieve financial
equilibrium vithout detriment to its efficiency and
autonomy;
-    correct SIR's situation, through:
short-term measures, such as Improving management
(particularly financial management), revising the
offtake price policy in order to bring these prices
into line with import parity, and transferring
responsibility for supplying crude and for marketing
refined products to SIR;
preparation of a longer-term financial rehabilitation
program based on the results of the audit that has just
been conducted;
-    re-examine the role of PETROCI and the scope of its
current functions, given the need to make these more
consistent with the latest developments in the
hydrocarbon subsector.
(b) Drafting of a price policy
The Government has decided to gear its price policy strategy to
the following goals:
-    better resource allocation;
-    increased tax revenue;
-    economic cost-effectiveness of the sector's enterprises.
It will take the necessary measures to:
-    update the electric pmwer tariff policy;
-    formulate a gas tariff policy on the assumption that natural
gas will be developed.
(c) Improvement of institutional coordination within the sector
The Goverment will take the necessary institutional measures to
strengthen coordination within the sector in order to ensure
better planning within the framework of a comprehensive energy
policy.
