REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR AN INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1..       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of US$52 million to assist the
financing of an integrated rural development project. The loan would have a
term of 17 years, including a grace period of 3 1/2 years, with interest at
8.7% per annum. A US$26.8 million portion of the loan would be transferred
to the Caja de Credito Agrario, Industrial y Minero (Caja Agraria) for on-
lending to farmers and marketing groups.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Colombia (1190-CO) was distributed to
the Executive Directors in August 1976. It was designed to assess current
developments and provide a medium-term prospective of the Colombian economy.
Country data sheets are provided in Annex 1.
Background
/
3.        During the past two decades substantial structural transformation
has taken place in the Colombian economy and the country is now well advanced
in the transition from a predominantly rural, agricultural, and largely
self-contained economy to an urban industrial economy, more oriented toward
international trade. Broadening of the country's productive base has been
accompanied by rapid growth of nontraditional exports (those other than
coffee) and development of a modern sector which relies to a considerable
extent on imported inputs. From 1967 to 1975 GDP increased by an average 6.0%
per annum in real terms, well above the historical average of less than 5%
(1950-67), and real per capita income increased by an average annual 3.6%.
Two mutually dependent phenomena, increased investment and relaxation of the
foreign exchange constraint, have been major factors in bringing about this
acceleration. Merchandise exports have expanded more than three-fold since
1967 and, most significantly, nontraditional exports have become an increas-
ingly important source of foreign exchange earnings, growing from 27% of
merchandise exports to about 50% at present. Much of this increase was the
result of both product and market diversification, especially of manufactured
exports, as the share of total exports shipped to Latin American countries
more than doubled. Despite the rapid development which has taken place in
recent years, however, Colombia remains essentially an underdeveloped country
with a still limited modern sector superimposed on a large, traditional, and
poor base.
4.        When the present Government took office in August 1974, the country
was faced with several adverse developments -- weakening balance of payments

situation, impending loss of self-sufficiency in petroleum production, infla-
tion, deterioration of public finances, and reduction in public investment --
which threatened to interrupt the high growth rate achieved by Colombia in
recent years. The new administration embarked upon an economic stabilization
program with the aim of restoring the basis for sustained economic growth.
In line with this, it implemented basic reforms of the fiscal, monetary
and price systems.
5.        To help strengthen public finances, the new Government implemented
a tax reform which covered almost every important component of the tax system
and represented a significant improvement in terms of the progressivity and
elasticity. The Government also made certain changes in the financial system
with the purpose of stimulating private savings and improving the allocational
efficiency of the financial system. The action included a restructuring of
interest rates, simplication of the complex reserve system, and elimination of
many of the more rigid and cumbersome controls.
6.        The Government also took steps to correct major distortions which
existed in the price system. Price controls on a number of important agricul-
tural products were removed. In mid-May of this year, the Government intro-
duced far-reaching modifications in its petroleum pricing policy which aim
at regaining self-sufficiency in production of crude petroleum by improving
incentives for exploration and exploitation. Under the new policy, foreign
oil companies will be paid the international price of crude CIF Cartagena
for new petroleum produced in association with the government petroleum cor-
poration. (Previously the foreign oil companies received less than US$7 per
barrel for new crude). The Government is also encouraging incremental produc-
tion from existing fields and, in this connection, eliminated the special
petroleum exchange rate, effectively increasing the price of crude oil
by about 20%. Furthermore, retail prices of gasoline have been raised in
successive steps from US$0.11/gallon in August 1975 to US$0.24/gallon in
August 1976, or by 118%. The Government proposes to continue this policy
until the prices of gasoline and other petroleum derivatives approach inter-
national prices.
7.        As expected, economic growth slowed in 1975 (from 6% in 1974 to
about 4%) and unemployment increased, reflecting both the impact of the
stabilization measures adopted at the end of 1974 and the effects of the
world recession. Towards the end of the year the economy began to recover,
stimulated by increased exports, larger agricultural output and heightened
industrial activity. Government revenues rose by an unprecedented 50% com-
pared to 1974; savings deposits and bonds outstanding, reflecting higher
interest rates, increased from 23% of GDP in 1974 to 25% in 1975. Further-
more, inflation was reduced from 27% in 1974 to 18% in 1975, i.e., below
the Government's target of 20%. Moreover, the balance of payments turned
favorable as a result of the sharp increase in world coffee prices, expansion
of non-coffee agricultural exports and reduced imports stemming from the
Government's stabilization effort. By the end of 1975 Colombia's official
foreign exchange reserves had recovered to about US$550 million, sufficient to
cover almost four months' imports. With increased export earnings the public



- 3 -
debt-service ratio declined from 16.7% in 1974 to 12.7% in 1975. Thus
Colombia, through a combination of fiscal, monetary and trade policies and
fortuitous external developments, was able to avoid any severe, prolonged
economic slowdown and to improve its external liquidity position in an envi-
ronment of worldwide recession.
Performance in 1976
8.        The economic forces have continued to be favorable during 1976.
Coffee prices are high and the balance of payments remains strong; foreign
exchange reserves reached nearly US$900 million at the end of the third quarter
of the year, the highest level in Colombia's history. The increased demand
generated by the higher incomes of the coffee producers has been a powerful
stimulus to the economy which is staging a sharp recovery. Real GDP growth
is projected at 6%, a growth rate approaching that achieved during the 1968-74
period (6.7% per annum). As a result, the urban unemployment has declined
to about 10% in mid-1976 compared to 13% a year earlier.
9.        The inflow of foreign exchange from coffee sales has, however, led
to a resurgence of inflation during the first half of 1976 and this has
prompted the Government to continue to give priority to short-term manage-
ment of demand. In this context, it has taken several measures. Legal
reserve requirements have been increased and limitations on private external
borrowing have been established. Import duties have been drastically reduced
to shift part of the inflationary pressures to the external sector. Fiscal
management is quite restrictive as the Treasury accounts have been kept in
balance in the first half of the year even after repayment of the Government's
short-term domestic debt. Almost two-thirds of coffee earnings are being kept
from increasing the monetary base by measures adopted recently. 1/ The Govern-
ment expects that a bumper harvest and the liberalized import policy will
(although with a lag) increase the supply of goods, thus dampening pressure on
domestic prices. Nevertheless, inflationary pressures are likely to persist,
since foreign exchange reserves are projected to continue increasing. This
would, even after the sterilization measures taken, add to the monetary expan-
sion. Furthermore, current price and cost trends (the Government is attempting
to hold wage increases in the public sector to 10%, but private sector wages
will probably increase substantially more) as well as "corrective" adjustments
in public-service prices make deceleration of price increases unlikely during
the remainder of 1976. However, the Government remains strongly committed to
reducing inflation; the tightening of monetary and fiscal policies, accompanied
by the liberalization of imports and the stabilization of world coffee prices,
should enable the Government to control the rate of inflation.
1/   The measures are:   15% of payments to coffee producers to be made in
three-year compulsory savings certificates; an increase in the coffee
retention tax from 23% to 46%, and investment of a substantial portion of
this tax, including the four percentage points received by the Coffee
Federation, in Government bonds.



- 4-
Development Strategy and Prospects
10.       The Government's development strategy is embodied in the 1975-78
development plan. The plan aims at creating the conditions necessary for
substantially reducing unemployment through increased capital accumulation in
the private sector, improvement in the efficiency of the price system in order
to encourage more labor intensive production techniques and expansion of
public investment. The main focus of the public sector investment plan is on
Colombia's poorest regions -- Choco, Narino, Boyaca, and the North Coast --
and the rural and urban poor. Special priority has been assigned to agricul-
ture because it is in the rural areas where the greatest concentration of
poverty exists and in agricultural activities where the highest employment
impact can be achieved. Commercial agriculture is also to receive support due
to its strong contribution to export and employment growth. A substantial
portion of public expenditures is being reoriented toward nutrition and
primary education programs which affect the productivity of the poorest 50% of
the population. Policies for promoting decentralization of industry away
from the largest cities in the country have been adopted to accelerate inte-
gration of more backward areas into the modern sector of the economy.
11.       Colombia's strong balance of payments prospects for the immediate
future should make it possible in 1977 for the country to resume the high rate
of growth of GDP (6-7%) achieved in the early 1970s. Maintenance of 7% growth
in the late 1970s and beyond will require imports to increase at a rapid pace
(about 10% per annum in real terms). Export prospects for the next several
years, however, are excellent, as world coffee prices remain strong and
economic growth is resuming in the industrialized countries. With the contin-
uation of appropriate incentives, minor exports should grow very rapidly
once again. Manufactured exports -- textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
mechanical and electrical equipment, and paper products -- are over the
long-term expected to lead this recuperation, along with non-coffee agricul-
tural exports. Given the improved outlook for coffee, the deficit in the
resource balance is projected to remain low throughout the late 1970s.
Balance of payments prospects beyond 1980 will depend to a significant extent
on the results of petroleum exploration and on progress made in implementation
of several resource-based export projects currently under preparation.
12.       Colombia is expected to require gross capital inflows of US$2.8
billion during the five-year period 1976-80, of which almost US$600 million
will be disbursed from commitments made through the end of 1975. To attain
this level, annual gross capital inflow will have to increase from US$435
million in 1976 to US$760 million in 1980. Direct foreign investment is
expected to provide only a small part (5%) of the required capital inflow,
with approximately 50% being provided by official multilateral and bilateral
sources and the remainder by suppliers', financial and other private credits.
Local-cost financing by the Bank is considered justified by Colombia's pro-
gressive development policies and programs and domestic resource mobilization
efforts, in those cases where such financing is required to give the Bank a
meaningful role in high priority projects.



13.       Colombia's public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$2.9 billion at the end of 1975, or US$2.3 billion excluding
undisbursed commitments. The Bank Group's share of this external debt (dis-
bursed only) as of the end of 1975 was about 28% and is expected to remain at
this level through 1980. Service on this debt was about 12.7% of exports
goods and non-factor services in 1975. Assuming recovery of minor exports
and the favorable outlook for coffee, the debt service ratio is projected
to decline to approximately 12% in 1980. The Bank's share of total debt
service is about 30% at present but is expected to decline to 20% by 1980.
With the maintenance of sound economic and financial policies, Colombia should
have no difficulty securing or servicing the amounts of external capital it
needs.
PART II:   BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
14.       The proposed loan, the 64th to be made to Colombia, would bring the
total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$1,298.2 million (net of cancella-
tions). Of the foregoing amount, US$945.9 million is now held by the Bank.
IDA has made one credit of US$19.5 million for highways in Colombia in 1961.
15.       Disbursements have been completed on 39 loans and the one IDA credit.
IFC has made effective investments and underwriting commitments in 22 enter-
prises in Colombia, totalling about US$36.2 million of which IFC now holds
US$21.2 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, the
IDA credit, and IFC investments as of June 30, 1976. The Annex also contains
notes on the execution of the 24 on-going projects.
16.       Since FY68, Bank lending in Colombia has become more diversified
than in earlier years. All three loans in the education sector have been
made since then, as were six of the ten agricultural loans and six of the
nine loans for industry. This compares with seven loans since FY68 in the
sectors where the Bank has been traditionally active, i.e., power and trans-
port. Bank efforts have been focused on production oriented activities
and activities which carry social as well as economic benefits.
17.       Bank lending to Colombia in FY76 consisted of one loan for develop-
ment finance companies totalling US$80 million. The FY77 program includes
the proposed integrated rural development project and proposed projects for
agricultural credit and road rehabilitation. In addition, work is under way
on nutrition and health, small-scale industry, slum improvement, power,
telecommunications, water supply and sewerage, tourism, mining, and cooper-
ative development and agricultural marketing for possible consideration
by the Executive Directors during the next two years.
1.8.      In lending to Colombia, the Bank tries to assist the Government in
achieving four major objectives. These objectives are interdependent and
complementary. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more widely
than before and, more particularly, to attach directly the problem of rural



- 6 -
poverty. A second objective is to help Colombia expand output, including
exports, by supporting projects that directly or indirectly make large con-
tributions to production and employment. A third objective is to support
programs that will bring about improvements in the management of the economy
and, particularly, that will help to strengthen public institutions and
financial intermediaries. A fourth objective is to transfer sufficient
external resources to complement Colombia's domestic savings and provide the
necessary funds for maintaining an adequate level of economic and social
investments in a framework of sound domestic finances and a viable balance of
payments.
19.       The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in Annex 1.
While IBRD, IDB and AID provided about 75% of total external financing to
Colombia in the 1961-72 period, their share has decreased since then to approxi-
mately 40%. The IDB has assisted projects in low cost housing, university
education, agrarian reform, ports, electric power, water supply, transportation,
and industry. Between 1968 and 1972 AID shifted the emphasis of its lending
from program to sector loans, particularly for education, urban development and
agriculture. More recently, it has moved in the direction of small project
loans aimed chiefly at the improvement of income distribution. It is ex-
pected to phase out its aid program in Colombia over the next year.
PART III: THE RURAL SECTOR AND PROJECT AREAS
A.   The Rural Sector
20.       The agricultural sector accounts for 37% of employment, 27% of
GDP and 59% of the value of all exports. The rural population, defined as
the people living outside centers with more than 2,500 inhabitants, is about
9 million, or 37% of the population of Colombia, which, in 1976, totalled
about 24.5 million. The growth of agricultural output was on average 4.6%
per annum from 1971 to 1975. Colombia is self-sufficient for most of its
food requirements, but continues to require imports of wheat, cocoa, oilseeds,
pulses, corn and barley.
21.       The wide range of climatic conditions and the various forms of
land tenure in Colombia have led to the development of several distinct types
of farming. Cattle ranching predominates in the lowlands along the Caribbean
coast, the lower part of the inter-Andean valleys and, increasingly, in the
Orinoco and Amazon river basins to the East. Fairly intensive, modernized
farms of medium and large size predominate in the upper reaches of the inter-
Andean valleys. On the steep slopes rising from these main valleys, small and
medium-sized farms produce a diversity of crop and livestock, but, with few
exceptions, coffee is of overwhelming importance, and it has provided the
resources which have financed the considerable development of the social ser-
vices and infrastructure in this zone. Above the coffee zone, conditions are
less favorable and these areas have not shared in the generally impressive
development of the agricultural sector.



- 7 -
22.       The unevenness in the distribution of 1and is an important charac-
teristic of the rural sector. However, aggregated national statistics do not
take into account differential land productivity; for example, they do not
distinguish between the economic value of extensive ranch land and intensive
coffee land. In 1973, farmers with less than 20 ha (small farms) accounted
for 83% of the number but only 13% of the area of farmland, while farms of
over 50 ha (large farms) occupied 80% of the area, but represented only 8% of
the number of farm units. Half the rural income is retained by 10% of the
rural population, of which in 1975 63% had annual incomes below the relative
poverty income level, as defined by the Bank (US$148 per capita in 1975).
23.       Some 47% of the children of school age in rural areas do not attend
school. Schools exist throughout most inhabited parts of the country but
there are serious deficiencies in the number and training of teachers, the
number of classrooms and their equipment. Adult literacy is about 65% in
rural areas since there have been some fairly successful out-of-school
literacy programs.
24.       Health services in rural areas are generally very poor and in
towns the local hospitals are often poorly equipped and not fully utilized.
Health statistics are particularly deficient; however, it is clear that in
rural areas infant mortality is generally higher than the urban rate of
9.4 per thousand live births. Water-borne infections lead to a high propor-
tion of illness and death in rural areas.
25.       The country is fairly well served with main roads between Depart-
ment (Provincial) capitals, but only 60% of the rural communities are linked
by all-weather roads. About 35% of the rural population is linked to public
electricity systems. About 4 million of the rural population live in hamlets
or villages of between 50 and 2,500 inhabitants; of this group, 42% is linked
to a potable water supply and 10% to a sewerage system.
26.       Caja Agraria is the principal agricultural credit bank in Colombia
and would have responsibility for administration of the project. It was
initiated in 1931 as a part of a state-owned bank. In 1971, it was trans-
formed into a mixed enterprise although the Government still retains an 89%
shareholding. Caja Agraria has had considerable experience with lending to
small-scale farmers and has participated successfully in two previous projects
partially financed by the Bank. It has 25 regional and 805 branch offices,
many of which also have outlets for seeds, fertilizers, and other farm require-
ments. Sales of farm inputs by Caja Agraria currently account for about half
of all national sales of these products. At the end of 1974, loans to small-
scale farmers accounted for about 60% of its loan portfolio or the equivalent
of US$318 million.
B.   The Project Areas
27.       The Bank project would cover three out of five geographic areas
which have been identified for the initial phase of a national rural develop-
ment program (Map IBRD 12202). The Canadian International Development Agency



- 8 -
(CIDA) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have already approved
loans to assist in the financing of the program in Areas 4 and 5, respectively.
28.       The project areas (Areas 1, 2 and 3) include districts in which
there is a high proportion of small-scale (under 20 ha) farmers and poverty.
In the areas selected, the current level of farm productivity is low, but
there are good potentialities for major increases using existing technology
which is being adapted to local conditions by the Colombian Agricultural
Institute and incorporating improved varieties developed in collaboration with
the International Center of Tropical Agriculture. In none of the Bank project
areas is the redistribution of land a prerequisite for project execution (see
para. 29), although it would be necessary in time to attempt to achieve a more
equitable distribution.
29.       All three project areas are located in the Andean highlands.    Area I
covers part of the Departments of Narino and Cauca adjoining the frontier with
Ecuador; Area 2 includes much of the Department of Cundinamarca and a small
part of Tolima in the center of the country close to Bogota; and Area 3 is
part of the Department of Antioquia, north and east of Medellin.     In 1973,
the total population of these three areas was 2.6 million, of whom 1.8
million (69%) lived in rural areas on 204,000 farms covering 2.3 million ha
of agricultural land. The project would be focused on the requirements of
farmers with less than 20 ha, who number some 175,000 -- 86% of the total
number -- and occupy 0.7 million ha of agricultural land -- 31% of all agri-
cultural land. These farmers produce primarily cereals, pulses, potatoes and
other starch crops and also maintain small numbers of livestock of various
species. The target population would include about 1.1 million on farms
and also poor, landless residents, giving a total of some 1.5 million persons
with an average annual per capita income equivalent to about US$100.
30.       A large number of official agencies is active in the rural areas.
Generally, they are technically competent and well staffed. Nevertheless,
the development of the rural areas of greatest poverty has been very slow.
Contributory factors have been the attention previously devoted to assisting
medium- and large-scale farmers, or producers of export crops; the strong
vertical structure of each official entity with little authority delegated
to the regions; budgetary uncertainties; and a lack of coordination between
entities and between the national and local government authorities. In
the past there has been little attempt by official agencies to discover the
priorities perceived by the local communities, who therefore have not become
involved in the process of development. However, there has been a growing
official awareness of the needs of the poor in rural areas and a realization
that their conditions of life could be improved.
31.       In the project area, the average adult literacy rate is quite high
(76%), although only 40% of children aged 7 to 14 years attend school. The
number of schools in relation to the population is close to the national
average of 7:10,000 population. The education standards are generally low
and this contributes to the continuing migration to the towns of people ill
prepared for urban life, and also holds back development in the rural areas.



- 9 -
32.       The project areas lack an effective health service and there is
widespread occurrence of avoidable or readily controllable diseases associated
with impure water and unhygienic conditions. As the areas are generally at
high altitudes, tropical diseases are not important. 35% of the rural com-
munities are inaccessible by road and 57% of the rural population living in
groups of 50 to 2,500 persons has no piped water and 78% has no sewerage
system.
33.       Agencies of Caja Agraria are located throughout the project area
and agricultural supplies are generally available at the market towns. At
present, the majority of small farmers dispose of their produce through
intermediary traders who also provide extra-bank credit. There is wide-
spread interest among farmers in obtaining more direct outlets to the final
consumers but considerable skepticism concerning the formation of cooperative
societies because of generally unsuccessful past experience.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
A. Prolect Concept
34.       The objective of the project would be to raise living standards in
selected rural areas by increasing the productivity, output and incomes of
farm families and by improving social services and facilities available to
rural communities. Through the project, it would be intended to reduce
disparities between rural and urban amenities while facilitating the transi-
tion of some of the rural population to industrial and commercial activities.
This would require not only raising formal educational standards of the rural
population but also increasing its familiarity with marketing, credit, techni-
cal and management skills which are required both for more intensive farm
management and to obtain regular urban employment, above the level of un-
skilled labor. The main emphasis of the project would be on providing super-
vised credit to promote farm investments and thereby to raise farm production.
Rural roads would be provided to areas with the highest agricultural potential
while investments in education, health, water and electricity would be designed
to spread these services more uniformly, while giving priority to communities
showing greatest interest in farm development.
35.       The project would be a component of the Integrated Rural Development
Program, which forms part of the National Food and Nutrition Plan. The Program
would assist families with less than 20 ha to increase their farm productivity
by providing supervised credit for development, operational expenses and the
improvement of marketing. With few exceptions, this category is composed of
families among the poorest 50% of the population. Priority would be given to
increasing the production of crop and livestock products of high nutritive
value and to promoting better family health, nutrition and living conditions.
36.       The other part of the National Food and Nutrition Plan would be the
Nutrition Program for which Bank financing is being considered. This would
consist of the provision of subsidized food of high nutritive value to pregnant



- 10 -
and lactating women, and children under five years, and supporting investments
in food processing and quality control, health and water supply services and
education in nutrition. The proposed Second Agricultural Credit Project could
contribute to financing the production and processing of the foods of high
nutritive value required for the Nutrition Program.
Detailed Features
a.   Supervised Credit
37.       Over a period of five years Caja Agraria would provide sub-loans to
some 40,000 borrowers -- 23% of the target group -- on the basis of integrated
farm plans incorporating crops (other than coffee), livestock, minor farm
structures and tree planting; from the third year of participation in the
project, credit would also be made available to farmers for minor home improve-
ments related to hygiene. Caja Agraria would also provide incremental working
capital and medium- and long-term sub-loans to associations of producers for
marketing. Sub-loans would be financed through a credit fund to be established
within Caja Agraria. In total, over the whole of the project period, Caja
Agraria would be required to provide the equivalent of US$23 million from its
own funds for eligible sub-projects (Section 2.11 of draft Project Agreement).
Because of its central role in the project, it would be important that the
financial stability of Caja Agraria be assured. With this in mind, the Govern-
ment has added US$36 million to the resources of Caja Agraria during 1976 and
has relieved the institution of all debt servicing responsibility for the whole
Integrated Rural Development Program (equivalent to a capital contribution of
approximately US$70 million over five years). In addition, assurances were
obtained at negotiations that Caja Agraria would maintain at all times a
liquidity ratio equal to or greater than unity (Section 4.03 Draft Project
Agreement).
b.   Production Support
38.       The project would finance part of the cost of a Program Management
Unit in the National Department of Planning and an administration unit in Caja
Agraria, and new facilities and increased service capabilities for the follow-
ing entities:
(a)  Instituto Colombiano               (crop and livestock adaptation
Agropecuario:                  - (and demonstration; preparation
(and supervision of farm plans
(b)  Instituto de los Recursos          (tree nurseries; advice on tree
Naturales Renovables y           (planting and soil conservation
del Medio Ambiente:            - (and minor soil conservation
(works, including protection of
(water sources
(c)  Central de Cooperativas de la    - (Market Intelligence Unit;
Reforma Agraria Ltda.:           (marketing advisory service



- 11 -
(d) Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje: (staff training; publicity for
- (the project; training farmers
(and staff of marketing groups
c.   Social Services
39.       The project would promote more effective use of existing rural
primary school facilities by providing classroom furniture -- 2,300 sets --
and 3,800 kits consisting of 'teaching aids and manuals. This component
would be the responsibility of the Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones
Escolares.
40.       Rural Health Service teams would be formed over five years to pro-
vide about 80% coverage of the rural population in the project areas. This
would require the construction and equipping of 75 new health posts and im-
provements to 26 existing facilities, 8 health centers and 17 local hospitals.
Health staff would be trained and provided with medical aid kits and nutrition
education kits. The construction of latrines in public places would also be
financed under this component of the project, which would be executed by
Ministerio de Salud Publica.
41.       The Instituto Nacional de Salud would supervise the construction,
expansion or improvement and operation of 248 new piped water systems with
individual house connections; 36 existing schemes would be extended and
five old schemes provided with chlorination facilities. A total of 147,000
people would benefit from these works.
d.   Infrastructure
42.       The Fondo Nacional de Caminos Vecinales would supervise the construc-
tion of 313-km of new rural roads and the improvement of 647 km of existing
rural roads throughout the project areas.
43.       In Area 1, the Instituto Colombiano de Energia Electrica would
supervise 22 sub-projects to provide electric power to 14,335 families --
about 90,000 persons. No further 'electrification under the project is planned
for Areas 2 and 3 since service levels there are already well above the
national average for rural areas.
B.   Project Costs and Financial Arrangements
Project Costs and Financing
44.       Total project costs for a five-year period of investment are esti-
mated to be US$131 million, including incremental seasonal credit and incre-
mental working capital for produce marketing. It is estimated that the
foreign exchange cost would be US$27.6 million, or 21% of the total.
45.       A Bank loan of US$52 million is proposed to finance all foreign
exchange costs and US$24.4 million of the local costs, and thus cover 40% of
the total cost of the project. Project beneficiaries would be required to



- 12 -
contribute US$11 million (19%) of farm and marketing development cost and
US$2.1 million (4%) of the cost of other project components, while the remain-
ing project cost of US$65.9 million (50%) would be shared by the National
Apprenticeship Service -- US$3.1 million (2%), Caja Agraria -- US$23 million
(18%) and the Government -- US$39.8 million (30%). Further details are given
in Annex III.
46.       Local currency financing is recommended because of the importance
the project would have within the overall Government attempt to promote the
economic development of the poorest of the rural population within the project
areas and because of the relatively low foreign exchange content which is
characteristic of rural development projects. The cost sharing proportion
which is proposed is necessary to give the Bank a meaningful role in the
project (see para. 12).
47.       Of the total Bank loan of US$52 million, US$26.8 million (52%) would
be used to assist in financing sub-loans to farmers and marketing groups,
through a fund to be established in Caja Agraria. The relending interest rate,
terms and grace periods are summarized in Annex III. To ensure that relending
rates reflect current economic conditions, the Bank obtained assurances at
negotiation that it would annually review with the Government and Caja Agraria
the terms and conditions of subloans to be made under the project. (Section
3.07 of Loan Agreement and Schedule I to the Project Agreement).
Procurement
48.       International competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank Guidelines
on Procurement, would be required for orders of an estimated value of more than
US$100,000 for the purchase of vehicles, water pumps and piping. Caja Agraria
would consolidate the requirements of the participating entities and issue the
calls for tenders. Domestic manufacturers would be granted a preferential
margin in bid evaluation equal to the prevailing tariff, or 15% of the c.i.f.
cost of imports, whichever is the lower. All other purchases of goods and
services would be made in accordance with local competitive procedures accept-
able to the Bank, with the exception of individual purchases by farmers where
competitive bidding would be impractical. Procurement in such cases would be
through regular commercial channels. Further details are given in Annex III.
Disbursement
49.       The loan would be disbursed over a period of six years.    (See
Annex III). Disbursement would be made according to the following percentages
of expenditures certified by Caja Agraria:
(a)  Sub-loans for farm and marketing     49% of amount disbursed
operations and development
(b)  Vehicles and medical equipment       100% of foreign expenditures
or 40% of ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured goods



- 13 -
(c)  Cables and electrical equipment;     100% of foreign expenditures
water pipes and pumps                or 80% of ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured goods
(d)  All other expenditures by Caja       36%
Agraria and project entities
Retroactive financing not exceeding US$500,000 is proposed for expenditures
incurred from July 1, 1976 for initial staff training and orientation for
project work, to initiate farming adaptation and demonstration units, the
Natural Resources Advisory Service, the Marketing Advisory Service and
engineering studies.
C. Market and Production Aspects
50.       The incremental farm production which may be generated through the
implementation of the proposed project would be locally significant and could
make a small but useful contribution to the national food requirements by 1985.
It is projected that by then the incremental production from farms receiving
sub-loans under the project could amount to the following proportions of
the national demand: cereals and other starch crops, 5%; non-centrifuged
sugar, 4%; pulses, 6%; vegetables, 1%; and meat and milk, 2%.
51.       The project would set out to blend improved methods into existing
farming systems and practices. The farmers in the project areas are already
well established and the existing management systems have been evolved over
many centuries in the light of experience and in order to minimize risks to
the farmers. More intensive farming practices could increase the economic
risks to producers; the project would seek to reduce this problem through
placing great emphasis on improving marketing channels organized by associa-
tions of producers, which may take various forms including cooperative
societies.
D.   Implementation
52.       The overall policy for the National Integrated Rural Development
Program is determined and supervised by the National Council for Economic and
Social Policy, a ministerial level body chaired by the President of the
Republic.
53.       Management and coordination would be carried out by a Program Manage-
ment Unit, headed by a Director General in the National Department of Planning
responsible for the whole Integrated Rural Development Program, of which the
proposed Bank project would form about 45%. The administration of the program
would be carried out by the Department of Rural Development of Caja Agraria.



- 14 -
54.       Caja Agraria would enter into subsidiary project agreements with
each entity responsible for implementing a component of the project. These
agreements would define the responsibilities of the respective executing
agencies to execute their components of the project and would recognize the
responsiblity of Caja Agraria to monitor the physical and financial progress
of each component and report to the National Department of Planning
(Section 2.02 of draft Project Agreement). Caja Agraria would also consoli-
date the issuing and awarding of international tenders required for the
project and transmit reimbursement applications from the participating enti-
ties through the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit to the Bank, which
would disburse to the account of the Ministry in the Bank of the Republic.
55.       A permanent Evaluation Group for the whole Integrated Rural Develop-
ment Progam would be formed in the National Department of Planning but would
be financed outside the project (Section 3.03(a) of draft Loan Agreement).
56.       There would be four levels of committees of participating entities
for the project: community, municipal, departmental and national. The target
population would be included in the community and municipal committees and
would constitute 50% of the membership and provide the chairman for both
committees.
E.   Financial Analysis
57.       The financial rates of return of representative farms range between
33% and 91% and income levels would be substantially improved by the project.
However, at full development it is projected that for about half of the repre-
sentative farms, incomes would still be below the poverty level in Colombia
(US$148 per capita, 1975). This assessment indicates the continuing need for
the promotion of employment opportunities in rural areas. The Small-Scale
Industry Project (Loan No. 1070-CO) and the proposed Second Agricultural
Credit Project were appraised with this problem in mind and they are expected
to assist in the creation of employment opportunities in the project area.
58.       Beneficiaries' contribution to total project costs would amount to
10% of total costs. Seasonal credit for farm operations would require a
contribution of 5% from the sub-borrower in the first year, increasing to 15%
for the fourth year. Farm investment and market operations and development
would require at least 15% contribution by beneficiaries. Communities are
required to contribute 15% of the cost of potable water sub-projects and 10%
of total investment costs for rural health posts and centers and electrifica-
tion subprojects. At negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that tariffs for electricity and potable water supplied under the project
would be maintained at levels sufficient to recover operating and maintenance
costs, including depreciation. (Section 4.03 of draft Loan Agreement).
59.       Through the implementation of the proposed project, the Government
would be committed annually to finance additional current costs, rising to
US$10 million by year 5. About US$8 million per year would continue to be



- 15 -
necessary after the end of the five-year investment period proposed for the
project. The largest individual cost would be for the operation and mainte-
nance of the health services to be established within the project areas. In
addition, the Government would bear the entire responsibility for servicing
the proposed Bank loan.
F.   Economic Analysis
60.       At full development (Year 5), 23% of the small farmers in project
areas are expected to have become incorporated into the supervised credit
component of the project. At this stage it is anticipated that the incre-
mental value (using 1975 international prices) of crops would be US$22.6
million and that of livestock, US$12.3 million. Increased production of
various kinds of meat and non-centrifuged sugar should release additional
amounts of beef and sugar for export and help the agricultural sector to
continue to play a significant role in the growth of Colombia's foreign
trade. At the same time, increased production of wheat and pulses would
save foreign exchange by reducing the amount imported. The net annual
foreign exchange savings of the project at full development would be US$15.4
million. The other commodities produced by the project are for domestic
consumption only and would assist in meeting the increased demand resulting
from higher per capita incomes and would contribute to improved nutritional
standards.
61.       The number of people benefitting directly and indirectly from the
project would amount to approximately 1.5 million. Many of these would, for
the first time, have access to advisory services, credit facilities, markets,
training and education opportunities, health care and water and electricity
delivery systems.
62.       Given the emphasis of the project on providing credit and other
services to farmers-with less than 20 ha of land, it is anticipated that the
project would improve the living standards of the rural poor and improve
income distribution in the project areas. It is projected that at full
development, 32% of the additional income generated under the project would
accrue to families currently receiving annual incomes of less than the
equivalent of US$29 per capita and 74% would be received by families now
earning annually less than the equivalent of US$98 per capita.
63.       The project's contribution to employment would stem mainly from
the regular work generated at the farm level at full development and also
from the opportunities generated during the investment period. At the farm
level, the project would require, annually, an additional 1.3 million man-
days of labor at full development, equivalent to 6,500 full-time jobs. Some
0.25 million man-days, or 20% of this labor, would be provided by members of
farm families while the rest would be provided by hired labor. In addition,
0.68 million man-days (3,400 full-time jobs) would be generated by the other
components of the project during the investment period.



- 16 -
64.       The economic rate of return is estimated at 22% for the productive
components of the project (credit, technical assistance, rural road develop-
ment and the project management unit), which account for 82% of total project
costs.
65.       The remaining components of the project -- education, health,
potable water and electrification, which together account for 18% of total
project costs -- were excluded from the economic analysis as no meaningful
rate of return could be estimated. These components, though not contributing
directly to the productive goals of the project, will help improve the living
conditions of the low income stratum rural population. The project's activi-
ties in these fields are designed to bring the level of these services in the
rural areas closer to that prevailing in urban communities.
G.   Conclusions
66.       The proposed project presents a coherent attack on the problem of
rural poverty and deprivation in Colombia. The main emphasis would be on
raising the level of farm productivity by combining the efforts of Government
entities to this end, while providing adequate funds for credit. Most of the
components of the project would intensify ongoing activities in a coordinated
manner, but the natural resources and health service components would consti-
tute innovative approaches in these fields. The project would provide exper-
ience in concerted rural development activities within fairly limited but
representative areas, which would be suitable for more widespread application.
67.       The functioning of the market system and fluctuations in prices for
farm products present the greatest uncertainties facing the project. The
extent to which members of the target population will take part in the project
will be strongly influenced by their assessment of the potential benefits and
apparent risks of participation. These risks have been recognized during the
preparation of the project, which consequently includes special emphasis on
improving the competitive position of the target population. The market
advisory service and market intelligence service would be particularly impor-
tant since it is the Government's policy to limit its direct intervention in
marketing and to encourage the interaction of demand and supply to determine
prices. Finally, coordination and collaboration between executing agencies is
expected to develop during the course of the project. To the extent that such
integration among agencies fails to occur, project effectiveness would be dimi-
nished, although the individual components of the project would still be of
value to the communities.
PART V:   LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
68.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Colombia and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Caja Agraria,
the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of
the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 17 -
69.       Special conditions of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex IV.
Special conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be that:
(a) the subsidiary agreements between the Government and
Caja Agraria, and Caja Agraria and ICA, INDERENA,
CECORA and SENA, have been duly executed (Section 6.01(b)
and (c) of the draft Loan Agreement); and
(b) a Program Evaluation Group has been formed. (Section 6.01(d)
of the draft Loan Agreement).
70.       In addition, a condition for disbursement for each loan category
separately would be that the relevant subsidiary agreement between Caja
Agraria and the participating entity (other than ICA, INDERENA, CECORA, and
SENA) has been duly executed (paragraph 3 (b) of Schedule 1 to the draft Loan
Agreement).
71.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI:   RECOMMENDATION
72.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION /1
Summarized below is the current status of all loans signed but not
disbursed fully:
1.   Ln No. 502 Irrigation (Atlantico I); US$9 million, June 1967.
Effective date:  November 2, 1967
Closing Date:     original - December 31, 1972
current - December 31, 1975
Physical works have been completed. Delays in project execution
were occasioned by poor selection of areas suitable for irrigation, technical
problems in the construction of irrigation and drainage works, and non-
compliance by contractor with established schedules. Agricultural develop-
ment has also been slow, due to poor project management and lack of adequate
supporting services to the farmer. However, the present INCORA agricultural
team has the potential to develop the project satisfactorily under its less
than ideal circumstances. Agricultural development and reclamation of saline
areas will require two to three years. Disbursement of Loan 502-CO has been
completed.
2.   Ln No. 536 Water Supply (Bogota I); US$14 million, June 1968.
Effective date: August 7, 1968
Closing Date:     original - June 30, 1972
current - December 31, 1975
This loan is almost fully disbursed.
3.   Ln No. 575 Electric Power (Interconnection); US$18 million, December 1968.
Effective date: February 25, 1969
Closing Date:    original - February 29, 1972
current - December 31, 1976
The original project was completed and commercially operational
in 1971. The Bank agreed that an undisbursed balance could be used to finance
a 220 kv transmission line, Guatape - Barrancabermeja. The cost of the line
is estimated at US$7.2 million of which about US$4.1 million represents the
foreign component. Work is substantially completed on the second line.
/1   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understand-
ing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 8
4.   Ln No. 680 Highways VI; US$32 million, June 1970.
Effective date: March 29, 1971
Closing date:     original - November 30, 1974
current - November 30, 1976
The largest component of the project, the paving program, has experi-
enced considerable cost increases and is still experiencing delays. The
status of the other components of the project is more satisfactory. The
Ministry of Public Works has taken many steps (supported by the Bank) which
have reduced, although not avoided, delays and contractor bankruptcies under
the paving program.
5.   Ln No. 681 Chivor Hydroelectric Power; US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Effective date: September 1, 1970
Closing date:     June 30, 1977
The project has experienced considerable delay and project costs
are expected to be 35% higher than originally estimated. Work is proceeding
and the first generating units are expected to be put into service in early
1977.
6.   Ln No. 682 Cali Water Supply and Sewerage; US$18.5 million, June 1970.
Effective date: September 2, 1970
Closing date:     original - June 30, 1974
current - June 30, 1977
As of October 31, 1976, about 95% of the loan amount was disbursed.
Disbursements were delayed due to a late project start, but the entire project
is now under execution, and it is expected that construction activities will
be finished by mid-1977.
7.   Ln No. 738 Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage; US$2 million, May 1971.
Effective date: December 29, 1971
Closing Date:     original - March 1, 1975
current - March 1, 1977
As of October 31, 1976, about 80% of the loan amount was disbursed.
Disbursements were delayed due to initial management and fiscal problems. A
financial crisis in early 1973 was resolved through higher tariffs and tight
budget control.



ANNEX II

8.   Ln No. 739 Land Settlement Caqueta I; US$8.1 million, May 1971.
Effective date: October 19, 1971
Closing Date:    original - December 31, 1975
current - June 30, 1976
Because of considerable price increases and unexpectedly difficult
physical problems, project objectives were reduced to about 70% of appraisal
targets in August 1973 halfway through the project period. Since then, the
livestock credit program has picked up speed so that the revised goal for this
component should be achieved ahead of time. On the other hand, the road
construction program has fallen far behind schedule although it is now proceed-
ing at an accelerated pace. Despite these problems, the project is making a
substantial contribution to the successful colonization of the Caqueta area.
Project works are completed and loan proceeds are fully disbursed. A second
loan for the project (No. 1118-CO) was signed in June 1975.
9.   Ln No. 740 Telecommunictions II; US$15 million, May 1971.
Effective date: August 16, 1971
Closing Date:     December 31, 1976
Contracts for all Bank-financed goods have been signed and technical
and financial consultants have been retained. Due to initial delays in the
procurement of project equipment, a slippage of up to 18 months in the comple-
tion date of some of the works in the project is now anticipated.
10. Ln No. 741 Water Supply (Bogota II); US$88 million, May 1971.
Effective date: August 16, 1971
Closing Date:     June 30, 1978
Disbursements up to October 31, 1976 amounted to 56% of this loan.
Slow progress in the construction of the vital Palacio - Rio Blanco Tunnel is
the main reason for the project's delay; the previous foreign contractor has
been replaced by another firm which has already made an impressive start. The
progress of the project, however, is endangered by serious financial problems
which are currently the subject of consultations with the Government and the
Borrower concerning necessary corrective measures, including further tariff
increases.
11. Ln No. 842 Development Program and Export Expansion Project; US$60 million,
June 1972.
Effective date: August 24, 1972
Closing Date:     original - December 31, 1974
current - June 30, 1976
The second tranche of US$30 million was canceled. Of the first
tranche, the US$20 million program component was promptly disbursed; the
US$10 million DFC component has now been fully disbursed except for a small
balance which has been canceled.

12. Ln No. 849 Irrigation (Atlantico II); US$5 million, June 1972.
Effective date: November 14, 1972
Closing Date:    March 31, 1978
Construction of drainage facilities and hence disbursements are
lagging far behind schedule primarily due to the poor performance of the
concractor having the major responsibility for the drain construction financed
under this loan. Steps are being taken to replace the contractor with another.
INCORA had been delaying initiation of the agricultural development phase of
the project, which includes land clearing, leveling, and initial preparation,
until the physical works were completed. However, INCORA has now agreed to
expedite this part of the project. Meanwhile, the principal use has been for
livestock. Originally conceived for dry-farming of crops and dairy farming,
INCORA now believes the soils in the area are better than originally classi-
fied and suitable for irrigation in the future.
13. Ln No. 860 Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$9.1
million, October 1972.
Effective date: March 7, 1973
Closing Date:    original - September 30, 1976
current - September 30, 1978
As of October 31, 1976, about 55% of the loan amount was disbursed.
Disbursements were delayed due to initial serious management problems, but
progress of works has since accelerated.
14. Ln No. 874 Guatape II Hydroelectric Power Project; US$56 million,
January 1973.
Effective date: March 13, 1973
Closing Date:    December 31, 1978
The progress of the work is generally satisfactory except for
delays in the resettlement of El Penol and Guatape villages, which means
that filling the Santa Rita reservoir cannot be started before mid-1977,
two years behind schedule. This would be likely to lead to an energy deficit
in the interconnected system of at least 10% from 1978 to 1981. The revised
project cost estimate is substantially above appraisal estimates, mainly due
to higher costs of the works at El Penol and Guatape.    The Borrower experienced
serious financial problems but as a result of a series of tariff increases, the
company is projected to achieve the covenanted rate of return in 1977. Finan-
cial gaps, however, remain to be met if the investment program is to be com-
pleted on schedule.
15.  Ln No. 903 Development Finance Companies V; US$60 million, May 1973.
Effective date: November 9, 1973
Closing Date:    June 30, 1977
Commitments have proceeded well, and the loan is expected to be
fully committed soon. Disbursements are still behind schedule, but in view
of the present repaid rate of commitment, they should be completed by the
Closing Date.

16. Ln No. 920 Education IIL; US$21.2 million, July 1973.
Effective date: January 10, 1974
Closing Date:     June 30, 1977
Project implementation is about eighteen months behind schedule
and all work has now been suspended pending completion of discussion concern-
ing restructuring the project.
17. Ln No. 926 Sixth Railway Project; US$25 million, August 1973.
Effective date: December 6, 1973
Closing Date:     original - June 30, 1976
current - December 31, 1977
The Railways received from the Government Col$87.5 million to meet
the operating deficit for 1975. The financial condition of the Railways, how-
ever, continued to deteriorate in the first seven months of 1976, due primarily
to increases in staff costs accompanied by a drop in traffic. The working and
operating ratios deteriorated to 130.9 and 139.1 for the first seven months of
1976, but are expected to improve to 114.4 and 122.0 if the increase in traf-
fic in the months of June and July 1976 continues for the rest of the year.
The track rehabilitation work has progressed, as has procurement, but the
position in regard to derailments and availability of locomotives and rolling
stock continues to be poor.
18. Ln No. 971 Preinvestment Studies Project; US$8 million, March 1974.
Effective date: June 27, 1974
Closing Date:    December 31, 1978
The Bank has approved 15 sub-projects. The Bank loan is expected
to be fully committed by early 1977.
19. Ln No. 1071 Small-Scale Industry; US$5.5 million, January 1975.
Effective date: May 20, 1975
Closing Date:    December 31, 1977
After a slow start due to a change of management in Corporacion
Financiera Popular, the beneficiary institution, commitments moved well and
are now on schedule. The second tranche was released by the Bank in view of
the satisfactory performance of CFP.
20. Ln No. 1072 Second Multi-City Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$27
million, January 1975.
Effective date: April 14, 1975
Closing Date:     June 30, 1980
This loan became effective on April 14, 1975 but there have been
substantial delays in making the eight subloans effective. The last subloan
(Barranquilla) was made effective on September 9, 1976.



ANNEX II

21. Ln No. 1073 Telecommunications III; US$15 million, January 1975.
Effective date: April 14, 1975
Closing Date:    December 31, 1978
This loan became effective on April 14, 1975 and US$4.5 million has
been disbursed. Bid awards for all Bank-financed goods have been approved by
the Bank.
22. Ln No. 1118 Caqueta Rural Settlement Project; US$19.5 million, June 1975.
Effective date:  April 1, 1976
Closing Date:    October 31, 1979
This loan became effective on April 1, 1976 after a six-month delay.
Since then, implementation has proceeded rapidly and some of the lost time
regained.  Road and bridge construction is underway (85 km have been completed)
and bidding documents for school construction have been prepared.
23. Ln No. 1163 Cordoba 2 Agricultural Development Project; US$21 million,
September 1975.
Effective date: March 30, 1976
Closing Date:    December 31, 1980
This loan became effective on March 30, 1976. Implementation is
proceeding satisfactorily.
24. Ln No. 1223 Sixth Development Finance Companies Project; US$80.0 million,
March 1976.
Effective date: September 1, 1976
Closing Date:     June 30, 1980
This loan was signed on March 31, 1976, and has only recently become
effective.

Procurement:                    International competitive bidding, in accord-

would be required for orders estimated to
cost more than US$100,000: for vehicles,
estimated to total US$2.1 million; and water

pumps and piping, estimated to total US$1.0
million. Caja Agraria would consolidate the
requirements of the participating agencies for
these categories and issue international calls
for tenders. Domestic manufacturers would be
granted a preferential margin in bid evaluation
equal to the prevailing tariff, or 15% of the
c.i.f. cost of imports, whichever is lower.
Much of the project would be concerned with
training and extension services which would
involve only minor construction and the purchase
of small amounts of equipment. Farmers would
purchase their requirements of fertilizer,
seeds, small farm equipment and other inputs
of their choice through existing commercial
channels of which the agricultural merchandise
department of Caja Agraria would be the most
important distribution agency. A wide range of
international manufacturers is represented in
Colombia and, for the items required for the
project, competition is satisfactory and
servicing and spare parts are generally avail-
able. Construction of health posts and centers,
potable water systems, rural roads and electri-
fication would be small subprojects widely dis-
persed geographically, and would therefore be
carried out by force account or local competi-
tive bidding procedures which are acceptable to
the Bank. In addition, self-help arrangements
may be included in subprojects for health and
potable water. Retroactive financing not ex-
ceeding US$500,000 is proposed for expenditures
incurred from July 1, 1976 for initial staff
training and orientation for project work, to
initiate farming Adaptation and Demonstration
Units, the Natural Resources Advisory Service,
the Marketing Advisory Service and engineering
studies.
Technical Assistance:           No local or foreign consultants are proposed to
be contracted under the project, but for the
overall National Integrated Rural Development
Program, UNDP will provide technical assistance
in marketing and for a market intelligence
system.
Rate of Return:                 The economic rate of return for the productive
components of the project is estimated at about
22%.
Staff Project Report:           No. 1212-CO, dated November 12, 1976.
